Page 1 of 3 Ref: 22OIA1407 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 9 December 202 1 Dear Than k you for your request made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA), received on 11 November 2021. You requested the following: Please provide data on government revenue by age group and government expenditure by age (if possible from 2000 to present). On 20 November 2021, you clarified your request to specify the age bands and timeframe for the data requested: To clarify, by government expenditure by age I mean how much money the government spends on services for each age group. The age groups do not have to be numerous, it is okay if it broken down by children, adults, and retirees. Person income tax data broken down by age for the last ten years would be excellent. The age bands for this data can be 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, etc., etc. If other age bands are easier to compile that is also fine. Government expenditure and revenue Government expenditure covers a large spectrum of activity and is generally not collated in a way that allows the age of the beneficiaries of that expenditure to be determined. There may be a few areas where some information is available, such as in the welfare benefit link provided below from the Ministry of Social Development, or in published research addressing planning for future government expenditure, as the population ages. This type of analysis cannot be generalised to the entire expenditure of the public sector and is not necessarily available as a time series. https://www.msd.govt.nz/about-msd-and-our-work/publications- resources/statistics/benefit/latest-quarterly-results/all-main-benefits.html Similarly, a lot of tax revenue is collected from entities, like companies or trusts, which do not fit within a “by age” framework. Some taxes may be paid by people (as opposed to entities) but not be directly attributable to who paid them. For example, GST is collected by a retailer at the time an item is purchased, but the age of the purchaser is not known to Inland Revenue. You could potentially make inferences of your own on how to allocate such tax types across the age groups you are interested in. For example, you could us e “consumption by age” information from Statistics New Zealand and apply this to GST receipts to make your own inferences on which age groups are paying the greater share of GST. If you wish to do such analysis, you can find monthly time series information of tax collections, reported by tax type, on the Treasury’s website: https://www.treasury.govt.nz/publications/tax-outturn-data/tax-outturn-data- september-2021. www.ird.govt.nz Page 2 of 3 Ref: 22OIA1407 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] The government expenditure and revenue (from most tax types) aspect of your request is refused under section 18(g) of the OIA as the information is not held by Inland Revenue. Personal income tax by age Inland Revenue does hold time series information on personal income tax by age, which we have summarised across the time period from your request clarification. The below table shows the tax on total income by age band across ten tax years ended 31 March 2011 to 31 March 2020 inclusive. The income tax amounts are rounded to the nearest million dollars. The 31 March 2021 tax year information is unavailable as it is still being compiled. Personal income tax described in the table does not fit neatly within the “by tax type” information provided in the above Treasury link. This is because it measures a March income year, irrespective of when the tax is paid, and covers tax which is paid via a range of tax types including PAYE collected by employers, income tax paid directly to Inland Revenue by individuals (“other persons”), and some, but not all, of the withholding taxes such as resident’s withholding tax on interest (collected by the financial institution paying the interest) or resident’s withholding tax on dividends (collected by the company paying the dividend).

The tax rules do change over time, which will directly affect this series. Over the period of interest the tax scale changed in October 2010, some tax credits have changed, and the tax base has also changed, particularly in relation to international tax and pass through of losses from businesses. Further, changed administration has affected the types of income which can be attributed through to individuals, for example income earned through KiwiSaver investments has not always been, but is now, linked through to individual investors using information supplied by the investment entity. Another example is much higher volumes of people with annual tax assessments following an administrative change which applied from the 2018-19 tax year. An outcome is that income, and hence tax, attributable to younger taxpayers is now more likely to be included in this data. Finally, Inlan d Revenue’s migration to a new software system has also affected how we construct the data distributions, with 2017-18 onwards prepared using a changed methodology.

People and Culture at Inland Revenue Inland Revenue is committed to maintaining a positive working environment and culture, where diversity is appreciated, and all people are respected and valued. Inland Revenue regards discrimination, bullying or harassment of any kind as unacceptable. This applies whether this behaviour comes from, or is directed at, an employee, contractor, consultant, customer or a visitor to Inland Revenue. Ref: 22OIA1333 We put prevention at the centre of our approach and expect all our people to model appropriate standards of conduct and report any breaches. Inland Revenue has a long-term commitment to enhancing diversity and inclusion in our workplace. Our aspiration is to have an inclusive culture where people from all walks of life can achieve their full potential. Inland Revenue has a range of diversity and inclusion initiatives, and is committed to supporting its people networks. Networks established within Inland Revenue include groups for Māori , Pasifika, Multi-cultural, Disability, Rainbow and Women. Our people networks play an important role in supporting and developing members and helping create a more inclusive organisation. Inland Revenue was awarded the Rainbow Tick in April 2021. Complaints at Inland Revenue Inland Revenue has procedures in place for making and managing complaints to ensure any complaint or query is treated confidentially, taken seriously and acted on promptly. Inland Revenue investigates all complaints related to bullying/harassment/sexual harassment. There is a preference for appropriately tailored responses to the circumstance and, where possible, how people want their complaint to be treated. Inland Revenue may explore informal options before formal actions are taken if this is appropriate. If appropriate, Inland Revenue may also proceed straight to formal investigation action. A formal investigation is one where there is the potential for an employee to receive a disciplinary outcome up to and including dismissal. Inland Revenue will ensure the principles of natural justice are applied and both parties are treated fairly, and respected and supported through the process. When complaints are recorded, they are noted as bullying & harassment within a single category, with a subcategory where the allegation is of a sexual nature. Question 1 & 5 The table below shows all complaints made by Inland Revenue employees to the HR department for the period 2016 to 2021. As mentioned above, these may be investigated formally or informally, tailored to the circumstances. The table below shows the total number of complaints formally and informally investigated relating to allegations of bullying and/or harassment, including sexual harassment. Please note, after investigation not all complaints were substantiated.

Inland Revenue does not break down information on Personal Grievances into specific topics of types of claims made. We have therefore provided the table below which sets out the total number of Personal Grievances settled and the total cost to Inland Revenue. These will include both unjustified disadvantage and unjustified dismissal claims and will also include Personal Grievances that refer to bullying and/or harassment and/or HR complaints, if any, for each given year.

Most grievances were settled at the Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment mediation service. -The increase in the 2018/19 and 2019/20 cost compared to other years is due to a large number of the personal grievances relating to organisational change processes (restructures). For further information on Inland Revenue’s recent Ref: 22OIA1333 organisational change processes, please refer to “Vote Revenue Standard Estimates Questionnaire 2021/22” available on www.parliament.nz (question 11). -Personal grievances are not always settled in the same year they are raised. Question 9 Inland Revenue is in the final stage of a large, complex transformation programme. To minimise the impact of transformation for Inland Revenue’s people, gradual reductions in Inland Revenue’s workforce have been achieved as the nature of the work has changed. Since mid-2016, workforce principles in place meant the majority of vacancies have been filled with fixed-term employees. As much as possible, reductions have been managed through attrition, fixed term arrangements coming to an end, and flexible workforce arrangements. The table below shows Inland Revenue employee resignations for the period 2016 to 2021. Year Fixed Term Permanent Total 2016 21 488 509 2017 76 487 563 2018 181 402 583 2019 220 303 523 2020 166 207 373 2021\* 109 232 341 \*as at 30 September 2021 Question 10 In April 2020, as part of Inland Revenue’s Active Listening programme, a pulse survey was launched which focused on employee wellbeing and work experience. During 2020/21, eight waves of the survey were run, with participation rates between 60 to 70%. Pulse surveys are run monthly or bi-monthly and give our people an opportunity to reflect on their experience and talk about the things that are of most value to them at work. While selected content of the pulses vary from pulse to pulse, well-being is a standing item in each of them. Staff who participate in the pulse survey can opt to share their comments with their leader, which support and enrich one-on-one conversations. Uptake of this has been high with 80 to 85% of participants opting to share their responses. Results are available within a week after the surveys close. A copy of Inland Revenue’s most recent people and well-being survey (September 2021) is attached as an Appendix.

A further Trinity argument estopped
===================================

2011 case note – further 'Trinity scheme' argument estopped - tax avoidance, res judicata, abuse of process, issue estoppel.

Case

XX v CIR

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 1994

### Summary

It was held the assessments made were not prohibited due to the effect of section 114 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA"). Furthermore, the assessments were valid due to the presumption of validity and even if there was a technical error, the Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") had jurisdiction to consider the challenge to the assessments.

The Supreme Court judgment is binding on the disputant for the purposes of issue estoppel and could not be re-litigated. Despite the technical black-letter argument, the Trinity Scheme had been found to be tax avoidance. The challenge proceedings were therefore struck out.

### Impact of decision

This judgment provides further confirmation that the Supreme Court's judgment in the Trinity test case litigation is the final word on the tax consequences of taxpayers' participation in the "Trinity Scheme".

The judgment also confirmed that the Commissioner's assessments are to be treated as valid until a Court rules otherwise and re-affirmed the TRA power under section 138P of the TAA to confirm, cancel or vary assessments as it sees fit.

### Facts

In his tax returns for the 1997 to 2006 income years, the disputant claimed attributed loss attributing qualifying company (LAQC) losses and losses brought forward based on his shareholding in an LAQC that was a member of a joint venture participating in the "Trinity Scheme".

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") assessed the disputant disallowing losses brought forward claimed in the 2004 income year and assessed the disputant with 100% shortfall penalties for adopting an abusive tax position in the 1997 to 2003 income years. The Commissioner is yet to reassess the disputant in the 2005 and 2006 income years. That said, the appropriate notices of proposed adjustment and notices of responses have been exchanged.

By way of a background, in the Trinity test case litigation, the High Court, Court of Appeal and Supreme Court upheld assessments made by the Commissioner disallowing deductions on the basis that the Trinity Scheme was a tax avoidance arrangement and imposing 100% shortfall penalties for an abusive tax position (see _Accent Management Ltd v CIR_ 22 NZTC 19,027 (HC), _Accent Management Ltd v CIR_ \[2007\] NZCA 231; (2007) 23 NZTC 21,366 (CA) and _Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v CIR_ \[2009\] 2 NZLR 289; (2009) 24 NZTC 23,188 (SC)).

In these proceedings the disputant sought, amongst other things, a declaration that the Commissioner's assessments were unlawful or should be replaced by assessments allowing the deductions sought under sub-part EH of the Income Tax Act 1994 ("the ITA94") (financial arrangements) or, if those rules did not apply, deductions on a straight-line basis. The disputant additionally contended, on the basis that the Commissioner's assessments were prohibited, that the TRA had no jurisdiction to hear his challenges.

#### _The disputant's submissions_

The disputant submitted that the Commissioner's assessments were prohibited because they were calculated under sub-part EG of the ITA94 (depreciation) and it should have been sub-part EH of the ITA94 that was applied.

The disputant said that, in circumstances where sub-part EH applies, its application is mandatory and that it is unlawful to fail to apply it. The disputant claimed that subpart EH is a special regime standing apart from, having superior operation to, and overriding the rest of the ITA94. The disputant additionally contended that, because sub-part EG had no effect in the circumstances, it could not support the Commissioner's assessments which must be quashed accordingly.

#### _The Commissioner's submissions_

For the Commissioner it was submitted that the disputant's claim about sub-part EH of the ITA94 was identical, in all material respects, to the taxpayers claim in _Ben Nevis_ so that the relief sought should not be available.

Further it was submitted that the disputant was prevented from running his sub-part EH argument under the doctrines of issue estoppel/res judicata and that it was an abuse of process for him to now seek to do this.

The Commissioner generally supported his relevant assessments and indicated that the only issues were whether there was a tax avoidance arrangement allowing the Commissioner to remove the losses claimed by the disputant and whether the disputant had adopted an abusive tax position and could be penalised accordingly.

### Decision

#### _Issue 1_

Judge Barber held that the Commissioner's assessments were not prohibited and that the TRA did have jurisdiction to hear the disputant's challenges.

At paragraph \[23\] Judge Barber commented that:

> It seems to me to be elementary that the assessments against the disputant now in issue cannot be regarded as void _ab initio_, as the disputant is suggesting, due to the effect of section 114 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ... Accordingly, since at least, _prima facie_, there are assessments in existence as pleaded, and because the jurisdiction of the Taxation Review Authority is to decide whether assessments are correct, it seems quite untenable to me for the disputant to submit that I do not now have jurisdiction to deal with his challenges.

In respect of the Commissioner's assessments specifically, His Honour commented:

1.  with reference to section 114 of the TAA, that "... even if there were some technical error in the assessments, that would not make them invalid" \[49\];
2.  that even if the Commissioner had somehow failed to comply with section EH8 of the ITA94 in carrying out the assessments, these assessments would not be invalidated but instead would merely be incorrect \[50\];
3.  that there is a presumption of validity and that an assessment will be treated as valid until a Court rules otherwise \[51\];
4.  that his analysis was supported by the High Court's decisions in _Redcliffe Forestry Venture Ltd v CIR_ (HC Auckland CIV 2009-404-005991, 26 February 2010 Venning J and _Accent Management Ltd v CIR_ (HC Auckland CIV 2008-404-8649, 12 March 2010 Keane J \[81\]; and
5.  that he must regard the assessments as correct \[92\].

In respect of the TRA's jurisdiction the Judge specifically commented that:

6.  the disputant's current argument was contrary to the analysis of the Supreme Court which had been rigorously fought previously in the High Court and Court of Appeal \[36\];
7.  the TRA's power under section 138P of the TAA is "... never simply to confirm, but to ‘confirm or cancel or vary' as it sees fit ..." \[76\];
8.  the High Court decisions of _Redcliffe_ and _Accent Management_ confirmed that the TRA had jurisdiction to consider these challenges (\[59\], \[76\] and \[91\]).

Judge Barber held that if the TRA were to dismiss the disputant's challenges for want of jurisdiction, the Commissioner's assessments would stand and accordingly there would be no benefit to the disputant in persisting with his objection to jurisdiction \[82\].

His Honour additionally rejected the disputant's arguments based on _BASF NZ Ltd v CIR_ \[1995\] 17 NZTC 12,136 (HC) (\[51\]-\[55\]) and commented that the presumption of validity precluded the disputant's assertion that the TRA had any extra-statutory power to "declare" assessments invalid before the challenge process had run its course \[81\].

#### _Issue 2_

Judge Barber also held that the disputant was prevented from running his sub-part EH of the ITA94 argument under the doctrines of issue estoppel/res judicata and for him to now seek to run this argument amounted to an abuse of process.

In respect of the issue estoppel/res judicata matter, Judge Barber specifically found that:

9.  with reference to the findings of the High Court, Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court in particular, the disputant "... cannot tenably suggest that he could ever have been entitled to the deduction which he now seeks ..." and that he "... must be estopped by the findings of those Courts from even making the arguments he has so elaborately set out before me" \[28\];
10.  there had been a final decision as to the appropriate legal analysis of the Trinity Scheme - the Supreme Court having determined that the appropriate analysis was under sub-part EG not sub-part EH of the ITA94 \[38\];
11.  "... \[the\] Supreme Court judgment finally determined all matters between the defendant and the plaintiffs in the Trinity litigation including their privies of which the disputant is one. There is a sufficient mutuality of interest to find that the disputant and the plaintiffs in _Accent Management/Ben Nevis_ are privies ... Accordingly, for the purposes of _issue estoppel_, that Supreme Court judgment is binding on him as if he were a named party to it" \[39\].

In respect of the abuse of process matter, His Honour held (at \[41\]) that:

> ... Broadly, I agree that if the disputant were permitted to proceed with his new argument based on sub-part EH of the Act, that would be manifestly unfair to the defendant Commissioner who, at significant expense, has succeeded in _Ben Nevis_ after extensive litigation on the issue. To relitigate matters would bring the administration of justice into disrepute among right thinking people. In the public interest, public money should be carefully spent.

At \[56\] Judge Barber indicated that while the disputant was entitled to argue that the assessments were incorrect, he could not relitigate issues which have already been dealt with by the Supreme Court in the Trinity litigation. If the disputant wished to challenge the correctness of the assessments he needed to set out why he considered his case was distinct from those dealt with by the Supreme Court (see also \[91\]).

The Judge commented that the disputant's arguments were moot in any event because, even if the Commissioner, the High Court, Court of Appeal and Supreme Court were wrong in their analysis as to the applicability of sub-parts EH or EG of the ITA94, both sub-parts were subject to the general anti-avoidance provision (section BG1 of the ITA94) and the Trinity Scheme had been found to be a tax avoidance arrangement (\[11\], \[22\], \[38\] and \[45\]).

#### _Other_

With reference to his previous findings, at \[92\] Judge Barber ordered that the disputant's challenge proceedings be struck out.

A gain "in kind" offsets the loss incurred
==========================================

2010 case note – deduction claim under FIF rules disallowed by CIR - comparative value method, 'in kind and not in money', paid, payment.

Case

Govind Prasad Saha V CIR

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 1994, FIF rules

### Summary

Dr Saha was a partner in a large accounting firm. When part of that business was sold, he was allocated a number of shares in the purchaser company. However, if Dr Saha left the employment within five years he would forfeit the right to some of those shares. Dr Saha subsequently left the partnership but was only required to forfeit 50% of those shares, by way of settlement of an employment dispute. Dr Saha claimed a deduction under the FIF rules for the value of the shares he forfeited. The Commissioner disallowed that deduction. Dr Saha appealed to the High Court and the Court of Appeal. Both Courts upheld the decision of the Commissioner. Dr Saha appealed to the Supreme Court, which also dismissed his appeal. The Court held that under the FIF rules, Dr Saha derived a gain "in kind", which offset the loss he incurred through the forfeiture of the other shares.

### Impact of decision

The decision confirms the High Court and the Court of Appeal decisions, but on different reasoning. Although there is discussion of the operations of the FIF rules, some of the provisions discussed have been amended or repealed.

### Facts

Dr Saha was a partner in Ernst & Young (E&Y). In 2000, E&Y sold a portion of its business to an overseas French company, Cap Gemini SA. The partners were paid by means of an allocation of shares in Cap Gemini. Part of the sale arrangements was that some of the E&Y partners, including Dr Saha, would work for Cap Gemini for five years. If a partner stopped working for Cap Gemini before the five years were up, share forfeiture would occur. This is what happened with Dr Saha and he was later required to return some of the shares he had received.

The share allocation and disposals were subject to the Foreign Investment Fund (FIF) taxation regime. Dr Saha chose to return his FIF income/losses under the comparative value method (section CG 18 of the Income Tax Act 1994) whereby if the value of a person's holding had increased during the course of a tax year, that increase would be treated as income, and if it had decreased it would be treated as a deductible loss.

Dr Saha forfeited 2095 of the 7566 shares he was allocated when he left the employment of Cap Gemini. Dr Saha claimed a deduction of $602,938 being the market value of the 2095 shares he forfeited to Cap Gemini. The Commissioner disallowed that deduction.

### Decision

Dr Saha chose the "comparative value" method under section CG 18. In applying the analysis to the formula, the Court noted at paragraph \[14\] that:

1.  because Dr Saha no longer owned the shares at the end of the income year during which they were forfeited their value at the time was nil;
2.  Dr Saha derived no gains during the year "with respect to" those shares (his "interest" in a FIF) because their forfeiture resulted in loss to him;
3.  the market value of the shares at the end of the preceding income year was $602,938; and
4.  no expenditure was incurred during the income year in acquiring the shares.

The formula in section CG 18 is (a + b) - (c + d). The calculation therefore is (nil plus nil) less ($602,938 plus nil). As a result, the Court said that if section CG 18 was the only relevant section, the deduction would have been correctly claimed. But section CG 18 is subject to sections CG 23(5) and CG 14(2).

Under section CG 23(5), if a person disposes of any interest for no consideration the person shall be deemed to have derived from the disposition consideration equal to the market value of the property. The Court concluded that it could not be said that Dr Saha disposed of his interest for no or inadequate consideration, as there was a benefit to him in the value of the shares he was permitted to retain.

For the Commissioner to rely on section CG 14(2), the Court said that the Commissioner must establish that as a consequence of the forfeiture Dr Saha derived a gain "in kind and not in money". If so, the amount of the gain was deemed to be the market value of the gain. The Court held at paragraph \[25\] that the gain was deemed by section CG 14(2) to be the market value of the shares which were retained.

The result was (at paragraph \[26\]):

*   The effect of section CG 14(2) was that Dr Saha was deemed to have derived a gain of $602,938 from the forfeiture of the shares. That sum therefore became input (b) into the section CG 18 formula. The resultant calculation was (nil plus $602,938) less ($602,938 plus nil), namely nil. It followed that the Commissioner's assessment that Dr Saha was not entitled to claim a deduction of $602,938 was correct, and his appeal must therefore be dismissed.

A question of standing
======================

2017 case note – standing of taxpayer bringing proceeding on behalf of incorporated society - strike out, liquidation, incorporated and unincorporated societies.

Case

Rhys Michael Cullen v The Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2017\] NZHC 578

Legislative References

Section 26 Incorporated Societies Act 1908, ss 248, 260, sch 6 Companies Act 193, ss 89AB, 89D, 109, 113, 138B Tax Administration Act 1994, ss 51, 57 Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, r 15.1 High Court Rules 2016

### Summary

Mr Cullen brought a proceeding in relation to a goods and services tax return on behalf of Tamaki Rugby League Incorporated against the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“the Commissioner”). The Commissioner applied to strike out this proceeding on the basis that, as Tamaki Rugby League Incorporated was struck off the register of incorporated societies at the time of the return and in liquidation at the time the proceedings were brought, Mr Cullen did not have standing. The High Court declined the Commissioner’s strike out application, considering it tenable that the proceeding related to the unincorporated version of Tamaki Rugby League Incorporated, and that Mr Cullen could therefore have standing.

This judgment is under appeal.

### Impact

There are concerns over the wider impact of this decision. Her Honour seems to suggest that the Commissioner is obligated to enter the disputes process and treat tax returns and dispute documents as valid even when they have not been filed on behalf of, or with the authority of, the taxpayer stated on the documents.  This decision appears to broaden the ambit of Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Alam \[2009\] NZCA 273.   
 

### Facts

On 24 July 2006, the Tamaki Rugby League (“the Club”) was registered on the Register of Incorporated Societies (“the Register”) as an incorporated society (“the Society”). On 20 August 2010, the Society was placed into liquidation and the Society was removed from the Register on 19 November 2012.

The Society was restored to the Register as of 17 June 2016 following an application by Mr Rhys Cullen as he believed the Society was due a tax refund from Inland Revenue. The Society came back into existence as an incorporated society from that date forward. The Judge hearing the application to restore the Society to the Register refused to make “relate back” orders.

In the interim, it seems that Mr Cullen, as Chairman of the Club, had been taking steps to prepare and file various tax returns, including a goods and services tax (“GST”) return for the period ended 31 May 2016 (“the Return”). The Return was in the name of the Society. The GST registration number used on the Return was the Society’s. The Return sought a GST refund of approximately $14,000.

On 3 August 2016, the Commissioner issued a notice of assessment (“the Assessment”). The Assessment was also in the name of the Society and used the Society’s GST registration number. The Assessment recorded that, rather than a refund of approximately $14,000, a refund of only approximately $100 was due. Mr Cullen says that there was a data entry error when Inland Revenue Department staff processed the Return.

On 26 August 2016, Mr Cullen issued a Notice of Proposed Adjustment (“the NOPA”) in relation to the Assessment. Again, the NOPA was in the name of the Society, and it used the Society’s GST registration number. In the NOPA, Mr Cullen challenged the validity of the Assessment.

Pursuant to ss 89G and 89AB(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (“the TAA”), the Commissioner’s Notice of Response (“the NOR”) was due on 26 October 2016.  On 5 September 2016, Mr Cullen commenced these proceedings, seeking a declaration that the Return is valid and a declaration that the Assessment is invalid.

On 7 September 2016, the Commissioner wrote to Mr Cullen acknowledging receipt of the NOPA and noting that the Commissioner intended to issue a NOR. On 14 October 2016, the Commissioner wrote again to Mr Cullen, stating that the Commissioner had confirmed that the Society was in liquidation and that the Commissioner would be directing further communications to the Official Assignee. No NOR was issued by the Commissioner prior to 26 October 2016.

On 19 September 2016, the Commissioner filed her application to strike out these proceedings.

### Decision

Her Honour found that it was tenable that the Return, the NOPA and these proceedings were issued and/or brought for and on behalf of the Club as an unincorporated body, rather than the Society. There was no doubt that the Return was issued in the name of the Society and used the Society’s GST registration number. However, her Honour’s view was that did not mean that the taxpayer to whom the Return actually related could not be the Club. Her Honour considered it tenable that the Return could not in fact relate to the Society, because the Society did not exist during the period to which the Return relates.

  
Her Honour reached a similar conclusion in relation to the Assessment, finding that it was arguable that the Assessment was an assessment of the tax activities of the Club and not the Society.

  
Her Honour also found that if the Commissioner considered that a NOPA does not meet the requirements of s 89D, or is otherwise invalid and has not triggered the statutory disputes process, the appropriate course was to issue a NOR to that effect, so that that issue can be resolved through the disputes process and challenge proceedings. This enables the question of validity to be determined through the correct procedural route.

  
Accordingly, for these reasons her Honour considered it was arguable that Mr Cullen did not need the Official Assignee’s consent to commence these proceedings and, as Chairman of the Club, had the necessary standing to bring them.

  
It was also found tenable that the Assessment was not deemed to be correct under s 109 of the TAA.  This was because the premise underlying s 109, namely that the taxpayer could challenge the Assessment in challenge proceedings, did not exist.

  
Her Honour found that while it was an abuse of process for Mr Cullen to have commenced these proceedings prior to the disputes process running its course, as the Commissioner did not continue to engage in the disputes process she did not propose to exercise her discretion to strike out the proceedings as an abuse of process.

A word from the Commissioner
============================

Over the last year, Inland Revenue Te Tari Taake has continued to focus on making tax simpler and easier for individuals and businesses, with 99.2% of tax returns being filed digitally in 2023–24.

In New Zealand, we enjoy a high level of voluntary compliance, with nearly 90% of payments made on time this year. We offer help to customers who may be struggling to meet their tax obligations.

New Zealand’s tax revenue has grown to its highest level ever this year with tax revenue for 2023–24 being $115.4 billion. This is 10.5% more than in 2022–23. We continue to focus on making tax and entitlements easy and simple and follow up with those who don’t comply.

Delivering value through our work
---------------------------------

During the year, we refreshed our enterprise strategy, which confirmed our core roles of working efficiently and effectively, being active stewards of the tax and social policy system and making a broader contribution across the Public Service through working collaboratively.

The focus of our strategy, in particular being efficient and effective, is consistent with helping us deliver the Government’s priorities for revenue.

The successful completion of our business transformation programme in mid-2022 has created a solid foundation for us to build on and the opportunity to deliver greater value for New Zealanders. This is the final year of reporting the outcomes of the programme and you can read more about what we have achieved here.

[Outcomes of the transformation programme](/about-us/publications/annual-corporate-reports/annual-report/annual-report-2024/our-performance/our-services/residual-activities-following-the-transformation-programmes-substantive-closure/outcomes-of-the-transformation-programme)

IR delivered a range of initiatives this year intended to improve efficiency and effectiveness across our services. You will see some of these covered in this Annual Report.

During the year there has been a notable growth in overdue tax debt, which is in part due to a difficult economic climate. We are prioritising efforts to manage and recover overdue amounts and are targeting high-value and high-risk debt such as customers with high levels of debt and who persistently default on their obligations.

Many customers with a debt have taken positive steps to deal with it, which includes setting up instalment arrangements this year covering $4.3 billion of debt, of which $461 million had been paid at 30 June 2024. The ability for customers to set up their own arrangements was one of the changes introduced by transformation. Since February 2017, when customers were first able to do this, more than 150,000 arrangements have been paid in full totalling $1.5 billion.

Across our compliance activities we have assessed $975 million in additional revenue. This includes $230 million in incorrect or fraudulent refunds and tax reductions that were picked up by our systems and stopped at the time of filing.

The analytical capabilities delivered by transformation enable checks like these to happen at the time of a transaction, which supports compliance and provides certainty to customers. We can now quickly assess risk on a customer-by-customer basis.

We have increased our enforcement activities this year for the few customers who choose to not do the right thing. We have carried out more audits and liquidations this year than last year. These activities also build trust and give confidence that, if people are doing the wrong thing, we will take action.

The new Government’s priorities include maximising revenue, reducing costs to customers and simplifying processes. In Budget 2024, IR received additional funding to carry out more compliance activities to increase tax revenue. We have committed to a return on investment of $4 for every $1 invested in 2024–25 and $8 for every $1 in future years. The funding will support an increase in investigations and audits as well as focus on debt collection from overseas-based student loan borrowers. This work is happening alongside our existing compliance activities.

Helping customers
-----------------

Being visible in the communities we work with is important to us and we hosted tax workshops for businesses and sole-traders and visited more than 1,600 customers to explain our services and talk through any areas of concern.

We continued to run awareness campaigns, including a successful campaign targeted at the construction industry, which has led to increased compliance, resulting in $1.2 million of debt being brought under instalment arrangements.

In line with the Government’s priority of reducing compliance costs for individuals and businesses, we have continued to look at what we can do for small-to-medium-sized businesses (SMEs). We are also working to reduce uncertainty for larger companies by providing tailored account management for the biggest companies.

Our Tax Counsel Office also supports compliance through providing clarity and certainty on tax law so that customers can enter into commercial transactions with confidence.

As well as collecting revenue, IR administers a range of social policy payments. Around 336,000 customers receive Working for Families Tax Credits, we facilitate child support for 145,000 children and process KiwiSaver contributions for 3.4 million New Zealanders.

During the early part of 2024, we worked closely with the Ministry of Social Development Te Manatū Whakahiato Ora and the Ministry of Education Te Tāhuhu o te Mātauranga to prepare to implement FamilyBoost, the Government’s new payment to partially reimburse early childhood education costs. We can now implement new products and services much more quickly and cost-effectively as a result of transformation.

To raise awareness about the new scheme and other Budget 2024 changes to Working for Families, we ran online campaigns to reach as many eligible people as possible.

Working together for New Zealanders
-----------------------------------

Our work is not done alone. We work with other Public Service agencies to deliver greater value together. We also work with partners across the tax ecosystem, including intermediaries, software providers, industry bodies and community organisations, who all contribute to supporting our customers.

To make sure New Zealand remains active in progressing global taxation initiatives, we work with international organisations and New Zealand’s tax treaty partners to support international efforts to ensure that everyone pays their fair share of tax.

The last year has required us to deliver our services in a challenging economic and financial environment and we have asked a lot of our people. I am proud of the work they do every day to deliver positive outcomes for current and future generations of New Zealanders.

[Accounting income method (AIM)](https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/publications#sort=%40irscttissuedatetime%20descending&numberOfResults=25&f:@irscttpublicationtypes=[Determinations,AIM])

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As part of legislation enacted on 21 February 2017, the Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Act 2017, a new method for calculating provisional tax was introduced – the accounting income method (AIM).

[Common Reporting Standard (CRS)](https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/publications#sort=%40irscttissuedatetime%20descending&numberOfResults=25&f:@irscttpublicationtypes=[Determinations,CRS])

[COVID-19 variations](https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/publications#sort=%40irscttissuedatetime%20descending&numberOfResults=25&f:@irscttpublicationtypes=[Determinations,COVID-19%20variations])

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Depreciation](https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/publications#sort=%40irscttissuedatetime%20descending&numberOfResults=25&f:@irscttpublicationtypes=[Determinations,Depreciation])

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Taxpayers must depreciate all depreciable property, other than excluded depreciable property by applying the economic depreciation rate (also known as the general rate) applicable to that item of depreciable property. These rates are set out in Determination DEP1, which was issued in 1993. Since DEP1 was issued, we have issued further general determinations amending DEP1 which set new asset classes and depreciation rates. Find more information including the depreciation rate finder and depreciation claim calculator under [Claiming depreciation](https://www.ird.govt.nz/income-tax/income-tax-for-businesses-and-organisations/types-of-business-expenses/depreciation/claiming-depreciation)
 on the Inland Revenue website.

### [Economic depreciation rates](https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/publications#sort=%40irscttissuedatetime%20descending&numberOfResults=25&f:@irscttpublicationtypes=[Determinations,Depreciation,General])

These rates are determined by the Commissioner and are also known as **general rates**. They are arrived at by calculating the estimated useful life of an item of depreciable property and expressing that as a percentage of its cost.  

### **[Provisional depreciation rates](https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/publications#sort=%40irscttissuedatetime%20descending&numberOfResults=25&f:@irscttpublicationtypes=[Determinations,Depreciation,Provisional])
**

Taxpayers may apply to the Commissioner to have a provisional depreciation rate set for an item of depreciable property that has not had an economic rate set for it. Often these will be items that are new to the New Zealand tax base. Once set, the depreciation rate is available to be used by all taxpayers who may acquire that item of property.

### Special depreciation rates

If a general economic or a provisional depreciation rate is not suitable for your asset, you may apply  for your own special depreciation rate – see application form [IR260B](https://www.ird.govt.nz/-/media/project/ir/home/documents/forms-and-guides/ir200---ir299/ir260b/ir260b-2019.pdf)
. Special depreciation rate determinations are not published.

======================

[Case summaries](https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/publications#sort=%40irscttissuedatetime%20descending&numberOfResults=25&f:@irscttpublicationtypes=[Case%20summaries])

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These are brief case summaries, prepared by Inland Revenue, of decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the District Court, the High Court, the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court in matters involving the Revenue Acts. For Taxation Review Authority matters, names have been anonymized. The findings described in a case summary will no longer represent current law where the matter has been successfully appealed or subsequent amended legislation has been enacted.

[Commissioner's statements](https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/publications#sort=%40irscttissuedatetime%20descending&numberOfResults=25&f:@irscttpublicationtypes=[Commissioner's%20statements])

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Informs taxpayers of the Commissioner’s position and the operational approach being adopted on a particular tax matter.

[Determinations](https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/publications#sort=%40irscttissuedatetime%20descending&numberOfResults=25&f:@irscttpublicationtypes=[Determinations])

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue may (or in some cases must) issue determinations about various tax issues such as accrual expenditure, depreciation, financial arrangements, foreign currency, livestock valuations, standard costs for boarding service providers, and childcare providers.

### [More about determinations](/about/about-our-publications/about-determinations)

[Interpretation guidelines](https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/publications#sort=%40irscttissuedatetime%20descending&numberOfResults=25&f:@irscttpublicationtypes=[Interpretation%20guidelines])

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These discuss the Commissioner's approach to the interpretation of a general area of law where there are also taxation implications. For example, _IG009: Employee or independent contractor?_ assists taxpayers to determine their employment status for tax purposes.

[Interpretation statements](https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/publications#sort=%40irscttissuedatetime%20descending&numberOfResults=25&f:@irscttpublicationtypes=[Interpretation%20statements])

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These set out the Commissioner's view of the taxation laws in relation to a particular set of circumstances in cases when a binding public ruling cannot be issued or is considered to be inappropriate.

[Issues papers](/about/about-our-publications/about-issues-papers)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

At the Tax Counsel Office we develop and publish public statements that interpret the current tax laws. Where sufficient uncertainty exists, it helps us to hear from interested parties before we prepare any public statement. An issues paper sets out Inland Revenue’s initial views on how the relevant tax laws apply and requests feedback from interested parties.

[New legislation](https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/publications#sort=%40irscttissuedatetime%20descending&numberOfResults=25&f:@irscttpublicationtypes=[New%20legislation])

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Explanations of changes to legislation including Acts, general and remedial amendments, and Orders in Council.

[Operational guidelines](https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/publications#sort=%40irscttissuedatetime%20descending&numberOfResults=25&f:@irscttpublicationtypes=[Operational%20guidelines])

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These are provided for information purposes only and do not replace or override any interpretations or other statements made with respect to the application of the law.

[Operational positions](https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/publications#sort=%40irscttissuedatetime%20descending&numberOfResults=25&f:@irscttpublicationtypes=[Operational%20positions])

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of an operational position is to outline the legal position that the Commissioner considers is correct for an issue identified and the approach the Commissioner will be taking to applying that position in practice.

[Operational statements](https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/publications#sort=%40irscttissuedatetime%20descending&numberOfResults=25&f:@irscttpublicationtypes=[Operational%20statements])

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These set out the Commissioner's view of the law in respect of the matter discussed. They are intended to be a preliminary view in the absence of a public binding ruling or an interpretation statement on the subject.

[Overviews](https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/publications#sort=%40irscttissuedatetime%20descending&numberOfResults=25&f:@irscttpublicationtypes=[Overviews])

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Where the Commissioner has published several items of tax technical guidance on a particular topic, an Overview may be created.  An Overview lists all relevant items tax technical guidance on a topic, with links, to help customers when they are searching on the Tax Technical Website.

PIB (Public Information Bulletin)
---------------------------------

The PIB is an Inland Revenue publication that ran from September 1963 (No 1) to July 1986 (No 183). The New Zealand Legal Information Institute (NZLII) has a database containing all issues of the PIB.

Please note: Many Public Information Bulletins contain very general information with limited analysis or reasoning to support the views expressed, and most relate to legislation which has since been repealed or amended. In some cases, the Commissioner's view or reasoning has developed or changed significantly since publication. Where there is doubt, professional advice should be sought.

### [New Zealand Inland Revenue Department - Public Information Bulletins](http://www.nzlii.org/nz/other/NZIRDPIB/)

[PIB reviews](https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/publications#sort=%40irscttissuedatetime%20descending&numberOfResults=25&f:@irscttpublicationtypes=[PIB%20reviews])

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To assist taxpayer certainty and compliance, we have completed a review of all tax technical items published in Public Information Bulletins (PIBs). We have reviewed PIB volumes 1 to 183, published between September 1963 and July 1989.

### Notes

*   A number of items have been identified as **Archived legislative commentary**. The acts referred to may have been amended or repealed since these items were published. This information reflects the policy intent of legislative changes made at the time and not necessarily the interpretative effect of the law.
*   Items which are of no current relevance and will not be updated are identified. The remainder have been updated to reflect current legislation and reissued in a current Tax Information Bulletin or, in the case of a small number, are still under consideration.
*   All review decisions were consulted on with the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants (now CA ANZ) and the New Zealand Law Society.
*   Inland Revenue published PIBs regularly between September 1963 and July 1989. They comprised a range of statements on taxation issues, as well as legislative commentary, public notices and other information. Tax Information Bulletins replaced PIBs from July 1989.
*   Many PIBs contained very general information with limited analysis or reasoning to support the views expressed, and most related to legislation which has since been repealed or amended. In some cases, the Commissioner's view or reasoning has developed or changed significantly since publication.
*   PIB items still under consideration should be referenced with some care. These items should not necessarily be taken as the Commissioner's current view of the law or operational practice. Where there is doubt, professional advice should be sought.

[Questions we've been asked](https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/publications#sort=%40irscttissuedatetime%20descending&numberOfResults=25&f:@irscttpublicationtypes=[Questions%20we've%20been%20asked])

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Issued by the Tax Counsel Office, these are published items about specific tax issues that set out the answers to enquiries we have received which may be of general interest to taxpayers. A general similarity to the items will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case should be considered on its own facts.

[Revenue alerts](https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/publications#sort=%40irscttissuedatetime%20descending&numberOfResults=25&f:@irscttpublicationtypes=[Revenue%20alerts])

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These are issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, and provide information about significant and/or emerging tax planning issues that are of concern to Inland Revenue. At the time an alert is issued, risk assessments will already be underway to determine the level of risk and to consider appropriate responses. A Revenue Alert will identify:

*   the issue (which may be a scheme, arrangement or particular transaction) which the Commissioner believes may be contrary to the law, or is inconsistent with policy;
*   the common features of the issue;
*   our current view; and
*   our current approach

[Rulings](https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/publications#sort=%40irscttissuedatetime%20descending&numberOfResults=25&f:@irscttpublicationtypes=[Rulings])

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A binding ruling is Inland Revenue's interpretation of how a tax law applies to a particular arrangement or situation.

[TIB (Tax Information Bulletin)](https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/publications#sort=%40irscttissuedatetime%20descending&numberOfResults=25&f:@irscttpublicationtypes=[TIB])

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These bulletins contain information about changes to tax-related legislation, proposed legislation, judgments, rulings and other specialist tax topics. Inland Revenue provides the TIB as a service to people with an interest in New Zealand taxation.

Who can get schedular payments and what you need to consider if you choose to be paid this way, or if you are making schedular payments to contractors who receive schedular payments.

Who gets schedular payments?
----------------------------

Contractors doing certain activities or services, or contractors working in certain industries, where the supply mainly consists of labour.

A contractor can be an individual, partnership, trust or company. Contractors can be [New Zealand tax residents](/api/glossary/item?id={CC613A0F-B2AE-4755-B947-A74A5002A8EF})
 or [non-resident taxpayers](/api/glossary/item?id={629D26DB-A2DC-4E9F-88E8-397C0AA00D67})
.

Some examples of contractors getting schedular payments are:

*   an IT project manager contracted by a recruitment agency (labour hire business) to one of the agency's clients
*   a builder contracted to a labour hire business
*   a freelance journalist paid to write a magazine article
*   an insurance agent or salesperson paid commission
*   a company director paid directors’ fees
*   a commercial cleaning partnership paid by a local business to clean their offices
*   companies contracted to supply labour to the agricultural, horticultural or viticultural sectors
*   non-resident contractors, entertainers and sportspeople.

Some prize money won in competitions may also be schedular payments.

There are special rules for non-resident taxpayers getting schedular payments.

[Non-resident entertainers and sportspeople](/roles/non-residents/non-resident-entertainers-and-sportspeople)

Working out your tax rate
-------------------------

You’ll need to tell your payer the correct tax rate so they withhold the right amount of tax from your payments. You can find out which rate you should be using on the IR330C form.

If you think your rate should be lower than that on the form, use our calculator to estimate the rate and apply for a tailored tax rate. You cannot use a tax rate lower than 10% without applying for a tailored tax rate.

[Apply for a tailored tax rate for schedular payments](/income-tax/withholding-taxes/schedular-payments/getting-schedular-payments/apply-for-a-tailored-tax-rate-for-schedular-payments)

Manage tax rates to avoid debt
------------------------------

If you do not declare the right tax rate for your schedular payments during the year, you’ll have tax to pay at the end of the year. If you do not pay your tax debt, we may enforce a prescribed withholding rate.

[Schedular payments with a prescribed withholding rate](/income-tax/withholding-taxes/schedular-payments/schedular-payment-special-cases/schedular-payments-with-a-prescribed-withholding-rate)

Declare your tax rate by notifying the person paying you
--------------------------------------------------------

The Tax rate notification for contractors - IR330C lists the activities which schedular payments can be paid for.

About standard practice statements
==================================

Standard practice statements describe how we will exercise a statutory discretion or deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts.

Since January 2005, a new referencing system has been adopted for all new standard practice statements:

*   Those issued in the same calendar year will be sequentially numbered and prefixed with a 2-digit year to identify the age of the publication.
*   Those issued prior to 2005 will retain their original references until they are replaced or re-issued.

You need to give your employer or payer your tax code so they know how much tax to deduct from your pay, benefit, pension or other taxable payment such as Student Allowance, an ACC compensation payment or paid parental leave.

[Paid parental leave](/paid-parental-leave)

How income is taxed 
--------------------

Your employer or payer deducts tax from your income when you are paid and then pays your tax to us. You are paid the after-tax amount.

If you pay tax yourself, you work out how much you need to pay at the end of the tax year (31 March) and pay the tax directly to us. 

[How income is taxed](/income-tax/income-tax-for-individuals/how-income-is-taxed)
 

Choosing the right tax code
---------------------------

Your tax code tells your employer or payer how much tax to deduct from your pay, benefit or pension.   
  
There are several tax codes and it’s important to choose the one that’s right for you so you avoid a bill at the end of the tax year 31 March. 

You need one tax code for your main or highest source of income, The code you use depends on the type and amount of your main income. 

Secondary tax codes
-------------------

If you’re getting taxable income from more than 1 source at the same time, you may need to use a secondary tax code. This is because your extra earnings may have pushed you into a higher tax bracket.

These income sources could include payments such as a pension, ACC, or a Work and Income Benefit.

Each 'layer' of your income is taxed at a different rate. The higher layers are taxed at a higher rate than the lower layers. 

### Secondary tax codes and rates from 31 July 2024

| Estimated annual total income from all sources | Secondary tax code for the second source of income | Secondary tax rate (before ACC levies) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 - $15,600 | SB  | 10.5% |
| $15,601 and $53,500 | S   | 17.5% |
| $53,501 and $78,100 | SH  | 30% |
| $78,101 and $180,000 | ST  | 33% |
| $180,001 and over | SA  | 39% |

[Secondary tax codes](/income-tax/income-tax-for-individuals/tax-codes-and-tax-rates-for-individuals/secondary-tax-codes)

Tax code declaration
--------------------

Our tax code declaration - IR330 has a flowchart on pages 2 and 3 to help you work out the right tax code to use.

You complete the IR330 and give it to your employer or payer. Now they can deduct the right amount of tax from your salary or wage.

[Complete my tax code declaration](/income-tax/income-tax-for-individuals/tax-codes-and-tax-rates-for-individuals/complete-my-tax-code-declaration)
  

If you do not give your employer an IR330, they’ll deduct tax from your pay at the non-declaration rate of 45%.

If your tax code changes, you’ll need to give your employer or payer a new IR330.

As an example, you may move from an ‘M SL’ tax code to an ’M’ tax code when you pay off your student loan.

We might change your tax code
-----------------------------

If we see that you're using an unsuitable tax code, we may suggest you change it or apply to us for a tailored tax code.

If you're using the wrong tax code, such as using the M tax code on 2 sources of income at the same time, we'll ask your employer or payer to change it. We'll notify you when we do this.

We do this to help you avoid getting a bill at the end of the tax year or to stop you paying more tax than you should during the year.

Talk to us if you disagree with our decision to change your tax code.

Tailored tax options
--------------------

Tailored tax options help you pay the right amount of tax if your circumstances mean you often have a large tax bill or refund.

\[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] About the Partner Performance Framework Commercial Services and Strategic Property March 2022 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] As a Government Agency it is important understand the importance and reliance we have on our supply chain.We need to consider: •innovation; •security; •risk management; •cost savings; •broader outcomes – social, environmental, cultural. As the role of Commercial within the organisation, we work alongside the business so that Inland Revenue gets the best value from its commercial and supplier relationships. We need to ensure that our relationship with key suppliers does not cease once a contract has been signed but evolves through the contracting lifecycle. We recognise that once contracted, holding our key suppliers at arm's length is not an option. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Supplier Relationship Management (SRM) SRM is the governance model that seeks to develop successful, collaborative relationships with key suppliers for the delivery of significant tangible business benefits for both parties. The partner performance framework is a key part of SRM and the management of suppliers for Inland Revenue. The suppliers managed within this framework are predominantly those which have been categorised as Tier 1 (Strategic) or Tier 2 (Critical). The collective management of performance and regular dialogue with key suppliers provides: •a greater focus on what is critically important to Inland Revenue; •an environment that enablesIR and its key suppliers to work in collaboration; •a platform to build trust; •an opportunity to identify challenges and resolve these before they become issues; •a platform that encourages open and honest communication; •an opportunity to promote the use of existing & emerging technologies. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Surveys and Scorecarding The purpose of surveying you as a as a key stakeholder within IR of a suppliers goods and or services is to track how IR’s key partners are performing month to month or quarter to quarter. These surveys seek feedback which is critical to managing IR’s relationship with the supplier and driving them to deliver the best possible service. The survey’s and results are highly valuable to both IR’s executive leadership and to the partners themselves. A high degree of importance is given to ensuring that the results are accurate and provide a true reflection of IR’s position. The Commercial Services team facilitates a three step method to track performance. 1.Gather information via survey 2.The survey respondents meet to moderate the scores and comments gathered from Step 1 3.The survey is consolidated into a single scorecard that summarises each of the topics that underpin the survey. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Surveys (Step 1) The grouping of questions in each survey applies differently to different aspects of the engagement lifecycle. BAU questions are tailored to reference more of a steady state. Project questions refer to more discrete pieces of work undertaken by the supplier. Project Specific Questions Generic across both Categories BAU Specific Questions Cost ManagementEngagement EffectivenessResource Stability Schedule Attainment & DeliveryRisk & Issue ManagementService Quality Scope ManagementAdmin & ComplianceService Improvement Team Mobilisation & Performance Project Management & Quality Assurance \*With the conclusion of the BT Programme, and the project specific work reducing, commercial are currently in the process of combining the Project & BAU scorecards into one scorecard that will cover all aspects of the engagement lifecycle. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Surveys (Step 1 cont.d) Example of a helpful comment Example of a not so helpful comment \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Scoring the survey (Step 1 cont’d) Scoring Ranges -A score of 5 denotes that the supplier is actually performing very well,and is meeting IR’s highexpectations. A 5 is not an average/middle-of -the-road achievement –it is the standard that each supplier should aim to meet (or aim to exceed). IR’s target for positive performance (i.evalue against delivery is a range of 4.8 – 5.5) - A score of 4 and aboveis a sign that the supplier is performing well, however there is room to improve in order to meet IRs’ high expectations. - A score below 3is an indicator that the supplier is underperforming and there is room for improvement. This requires steps to be taken in order to achieve a level of service that better meets IRs expectations. - A score below 2is exceptionally rare and would indicate that the supplier is performing below the expected parameters; if urgent steps are not taken to remediate this level of performance, IR may need to consider changing supplier. Survey scores are averaged across each survey question and rolled up across each major category. In general, most IR vendors tend to attain scores between a 4.0 and 5.2. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Scoring the survey (Step 1 cont’d) Commentsare a critical part of each survey response. All comments are gathered and discussed in each moderation session to determine the key messages to feed back to each supplier and senior leaders. Each score should be supported by a brief comment to justify the reasoning behind it. Scores that do not provide supporting comments (particularly very low or very high ones) may be discarded during moderation. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Scorecards and Moderations (Step 2) Moderations are a critical part of this process All comments and scores are gathered and discussed in each moderation session to determine the key messages to feed back to each supplier and senior leaders. It is important that you are present at the moderation sessions to ensure your specific feedback is taken into account and discussed. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Scorecards (Step 3) Once moderated the results are consolidated to the topic headings only and are anonymised and presented as a final scorecard, rating the supplier’s performance and including pertinent comments to support a discussion with supplier representatives at account meetings. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Scorecard (Next Steps) 5 4.8 4.7 4.94.9 5555 5.1 4.8 555 4.4 5 4.9 5 5.2 4.7 4.94.9 Supplier 1Supplier 2Supplier 3Suppier 4Supplier 5Supplier 6Supplier 7Supplier 8Supplier 9 Projects & Programmes Sep-21Oct-21Jan-22Feb-22 4.9 4.4 4.6 555 4.24.2 55 4.5 4.8 5 4.9 5.1 4.74.7 55 4.6 55 4.8 4.4 Supplier 1Supplier 2Supplier 3Supplier 4Supplier 5Supplier 6Supplier 7Supplier 8Supplier 9Supplier 10 BAU Sep-21Oct-21Jan-22Feb-22 Scores generated from this process are reported on both internally and externally.

Abusive tax position taken when making a family assistance claim
================================================================

2013 case note – abusive tax position taken when making a family assistance claim - accountancy practice, artificially low salary from company, family trust.

Case

TRA 18/11

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 2004, Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The disputant accepted a re-assessment by the Commissioner of her family support entitlement because her husband was paid an artificially low salary. The family had also received the benefit of distributions from a family trust which was a shareholder in the company her husband worked for. The disputant argued that the Commissioner had not challenged her husband's tax position and accordingly, she could not be held to have taken an abusive tax position.

The Taxation Review Authority found that the dominant purpose of the arrangement was to obtain family assistance the disputant was not otherwise entitled to.

### Impact of Decision

This judgment makes it clear that where a party enters into an arrangement with another party that creates a favourable tax position for both by reducing the income of the second party and allowing the first party to claim family assistance, the Commissioner can challenge the first party's tax position directly under section GC 28 of the Income Tax Act 2004 (the Act), even though they have not challenged the second party's income under general anti-avoidance provisions.

### Facts

The disputant, who had nil income, began claiming family assistance based on her husband's income following the birth of her first child.

The disputant and her husband were trustees of a family trust which held shares in two companies, one of which was an accounting practice. The husband was the settlor, sole appointee and primary beneficiary of the trust and worked for one of the companies, with his salary paid through the other. The husband's salary was artificially low.

The disputant and her husband moved funds from the accountancy practice to the family trust and used those funds for family expenses.

The Commissioner reduced the disputant's claim for family assistance for the 2006 to 2008 income years (inclusive) and imposed an abusive tax position shortfall penalty in relation to the 2007 income year. The disputant initially challenged the Commissioner's tax assessments. This challenge was subsequently withdrawn. This proceeding solely concerned the imposition of an abusive tax position shortfall penalty.

### Decision

Sinclair J found that an abusive tax position shortfall penalty will apply if (at \[14\]):

*   1.  a tax shortfall arises from the disputant's tax position
    2.  the disputant took a tax position which is an unacceptable tax position
    3.  viewed objectively the disputant took a tax position in respect of or as a consequence of an arrangement that is entered into with a dominant purpose of avoiding tax, whether directly or indirectly, and
    4.  The resulting tax shortfall exceeds $20,000.

It was found on the facts that the requirements in paragraphs (a) and (d) above were satisfied.

The focus of the inquiry was on the application of section GC 28 of the Act which allowed the Commissioner to decrease the tax credits a person was entitled to where they had entered into an arrangement with another person to give a more favourable effect.

The disputant claimed section GC 28 of the Act did not apply. She claimed that her reliance on the income of her husband to claim family assistance was not an abusive tax position to take, because the Commissioner had not challenged the husband's income.

Sinclair J found that the disputant had taken an unacceptable tax position. She did not accept that the interpretation adopted by the disputant was "about as likely as not to be correct". Sinclair J made it clear that for the Commissioner to rely on the specific avoidance provision in section GC 28 of the Act, she does not first have to attack the taxable income of another party to the arrangement under the general anti-avoidance provisions.

Sinclair J found that when viewed objectively, the dominant purpose of the arrangement was to obtain family assistance that the disputant was not otherwise entitled to. She did not accept that there were any commercial reasons (other than tax) for the arrangement.

Sinclair J found that the disputant had not satisfied the onus of proof that the Commissioner's assessment was wrong and to what extent. She found that the disputant was liable for an abusive tax position shortfall penalty for the 2007 income year.

ACC attendant care payments
===========================

2006 changes mean withholding tax at source will replace the current practice of injured claimants deducting and paying tax on payments by ACC.

### Sections CE 12, CF 1(2)(g), CW 28B, DF 4, LD 1B, OB 2 of the Income Tax Act 2004, 33A(1)(a)(iiic) and 33C of the Tax Administration Act 1994

**Correction to TIB Vol 18, no 5, June 2006, ACC ATTENDANT CARE PAYMENTS**  
  
**Application date**  
The provisions apply from 1 April 2008.\*  
  
(\*Updated on 17 August 2007. The previously reported application date, 1 April 2007, was incorrect. Note that a taxation bill before Parliament at the time of this update extends the application date further, to 1 July 2008. That change is expected to be enacted in late 2007.)  

Changes have been made to the Income Tax Act 2004 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 to withhold tax on ACC attendant care payments made by the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC).

Withholding tax at source will replace the current practice of injured claimants or their caregivers deducting and paying tax on the payments by ACC.

Withholding payments regulations will be amended later this year to include the ACC attendant care payments into the withholding payment rules and to require the ACC to withhold 15% of any ACC attendant care payments.

### Background

Attendant care payments are made by ACC to injured claimants for the provision of personal care to those claimants. Claimants may use ACC-contracted caregivers or independent caregivers.

Uncertainty about the correct tax treatment of ACC attendant care payments led to some inconsistent practices. When independent caregivers were used, the accepted practice was that all independent caregivers were considered to be employed by the claimants they cared for. As a result, claimants had to meet all employer PAYE obligations. However, if caregivers worked less than 20 hours per week, they had to meet their own tax obligations as if they were self-employed.

### Key features

New section CF 1(2)(g) of the Income Tax Act treats all ACC attendant care payments as income.

New section CW 28B of the Income Tax Act states that when a claimant uses all the money he or she receives as an ACC attendant care payment to pay for his or her attendant care, the ACC payment is exempt income of that claimant. The provision ensures that a claimant is not required to pay tax on the ACC payments that are applied fully for attendant care purposes.

Under new section DF 4 of the Income Tax Act, a claimant who does not pay the full amount of the money received from ACC to a caregiver will have to pay tax on the portion of the ACC payment not paid to the caregiver. Amendments to the definition of “source deduction payment” in section OB 2 ensure that the claimant is not required to withhold any tax from an ACC payment that he or she makes to a caregiver.

New section 33A(1)(a)(iiic) of the Tax Administration Act states that claimants are not required to file returns of income if their only income for that tax year has come from ACC attendant care payments from which tax has been withheld.

New section 33C of the Tax Administration Act specifies that a caregiver whose annual income does not exceed $9,500 is not required to furnish a return of income for that income year.

New sections CE 12 and LD 1B of the Income Tax Act provide the mechanism for a caregiver to recognise and take into account tax that has been withheld by ACC. Section CE 12 will require that the amount the caregiver received from the claimant should be grossed up by the amount of tax already withheld. Section LD 1B provides a tax credit for the tax amount already withheld.

### Application date

The provisions apply from 1 April 2007.

[All Income tax dates](/index/key-dates#f:@irsccoresubject=[Income tax])

If you're an ACC carer, you have tax responsibilities you need to meet to avoid penalties.

You pay tax on your earnings if you're paid for any of these duties as an ACC carer:

*   attendant care
*   home help
*   childcare
*   attendant care services - training for independence
*   attendant care services - transport for independence.

What you need to do depends on who pays you - ACC or the person you're caring for.

If your agency pays you, you are not an ACC carer so the ACC carer rules do not apply to you. Instead, the tax rules for employees apply to you because you're an employee of your agency.

When you become a carer for someone
-----------------------------------

You need to fill in 2 forms to make sure you're paid and taxed at the right rate.

Your payer will give you a How would you like us to pay for your care? - ACC84 form. You need to complete this form for each client you provide care for. Your client also needs to complete some of this form. 

You also need to complete a Tax rate notification for contractors - IR330C form. 

You need to return both forms to your payer, either ACC or the person you're caring for.

If you do not return both forms, your payer cannot pay you and will tax you at a higher rate.

### Choose your tax rate

As an ACC carer you get schedular payments. These are usually taxed at the rate of 10.5%. You may be able to choose a different tax rate when you complete your IR330C.

Your payer takes the tax out of each payment at the rate you give them. They pay it to us before they pay you.

Keep records during the year
----------------------------

If the person you're caring for pays you, you need to keep full and accurate records for 7 years of:

*   the date you were paid
*   how much you were paid
*   the name of the person who paid you.

You do not need to keep records if ACC pays you.

### Keep records of expenses

If you're self employed, you can claim vehicle expenses and ACC levies as expenses.

#### Vehicle expenses

If you use your vehicle while performing your care duties, you can claim expenses for this. For example, if you take a client to a medical appointment.

You cannot claim for travel from home to a place of work, because this is considered private use, not business use.

#### ACC levies

You may have to pay ACC levies on the income you earn from being a carer. You can claim these as expenses.

If you're self employed
-----------------------

Most carers do not meet the criteria for being 'in business', so we do not consider them self employed.

Register for goods and services tax (GST) if your income is over $60,000.

If you're self employed and your total income from all sources is over $60,000 a year, you must register for GST.

At the end of the tax year
--------------------------

*   If you meet the criteria for an IR3, file an IR3 or an auto calculation will be generated and more information will be required. 
*   If the person you're caring for paid you, you'll have to use your own records of income and tax credits to complete your tax return.
*   If ACC paid you, we'll send you a summary of earnings, showing the amount ACC paid you, and the tax they paid us on your behalf.

If ACC pays for you to have a carer you may have tax responsibilities, depending on whether:

*   ACC pays your carer or your carer's agency directly
*   ACC pays you, and then you pay your carer or agency.

Choosing who you want ACC to pay
--------------------------------

ACC will send you a 'How would you like us to pay for your care?' - ACC84 form. If you have more than 1 carer, you need to complete a form for each carer.

Your carer(s) need to complete some parts of the form before you send it back to ACC. 

At the end of the tax year
--------------------------

Depending on who ACC pays, you have different responsibilities.

My responsibilities

What are my responsibilities when ...

Select what applies to you ACC pays my carer or agency I did not pay a carer or agency I paid only part of the payment to my carer or agency I paid the full payment amount to my carer or agency

If ACC pays your carer, or you use an agency, ACC or the agency will keep records and take care of the tax on your carer's wages.

When you keep the full payment and do not pay a carer or agency, the following applies.

### You need to choose a tax rate

The standard rate of tax for this type of payment is 10.5%. Depending on your circumstances you may need to have a different rate.

To find out more about choosing the right tax rate, read the schedular payments information.

[Schedular payments](/income-tax/withholding-taxes/schedular-payments)

If you do not complete an ACC84 before ACC makes the first payment, they will deduct tax at the non-declaration rate of 45%.

If you have a tailored tax rate certificate or certificate of exemption, give it to ACC with your ACC84 form.

### Your income details

At the end of the tax year, the amount you received from ACC along with the tax credits, will show as schedular income on your income tax assessment.

If you file an Individual income tax return - IR3, the amount will show as schedular payments in your Summary of income. If you file online, we'll add the amount into your online return.

### Records you need to keep

You will need to keep the following records for 7 years:

*   the date ACC paid you
*   how much ACC paid you.

When you only pay part of your payment to your carer or agency, the following applies.

ACC - withholding tax on personal service rehabilitation payments
=================================================================

2007 legislation applies a withholding tax of 15 cents in the dollar to payments made by the ACC to a claimant for personal rehabilitation.

**_Sections CE 12, CF 1, CW 28B, DF 4, LD 1B, LD 1C, OB 1 and OB 2 of the Income Tax Act 2004; sections CE12, CF 1, CW 35, DF 4, LB 7, LB 8, RD 3, YA1 and Part I of Schedule 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007; sections 33A and 33C of the Tax Administration Act 1994; Part F of the Schedule to the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979_**

A withholding tax of 15 cents in the dollar will apply to payments made to a claimant by the Accident Compensation Corporation (or an employer that is an accredited employer under the Injury Prevention, Rehabilitation, and Compensation Act 2001) that are for personal rehabilitation.

**Backround**

Changes were enacted in the Taxation (Depreciation, Payment Dates Alignment, FBT, and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006 that provided for a withholding tax to be imposed on ACC attendant care payments. The withholding rate was to have been set by regulations. Details of these changes are set out on page 112 of _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 18, No 5 (June 2006).

The Taxation (Business Taxation and Remedial Matters) Act 2007 repeals the changes in the 2006 Act and re-enacts them with some modifications, and delays the application date from 1 April 2008 to 1 July 2008.

**Key features**

Payments made by the Accident Compensation Corporation (or an employer that is an accredited employer under the Injury Prevention, Rehabilitation, and Compensation Act 2001) for attendant care, home help, child care, training for independence and escorted travel (collectively referred to as "personal service rehabilitation payment") are to be subject to a withholding tax of 15 cents in the dollar.

If the ACC recipient fully uses the after-tax payment received to purchase care, the total amount of the payment will be treated as exempt income to the recipient. The amount paid to the care provider, together with the amount of the withholding tax will be taxable to the care provider, with the tax credit available to the care provider to be offset against his or her tax liability.

##### Example

Mary was involved in a car accident that reduces her ability to care for herself. ACC assess her entitlement for attendant care at $500 a week. ACC deducts withholding tax of $75.00 from this and pays Mary a net amount of $425.00. Mary fully uses this to pay Molly to come and assist her. Because Mary has fully used the amount she received, her payment is treated as exempt income. Molly's income for tax purposes is the amount received ($425) plus the amount of the withholding tax that was deducted ($75), making a total of $500. Molly is given credit for the tax deducted (the $75) to offset against her tax liability.

However, if the ACC recipient retains part of the payment, the payment is taxable income to the ACC recipient, with a deduction allowed for the pre-tax equivalent amount, and the tax credit is apportioned between the two.

##### Example

In the previous example, instead of using the full amount received to pay for a caregiver, Mary arranges for her sister, Sally, to assist her for $340 a week. Mary is taxable on the $500 payment less a deduction equal to the pre-tax equivalent of the amount she paid, which is $400, making her net taxable income $100. She receives the proportional amount of the total tax deduction of $75, which in this example is $15.00. Sally is taxable on the amount she received ($340), plus her proportion of the tax credit, which in this example is $60.00, making her total taxable income $400, with a tax credit of $60.

An ACC claimant whose only income is from personal service rehabilitation payments will not be required to file a tax return. The care provider will not be required to file a tax return if his or her total income for the tax year does not exceed $9,500.

**Application date**

The provisions apply from 1 July 2008.

Access operations judicial review
=================================

2011 case note – judicial review of search and seizure operations undertaken by CIR – access operations, section 16, reasonableness, lawfulness, validity.

Case

Tauber & Ors v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994, Judicature Amendment Act 1972, New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990, Declaratory Judgments Act 1908

### Summary

Judicial review proceedings were filed by the applicants challenging the lawfulness and reasonableness of search and seizure operations undertaken by the Commissioner, pursuant to section 16 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA"), on a number of business premises and private residences.

### Impact of decision

The Judge found no fault in the procedures followed by the Commissioner's access and removal teams, and shows they were methodical, justifiable and not unreasonable.

The judgment also confirms the decision of _Avowal Administrative Attorneys Ltd v District Court at North Shore_ \[2010\] 2 NZLR 794 ("_Avowal_"). That is that the statutory form of warrant is sufficient; the Commissioner need not exhaust alternative investigatory powers before relying on section 16 of the TAA; and other persons may accompany the officer executing the warrants so long as their presence is necessary for the effective exercise of the search and inspection powers.

The judgment highlights that judicial review is an inappropriate mechanism to challenge the issue, validity and execution of a search warrant. Fact-intensive issues of the reasonableness of the search and/or the excessiveness of any seizure are not appropriate in a judicial review context.

### Facts

On 16 March 2011, as part of his investigation into the tax affairs of Messrs Tauber and Webb and entities associated with them, the Commissioner executed access and removal warrants in respect of residential and commercial premises in Auckland and Hamilton. A total of eight sites were accessed: six in Auckland and two in Hamilton.

A total of 111 boxes of hard-copy books and documents were removed, along with approximately 9.5 terabytes of electronic media. Late on 16 March 2011, a blanket privilege claim was made over all hard-copy and electronic information removed. Subsequently the material was sealed in the offices of the Crown Solicitors in Auckland where it has remained since.

On 8 April 2011, the applicants filed a judicial review application challenging the lawfulness and reasonableness of the access and removal operations for the six Auckland sites.

### Decision

#### Were the section 16(4) and 16C(2) warrants too widely drawn, too general and lacking in specificity?

Justice Venning first outlined the Commissioner's powers to obtain information as set out in Part 3 of the TAA, in particular sections 16 to 19. Under section 16 the only statutory criteria for access to information is that the Commissioner must consider it necessary or relevant for his statutory purposes. The warrant to access private dwellings under section 16(4) must be considered in that context. The District Court Judge need only be satisfied that the exercise of the Commissioner's functions requires access to private dwellings (along with the reasonableness requirements of section 21 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 ("NZ BoRA")).

The Court considered whether the warrants were too widely drawn and lacked specificity. Noting that the warrants were issued in the form prescribed by the Tax Administration (Form of Warrant) Regulations 2003, Justice Venning cited _Avowal_, a case also involving the Commissioner's search powers under section 16. Case law on this issue has confirmed that the statutory form of warrant is sufficient. The warrants could not be criticised because they followed and complied with the prescribed form.

The challenge that the warrants were too widely drawn and lacked specificity was dismissed.

#### Were the section 16(1) searches necessary and were the section 16(4) and 16C(2) warrants required to enable the exercise of the Commissioner's functions?

The applicants submitted that the reasonableness of the access operation depended on whether the Commissioner had exhausted other less intrusive alternatives, such as asking for the information by telephone; applying to the District Court under section 17A of the TAA; seeking an interview under section 19 of the TAA and/or holding a targeted inquiry before a District Court Judge under section 18 of the TAA.

Justice Venning again cited _Avowal_ and noted that there is no requirement for the Commissioner to exercise all or any of his other powers in Part 3 of the TAA before choosing to use the access provisions in section 16. Furthermore, the question for the judicial officer considering whether to issue a warrant is whether the exercise of the Commissioner's functions under section 16 of the TAA requires access to a private dwelling. It was not for the judicial officer to second-guess or review the decision of the Commissioner to invoke his powers to obtain information under section 16.

Justice Venning found that it was not unreasonable for the Commissioner to have invoked his powers under section 16, including the power of access to private dwellings under section 16(4). It was entirely reasonable for the Commissioner to expect that relevant documentation would be found in the three private homes that were accessed. It was also not unreasonable for the District Court Judge to conclude that the exercise of the Commissioner's functions may have required the removal of books and documents for a full and complete inspection. The issue will always be whether access to private homes is required and whether the search of them in the circumstances of the case was reasonable.

The searches were found to be necessary and the section 16(4) and 16C(2) warrants were required and justified.

#### Were the searches carried out in an unreasonable manner?

The applicants pointed to a number of factors that they alleged made the searches unreasonable. These factors were the excessive number of persons engaged in the search of the premises, the duration of the searches, the search of areas that were wholly irrelevant and of roof spaces, the perusal of intimate, personal and obviously irrelevant records, the parking of vehicles on private property, the officers remaining on the property during lunch times, damage to personal items and searches of records relevant to ongoing Taxation Review Authority (TRA) proceedings.

Justice Venning cited the Court of Appeal's decision in _Gill v Attorney-General_ \[2011\] 1 NZLR 433 where it was noted that "the use of the rather blunt instrument of judicial review should rarely be permitted to be used to challenge the issue, validity and execution of a search warrant". Justice Venning stated that it was not possible to resolve the details and nuances of the factual issues concerning the searches on a judicial review application.

Nevertheless, Justice Venning went on to consider the applicants' complaints. As to the number of officers involved, the Commissioner's process of employing a team of officers was considered and approved in _Avowal_. Not only did the warrants specify that the officer executing it may be accompanied by other person(s), each of the other persons had a role to play. Further there was a balance between the number of people involved in the search and the length of time the search will take. In this case, the number of persons involved in the search did not make it unreasonable.

The next complaint was that irrelevant areas were searched. Justice Venning noted how it was "not possible to rule out any particular areas of a dwelling as irrelevant as documents or books can be hidden or stored anywhere" \[60\]. His Honour noted further that the searches were focused. Processes were in place to deal with privileged material and occupiers were advised of their rights and given an opportunity to consult with a solicitor.

There were complaints that personal and irrelevant items were unnecessarily searched and inspected. Justice Venning found that this complaint could not be resolved in this judicial review application. However, it was noted that the searches of private bedrooms and living areas took a fraction of the total time spent on site.

Other complaints were made about cars parked on private property. Justice Venning noted section 16(2) of the TAA requires occupants to provide the Commissioner with all reasonable facilities and assistance for the effective exercise of his powers under the section. His Honour noted that the cars served a readily discernable function and that the provision of reasonable facilities in section 16(2) could extend to the provision of temporary parking facilities. The complaint about officers eating their lunches was similarly dealt with, in that section 16(2) requires the provision of reasonable facilities.

Mr Tauber complained that he was arbitrarily detained. Justice Venning found that Mr Tauber was not arbitrarily detained as he was free to leave the property once the search of his car was completed.

The final complaint about the conduct of the searches was that the access teams removed material relating to ongoing TRA proceedings. This was also said to breach section 27(3) of the NZ BoRA. Justice Venning cited _Vinelight Nominees Ltd & Anor v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (2005) 22 NZTC 19,298 where this issue has been considered and referred to recently by the Court of Appeal in the decision of _Commerce Commission v Air New Zealand_ \[2011\] 2 NZLR 194. The fact that there were TRA proceedings on foot did not constrain the Commissioner from exercising his search powers under section 16. There was no evidence that the dominant or principal purpose of the search was to obtain information relating to the TRA proceedings.

Justice Venning concluded that the searches and seizures were not unreasonable in terms of section 21 of the NZ BoRA.

#### Was the application for the warrants deficient?

The applicants submitted that much of what was put before the District Court Judge to justify the warrant application was erroneous and that the cumulative effect of it was that the affidavit as a whole was misleading to a material degree.

Justice Venning considered the separate allegations in the light of the _Tranz Rail Ltd v Wellington District Court_ \[2002\] 3 NZLR 780 (CA) decision where it was stated that "(c)ertainly there will be cases when it can be said that although something relevant has not been disclosed the non-disclosure can have made no difference". Correct information was put before the District Court Judge and statements were not made in bad faith. Whatever errors or failings contained in the affidavit were confined to emphasis only. In the context of a lengthy affidavit these were not found to be material and could not possibly have affected the District Court Judge's decision to issue the access warrants under section 16(4) and the warrants under section 16C(2) of the TAA.

The challenges to the issue of the warrants and subsequent search were not made out. The judicial review application was dismissed.

PROTOCOL Access to Audit Working Papers BElWEEN NEW ZEALAND INSTITUTE OF CHARTERED ACCOUNTANTS AND INLAND REVENUE 29 Apr!! 2006 Access to Audit Working Papers 8el:ween NZICA and lRD Introduction 2 This document records Inland Revenue's policy in respect of Inland Revenue's access to audit working papers maintained by an external auditor in relation to an audit assignment In draf1ing this statement the Inland Revenue has taken into account the views of the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants (the Institute). The policy statement is necessary because the provisions of the Tax Administration Act i 994 give the Department powers of access to audit working papers. In particular. these statutory powers override the important confidentiality aspect of an aiJditor's operating method, as set out in the lnstitute's Code of Ethics, formulated and published by the Institute and updated from lime to Hme. This policy statement also has regard to the provisions of sections 6 and 6A of the Tax Administration Act i994 and the need to have regard to the role of !he auditor, as set out below. This statement does not address matters relating to working papers other than an auditor's working papers relating to the external audit of an entity. The distinction between audit working papers and other workpapers held by an external auditor in relation to any cfient is outlined below. Audit Working Papers 'Audit 1i-vorking papers' are materials that document matters which are importanl in providing evidence that the audit was carried out in accordance with the "Codified Auditing Standardsm promulgated by the Institute. The extent of this documentation is decided by the auditor, but they wi!! not include every observation. consideration or conclusion made. Audit working papers include management letters arising from the audit These letters may be in the possession of lhe taxpayer. Working papers may be in the form of data stored on paper, film, electronic media or other media. The audit working papers are the property of the auditor and not of the client. The external auditor of an entity may wen maintain working papers in relation to other work undertaken in relation to that entily. In this statement these are referred to as 'other working papers'. 'Other working papers' may include lax wolkpapers, such as papers compiled in order to complete the tax return or to provide tax advice. Any such 'other working papers' form part of !he taxpayer's records, whether they are held by the audrtor, the taxpayer or a third party. Audi! working papers in relation to a client's tax positions and exposures which are prepared solely for audit purposes constitute 'audit working papers' and not ·other working papers'. The Law The general information gathering powers of the Commissioner are set out in the Tax Administration Act 1994. Section references quoted in this document are to sections of that Act 29 April 2008 Access to Audit Working Papers Between NZICA and IRD Broadly slated, relevant sections are: 3 • Section 16 -Commissioner has the power to inspect books and documents, and has the right of access to them. • Section 16B-Power to Remove and Copy Documents. • Section 16C -Power to Remove and Retain Documents for Inspection. • Section 17 -Information required to be furnished to the Commissioner upon the request being made. • Section 17A -Court orders for production of information or return. • Section 18 -Inquiry before District Court Judge. • Section 19 -Inquiry by the Commissioner. • Section 20 • Privilege for certain types of legal communications. • Section 20B-G • No requirement lo disclose tax advice document. Under section 6A of the Tax Administration Act, the Commissioner is charged with the care and management of the Inland Revenue Acls and certain other functions. If that statutory duty is to be properly discharged, the Commissioner must be able to obtain information from a wide variety of sources so as to enable the correct tax position of a taxpayer, or other persons, to be ascertained. However 1he Commissioner must exercise the powers in a manner that promotes voluntary compliance. The sections of the Tax Administration Act 1994 which are customarily used for the purposes of gathering information are seclions 16 and 17. In particular, section 17 is used to require information to be furnished from audit working papers. Every person to whom a request is made in terms of section 17(1} is required to fumish in writing and produce tor inspection such information as the Commissioner consfclers necessary or relevant for the performance of the Commissioner's duties under the Inland Revenue Department Acts. Section 17 of the Act overrides any contractual, professional or other obligation not to produce the documents. The Department noles that this position is supported under the lnstitute's Code of Ethics which slates that the auditor must give access when there is a legal requirement to do so. In short, audit working papers must be made avarlable to the Commissioner upon the recipient of that request being satisfied that a valid request has been made in accordance with section 17. Tue other information gathering powers contained in sections 16, 17A, 18 or i9 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 are very broad. Instances when these other powers are used for requesting information held by auditors would be very rare. Generally audit working papers do not include tax advice documents. However where tax advice documents exist in the audit working papers the procedures set out in Standard Practice Statement SPS 05/07 -Non- disclosure right for tax advice documents are to be followed. 29 April2003 Access to Audit Working Papers Between NZICA and !RD The Role of the Auditor 4 Tire objective of an audit of financial statements is to enable the auditor to express an opinion on, in the case of a reporting entity {an issuer and a company other than an exempt company), whether those financial statements comply with generally accepted accounting practice and give a true and fair view of the matters to which they relate. The overall objective of the auditor in conducting the audrt is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statemenls as a whole are free from material misstatement. Financial information contained in ihe audit rne is extracted from the client's records. The remainder of the audit rne is the thought process in arriving at !he audit opinion. The extracts and thought process may be misfeading if applied for any other purpose. In performing the audit and recording their cunclus1ons, auditors are not acting as tax experts. The audit opinion is expressed about the financial statements as a whole, and not about any one part of those statements. This opinion is not expressed about the lax return or tax liability. Even if statements recorded by the auditor are made a.bout items that affect a client's tax provision, !he correctness or otherwise of data reflected in the tax return cannot be inferred from stalements recorded in the audit working papers. The question of correctness is one of fact and not one of inference or belief. ihe Policy For the external auditors to be effective in performing their responsibilities to their clients and users of financial statements they must develop a relationship of candour with their clients. This policy is designad to be a practical guide to both external auditors and Inland Revenue staff that takes that relationship into account. Requests tor access to audit working papers will arise only in !he course of enquiries conducted by Investigators of the Inland Revenue Department or in Hmi!ed other special cases. The circumstances will vary but a request for audit working papers will not be a routine part of Inland Revenue's investigations. In the first instance the informalion will be requested from the taxpayer. Requests to a taxpayer's auditor for access lo audit working papers will only be made in exceptional circumstances. This approach does not imply that audit working papers enjoy any privilege lrom disclosure unless they are tax advice documents. A request for access to audit working papers will be made only after careful consideration, and on~/ after obtaining the authorisation of !he appropriate Area Manager-Assurance. The authorising officer win have to consider if the informatlon requested is ·necessary or relevant" for the administration of the Tax Acts. !n particular, they must be satisfied as to the adequacy of the investigator's actions in attempting to get the information required from the taxpayer, remembering that requesting the information from the auditor is the last resort. Requests for audit working papers made pursuant !o section 17 will be 'formal requests'. They will incrude details such as when and where the records are to be made available. They will state the penalties for non• compliance. They will comply with the Department's standard practices, currenti 1 · represented by SPS 05/08. The Department will always issue a section 17 request prior to resorting to the other information gathering powers contained in the Tax Administration Act 1994. 29 April 2008 Aef:eSs to Audit Working Papers Between NZICA and fRD .s The auditor is expected to act with proper professional propriety in responding to the Department's request for information. Where fom,al requests are made in accordance with this policy, the Department asks that the recipient auditor endeavour to reciprocate the Department's co-operation, and deal expeditiously with the request after taking into account therr workload. In appropriate cases, the auditor may find it necessary to seek professional advice before complying with requests. In this regard, the Department accepts particular documents on an audit file may properly be subject to legal professional privHege or subject to non-disclosure as tax advice documents. Any request for information that is not made wilh the authorisation of the appropriate person should not be accepted. This complaint should be raised with the National Manager, Technical Standards Inland Revenue. The removal and retention of audit working papers wm be confined to photocopies or copies o! eieclron1c mes. This is because audit working papers are an auditor's 'evidence files' shOuld the auditor be involved in litigation. In practice, it is unlikely that audit files wilf be removed from the auditor's premises. In most cases, providing facilities are available, the investigalor will analyse and, if necessary, photocopy or copy records at the auditor's premises. Further, investigators will examine the audit working papers as quickly as possible. Because of the secrecy provisions of the Tax Administration Act 1994, it is not possible for an investigator to rev ea! the reasons for an access request to an auditor. The procedures outlined in this policy will apply to audit working papers held by (or on behalf of) the external auditor, and to correspondence between !he auditor and the taxpayer concerning matters arising in the course of the audit. Opinions expressed by the auditor in either the audit working papers or communications between the audrlor and their client will not be quoted back to the client (or representatives of that client). As noted previously, the auditor is not acting as a tax expert. The accounting conventions of consistency and materiality may mean audit advice is incompatible w1th tax requirements. When an auditor holds both audit working papers and other working papers on a common file, on a valid request being made for files, the auditor is not expected to make ava!lable the audit working papers content of the file unless the procedures laid down in this statement have been followed. In appropriate cases, legal professional privilege or non-disclosure of tax advice documents may apply to some documents or information. Nothing in this policy statement precludes an auditor or the audit client voluntarily providing to the investigator any audit working papers or copies thereof, shouid they wish to do this. It is intended that this policy will be monitored regularly. 29 April 2008 Accoss to Audit Working Papers Betwsen NZICA and !RO Review 6 The Group Manager, Assurance, (or equivalent officer} and the Chief Executive of the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants shalt review this document periodically.

Accident Compensation Act 1972
==============================

Archived legislative commentary on the Accident Compensation Act 1972 from PIB vol 77 Feb 1974.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 77, February 1974

### Accident Compensation — Inland Revenue as Collecting Agent

### Introduction

The Accident Compensation Act 1972 comes into force on 1 April 1974. The Act provides for three compensation schemes:—

*   The Earner's Scheme for which funds are to be provided by a levy on employers and self-employed persons. Under this scheme compensation will be paid to all earners (employees and self-employed) who suffer an injury, whether or not the injury arises in the course of employment or business.
*   The Motor Vehicle Accident Scheme for which funds are provided by an annual levy on all registered motor vehicles. Under this scheme compensation will be paid in respect of injury arising from a motor vehicle accident.
*   The Supplementary Scheme will be financed from general taxation. Under this scheme compensation will be paid in respect of injury received by any persons not covered by either of the other two schemes.

### The Inland Revenue Department As Collecting Agent

The Inland Revenue Department has been appointed collecting agent of the Accident Compensation Commission to collect the levies under the Earner's Scheme.

### Payment Of Levies

#### Self-Employed:

*   30 April 1974 — pay a flat rate of $3 per month for the period 1 April 1974 to 30 September 1974 i.e. a total payment by 30 April of $18.
*   30 November 1974 — pay 1 percent of business income up to $10,400 for the period 1 October 1974 to 30 September 1975, on the basis of the income of the last financial year.

A leaflet "Guide to Self-Employed" and a levy statement will be sent to all self-employed persons. If you have not received a levy statement by 31 March 1974 get in touch with your local tax office. The leaflet gives information on the levy payable for the period 1 April 1974 to 30 September 1974.

#### Employers:

*   30 June 1974 — pay levy at the classified rate(s) for your industrial activity or activities on each employee's leviable earnings up to $10,400.

A booklet is available at any tax office on the classified rates of levy. A pamphlet, "Guide to Employers" and a levy statement will be sent to all employers later.

If you have not received an employer's levy statement by 31 May get in touch with your local tax office.

### More Information Available

A copy of the working notes given to our staff is available on request from any tax office. These notes give more detailed information about the Accident Compensation levy.

API pūkete Account API
======================

The account API provides either a list of accounts for an identified customer or information about a single customer account. It is 1 of 8 APIs that, together, make up the customer services suite.

[How customer services work](/digital-service-providers/services-catalogue/customer-and-account/customer-services-suite/how-customer-services-work)

An account represents a tax type (for example, income tax) or a product (for example, KiwiSaver). 

How the account API works
-------------------------

When integrated through our gateway services, the account API provides general information about customer accounts. The account API accepts either a customer ID or an account ID. When a customer ID is provided, the account API will return a list of account IDs associated with the customer. When an account ID is provided, the account API returns information about that identified account including:

*   account status
*   account type (tax or product name)
*   filing details
*   start and stop dates
*   physical address
*   postal address
*   primary contact details (contact and phone)
*   secondary contact details (contact and phone)
*   refund bank account.

The account API can only be used by:

*   the customer the account is associated to
*   a user with delegated access to the customer’s account
*   an intermediary who’s linked to the customer’s account
*   government agencies with a memorandum of understanding that allows them access to customer account level data.

Some customers may split their individual account access across delegated users. This means a user may not be able to see all accounts for a specific customer. 

The account API enables the above users to query Inland Revenue’s customer account data from their native systems, and to avoid the use of manually facilitated channels.

Gateway service capability for the account API
----------------------------------------------

The account API provides the following capabilities through defined API operations and API paths.

| API operation | API path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POST | /list | Returns a list of accounts for an identified customer. |
| POST | /account | Returns the information of an identified customer account. |

Account API business use cases
------------------------------

The following are examples of how to use the account API to achieve specific business outcomes. The sequence of operations, the order in which they should be called, is indicated in the column of each operation.

| Number | Use case | POST /list | POST /account |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | Retrieve a list of accounts for an identified customer that I am authorised to access. | 1   |     |
| 2   | Retrieve account data for an account that I am authorised to access but do not have the account ID. | 1   | 2   |
| 3   | Retrieve account data for an account that I am authorised to access and already have the account ID. |     | 1   |

Account management
==================

Inland Revenue fully expected to learn important lessons at every stage of its Transformation, including after its first release. After Stage 1 in February 2017, we quickly realised we needed a closer understanding of how some of our customers operated and the Account Management team was set up later that month to improve customer and stakeholder management.

From that time onwards, the Account Management team became the front door for external stakeholders and customers for the remainder of the programme. They were the ‘canaries in the coalmine’ providing early warning and identification of issues that could impact our external customers before they became widespread or critical.

Managing relationships
----------------------

The Account Management team managed our customer and stakeholder relationships to help us achieve our strategic objectives for transformation. The team managed engagement with stakeholders, customers and their advocacy groups who were affected and impacted by programme changes and enabled two-way open, honest discussion, communication and feedback between customers and our programme.

The team also:

*   understood our customers’ future plans and needs, and helped them understand and engage with our transformation goals
*   engaged, advised and supported customers when transformation-driven change impacted them
*   made important contributions to design and policy based on their own sector knowledge and in-depth understanding of customer needs
*   championed customer issues to ensure the voice of the customer was heard when solutions/designs were being considered or when implemented
*   helped our customers and programme teams to stay on track to achieve the agreed outcomes.

Working with other teams
------------------------

The Account Management team worked alongside teams within Business Transformation and across Inland Revenue to support customers affected by transformation and to make sure the right transformation messages were shared across all customer groups. They worked very closely with the Transformation Communication and Marketing teams.

Having the right people
-----------------------

Our transformation account managers were professional relationship managers with:

*   executive-level engagement and influencing skills, with proven experience and credibility in their sector
*   the ability to drive difficult decisions while maintaining credibility, support and rapport
*   the ability to skilfully line up messaging which was appropriate for the impacted customers
*   proven experience in programme delivery and balancing conflicting priorities
*   familiarity with a variety of engagement techniques with the confidence to deliver the right mix for their sector.

How the Account Management function adds value
----------------------------------------------

*   Established an account management function for all customer segments – not just the traditionally serviced customer segments within IR (tax agents, accounting software developers and others).
*   Developed account management relationships with customer groups which only had access to operational level management previously.
*   Employed account managers with industry knowledge and credibility — real world experience.
*   Took a proactive rather than reactive approach to stakeholder engagement.
*   Provided customer views and feedback directly into IR change and policy initiatives.
*   Presented a collective view of change impact for each customer rather than a piecemeal view of external impacts.
*   Established a successful working partnership with communications and marketing to provide a joined-up engagement approach across all customer segments.
*   Initiated customer information gathering exercises to provide fast feedback into the programme on design or policy challenges.

What we learned
---------------

For future programmes of work, the account management function should be established at the mobilisation of the programme to make sure that customer and stakeholder engagement is embedded into every part of the programme design and delivery.

Moving to business as usual
---------------------------

The team and function have been so successful that they have been transitioned into the business. This means the key stakeholder management and the relationship management practices can continue after the programme’s completion.

Accountant loses appeal in High Court for expenditure on rental properties and treatment of trust income and expenses
=====================================================================================================================

This decision concerns the appellant taxpayer’s appeal against the Taxation Review Authority’s decision upholding the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s assessments in the 2013 and 2014 income years.

Case

Wong v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2018\] NZHC 2729

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994 and Income Tax Act 2007

### Summary

This decision concerns the appellant taxpayer’s (Mr Wong) appeal against the Taxation Review Authority’s (“the Authority”) decision upholding the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s (“the Commissioner”) assessments in the 2013 and 2014 income years (“years in dispute”) (_TRA Case 09/16_ \[2017\] NZTRA 04). The Commissioner disallowed interest and other expenditure on funds borrowed to purchase properties for commercial rental having the effect of increasing Mr Wong’s taxable income. The High Court was not satisfied that Mr Wong had discharged his onus of showing how and by how much the Commissioner’s assessments were wrong ultimately finding the Authority’s decision correct in all respects and disallowing the appeal.

### Impact

This decision confirms, as per _Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2008\] NZSC 115, \[2009\] 2 NZLR 289, that the onus of proof rests on the taxpayer to show that the Commissioner’s assessments are wrong and by how much they are wrong (at \[171\]). The ability to accrue, carry forward and apply tax losses falls within the broad definition of a “tax shortfall” pursuant to ss 3 and 141 of the TAA, being a tax benefit, credit or advantage of any type or description whatever benefiting the taxpayer or another person.

### Facts

Mr Wong is a chartered accountant and operates a consultancy business from his residential address. Mr Wong’s rental and consultancy income went into his various revolving credit accounts. Business and personal expenditure were paid by the disputant from personal credits cards and from funds in the revolving credit accounts.

Three rental properties were identified by the Commissioner during her investigation into Mr Wong’s tax affairs. The first property was purchased by Mr Wong in 2002 (“Upland Road”) for $555,000 and in the name of the Madeline Francesca Family Trust (“the Trust”). Mr Wong and his brother are trustees with Mr Wong and his daughter being beneficiaries. In September 2003, Mr Wong and his late partner purchased a rental property (“Ranfurly Road”) for $685,000 and another in August 2004 (“Victoria Avenue”) for $842,000. The total cost of the properties was $2,082,000. Funding for the properties was largely obtained by loan and credit facilities from ASB.

Mr Wong claimed interest on the borrowings for the Ranfurly Road property for only a small part of the 2013 income year. He also claimed interest in respect of the Victoria Avenue and Upland Road property for both tax years in dispute.

### Decision

The High Court dismissed the appeal finding the Authority’s decision was correct in all respects.

_Interest deductions_

The High Court held that upon sale of the Ranfurly Road property the debt relating to the acquisition of that property should be excluded. The Court also suggested that it would be necessary to exclude part of the debt attributable to Upland Road, given it was owned by the Trust, Mr Wong failing to establish sufficient nexus pursuant to ss DA 1 and DB 6 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

While the High Court agreed with Mr Wong’s counsel that interest deductions on the Victoria Avenue property would have exceeded that allowed in the Commissioner’s assessment, Mr Wong had failed to prove the underlying premise, that the entire sum of $842,000 remained outstanding, and the actual interest paid thereon. The High Court was not persuaded that the Authority erred in rejecting Mr Wong’s claim that he was entitled to deductions for interest that he sought (_Wong v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2018\] NZHC 2729 at \[31\]).

_Upland Road_

Mr Wong challenged the Authority’s finding that he was not entitled to deductions in relation to Upland Road submitting that the Commissioner “can’t have it both ways” i.e. that he should not be liable for the tax on the income from the property but at the same time be denied deductions for expenses. However, the High Court, in agreeing with the Authority, determined that Mr Wong was not entitled to deduct any expenses for insurance and rates for Upland Road given those expenses were incurred by the trustees of the Trust as owners of the property (at \[46\]-\[48\]).

_Penalties_

In the Authority, Mr Wong contended that no tax shortfall arose because once his accumulated losses were taken into account, he had no taxable income in either of the years in dispute. The question before the Authority was whether the tax position taken by the disputant, in not filing tax returns by the due date, “overstate\[d\] a _tax benefit, credit or advantage of any type or description whatever_ by or benefitting…the disputant or another person. (Italics added)” (TRA Case 09/16 \[2017\] NZTRA 04 at \[66\]).

On this point, the Authority concluded that the ability to accrue and carry forward tax losses thereby reducing the amount of tax payable on income earned in subsequent years is plainly a tax advantage to any taxpayer. The Authority was therefore satisfied that the disputant had taken a tax position that resulted in a tax shortfall in each of the years in dispute.

The High Court agreed that the Authority’s decision was correct for the reasons it gave (at \[62\]). Furthermore, the High Court agreed with the Commissioner’s submission that s 141 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) made it clear that a tax shortfall may still arise if a taxpayer has no tax to pay (at \[64\]).

Accountants' advice documents must be discovered
================================================

2008 case note - interlocutory application made by CIR for discovery of ANZ's accountants' advice documents granted - relevance, confidentiality, tax avoidance.

Case

ANZ National Bank Limited and Ors v The Commissioner of Inland Revenue CIV 2005-485-1037, 1038, 1039; 2006-485-1105, 1108, 1109, 1111. (Discovery application)

Legislative References

Evidence Act 2006, Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

An interlocutory application made by the Commissioner for discovery of ANZ's accountants' advice documents was granted. The documents were relevant and not confidential.

### Facts

The Commissioner has investigated a number of structured financing arrangements entered into by the ANZ and the National Bank ("ANZ"). Following this investigation amended income tax assessments have been issued. The basis for the reassessments is that the structured finance transactions are tax avoidance arrangements and the Commissioner is able to counteract the tax advantage gained. ANZ has challenged the reassessments but the substantive question relating to whether the transactions amount to tax avoidance has not yet been heard.

These proceedings arose out of the discovery phase of the substantive litigation. ANZ failed to provide for inspection copies of certain documents relating to tax advice it received from KPMG and PWC in relation to the structured finance transactions. The Commissioner sought discovery and inspection of these documents.

ANZ opposed the application for discovery on the grounds that the documents were not relevant and were confidential.

### Decision

With regard to the question of relevance the Court proceeded on the basis of the settled law that the test for tax avoidance was objective and was determined by reference to the arrangement itself, not the subjective motives of the parties to the arrangement.

ANZ considered the subjective opinions of their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences as irrelevant to the Court's objective determination of whether the structured finance transactions constituted tax avoidance. However, the Commissioner relied on the proposition that the PWC tax advice documents formed part of the overall tax avoidance arrangement and were therefore relevant. The Commissioner also argued the tax advice documents might prove or disprove a matter which would be of consequence to the determination of tax avoidance. In particular the Commissioner cited eight aspects central to the determination of the substantive case which the PWC and KPMG document might go towards proving or disproving.

The Court accepted that the PWC and KPMG documents might be relevant to the determination of those eight aspects and were therefore relevant.

With regard to whether the documents were confidential ANZ relied on section 69(2)(b) of the Evidence Act 2006 ("EA"). This provision gives the Court the overriding discretion to order non-disclosure if the public interest in disclosure is outweighed by countervailing public interest in preventing harm to a relationship of confidence or maintaining the free flow of information.

ANZ argued the relationship between itself and its accountant tax advisors was one which came within the scope of section 69(2) (b) of the EA. This was rejected by Wild J on the following grounds:

*   Accountants' advice is not privileged and is discoverable if it is relevant.
*   The clear legislative intent of Parliament is not to extend privilege to accounting advice.
*   Given the clear intent of Parliament it would be improper for the Court to exercise its discretion under section 69 of the EA to extend confidentiality to accountants' advice as an entire class of documents.
*   There was no evidence that the relationship between ANZ and its accountant tax advisors would be harmed unless confidentiality was ordered.
*   The proper evidential foundation was not laid for asserting confidentiality in relation to individual documents.
*   The ANZ did not comply with the High Court Rules in relation to its claims of confidentiality.

The PWC and KPMG tax advice documents were held to be relevant and not confidential under the EA. The Commissioner's application for discovery of the PWC and KPMG tax advice documents relating to the structured finance transactions was allowed.

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994, Income Tax Act 1994

### Summary

The plaintiffs challenged the Commissioner's assessments made following completion of the disputes process. The plaintiffs had treated the cash flows in their tax returns on the basis that refundable commissions were assessable income and commission repayments were deductible expenditure. The High Court confirmed the Commissioner's position that the commission arrangements were to be considered separately from other components of the money flows under the applicable treaties. As such, the commission arrangements constituted a financial arrangement for the purposes of the accrual rules. The accrual rules required the commission repayments to be spread over the relevant period with refundable commissions being netted off against the commission repayments, and only the sums attributable to the interest debited to the bonus account remained and could be deductible by the plaintiffs.

### Impact of decision

This judgment confirms that the financing of working capital under reinsurance treaties is to be dealt with under the accrual rules.

### Facts

This proceeding is concerned with the income tax implications for the 2000 to 2006 income years of certain agreements entered into between Sovereign Assurance Company Ltd (Sovereign) and three German reinsurance companies: Gerling, Cologne Re and Hanover.

As a new life company, Sovereign faced a number of risks. One risk was mortality risk (ie, an insurance policy either lapses or the policyholder dies within a short period of time from when the policy was taken out). Another risk was "new business strain"; as a new company Sovereign's up-front costs in issuing a policy exceeded the amount it initially made from that policy (due to Sovereign paying commissions to brokers and agents who sell policies to policyholders). To mitigate these risks, Sovereign entered into reinsurance agreements with the German reinsurers ("the treaties").

The treaties provided for two sets of money flows between Sovereign and the reinsurers (the two sets of money flows were interchangeably referred to in the judgment as "commission arrangements"; see \[101\]). First, Sovereign paid premiums to the reinsurers in return for the reinsurers accepting liability to meet the costs of policies ending early (ie, due to mortality). There is no dispute over the manner in which Sovereign accounted for the money flows in both directions on the reinsurance of those mortality risks.

The second money flow component of the treaties involved the reinsurers agreeing to pay Sovereign "refundable commissions" and Sovereign was obliged to repay the refundable commissions in stipulated portions out of subsequent years' premiums. The refundable commissions were used to cover the initial costs of establishing life insurance policies. It is this part of the treaties that was in dispute as to the correct tax treatment of the refundable commission payments and repayments.

### Decision

Dobson J held that the refundable commissions are to be considered separately from the other components of the money flows under the treaties and that those commission arrangements constitute a financial arrangement for the purposes of the accrual rules. By doing this, Dobson J distinguished this case from _Marac Life Assurance Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[1986\] 1 NZLR 694 (CA) as the accrual rules clearly contemplate that the money flows can be separately identifiable.

The refundable commissions' component of the treaties is not a contract of insurance so as to qualify as an excepted financial arrangement.

Once the accrual rules are applied to the additional component (representing the consideration for deferral of Sovereign's repayment of the amounts received as commissions), the base component of those money flows becomes irrelevant for income tax purposes. Accordingly, Sovereign's alternative contention that the commissions received and subsequent repayments should be added respectively to its assessable income and deductible expenses was also incorrect.

Dobson J also said that if he were wrong, then he finds for the Commissioner's alternative argument that the money flows were capital in nature.

Te whiwhi i ngā rawa whitirangi hei hoko atu, hei whakawhiti rānei Acquiring cryptoassets to sell or exchange
=============================================================================================================

If you [acquire](/api/glossary/item?id={E9741D36-72AB-47B3-AA68-C913AC526137})
 cryptoassets for the purpose of [disposing](/api/glossary/item?id={5F8EE1F7-ADFD-4857-B1F3-412208D7A359})
 of them you need to pay income tax on any profit you make. For example, if you buy or mine cryptoassets to sell or exchange them. If you make a loss when you sell your cryptoassets you may be able to claim this loss.

Why your purpose matters
------------------------

If your purpose for getting cryptoassets is to sell or exchange them, you’ll need to pay income tax when you do.

You may have more than one purpose for your cryptoassets at the time you acquire them. It is your main purpose that matters.

We look at your purpose at the time you acquire (for example, buy or mine) your cryptoassets. If that purpose changes later on, it does not matter.

If you plan on selling or exchanging your cryptoassets at some point in the future, then you have a purpose of disposal. It does not matter how long you plan to hold onto your cryptoassets for before selling or exchanging them. Your main purpose can still be to sell or exchange them, even if it takes a few years.

What you say your purpose is
----------------------------

What you say your purpose for getting cryptoassets is must be supported by what you actually do and the surrounding circumstances, including the:

*   nature of the asset (for example, does it provide an income stream or any other benefits while being held)
*   circumstances of the purchase
*   number of similar transactions
*   length of time you hold the asset
*   circumstances of the use and disposal of the asset.

Just saying why you got your cryptoassets is not enough. For example, you might say you got your cryptoassets as:

*   a long-term investment
*   a hedge against inflation
*   portfolio diversification
*   a store of value outside the monetary system.

These types of reasons usually still involve a purpose of eventually selling or exchanging your cryptoassets. There will be a purpose of disposal if sale or exchange is the way to achieve your goals.

Income streams from your cryptoassets
-------------------------------------

Sometimes you might earn an income from holding cryptoassets. For example, you might [stake](/api/glossary/item?id={04254A7C-6D31-495D-B22B-B45D668A6DEE})
 your cryptoassets or use a [staking-as-a-service](/api/glossary/item?id={34B12419-62AE-4A31-B6B1-CCC7D6D0A674})
 provider to earn more cryptoassets. Having an income stream is a factor to consider when thinking about your purpose.

### When you do not have an income stream

You may have cryptoassets that do not provide an income stream or any other benefits while you hold them.

This strongly suggests you acquired them for the purpose of selling or exchanging them. This is because the only benefit you get is when you sell or exchange those cryptoassets.

This is similar to our position on gold bullion.

[QB 17/08: Are proceeds from the sale of gold bullion income?](https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/questions-we-ve-been-asked/2017/qb1708-qb-1708-are-proceeds-from-the-sale-of-gold-bullion-income)

### When you have an income stream

You may have cryptoassets that provide an income stream or other benefits while you hold them (for example, from staking).

Just because there is an income stream does not mean that you did not acquire them for the main purpose of selling or exchanging them.

If you sell or exchange your cryptoassets for a profit and claim that you did not acquire them for the purpose of selling or exchanging them, you will need clear and compelling evidence to support your claim.

What to do next
---------------

If you acquired your cryptoassets for the purpose of disposal you need to work out your tax to pay or loss to claim. To claim a loss, you need to show that if you'd made a profit it would have been taxable.

You may still need to pay income tax even if you did not acquire your cryptoassets for the main purpose of disposing of them, such as if you’re carrying on a profit-making scheme.

[Taxing cryptoasset income](/cryptoassets/taxing)

Example - Sione speculates on the price of crypto

Sione heard about crypto B in late 2016 and decided to invest $2,000. Shortly afterwards as he saw the price going up, he invested an additional $3,000.

In late 2017 Sione sold his crypto B when he judged that the market had reached its peak.

Sione acquired crypto B for the purpose of disposal. His actions show he bought it to make a gain on sale. Crypto B did not provide Sione with an income stream or any other benefits. Sione will need to pay tax on his profits.

In June 2018 Sione decided to buy more crypto B. In December 2018, after a steep drop in the price, Sione decided to sell crypto B to minimise his losses.

Sione’s history of buying and selling crypto B, and the nature of crypto B, support the fact that Sione held crypto B for the purpose of disposal. In the same way Sione had to pay tax on his profits, Sione can claim a loss made on the sale of crypto B.

Example - Leena buys crypto as a long-term investment

Leena decided to invest $5,000 in crypto E as a long-term investment. She held it for 3 years during which time the market for crypto E went up and down. After 3 years when Leena judged that crypto E had realised its full potential, she sold it for a profit.

Crypto E did not provide an income stream or any other benefit to Leena. She simply held it with a purpose of one day making a gain on the sale. Calling it a long-term investment does not mean that Leena did not acquire crypto E for the purpose of disposal.

On the facts provided Leena acquired crypto E for the purpose of disposal and needs to pay tax on the profit she made from selling it.

Example - Chen changes his purpose for buying crypto

Chen bought crypto B as a speculative investment intending to sell it for a profit when the price went up.

Six months later an exchange he used offered users an opportunity to lend crypto B to the exchange and earn rewards (interest). Chen did this and received a small amount of reward income paid in crypto B. Two months later he sold all his crypto B for a profit.

It is Chen’s purpose at the time he acquired crypto B that matters. The fact that he decided to use his cryptoasset for lending does not change the fact that his purpose when he bought crypto B was to sell it.

Chen needs to pay tax on the reward income he received as well as on the profit he made from selling his crypto B. The reward income can be income for Chen twice. The reward income is taxable when it is received. Any profit made when it is sold is also income. To calculate the profit on the sale, the cost is the income amount when the reward was received.

How you can prove what your purpose is
--------------------------------------

If you expect that you are likely to earn more money from selling your cryptoassets than from any passive income you might receive, your dominant purpose will most likely be acquiring cryptoassets for disposal.

If your dominant purpose is not to dispose of the cryptoassets, you will need to be able to show this.  There are several factors to consider when working out what your dominant purpose is.  The types of factors that will be considered include:

*   what you say your purpose was at the time you acquired the cryptoassets
*   the type of cryptoassets you bought. For example, why did you choose the particular cryptoassets and how easy is it to derive passive income from them
*   what research did you do before you purchased your cryptoassets.  For example, did you:  
    *   do an analysis of the potential passive income you expect to receive compared to gains on sale
    *   forecast a potential return from holding the cryptoassets
    *   review your holdings and passive income return. 
*   what is your return from passive income compared to your gains on disposal
*   how long did you hold your cryptoassets for, compared to how long you used your cryptoassets for passive income  
    how many purchases and sales were you making,when you did sell your cryptoassets and what were the reasons for this.

Example - Pete earns passive income but plans to sell at a high price

Pete heard about crypto C which could be staked to earn passive income on a centralised exchange while it was owned. After doing a couple of hours of research on the internet, Pete found that the staking process was easy as the exchange did everything for him, and he could earn up to 8% per year. It was much higher than what he could get from leaving his money in a term deposit at the bank. Pete also found out that crypto C had gained in value by 150% over the last year. Pete thought that staking was a good way to increase his earnings until he could time the market and sell his crypto C when prices were at a high. 

Pete invested $5,000 into crypto C. He kept his crypto C staked for $250 worth of crypto C in staking rewards. At that time, the price of crypto C had increased to a point where Pete felt it had reached its peak. Pete sold all his crypto C (including the staking rewards) for $12,500.  

Pete purchased crypto C for the dominant purpose of disposal. While he wanted to earn staking rewards, he also planned to sell crypto C when the price was at its peak. That was his dominant purpose, as shown by his actions. 

Pete is required to pay tax on the receipt of the staking rewards and also on the profit from selling all his crypto C, including sales of the rewards. Pete will be able to deduct the initial cost of his crypto C, including the value of the staking rewards that Pete initially paid tax on.   

Example - Selina stakes a stablecoin

Selina has been involved in buying, staking and selling cryptoassets for a few years and had made some good profits (and the occasional large loss). Selina was researching how to stabilise her portfolio to try and earn a steady income stream without worrying too much about another market crash. Her research led her to crypto U, a stablecoin that paid a decent passive income return of 12% when staked on a particular platform. Crypto U was pegged to the $USD so she would be protected from some of the heavy losses that she previously suffered. 

Selina did some calculations and looked up crypto U’s price history, as well as considering the returns from other similar stablecoins. Selina wished to create a stable return that she could use to buy more cryptoassets without having to sell any of her initial investment and without worrying about volatility.

Selina purchased $20,000 of crypto U and earned $3,600 from staking it over three years continuously. Selina had to sell all her crypto U to pay an unexpected bill. She sold the initial crypto U and the rewards for $24,000.  

Selina had acquired crypto U to earn steady passive income. She was required to include the passive income in her tax return when she earned it and also when she disposed of it (as she had intended to use the staking rewards to buy more cryptoassets). However, as Selina purchased the initial crypto U for the dominant purpose of earning passive income, she did not have to include the profit that related to that initial crypto U in her tax return.

[Taxation (International Investment and Remedial Matters) Act 2012](/new-legislation/act-articles/taxation-international-investment-and-remedial-matters-act-2012 "Taxation (International Investment and Remedial Matters) Act 2012")

Active business test - clarifications and remedial amendments
=============================================================

This 2012 Act amends the meaning of passive income and total income used in the active business test for controlled foreign companies.

The Act amends the meaning of passive income and total income used in the active business test for controlled foreign companies. This will make it easier to pass the active business test that is based on accounting data.

The Act also clarifies that, when the active business test is applied to a group of CFCs, a CFC may not be included in more than one group.

#### Application date

The amendment applies to income years beginning on or after 1 July 2009. This amendment is retrospective so that affected taxpayers can benefit from the policy from the inception of the international tax rules, consistent with the original intent.

#### Key features

The Act proposes changes to ensure that:

*   Rental income may be included in the measure of reported income in section EX 21E (which contains the active business test using accounting data).
*   Income from financial arrangements that is received from a non-attributing active CFC may be excluded from the measure of passive income in section EX 21E.
*   Income from some financial assets that are in the nature of accounts receivable may be excluded from the measure of passive income in section EX 21E.
*   A CFC that is part of a "test group" for the purposes of the active business test under sections EX 21D or EX 21E cannot be part of another test group and cannot apply the test as an individual CFC.

The first three proposed changes fix unintended omissions. The final change is for clarification only, and does not - in our view - result in the effect of the law changing.

#### Detailed analysis

The active business test is used when a New Zealand resident has an income interest in  
a foreign company. If the foreign company passes the active business test, the New  
Zealander may ignore the current income of the foreign company for tax purposes.

There are two forms of the test, one using accounting data and one using the usual provisions of the Income Tax Act for calculating income. In concept, both are similar - they measure the amount of passive income of the foreign company as a proportion of total (gross) income, and deem the company to be an active business if the proportion is less than 5%.

Passive income is exhaustively defined. For example, it explicitly includes rental income and interest income. However, there are numerous exceptions which allow a person to remove items if they wish. Total income is also defined.

It is possible for companies in the same country (in the case of some interests in foreign investment funds, companies in any country) to undertake the test as a group, using consolidated accounts. This may reduce compliance costs and also simplifies the treatment of holding companies or other companies with non-operational functions within the group.

#### _Remedial changes_

_Paragraph EX 21E(10)(ab)_

Reported revenue in section EX 21E(10) is the measure of total income for the purposes of the active business test using accounting concepts. Reported revenue includes "revenue" if IFRS is used, a term which is defined by International Accounting Standard 18. Lease income is generally excluded from the definition of "revenue" under that standard. Lease income is brought in under another item that is part of reported revenue, but only if it is income other than rent from finance or operating leases.

This means that rental income may not be able to be included in the measure of total income. This is not intended, and this Act contains an amendment to the definition of reported revenue so that rent may be included.

_Paragraph EX 21E(9)(cb)_

Reported passive in section EX 21E(7) is the measure of passive income that is used in the active business test using accounting concepts. One component of reported passive is income or loss from a financial asset, other than a derivative or a share on capital account. Accounts receivable can be financial assets. This means that gains or losses on accounts receivable - for example, due to exchange rate fluctuations - may be included in the measure of passive income. However, accounts receivable may relate to active businesses so including them is not necessarily appropriate.

Reported passive income also includes interest received from associated non-attributing CFCs.

Such interest may not be ignored even though other forms of passive income from such CFCs can be (see paragraphs EX 21E(9)(a) to (c)).

The Act changes the measure of passive income to address these problems. The change allows gains or losses on financial assets (including interest income) to be excluded from the measure of passive income if:

*   they are included in the measure to begin with (see the existing provision at the beginning of subsection EX 21E(9)); and
*   they could be excluded under the active business test that uses tax rules (see subsection EX 20B(12), but subject to the modification described below).

This allows the exclusion of amounts that are, broadly speaking, payments from related active entities and gains or losses relating to accounts receivable.

The exclusions in subsection EX 20B(12) are exclusions from financial arrangement income. The subsection does not apply to financial arrangement expenditure.

However, in the context of section EX 21E, it would be inappropriate not to exclude expenditure if income was being excluded; section EX 21E refers to gains _or losses_ from financial assets. Therefore, paragraph EX 21E(9)(cb) refers to any gain or loss on a financial asset that is a financial arrangement or agreement referred to in subsection EX 20B(12), whether or not it actually generates income under that subsection. That is, a person may exclude gains under paragraph EX 21E(9)(cb), but only if they also exclude similar losses.

#### _Clarification - test groups_

_Subsection EX 21B(4)_

Subsections EX 21D(1) and EX 21E(2) each define a "test group" for the purposes of the active business test.

Subsection EX 21B(4) clarifies that a CFC may not be part of more than one test group, and may not apply the test on an individual basis if it is part of a test group.

[Research & development](/new-legislation/act-articles/research-development "Research & development")

Activities excluded from SIE activities (Schedule 21, Part C)
=============================================================

2007 list of activities excluded from being SIE (systematic, investigative, and experimental) activities in the Research and Development definition.

Certain activities are routinely excluded from R&D tax incentives. This can be because governments do not wish to incentivise a particular activity through an R&D tax concession, to remove uncertainty over whether a particular activity could be considered R&D, to clarify the boundary between development and post-development activity or innovative and routine work.

The activities listed below are excluded from being SIE activities in paragraph (a) of the R&D definition:

*   prospecting, exploring or drilling for minerals, petroleum, natural gas or geothermal reserves;
*   research in social sciences, arts or humanities;
*   market research, market testing or market development, or sales promotion (including consumer surveys);
*   quality control or routine testing of materials, products, devices, processes or services;
*   the making of cosmetic or stylistic changes to materials, products, devices, processes or services;
*   routine collection of information;
*   commercial, legal and administrative aspects of patenting, licensing or other activities;
*   activities involved in complying with statutory requirements or standards;
*   management studies or efficiency surveys;
*   the reproduction of a commercial product or process by a physical examination of an existing system or from plans, blueprints, detailed specifications or publicly available information; and
*   pre-production activities, such as demonstration of commercial viability, tooling-up and trial runs.

The exclusions are similar to those in Australia. As in Australia, these activities are excluded from being SIE activities only - they may still be support activities within paragraph (b) of the definition. For example, routine data collection will not be eligible as a SIE activity but can qualify as a support activity.

**Prospecting, exploring or drilling for minerals, petroleum, natural gas or geothermal energy (clause 1)**

It is possible to have R&D in extractive industries - for example, R&D to develop new exploration techniques, but the exploration itself is not R&D. Drilling can be a supporting activity if it is wholly or mainly for the purpose of, required for and integral to the development of a new exploration technique or new equipment - for example, testing new drilling equipment.

**Research in social sciences, arts or humanities (clause 2)**

Research in these disciplines is excluded in each of the jurisdictions considered in the development of the R&D definition. The focus of R&D tax incentives is on extending business scientific and technological know-how rather than promoting research in these areas which are funded by other means.

The exclusion covers, for example, research in economics, classics, languages, literature, music, philosophy, history, religion, and visual and performing arts. Examples of activities excluded would be the study of the historical development of a language or the role of the family in society, or writing a novel or screenplay.

If a business is developing an innovative product and the development process satisfies the definition in section LH 7, the development is not excluded simply because the product is used in the arts or humanities. For example, if a business develops computer software for use in the film industry in a process that satisfies the criteria in the definition, the software development is not excluded under this paragraph. Similarly, if a business develops and manufactures innovative ceramic glazes, the development is not excluded under this paragraph because glazes are used in the visual arts.

As with the other exclusions, this research is excluded from being a SIE activity only. When research in these fields is required for development of a new product or process, the research can be an eligible support activity. For example, if research into human behaviour is required for the development of an innovative product, the research can be an eligible R&D support activity.

**Market research, market testing or market development, or sales promotion (including consumer surveys) (clause 3**)

Conducting of market research is excluded. However, it can be a supporting activity if the research is wholly or mainly for the purpose of, required for and integral to development of, a product or process.

##### Example

ACo is developing a new can opener for use by people with arthritic hands. It has two options for handle design and selects a group to test both trial models to determine which handle is more easily manipulated. This market testing is eligible as a support activity.

**Quality control or routine testing of materials, products, devices, processes or services (clause 4)**

Quality control in itself is excluded as a SIE activity. However, the development of new or improved methods of quality control testing can be eligible R&D. Quality control may also be a supporting activity - for example, in the development of a new manufacturing process, checking that the products in a trial run meet the desired quality.

**Making cosmetic or stylistic changes to materials, products, devices, processes or services (clause 5)**

Changes that are purely cosmetic or stylistic (such as changes to colour or pattern) are excluded from being a SIE activity. For example, this would include design changes for fabrics and wallpapers.

However, work to create a desired cosmetic or aesthetic effect through the application of science or technology can advance the science or technology and be R&D.

Cosmetic or stylistic changes that meet the requirements in paragraph (b) of the R&D definition can also be a supporting activity. For example, if a firm is improving a product it manufactures in a way that falls within the definition of a SIE activity, work on required associated stylistic changes can be eligible R&D.

**Commercial, legal and administrative aspects of patenting, licensing or other activities (clause 7)**

This is post-R&D work which is very unlikely, even in the absence of the exclusion, to qualify as a SIE activity. It is also unlikely to be a supporting activity because patenting or licensing would seldom be wholly or mainly for the purpose of, or required for, a SIE activity.

**Activities involved in complying with statutory requirements or standards (clause 8)**

This exclusion targets routine testing and analysis of materials, products and processes to check that they comply with statutory requirements or standards. It does not apply to development of new technologies to comply with standards. Activities involved in developing, rather than complying with, standards is also not excluded. Checking that new products meet relevant standards can be an eligible R&D support activity.

**Management studies or efficiency surveys (clause 9)**

This includes studies relating to inventory control (such as Just-in-Time), work practices, industrial relations and feasibility analysis, and time and motion studies. The exclusion also covers industry research - for example, when a company carries out a survey into a particular industry's characteristics and future needs.

These studies or surveys can be a supporting activity. For example, if a manufacturer's improvement to a process is R&D, a monitored test to determine how efficient the new process is would be eligible as a supporting activity.

**The reproduction of a commercial product or process by a physical examination of an existing system or from plans, blueprints, detailed specifications or publicly available information (clause 10)**

No R&D is involved in simply reproducing an existing product or process from the plans or publicly available information. As a result, this is excluded as a SIE activity.

**Pre-production activities, such as demonstration of commercial viability, tooling-up and trial runs (clause 11)**

This paragraph is intended to clarify the boundary between R&D and post-R&D pre-production activities. Activities either satisfy the definition of SIE activities in paragraph (a) of the R&D definition or fall within the exclusion. If activities that satisfy the definition of R&D in paragraph (a) arise during a pre-production process, they will be eligible regardless of the exclusion. However, most pre-production activity is unlikely to be eligible as SIE R&D.

Trial runs could be eligible as a qualifying supporting activity, as could tooling up (for example, to test a new manufacturing process). It is unlikely that demonstration of commercial viability satisfies the test to be a supporting activity.

Te tikanga utu tūturu mō te tātai moni whiwhi me ngā utunga rēti Actual cost method for working out rental income and expenses
==============================================================================================================================

You must pay tax on your rental income. This could be from renting out a house, land, caravan, sleep-out, building, holiday home or room in your own home.   
  
Under the regular tax rules, you deduct allowable rental expenses from the [gross rental income](/api/glossary/item?id={675F39E7-69B6-4841-BAC7-F43CE3A12248})
. What's left is your taxable rental income. This is the actual cost method.

Check if you use the actual cost method for your rental property
----------------------------------------------------------------

The actual cost method might not apply to your rental property. If you're not sure, check what to do for your type of property:

[Tax by rental property type](/property/renting-out-residential-property/tax-by-rental-property-type)
 

How to apply the actual cost method
-----------------------------------

When you're using the actual cost method, you need your:

*   gross rental income
*   allowable rental expenses.

### Gross rental income

Gross rental income includes:

*   rental payments from tenants, for example $400 per week (this is the rental payment before you've deducted any management fees)
*   rental payments from short-term guests, for example $165 per night (this is the rental per night before you've deducted service fees)
*   fees paid to agencies like Airbnb and property management companies
*   payments from the Tenancy Board for damages or rent arrears
*   depreciation recovered.

### Allowable rental expenses

Your allowable rental expenses are those you've spent to earn rental income.

Under the actual cost method, you can deduct your allowable rental expenses from your gross rental income. Not all expenses are deductible. They can be:

*   fully deductible from your rental income if you've spent them for income-earning use
*   non-deductible if they're spent on private use
*   apportioned or split for [shared rental expenses](/api/glossary/item?id={9A548C14-508C-4A7C-AE44-4F85BA8EFC6D})
    . You'll be able to deduct some of these from your gross rental income.

You can generally claim the expenses for the time you rented out your property and it was available to rent, if your property is one of the following types.

*   100% an investment property.
*   A mixed-use asset that is not under the mixed-use asset rules.
*   A property, or part of it, used for short-term or long-term accommodation also used privately (as long as you can provide evidence it was not used privately when it was available to be rented).

You can only claim the expenses for the time you rented out the property, or part of it, if it is not one of the above types.

You cannot claim the expenses for the time you stay in the property. For example, you live in the property for 3 months of the year and rent it out for 9 months. In this case, you'll only claim the fully deductible and shared rental expenses for those 9 months.

If you have boarders, home-stay students or flatmates, you can only claim expenses for the time the room is rented.

[Rental property expenses](/property/renting-out-residential-property/residential-rental-income-and-paying-tax-on-it/rental-expense-deductions)

Working out your expenses using the actual cost method

When you're using the actual cost method, you'll deduct allowable rental expenses from your gross rental income. After the deduction you're left with taxable rental income.

Sometimes your allowable rental expenses are more than your gross rental income. When this happens, you're left with excess deductions. You cannot use the excess deductions against your other income, for example salary and wages. You may have to carry these into the next tax year and deduct them when you earn [residential income](/api/glossary/item?id={639854D6-6590-446F-8E92-123587082168})

### Shared rental expenses

When you have shared rental expenses you can only partly deduct them from your gross rental income. It's because they're not all for income-earning use. 

You work out what you're allowed to deduct by [](/sitecore/service/notfound.aspx?item=web%3a%7b0DAE69CA-3BF2-425C-9404-DC36BFD992C5%7d%40en)
splitting them between private and income-earning use. We call this apportionment. How you work it out depends on how you're using your property.

1 Information reporting for the sharing economy For online marketplaces (also known as digital platforms) AD279 New Zealand online marketplaces must provide Inland Revenue with information about sellers and the income they earn from relevant services on their platform. Find out what you need to do. New Zealand is implementing the sharing and gig economy information and exchange framework developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD). These rules apply from 1 January 2024. Who is affected The rules affect: yonline marketplaces that connect buyers with sellers of relevant services ysellers on online marketplaces that get income from relevant services. The rules apply to all online marketplaces that are New Zealand tax residents. Reportable sellers A reportable seller is someone who registers with an online marketplace to offer relevant services. They do not have to be actively selling on the online marketplace. Sellers may be individuals (sole traders) or entities (organisations). The rules apply to domestic and non-resident sellers. Active sellers Active sellers provide relevant services during 1 January to 31 December in any year, or they receive income from relevant services in that time. Excluded sellers Some providers of relevant services will be excluded from the reporting requirements. These include: yGovernment entities ybusinesses that have listed more than 2,000 nights of accommodation per property listing, in a 12-month period ya listed company selling on the online marketplace. Online marketplaces can use their own records or publicly available information to determine whether a seller is an excluded seller. Alternatively, an online marketplace can get a declaration from the seller stating they fall into the above categories. Relevant services A relevant service is: ythe rental of immovable property (including commercial and residential), such as carparks, short-stay and visitor accommodation ypersonal services such as ride-sharing, food and beverage delivery, and graphic and web design services. Advertising a property is available to rent and the sale of goods are not relevant services. Personal services A personal service is a service involving time- or task-based work performed by one or more individuals at the request of a buyer. A personal service must be adapted to the requirements of the buyer who has requested it. A service that cannot be adapted to the specific time or content requirements of a buyer is not a personal service for these rules. The seller is a tour guide who delivers a tour with a set itinerary. While the tour guide might adapt his content slightly as the tour progresses based on how the customers interact, it is still broadly the same content and delivered in a generally uniform manner. Any deviations in the delivery of the tour are supplementary to the generally uniform service and, therefore it is not considered a personal service. Example - Non-personalised guided tour 2 The seller is an artist who sells artwork to buyers via a platform. Buyers can commission exclusive artwork. The creation and sale of these is considered to be the provision of a personal service as the artwork is created on request for a fee. Example – Commissioned art A personal service does not include a service provided as part of an employment relationship with the online marketplace or a related entity of the online marketplace. You may presume that any time- or task-based service facilitated through your platform is a personal service. This may be rebutted by establishing that the services cannot be adapted to the specific time or content requirements for buyers. Consideration Consideration is compensation in any form that is paid or credited to a seller in connection with relevant services, the amount of which is known or reasonably knowable by the online marketplace. Consideration includes money, crypto assets, payments in kind, tips, gratuities, and goods or services provided to a seller. Where consideration is paid or credited to a seller in any form other than a fiat currency, it should be reported in NZ dollars. Information to collect and report Online marketplaces must collect and report information about reportable sellers and themselves. Seller information For each reportable seller, the online marketplace must report the following details. Sellers who are individuals: yfirst name and last name yprimary address yjurisdiction(s) the seller is resident ytax identification number (TIN) issued to them, for example an IRD number for New Zealand tax residents and the jurisdiction that issued it ydate of birth. Sellers who are entities: ylegal name yprimary address yjurisdiction(s) the seller is resident yTIN issued to them and the jurisdiction that issued it ybusiness registration number, for example an NZBN for New Zealand companies. The online marketplace is expected to collect information from sellers that it does not already hold. Immovable property information For both types of sellers (individuals and entities), online marketplaces must report the following information for each immovable property that is used as a relevant service: yaddress of each property listing yland registration number (if known) ynumber of days each property listing was rented during the calendar year ythe type of each property listing (for example apartment, parking space), where available. All immovable property units located at the same street address and offered for rent by the same seller should be treated as a single property listing for reporting. The number of days each sub-unit was rented should be combined to determine the number of days each property listing was rented during the reportable period. Activities and consideration Online marketplaces must report on the following for each reportable seller and immovable property: ytotal consideration paid or credited ynumber of relevant activities carried out to which that consideration relates yfees, commissions or taxes withheld or charged yfinancial account identifier (where available) yname of the holder of the financial account where consideration is paid or credited. This information must be reported for each quarter of the calendar year. The person receiving the benefit of the service does not have to be the one providing the consideration for the service to be reportable. Platform A is a platform that connects sellers of cleaning services to customers. Platform A provides customers with two hours of free cleaning when they initially sign up to the platform. Platform A compensates the seller of the cleaning service for these two hours cleaning. As the seller is receiving consideration for the service, the service they are providing is reportable. Example - Reportable consideration The concept of consideration and whether that consideration is ‘reasonably knowable’ determines if a business is or is not within the scope of the reporting rules. The key determinants are whether the online marketplace has knowledge that a relevant service has been carried out and if it was for a consideration which is knowable or reasonably knowable to the online marketplace. 3 If multiple parties are jointly registered as sellers, the total consideration should be reported for each seller. If the online marketplace can reliably determine the amount attributable to each seller, only their amount should be reported. Platform B hosts third party advertising. Sellers can list relevant services and their contact details. A prospective buyer cannot contact a seller through Platform B directly. Neither the contract for sale nor the payment of consideration are concluded through Platform B. Platform B exclusively allows sellers to list or advertise a relevant activity. Therefore, Platform B is not within the definition of a ‘platform’. Example – Consideration not reasonably knowable Platform C hosts third party advertising. Sellers can list relevant services, their contact details, and the consideration payable on Platform C. Platform C facilitates the contract between the buyer and the seller through its platform along with the payment of the consideration for the relevant service. Platform C’s software knows when a relevant service is carried out and the consideration is known (or reasonably knowable). Platform C is therefore within the definition of a ‘platform’. Example – Consideration is reasonably knowable Sales of goods and personal services in a single transaction If a transaction involves both the sale of goods and the provision of a personal service and both can be identified separately, then the personal service component should be reported. Where they cannot be separately identified, then the entire transaction should be reported, unless the personal service component is purely ancillary to the non-reportable element. Reporting to sellers Provide sellers with a copy of the information reported about them by 7 February. Platform information Online marketplaces must report the following information about themselves: ytheir name ytheir registered office address ytheir IRD number ybusiness name for each platform. Completing reporting obligations for another online marketplace An online marketplace can report seller information on behalf of another online marketplace. In this case, the New Zealand based online marketplace will need to report information identifying the other online marketplace. Keep proof that the required information has been reported. How to report the information Online marketplaces with income reporting obligations will need to register for a Digital Platform Information (DPI) account with us. You can register for a DPI account in myIR from 29 October 2024. If you do not have a myIR account already, you must register for one at ird.govt.nz/myIR Format and frequency Online marketplaces must report: yannually for each year ending 31 December yinformation shown in quarterly periods yon or before 7 February yusing the OECD model rules XML Schema. Reporting methods Online marketplaces will be able to report using either: yXML file upload yExcel template – limited to 1,000 sellers. Make sure you use the latest version provided in myIR. You can correct reported information using the same methods. Due diligence requirements Online marketplaces are responsible for ensuring the information reported is valid. You can choose to complete due diligence procedures for active sellers only. Accurate seller information Determine if the information collected from the seller is reliable. To confirm the information is correct, you should use the information you already have available and any public information. Seller’s residency Online marketplaces should use the seller’s primary address to confirm which country or jurisdiction they are resident in. If a seller updates their primary address during the calendar year, the new address should be used for reporting purposes. A seller should also be considered a resident for the country or jurisdiction that issued their TIN. Where the primary address and the jurisdiction that issued their TIN are different, they should be reported for both. 4 Timeframes for due diligence procedures Online marketplaces must complete due diligence responsibilities for new sellers by 31 December of a reportable period. For sellers that are already registered on a marketplace as of 1 January 2024, the due diligence procedures must be completed by 31 December 2025. If you already have the required information, provide this by 7 February 2025. You may rely on the due diligence procedures conducted in previous reportable periods if: ythe seller’s primary address has been either collected and verified or confirmed within the last 36 months, and yyou have no reason to believe the information is unreliable or incorrect. Third party due diligence If you use a third-party service provider or another online marketplace to fulfil the due diligence requirements, you remain responsible for the due diligence obligations. Keeping records Online marketplaces must keep records showing the steps they have taken to collect the information and the information relied upon. These records must be kept in New Zealand and in English or te reo Māori. The only exception is if we have approved their storage outside New Zealand or in a different language. You must keep this information for at least 7 years following the end of the reportable period. Penalties Penalties can apply if online marketplaces do not comply with their due diligence (including record keeping) and reporting obligations. An online marketplace may be liable for a penalty of $300 for each occasion that they do not meet the requirements that are set out in the reporting rules, unless the failure is due to circumstances outside their control. This is capped at a maximum of $10,000 per reportable period. Where an online marketplace does not take reasonable care to meet a requirement and a $300 penalty has not been applied, we can assess penalties payable for each occasion. On the first occasion, a penalty of $20,000 can apply. On subsequent occasions, a penalty of $40,000 can apply. The maximum amount for a reportable period is $100,000.

No liability is accepted by Statistics New Zealand or Inland Revenue for any use or interpretation of this information. 2AD164 Table of contents Introduction .........................................................................................................................................................................................................................3 Data ..........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................3 Source ...............................................................................................................................................................................................................................3 Regions .............................................................................................................................................................................................................................3 Household compositions .......................................................................................................................................................................................3 Household expenditure ..........................................................................................................................................................................................4 Things to take into account ..................................................................................................................................................................................6 Using the tables ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................6 Urban Auckland ..........................................................................................................................................................................................................7 Urban Waikato/Bay of Plenty ..............................................................................................................................................................................8 Urban Wellington.......................................................................................................................................................................................................9 Rest of urban North Island .................................................................................................................................................................................10 Urban South Island .................................................................................................................................................................................................11 Rural ................................................................................................................................................................................................................................12 No liability is accepted by Statistics New Zealand or Inland Revenue for any use or interpretation of this information. 3AD164 Introduction This is a guide to some of the categories of living costs of NZ households. It is a basis for Inland Revenue to use as a first step in determining an individual debtor’s non-discretionary household expenditure when collecting debt. The information can be used to compare a person’s household expenditure to an average expenditure for similar households in the same region. Data Source This guide is based on data obtained from the Household Economic Survey 2023 administered by Statistics New Zealand, adjusted for inflation. The Household Economic Survey gathers information from approximately 3,000 NZ households about their weekly household operating expenditure. In conducting the Household Economic Survey every effort was made to obtain a sample that is representative of NZ households. However, there will always be households whose expenditure varies from the figures in this guide. The tables in this guide provide data broken down by region and household composition. For the purposes of the Household Economic Survey, a household comprises a group of people who share a private dwelling and normally spend four or more nights a week in the household. They must share consumption of food or contribute some portion of income towards the provision of essentials for living as a group. Regions Two types of regions are listed in this guide - urban and rural. Urban – Towns with populations over 10,000 people, broken down into 5 sub-regions: yAuckland yWaikato and Bay of Plenty yWellington yrest of the North Island (ie Northland, Gisborne, Hawke’s Bay, Taranaki and Manawatu-Whanganui) ySouth Island. These include all main and secondary urban areas in the region. Rural – Towns (all rural or minor urban areas) with a population of less than 10,000 covering all areas of NZ. Household compositions The household compositions used in this guide are: ycouple only ycouple with 1 dependent child ycouple with 2 dependent children ycouple with 3 or more dependent children y1 parent with dependent child(ren) y1 person. For these purposes, a dependent child is younger than 18 years of age and is not employed full-time. No liability is accepted by Statistics New Zealand or Inland Revenue for any use or interpretation of this information. 4AD164 Household expenditure Household expenditure is divided into 16 categories. 1. Food & groceries Including: yfruit and vegetables ymeat, poultry and fish ygrocery food ynon-alcoholic beverages yrestaurant meals and takeaways yhousehold supplies such as cleaning products ytoiletries and personal care products Excluding: yalcohol ytobacco yillicit drugs 2. Rent Including: yproperty rent, payments connected with renting ybond payments yeducational accommodation 3. Mortgage Including: ymortgage principal repayments ymortgage interest payments 4. Passenger transport Including: yurban train and ferry fares ytaxis yshort distance bus fares ycable-car fares, tram fares 5. Gas/electricity Including: yelectricity and gas ysolid fuels (ie coal, firewood) yliquid fuels yservice connections 6. Telephone/mobile/internet services Including: ytelecommunication services y cellphone, telephone, internet and toll call charges Excluding: ytelecommunication equipment 7. Clothing & footwear Including: yall clothing and footwear y clothing and footwear supplies and services (such as repairs, alterations and drycleaning) 8. Rates Including: y local and regional authorities rates and payments ywater supply, rates and charges yrefuse disposal and recycling 9.

Insurance other and combinations Including: ycombinations of insurance y insurance on bicycles, BMX bikes, mountain bikes ymortgage repayment insurance yincome protection insurance. No liability is accepted by Statistics New Zealand or Inland Revenue for any use or interpretation of this information. 6AD164 Things to take into account This is a guide only. The following should be considered: 1. Household Economic Survey data are not collected based on ethnicity. Ethnicity may affect expenditure in different categories eg some ethnic groups may send part of their income to relatives overseas. 2. Expenditure does not necessarily rise with increasing household size. 3. Households are diverse and have differing characteristics and expenditure priorities. These include family size, age of adults and children, income earned, occupation, etc. For example, households with no children may spend more money on ‘eating out’ than young families who may be reliant on a single income. 4. Household income is not a factor in collecting and collating data. 5. The Household Economic Survey was designed to produce national estimates. In this guide where data have been broken down into regions, the sampling error of the data will increase. This reduces certainty that the sample accurately reflects the regional population. 6. Within regions expenditure patterns will not be uniform. 7. Factors influencing a household's expenditure or income include household size, household composition, geographic location, and employment-related factors. 8. Where insufficient expenditure data were collected, Statistics NZ has imputed (estimated) the amounts. These are marked with an asterisk (\*). Using the tables To compare your household’s weekly spending to the amounts in the following tables, follow these steps: 1. Gather details of your household weekly spending, including GST. 2. Categorise your household’s weekly expenditure into the 16 categories described on pages 4 and 5. 3. Select the table for the region where you live from pages 7 to 12. 4. Select the household within the table that matches yours. 5. Compare your weekly spending with that shown in the table. The expenditure amounts are: yweekly average expenditure for reporting households only yrounded to the nearest 10 cents yinclusive of goods and services tax (GST) and excise duties. No liability is accepted by Statistics New Zealand or Inland Revenue for any use or interpretation of this information. 7 ird.govt.nz Category Average weekly household expenditure ($) Couple only Couple with 1 dependent child Couple with 2 dependent children Couple with 3 or more dependent children 1 parent with dependent child(ren) 1 person 1.

01 What is a low-value good? A low-value good is a physical good valued at NZ$1,000 or less each, such as clothing, cosmetics, sports equipment and shoes. This means transport and insurance costs are excluded when determining if GST needs to be charged. Goods imported into New Zealand valued over NZ$1,000 each (high-value goods) and all tobacco products and alcoholic beverages will continue to have GST and customs duties applied at the border. Who is a consumer? A consumer for these rules is a person who buys low-value goods that are delivered to New Zealand and: • is not registered for New Zealand GST; or • is registered for GST and uses the low-value goods wholly for personal use. Who is affected? These changes apply to: • merchants that sell directly to New Zealand consumers either online, by phone or mail order • online marketplaces through which merchants sell goods and services • redeliverers that offer mailbox redelivery and personal shopping services from other countries. There are rules for working out which of these businesses is treated as the supplier of the goods. If a business is treated as the supplier and its total supplies exceed or are likely to exceed NZ$60,000 in a 12-month period, then it must register for, collect and return New Zealand GST. When determining if you meet the NZ$60,000 registration threshold, do not include supplies to New Zealand GST-registered businesses. Who charges GST? Only one entity is required to collect GST on the value of the good. The order of priority is: • if an online marketplace is responsible for GST on a sale, the merchant will not be responsible for GST • if an online marketplace or the merchant is responsible for GST on a sale, a redeliverer will not be responsible for GST. How much GST should I charge? The New Zealand GST rate is 15%. GST is generally charged on all amounts paid by the consumer. Charge GST on: • low-value goods • transport and insurance for the good leaving its country of export and being delivered in New Zealand • remote services (such as legal and accounting advice) and digital products (such as e-books, streamed movies and music) • any other amounts paid by the consumer including any fees. Exceptions You won’t charge GST on: • supplies of fine metal • alcohol and tobacco products. Fine metal is exempt from GST. Alcohol and tobacco products (regardless of value) are subject to excise taxes and GST at the border. These rules haven’t changed. Goods sold to a New Zealand GST-registered business (for use in their business) are also generally excluded. They must provide you with their GST number or New Zealand Business Number (NZBN) or advise you that they are GST-registered. Even if you don’t charge GST because of one of these exceptions, you must still include certain information on customs documents if you are registered for GST. From 1 December 2019, overseas businesses that sell low-value goods to consumers in New Zealand may need to register for, collect and return goods and services tax (GST). Find out if this affects you. Selling goods to consumers in New Zealand? Information for suppliers. 02 High-value goods Goods imported into New Zealand valued over NZ$1,000 each (high-value goods) will have GST charged at the border. However, you have the option to charge GST on these goods at the point of sale if: • 75% or more of the total value of the goods supplied to customers in New Zealand consists of goods individually valued at NZ$1,000 or less, or • the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has given you approval to do this. Sales of multiple items If you sell multiple low-value goods in a single transaction, collect GST on each low-value good even when the total value of the sale or transaction is over NZ$1,000. If you sell low-value goods and high-value goods in a single transaction, collect GST on each low-value good. High-value goods will be taxed at the border as they come into New Zealand. Customs processes will make sure GST is not collected on any goods in a consignment that have already been taxed at the point of sale. Sales to New Zealand GST-registered businesses These sales are excluded but in limited circumstances, overseas suppliers can choose to collect and return GST on these sales if: • the value of the supply is NZ$1,000 or less, and • in the 12 months after the sale the supplier expects that more than 50% of all its sales to New Zealand customers will be made to non-GST registered customers. If GST is incorrectly charged to a GST-registered business in New Zealand, the overseas supplier that sold the goods can either: • provide a refund, or • if the value of the supply is NZ$1,000 or less (excluding GST) they can issue a tax invoice which the recipient can use to claim a GST deduction. More for merchants If you sell through an online marketplace, the marketplace operator will generally be responsible for collecting GST. Don’t include those sales when determining if you meet the NZ$60,000 registration threshold. An online marketplace is a service that allows you to make goods available to consumers for sale. It delivers the service through electronic communication such as a website or an app. A service is not an online marketplace if it only provides advertising to make consumers aware of products and links them to your website to make a purchase. You will be responsible for the GST on these sales. If you sell directly to consumers, check the value of these sales to New Zealanders to see if you need to register for New Zealand GST in your own right. When determining if you meet the NZ$60,000 registration threshold, you will need to include: • low-value goods sold directly to consumers in New Zealand through your website, by phone or mail order • amounts paid by the consumer for services such as delivery and insurance • any other sales that GST applies to, such as online services or digital products sold to New Zealand consumers. Overseas businesses are already required to collect and return GST on online services and digital products bought by New Zealand consumers from overseas. When you are registered for GST, you will also need to ensure certain information is provided to customers and included on customs documents. If you refund a consumer for goods that are returned, you should refund any GST you collected on the goods. If you have done this and you have already paid the GST to Inland Revenue, you can reduce the GST payable in your next GST return. More for online marketplaces If you operate an online marketplace through which merchants sell low-value goods to consumers in New Zealand, you may be treated as the supplier for GST purposes. Similar rules already apply to sales of online services and digital products to New Zealand consumers. When determining if you meet the NZ$60,000 registration threshold, you need to include: • low-value goods supplied to consumers in New Zealand • amounts paid by the consumer for services such as delivery and insurance • any other sales that GST applies to, such as online services or digital products. Once you register, you will need to work with your merchants to ensure certain information is provided to customers and included on customs documents. To do: Contact your online marketplace operator to clarify how the GST rules will affect you, including: • changes to their policies or terms of sale • how this may affect your pricing, receipts or business systems • how they will differentiate between consumer and business sales • how this will affect returned goods and refunds processes • how you will need to assist the online marketplace provider to provide GST information to transporters or customs brokers. 03 A merchant is responsible for GST on their sales through your platform if the documentation provided with the consignment shows the merchant as the supplier and you have both agreed that the merchant is responsible for the GST, and all the following apply: • you don’t authorise the payment for the sale • you don’t make or authorise the delivery of the goods sold • you don’t directly or indirectly set any terms or conditions for the sale. More for redeliverers You are a redeliverer if you assist in getting goods to New Zealand by providing either: • an offshore mailbox service, where you provide or assist in providing the use of an address outside New Zealand to which goods are delivered • a shopping service, where you purchase or assist in purchasing goods outside New Zealand as the agent of a recipient. If you buy and resell goods, you are a merchant rather than a redeliverer. When determining if you meet the NZ$60,000 registration threshold, you will need to include: • the total value of low-value goods that you deliver to consumers in New Zealand • amounts paid by the consumer for services such as delivery and insurance • any other amounts that GST applies to including your fees. If a merchant or online marketplace operator also assists in getting the goods to New Zealand, they will be responsible for GST, not you. If you need to register To register, use our online GST registration process for non- residents (available from the beginning of September 2019). See www.ird.govt.nz Can overseas branches/divisions register separately? An overseas business that sells goods and services to consumers in New Zealand through branches or divisions in separate locations must register for GST if the combined sales exceed NZ$60,000. However, if a branch or division has its own accounting system it may apply to register separately so it can file its own GST returns. A branch or division is a separate reporting line within a single entity. Converting foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars When determining whether goods are individually valued at or below NZ$1,000 (and therefore whether to charge GST), you may use the spot exchange rate that applies at the time of supply or the exchange rate published by either: • the New Zealand Customs Service (see www.customs.govt.nz) • the Reserve Bank of New Zealand • another central bank’s reference rate • a foreign exchange organisation (such as a bank that publishes foreign exchange rates) or foreign exchange data vendor. You can choose from a sell NZD rate, a buy NZD rate or a midpoint rate. Whichever you choose, you must use it consistently. When determining how much GST you are required to return to Inland Revenue in New Zealand dollars, you can use the conversion rate at either: • the time of supply • the end of each taxable period • the time you file the return (or the time it was due) • another time agreed with the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. You cannot change your method for 24 months, unless agreed with the Commissioner. Preventing double taxation Including the right information on import documents will prevent the purchaser paying tax a second time at the border. Suppliers (merchants, online marketplaces and redeliverers) along with transporters and customs brokers all have obligations to meet. Suppliers must: • ask transporters or customs brokers in the country of export to collect tax information and make sure it is provided to transporters or customs brokers in New Zealand • provide tax information for inclusion in import documents. Inform your transporter or customs broker: • whether GST has been paid at the point of sale (yes/no) • the name and GST number of the business responsible for returning GST. Penalties may apply if you fail to take reasonable steps to make this information available to customs. You must also provide a receipt to the customer clearly showing the amount of GST charged. The recipient can provide the receipt to Customs to ensure GST is not charged again. If the low-value goods have been taxed at the point of sale and again at the border, the purchaser of the goods will need to seek a GST refund from the overseas business that charged GST.

01 What’s changing? GST on low-value imported goods will be collected by merchants, online marketplaces or redeliverers. There are rules for working out which of these businesses is treated as the supplier of the goods. If a business is treated as the supplier and its total supplies exceed or are likely to exceed NZ$60,000 in a 12-month period, then it must register for, collect and return New Zealand GST. It will also have to report GST information to Customs. This is to ensure GST won’t be collected again at the border. How are transporters and customs brokers affected? Suppliers will need your practical assistance to report GST information to Customs using Trade Single Window (TSW). Generally, you will not be required to register for GST unless you are also a supplier for GST purposes. What is a low-value good? A low-value good is a physical good valued at NZ$1,000 or less. This NZ$1,000 threshold is based on the customs value of the good. This means transport and insurance costs are excluded when determining if GST needs to be charged. Exceptions Fine metal is exempt from GST. Alcohol and tobacco products (regardless of value) are subject to excise taxes and GST at the border. These rules haven’t changed. High-value goods and consignments over NZ$1,000 Individual goods valued over NZ$1,000 each (high-value goods) and consignments with a combined value exceeding NZ$1,000 will have GST, any tariff duty, an import entry transaction fee (IETF) and a biosecurity system entry levy (BSEL) applied at the border. If GST on the value of any goods has already been collected at the point of sale by the supplier, GST will still be payable on any tariff duty amount. Preventing double taxation Including the right information on import documents will prevent the purchaser paying tax a second time at the border. Suppliers (merchants, online marketplaces and redeliverers) along with transporters and customs brokers all have obligations to meet. GST-registered suppliers must: • provide a receipt to the customer clearly showing the amount of GST charged • ask transporters or customs brokers in the country of export to collect tax information and make sure it is provided to transporters or customs brokers in New Zealand • provide certain GST information for inclusion in import documents (see below). Penalties may apply to your suppliers if they fail to take reasonable steps to make this information available to Customs. Transporters and customs brokers must report GST information provided by suppliers using TSW. If a supplier does not provide this tax information to you, you can still report the goods into TSW for Customs clearance. Some smaller businesses are not required to register for GST, so not every importation will contain this information. If low-value goods are taxed at the point of sale and again at the border, the purchaser of the goods will need to seek a GST refund from the supplier that charged the GST. From 1 December 2019, New Zealand goods and services tax (GST) will apply to sales of low-value goods imported by consumers into New Zealand. Find out about these changes and what you need to do. Goods and services tax (GST) on low-value goods Information for transporters and customs brokers. Note: The GST charged at the point of sale is based on the customs value of the good plus any transport and insurance charges. AD265 02 How to complete import documentation All consignments valued at NZ$1,000 or less can be cleared on an Inward Cargo Report (ICR), a Simplified Import Declaration (SID) or an Import Declaration. ICRs and SIDs will be written off as GST paid (collected by supplier) or not required (supplier not registered for GST) unless the goods are: • alcohol or tobacco • high-value goods (with a customs value of more than NZ$1,000) • a consignment on the same craft or in the same mail dispatch for the same importer with a combined value exceeding NZ$1,000. In these cases, an Import Declaration is required. What you need to do Contact your clients and others involved in the goods supply chain to clarify if they are GST-registered and how you will work with them to collect and provide the required GST information. If the supplier is not registered for GST in New Zealand, leave blank: • GST number • GST paid indicator on the goods item line.

01 How to convert currency when working out if you should charge goods and services tax (GST) on sales of low-value goods imported into New Zealand. Converting currency to New Zealand dollars What’s changing? From 1 December 2019, New Zealand goods and services tax (GST) will apply to sales of low-value goods imported by consumers into New Zealand. Under these new rules, suppliers are required to calculate a reasonable estimate of the “customs value” of an individual item in New Zealand dollars to work out if the item is a low-value good (valued at $1,000 or less). If the item is a low-value good, GST must be charged on the supply of the item. What’s the customs value? The value of an imported item is the price the item is sold for. This doesn’t include any amounts charged by the supplier for: • GST charged on the supply of the item • duty payable by the supplier under the Customs and Excise Act 2018, and • the cost of international transport and associated insurance of the item between leaving the country of export and being delivered in New Zealand. Currency conversion to New Zealand dollars will only be necessary if: • it is unclear whether a good that is sold in another currency has a customs value exceeding $1,000, and • the supplier has not chosen to charge GST on supplies of high- value goods (goods with a customs value above $1,000). As the customs value is worked out by using a reasonable estimate at the time of supply, the date or time of supply will be the date or time the currency conversion is done if it is required. What exchange rate should I use? When working out if goods are low-value goods, overseas suppliers may use any one of the following exchange rates: • the spot exchange rate applying at the time of supply • the rate published by the New Zealand Customs Service • the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) rate, or a reference rate published by another central bank • an exchange rate provided by a foreign exchange organisation or foreign exchange data vendor. “Exchange rate” means the unit of foreign currency per New Zealand dollar, published within 30 calendar days of the conversion time. If using a rate other than the spot exchange rate that applies at the time of supply or the most recently published rate, the practice for sourcing the rate must be consistent. Apart from the requirement that a supplier’s chosen exchange rate be used consistently, there are no restrictions on the specific type of exchange rate suppliers may use for converting foreign currency amounts. This means suppliers have a choice of using a sell NZD rate, a buy NZD rate or a midpoint rate when converting foreign currency amounts to establish whether GST applies. Currency conversion formula In working out the customs value of goods, suppliers convert foreign currency to New Zealand dollars using the following formula: Sourcing exchange rates and updating business systems A supplier may set a schedule to update their business systems with their chosen rate. This schedule must make sure rates will be updated at consistent and regular intervals, no more than 30 calendar days apart. A supplier cannot test and select a more favourable exchange rate at other times, or decide not to accept the published rate at the scheduled time. A supplier may only change their exchange rate or their schedule for sourcing and updating the exchange rate in their systems if they have sound commercial reasons for doing so. If a supplier changes the exchange rate they use with the purpose of affecting whether goods are low-value goods, the supplier will not have used the rate consistently and will not have followed the requirements. However, different exchange rates may be used for distinct parts of the supplier’s business, provided the exchange rate chosen for each part of the business is used consistently in that part. (Amount expressed in a foreign currency) / (the supplier’s chosen exchange rate on the conversion day) AD266 02 Currency conversion when determining the amount of GST payable When converting foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars to work out the amount of GST to be returned, a supplier can use the exchange rate applying at: • the time of supply • the last day of the relevant taxable period • the date the supplier files their return for the relevant period (or the due date for filing, if the return is filed past the due date), or • another date as agreed with the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. If the supplier chooses an option other than expressing amounts in New Zealand currency at the time of supply, they cannot change it for 24 months unless agreed otherwise with the Commissioner. Just as the exchange rate options for determining whether goods are low-value goods (and whether GST applies), the exchange rate used by the supplier to calculate the amount of GST required to be returned in New Zealand dollars may be a sell NZD rate, a buy NZD rate or a midpoint rate. Example 1 – supplier using exchange rate published by New Zealand Customs Pilko’s Phones & Electronics (Pilko) is a non-resident merchant that supplies consumer electronics such as tablets and mobile phones. It prices goods in USD. Pilko is registered for GST in New Zealand. To determine the estimated customs value of an item at the time of sale, Pilko has its point of sale systems set up to convert USD to NZD using the exchange rate published by the New Zealand Customs Service. Customs publishes its exchange rates fortnightly, 11 calendar days before the newly published exchange rate comes into effect. Pilko has a practice of sourcing the most recently published exchange rate and updating the exchange rate in its point of sale systems 7 days after the exchange rate is published on the Customs website. The currency conversion method used by Pilko meets the requirements. The schedule set by Pilko for sourcing the exchange rate and updating its systems is consistent in terms of its frequency and time of setting the rate. The time between setting the previous rate and updating the rate is 14 calendar days (within the 30-day maximum). Under Pilko’s schedule, the maximum possible length of time between the publication date and the time of conversion is 21 calendar days. This is within the 30 day maximum. Example 2 – supplier using midpoint exchange rate published by a retail bank Witte Fashion Co. (Witte) is a non-resident merchant that supplies high-end clothing. It prices goods in AUD. Witte is registered for GST in New Zealand. To determine the estimated customs value of an item at the time of sale, Witte has its point of sale systems set up to convert AUD to NZD using a mid-point rate published by a bank. The bank publishes the close of trading foreign exchange rates from the previous day each morning except for Saturdays and Sundays. Witte has a practice of sourcing the most recently published exchange rate and updating the exchange rate in its point of sale systems once every 4 weeks on a Tuesday. The currency conversion method used by Witte meets the requirements. The schedule set by Witte for sourcing the exchange rate and updating its systems is consistent in terms of its frequency and time of setting the rate, and the time between setting the previous rate and updating the rate is 28 calendar days. This is within the 30-day maximum. Under Witte’s schedule, the maximum possible length of time between the publication date and the time of conversion is 28 calendar days. This is within the 30 day maximum. Example 3 – currency conversion to determine whether goods are low-value goods Witte (as in example 2) sells a suit valued at AU$880 to Gordon, plus AU$50 for shipping to Gordon’s address in Wellington, New Zealand. At the time of the sale, the midpoint exchange rate used in Witte’s systems for estimating the customs value of items sold is AU$0.9270 to NZ$1. Based on this, Witte determines that the estimated customs value of the suit in New Zealand dollars is NZ$949.30 (AU$880 / AU$0.9270 = NZ$949.30). As the estimated customs value is less than NZ$1,000, the suit is a low-value good. Witte charges Gordon GST of AU$139.50 (AU$930 x 15% = AU$139.50). More information Visit us at ird.govt.nz/GSTupdate Or email info.lvg@ird.govt.nz 03 Example 4 – currency conversion to determine amount of GST to be returned in New Zealand dollars When preparing their GST return, Witte determines that the total amount of GST they charged for the most recent taxable period is AU$9,000. Witte has chosen to use the exchange rate applying on the date that they file their GST return to determine the amount of GST to be returned to Inland Revenue in New Zealand dollars. The exchange rate applying on the date that Witte files their return is AU$0.9294 / NZ$1. The amount of GST Witte return in their GST return is NZ$9,683.67 (AU$9,000 / AU$0.9294 = NZ$9,683.67). Witte must use this method for 24 months. They must convert GST from AUD to NZD on the date they file each GST return (or the due date if a return is filed late).

First, check our online tool below to see if your trust needs to comply with the additional reporting requirements.

Then, if you do need to comply, continue reading to see what that extra information is. The 2022 IR6, including the IR6B, IR6S and IR6P, have new fields to collect the information required.

Trusts that do not need to comply ‒ general rules
-------------------------------------------------

If a trust does not earn assessable income, it is not required to comply with the reporting requirements, even if it chooses to file an income tax return.

As estates are not trusts, estates will not be required to comply with the reporting requirements. An estate may progress to a point where assets are held on trust, in which case the trust will need to comply with the new reporting requirements (unless it does not earn assessable income or is one of the types of trusts listed below).

Other trusts that do not need to comply with the reporting requirements include:

*   trusts that have made a non-active declaration (you can find the form - the IR633 - at the bottom of this page)
*   foreign trusts
*   charities
*   trusts eligible to become Māori Authorities
*   widely-held superannuation funds
*   exempt employee share schemes
*   debt funding special purpose vehicles
*   energy lines trusts.

Does your trust need to comply with the additional reporting requirements?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you file your trust's IR6 return you need to tell us if the trust needs to comply with the additional reporting requirements. Work out if these requirements apply to your trust.

What are the additional reporting requirements?
-----------------------------------------------

You need to give us information about the trust's financial situation and people involved in the trust.

These requirements apply to tax returns for the 2021-2022 and later income years.

Show all

Financial statements

The IR6 tax return now asks for additional information about the trust's financial performance and position, including:

*   net profit or loss before tax
*   assets (for example, land, buildings, and shares - and the methods used to value these assets)
*   liabilities (for example, loans and other money the trust owes to creditors)
*   equity (this means assets available to trustees after liabilities are taken into account).

If the trust would usually file an IR3R (rental income), IR3F (farming income) or IR10 (financial statement summary for business activities) form then they should continue to do so if they conduct those types of activities. These forms should only capture the transactions that relate to the specific activity.

The fields on the IR6 are intended to capture all income, expenses, assets and liabilities of the trust, even where those assets are not used to derive assessable income - so for many trusts these values will differ from their IR10.

Settlements

A settlement is any transfer of value from a person (or entity) to a trust. A transfer of value is the giving or doing of something for less than market value.

Please give us details of any settlements made to the trust:

*   details of the person (or entity) who made the settlement (the settlor)
*   the nature and amount of the settlement.

These details are entered onto the 'Trust settlor details' (IR6S) form.

### Settlor details required

Please include details of the settlor, including the name and date of birth (or commencement date for companies or other non-individuals), jurisdiction of tax residency and IRD number or Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) for non-residents.

You need to give us details of any person (or entity) who has ever been a settlor of the trust (including historical settlors), but you won’t need to tell us the amount or nature of any historical settlement. For current year settlements, you must include the details of the settlor and the amount and nature of the settlement.

### Settlement details required

The nature of settlements is broken down into the following categories:

*   cash
*   financial arrangements
*   land
*   buildings
*   shares
*   services
*   other.

If a settlement is of minor services that are incidental to the activities of the trust, you do not need to disclose it.

### Loans

A loan to a trust is not a transfer of value so this is not a settlement. If the loan is later forgiven, the forgiveness is a settlement, and if the lender does not charge interest on the loan they also become a settlor.

Beneficiaries

A beneficiary is a person (or entity) who can benefit or does benefit from a trust.

Trustees can choose to allocate beneficiary income or make distributions to beneficiaries.

If a person receives an allocation of beneficiary income or a distribution during the year, please complete the 'Estate or trust beneficiary details' IR6B form, and identify the nature of the distribution under the following categories:

*   accounting income and any other amounts
*   [corpus](/api/glossary/item?id={FB410F8B-2D1E-472C-A7D7-3CDADE57736B})
    
*   [capital](/api/glossary/item?id={ABB97BD1-8DCF-451A-AEDC-D89A818640F1})
    
*   use of trust property at less than market value
*   distribution of trust assets
*   forgiveness of debt.

In another section, you're asked to show the transactions into and out of the beneficiary's account.

Non-cash distributions that are minor and incidental to the activities of the trust do not need to be disclosed. There is no requirement to disclose details of beneficiaries or distributions that happened in the past, only those from the 2021-2022 year onwards.

You'll need a separate IR6B for each beneficiary.

Power of Appointment

A person (or entity) who holds a power of appointment has the legal power to add or remove trustees, add and remove beneficiaries, or alter the terms of the trust deed.

From the 2021-2022 income year onwards, trusts must tell us the details of any person (or entity) who holds a power of appointment. The details required are:

*   full name
*   date of birth (or commencement date for companies or other non-individuals)
*   jurisdiction of tax residency
*   IRD number/Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN)
*   commence date (that the person acquired the power of appointment)
*   cease date (that the person ceases to hold the power of appointment).

You can submit details of powers of appointment through your income tax account in myIR by selecting 'Manage power of appointment' or by paper through the post.

API wāhinoho Address API
========================

The address API enables the creating, updating and deleting of the address of a customer or an account. It is 1 of 8 APIs that, together, make up the customer services suite.

[How customer services work](/digital-service-providers/services-catalogue/customer-and-account/customer-services-suite/how-customer-services-work)
 

How the address API works
-------------------------

The address API requires the customer or account API to be integrated.

The address API enables the addresses held at either the customer level or the customer account level to be added, updated and deleted. It requires either:

*   the customer ID or account ID for adding an address to a customer or account
*   an address ID for the update or deletion of an address from a customer or account.

The customer ID or account ID is available through a call to the customer API or account API, respectively. The address ID is available through a call to either the customer API or the account API.

The address API can only be used by:

*   the customer the data is associated to
*   a user with delegated access
*   an intermediary who’s linked to the customer
*   government agencies with a memorandum of understanding that allows them access to customer account level data.

The address API enables the above users to update Inland Revenue’s customer or account data from their native systems, and to avoid the use of manually facilitated channels.

For access to myIR File Upload and Gateway Services detailed technical documentation, register your organisation or login to Gateway Customer Support Portal via the links below.

Use the Getting started guide to find out how to access our sandbox (mock services) and test environments.

[Getting started guide](/digital-service-providers/guides-and-docs/getting-started)

### Gateway service capability for the address API

The address API provides the following capabilities through defined API operations and API paths.

| API operation | API path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POST | /address | Adds an address of a given type (physical or postal) to either the identified:<br><br>*   customer<br>*   account. |
| PUT | /address | Updates the provided details to the identified address for either the:<br><br>*   customer<br>*   account. |
| DELETE | /address | Deletes the details of the identified address for either the:<br><br>*   customer<br>*   account. |

Address API business use cases
------------------------------

The following are examples of how to use the address API to achieve specific business outcomes. The sequence of operations, the order in which they should be called, is indicated in the column of each operation.

| Number | Use case | POST /address | PUT /address | DELETE /address | Dependencies |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | Add a postal address to a customer. | 1   |     |     | Customer does not already have a postal address. |
| 2   | Update an existing postal address for a customer. |     | 1   |     | Address ID for update has been obtained from the customer API. |
| 3   | Update an existing postal address for a customer account. |     | 1   |     | Address ID for update has been obtained from the account API. |
| 4   | Remove an existing postal address for a customer. |     |     | 1   | Address ID for removal has been obtained from the customer API. |
| 5   | Remove an existing postal address for a customer account. |     |     | 1   | Address ID for removal has been obtained from the account API. |

[Student Loan Scheme Amendment Act 2014](/new-legislation/act-articles/student-loan-scheme-amendment-act-2014 "Student Loan Scheme Amendment Act 2014")

Adjusting the overseas-based borrower repayment rules
=====================================================

2014 Student Loan amendment to adjusts the overseas-based borrower repayment rules by introducing a fixed repayment obligation and two new repayment thresholds.

#### _Section 110 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011_

The legislation adjusts the overseas-based borrower repayment rules by introducing a fixed repayment obligation and two new repayment thresholds.

### Background

Under the previous rules, there was a four-step repayment obligation for overseas-based borrowers based on their loan balance, as shown in the table below.

| Loan balance (at start of year) | Amount due per year |
| --- | --- |
| <=$1,000 | The whole balance |
| \>$1,000 and <=$15,000 | $1,000 |
| \>$15,000 and <= $30,000 | $2,000 |
| \>$30,000 | $3,000 |

Under those rules, as a borrower repaid their loan, their loan balance would decrease, along with their repayment obligation. This meant that a compliant borrower's repayment obligation decreased over time, while their ability to pay was likely to be the same or better (as, for most people, their income increases over time).

The new legislation introduces fixed repayment obligations for overseas-based borrowers. This will reduce repayment times and the interest cost for compliant overseas-based borrowers. It also brings overseas-based borrowers' repayment obligations more in line with how commercial loans operate and their New Zealand-based counterparts.

### Key features

The new legislation introduces fixed repayment obligations for overseas-based borrowers, which ensures that their repayment obligation is maintained, even when their loan balance is decreasing.

It also introduces two new repayment thresholds. Overseas-based borrowers with a relevant loan balance of more than $45,000 but less than or equal to $60,000 will have an annual repayment obligation of $4,000, and borrowers with a relevant loan balance greater than $60,000 will have a repayment obligation of $5,000.

The new repayment obligations are:

| Relevant loan balance | Amount due per year |
| --- | --- |
| <=$1,000 | The whole balance |
| \>$1,000 and <=$15,000 | $1,000 |
| \>$15,000 and <= $30,000 | $2,000 |
| \>$30,000 and <= $45,000 | $3,000 |
| \>$45,000 and <= $60,000 | $4,000 |
| \>$60,000 | $5,000 |

### Detailed analysis

Under the previous rules, an overseas-based borrower's repayment obligation was determined based on their current loan balance. As a borrower repaid their loan, their loan balance decreased along with their repayment obligation.

New section 110 fixes an overseas-based borrower's repayment obligation so their repayment obligation does not decrease as their loan balance decreases.

From 1 April 2014, overseas-based borrowers will have their repayment obligation maintained at the same rate as when they became overseas-based.[1](#01)

Borrowers who are already overseas-based at 31 March 2014 will have their repayment obligation fixed at the same rate they had on 1 April 2014.

These rules only apply if an overseas-based borrower's loan balance is decreasing. A borrower may have their loan balance increase if they continue to draw down on a loan while overseas or if they are charged interest.

If a borrower's loan balance increases so that it rises into a higher repayment threshold, the on-going repayment obligation will be fixed at the new higher threshold.

#### _Borrowers whose loan balance is decreasing_

New section 110 achieves the goal of fixing a borrower's repayment obligation by setting a borrower's repayment obligation based on their "relevant loan balance". For a borrower whose loan balance is decreasing, the "relevant loan balance" is the borrower's loan balance on their "start date".

A borrower's "start date" differs depending on whether the borrower is an "existing borrower".

An "existing borrower" is a person who was overseas-based on 31 March 2014 and has been continuously overseas-based since then. For "existing borrowers" their relevant loan balance is their balance at 31 March 2014 (their start date).

For all borrowers who are not "existing borrowers", their relevant loan balance is their loan balance at the date they became overseas-based.

This distinction ensures that current borrowers have their repayment obligation fixed based on the loan balance at 31 March (which is the end of the annual assessment period).

The requirement that borrowers be "continuously" based overseas will affect borrowers who are existing overseas-based borrowers at 31 March 2014, but who later become New Zealand-based borrowers. If a borrower were to become overseas-based again following being New Zealand-based, they will no longer be classified as an "existing borrower".

These rules result in a borrower having their relevant loan balance remain the same over time as it is fixed at the amount of their loan balance at the "start date". As a result, their associated repayment obligation also remains the same over time.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Example | **Calculating a borrower's repayment obligation based on the relevant loan balance at their start date** |
| Shannan becomes overseas-based on 1 May 2014 with a loan balance of $31,000.<br><br>Shannan is not an "existing borrower", because she became overseas-based after 31 March 2014. Her "start date" is therefore 1 May 2014 (the day she became overseas-based).<br><br>For the purposes of calculating her full-year repayment obligation as an overseas-based borrower for the year to 31 March 2015, her "relevant loan balance" is her consolidated loan balance at the start date.<br><br>So her relevant loan balance is $31,000 and her full year repayment obligation is $3,000.<br><br>Shannan is an overseas-based borrower for only part of the tax year. As a result, she does not have to pay her full year repayment obligation. Instead, her repayment obligation is apportioned to the amount of the year she is overseas-based. Her part-year repayment obligation is therefore $2,750.<br><br>Shannan makes payments throughout the year and at 31 March 2015 her loan balance is $29,500 (after interest is applied).<br><br>For the 2015-16 year her relevant loan balance will be $31,000 (the consolidated loan balance at the start date). This ensures her repayments are fixed in relation to her loan balance when she became an overseas borrower. Her full-year repayment obligation therefore remains at $3,000.<br><br>**Note:** The loan balance numbers used in these examples are rounded, and are used for illustrative purposes only. The actual amount of interest charged to overseas-based borrowers on any given loan balance, plus any penalties for non-payment, will vary. |     |

#### _Borrowers whose loan balance is increasing_

Some borrowers' consolidated loan balances may increase after their start date.

If a borrower's consolidated loan balance has increased since their start date, their "relevant loan balance" is the borrower's highest loan balance on any 31 March balance date.

This means that if a borrower's loan balance is increasing, the associated repayment obligation also increases. This ensures that borrowers whose loan balance is increasing make payments sufficient to make progress on their loan repayment.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Example | **Calculating a borrower's repayment obligation based on their relevant loan amount at 31 March date** |
| Hannah becomes overseas based on 16 May 2014 with a loan balance of $14,500. Her annual repayment obligation is $1,000.<br><br>Her start date is 16 May 2014 (the day she became overseas-based).<br><br>Hannah fails to make any repayments on her loan for the next two years, and fails to contact Inland Revenue to discuss a repayment plan. Hannah therefore accrues both interest and penalties.<br><br>By March 2015 her loan balance has increased to $15,500. Her relevant loan balance is therefore based on this higher amount of $15,500 and the amount she is required to repay for the year to 31 March 2016 is now $2,000.<br><br>In the year to 31 March 2017 Hannah makes arrangements to repay her loan. Her loan balance at 31 March 2017 now sits at $14,600. However, in calculating her "relevant loan balance" the highest of the loan balances as at her start date, or any subsequent balance date, 31 March is used. So Hannah's "relevant loan balance" remains as at 31 March 2016 ($15,500) and her repayment obligation for the year to 31 March 2017 is still $2,000. |     |

#### _Repayment thresholds_

Section 110(2) introduces two new repayment thresholds. Borrowers with a relevant loan balance of more than $45,000 but less than or equal to $60,000 will have a repayment obligation of $4,000 and borrowers with a relevant loan balance that is more than $60,000 will have a repayment obligation of $5,000.

The new repayment obligations are:

| Relevant loan balance | Amount due per year |
| --- | --- |
| <=$1,000 | The whole balance |

These new thresholds for borrowers with higher loan balances will ensure that more borrowers will have repayment obligations which will at least cover their annual interest charge.

### Application date

The amendment applies from 1 April 2014.

1A borrower is overseas-based if they are not in New Zealand for 184 consecutive days. When a borrower meets the 184-day test they are treated as being overseas-based from the first day of the 184-day period.

Advertising agencies: placement and creative services supplied to non-residents
===============================================================================

QB (Jan 1999) clarifies that advertising services for non-residents qualify for zero-rating, whether or not the goods to be advertised are situated inside NZ.

### Section 11(2)(e), Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 - Services provided for and to persons not resident in New Zealand

In November 1996, Inland Revenue published public ruling BR Pub 96/10 - _GST: advertising space and advertising time sold to non-residents_ - (_Tax Information_ _Bulletin_ Vol. 8, No. 8, pages 13-17).  That ruling and its commentary discussed the supply of advertising space and advertising time on radio and television, by a GST registered person to a non-resident person who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed.

A taxpayer has asked whether zero-rating would apply to:

*   services that are required to create an advertisement for a non-resident
  
*   placement services provided to a non-resident.  

The ruling itself says that the supply of advertising space or advertising time means the service of communicating an advertising message, including all steps involved in providing the service by the supplier of the advertising space or time.  However, the ruling does not mention advertising agencies that supply creative and placement services, and deals only with the supplier of the advertising media.

This item explains Inland Revenue's view of how section 11(2)(e) applies and, in particular, whether the "directly in connection with" test is satisfied in the case of creative and placement services when these advertising services are supplied to non-residents.

##### Section 11(2)(e) states:

(2) Where, but for this section, a supply of services would be charged with tax under section 8 of this Act, any such supply shall be charged at the rate of zero percent where-…

5.  The services are supplied for and to a person who is not resident in New Zealand and who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed, not being services which are supplied directly in  connection with-  
      
    1.  Land or any improvement thereto situated inside New Zealand; or  
        
    2.  Moveable personal property (other than choses in action, and other than goods to which paragraph (ca) of this subsection applies) situated inside New Zealand at the time the services are performed; -  
        and not being services which are the acceptance of an obligation to refrain from carrying on any taxable activity, to the extent that the conduct of that activity would have occurred within New Zealand; ...

Creative services are simply services supplied that create the advertisement itself.  The creation of an advertisement involves ascertaining the client's general aspirations, defining the required product image, identifying potential market targets, identifying suitable advertising media and formats, and focussing more specifically on the generation of ideas, themes and concepts which best link these.  After evaluation and discussion with clients, a specific advertising product is finally developed and submitted to the client for approval. 

Placement services cover the "where and when" of advertising, and are services provided by agents in giving their advice on placing advertisements with the appropriate media.  This may involve the detailed planning of an advertising campaign, and negotiating and arranging the placement of advertisements with broadcasters and mass circulation publishers. 

The Commissioner's view is that placement services may be zero-rated, provided the other requirements of section 11(2)(e) are satisfied, i.e. the services are supplied contractually for and to a non-resident who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed.  It is considered that placement services are in the same category as other services such as the provision of advertising space which, according to Hillyer J in his decision in _Wilson & Horton v CIR_  (1994)16 NZTC 11,221 at 11,224, are supplied directly in connection with an advertisement but not directly in connection with whatever goods or services are advertised.  Placement services will always satisfy the requirement of section 11(2)(e) that the services are not to be supplied directly in connection with land or moveable personal property situated in New Zealand.

With creative services the situation is more complicated.  Since the finished advertisement does not yet exist while creative services are being performed, it arguably follows from the reasoning in _Wilson & Horton_ that creative services should be considered to be directly connected with the subject matter of the advertisement. 

However, the Commissioner's view is that although the finished advertisement may not exist, it will nevertheless exist in a conceptual or embryonic form while the creative services are being performed.  Although the developing advertisement may be said to have an imaginary or intellectual existence, it would not be so elusive or insubstantial as to be said to have no existence at all for the purposes of the Act.  Accordingly, there will always be something intervening between the creative services and the subject matter of the advertisement.  On the basis of the "one step removed" test applied in _Wilson & Horton_, creative services and the advertisement's subject matter (i.e. the goods and/or services being advertised) may truly be said not to be directly connected with one another. 

In summary, creative services and placement services supplied to non-residents who are outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed will qualify for zero-rating, regardless of whether or not the goods to be advertised are situated inside New Zealand.

Advisory fees facilitate inbound tour operations and attract GST at the standard rate
=====================================================================================

2015 case note - advisory services supplied to overseas operators chargeable with tax at standard rate - agent, domestic tourism products, packaging, zero-rating.

Case

ID Tours New Zealand Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Goods and Services Tax Act 1985

### Summary

This was an appeal from the decision of the Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") that found advisory services supplied by the appellant to overseas operators were chargeable with tax at the standard rate under s 8(1) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 ("the Act"). The appeal was dismissed.

### Impact of decision

In determining whether goods and services tax ("GST") applies to a transaction, the focus is on the nature of supply and the contractual relationships actually entered into and carried out.

Facilitation services provided by a registered person in s 8(2B) of the Act include services that are included in or form part of the packaging and selling process. Packaging involves the action of putting things (domestic tourism products and services) together for a particular purpose (sale to overseas operators).

### Facts

ID Tours ("the appellant") is described as a "Ground Handler" and a destination management company that provides advisory tourism services to cruise lines, incentive houses and a UK travel agent.

This decision concerns the appellant's appeal of the TRA's finding that it facilitated inbound tour operations for the purposes of s 8(2B) of the Act.

The appellant also appeals the TRA's finding that it supplied the advisory tourism services under contractual arrangements to overseas operators and that those services were received in New Zealand by another person so that, pursuant to s 11A(2) of the Act, zero rating does not apply.

The practical effect of the TRA's findings was that the appellant's services are chargeable for GST.

### Decision

The appeal was dismissed. The High Court found that s 8(2B) of the Act applied to the appellant's advisory services, which were therefore chargeable with GST at the standard rate under s 8(1) of the Act. As s 8(2B) of the Act applied, it was unnecessary to consider the application of s 11A(2).

#### _Whether the TRA was wrong in its finding under s 8(2B) of the Act_

The High Court noted that it was open to the TRA to find that the appellant was not an agent of the overseas tour operators. The Court looked to the actual arrangements entered into by the parties and determined that the appellant formed two separate contractual arrangements, one with the overseas operator and another with the local suppliers.

As the Court found that the appellant was not an agent, it was necessary to consider whether its services consist of facilitation of inbound tour operations under s 8(2B) of the Act. This required an assessment of whether the appellant's business of providing advisory and "on the ground" services amounted to packaging one or more domestic tourism products and services for the purposes of the definition in s 8(2F).

The Court found that the prima facie meaning of facilitation of inbound tour operations is the provision of services in the process of or in the act of organising one or more domestic tourism products or services in New Zealand into a set of interdependent or related objects that are viewed as a unit.

The Court found that the TRA was correct to find the appellant's advisory services are an integral part of the process of packaging domestic tourism products and selling them to overseas operators. The High Court found that for the purposes of ss 8(2B) and 8(2F) of the Act, the appellant's advisory services consist of facilitation of inbound tour operations and are chargeable with GST.

#### _Other arguments_

The High Court also considered additional issues brought by the appeal.

_Corroboration and creditability of evidence_

1.  The appellant submitted that the TRA failed to provide reasons for not accepting the appellant's evidence. The TRA did not make any findings of credibility in relation to the appellant's evidence. The High Court noted that there is no requirement for the TRA to make express findings of witness credibility and none were required to the extent that the appellant's factual witness gave opinions as to the legal position.
2.  The appellant submitted that the TRA made incorrect findings of fact due to the absence of corroborative evidence provided by the appellant and the appellant should have been warned that it would need to provide evidence from overseas operators and local suppliers. The High Court found that there was nothing in the TRA's decision that indicated it would have reached a different conclusion had the evidence been provided. Ultimately the onus was on the appellant to demonstrate that the services should be zero-rated, which includes providing the evidence it deems helpful.
3.  The High Court found that the appellant's submission that the TRA failed to provide reasons for not accepting the appellant's evidence is incorrect.

_Errors on record_

1.  The appellant contended that the TRA incorrectly recorded its concession at \[60\] of the decision under appeal. The appellant raised this point on appeal because it says it goes to the question of whether the appellant is an agent of the overseas operator.
2.  The High Court found that the concession as recorded at \[60\] did not impact on the TRA's consideration of whether s 8(2B) of the Act applied. The High Court also noted that the TRA had already found that no agency relationship existed between the appellant and any of the overseas operators.

_Errors of fact_

1.  The appellant acknowledged that the errors of fact it alleged occurred are immaterial, but contended that their number may indicate the TRA reached conclusions not supported by the evidence.
2.  The High Court found that the facts the appellant says are erroneous appear to have been summarised generally by the TRA for the convenience of the reader without distorting the essence of the evidence.

This can lead to late payment penalties or interest. The period date is not the due date or the date the payment is made, it’s the end date of the taxable period that they are paying for. If paying online, the bank might ask for the ‘Period ending’ date, or it may need to be provided in the ‘Payee Code’ field. For example, GST for the taxable period ending 31 May is due to be paid by 28 June. So, the payee code information would be “GST 31052020”. For more information on how to pay, check out ird.govt.nz/pay Decommissioning KiwiSaver website Over the last year and a half, we’ve been working to improve our website, by rebuilding it on a modern and enduring platform so we can give our customers a great online experience. More recently we’ve also been working to address concerns received when the core Inland Revenue website went live last April. These largely related to how easily content could be found and the omission of technical and targeted content on the site. We’ve worked to address this feedback, including a full review of the income tax content and the application of a clearer structure, along with tools to help customers find what they’re looking for. With these aspects largely addressed, and most content now on our new site, we’re nearing the end of this journey. To complete this process, we’re working to switch off the heritage (old) website and subsites in the coming months. One of these is the KiwiSaver subsite kiwisaver.govt.nz Last September we started testing re-written KiwiSaver content on our main Inland Revenue site. We’re confident this new content meets the needs of our customers so we’re looking to turn this subsite off on Wednesday 8 April. To ensure customers clicking on an old URL will still get to the new KiwiSaver material, there will be temporary redirects in place for several months. Banners will also be placed across the heritage site, the KiwiSaver subsite, and our new site, in the days leading up to turning off the subsite, to inform customers that it will be turned off shortly. Set up new links now With the KiwiSaver content on the new Inland Revenue website now, we suggest you visit and set up new links and favourites to pages you may refer to or visit often. Remember, the links you have set up to content on the old subsite won’t work, or will temporarily redirect you to the new content, when we turn the subsite off. Visit the new KiwiSaver material ird.govt.nz/kiwisaver Using the 10% uplift to calculate provisional tax We have received a number of queries from tax agents recently about provisional tax calculations where they were expecting the 10% uplift to be applied. All these criteria for using the 10% uplift must be met as in section RC 5(3) of the ITA 2007: • The customer must provide a return of income for the preceding tax year. • The customer’s return for the preceding tax year is not due to be filed on or before the date their first payment of provisional tax is due on, or they have been granted an EOT (either through their tax agent or individually by Inland Revenue) • The tax return for the preceding tax year has not been provided on or before the date of their first instalment • The date is not the date of instalment F for the corresponding income year. Note that in some early balance date situations it is possible for a customer to meet the criteria of bullet point 2 above without having an EOT. For example, a customer with a 31 October balance date with 3 instalments and no EOT using the standard method is required to pay their first instalment of 2021 provisional tax on 28 March 2020. The customer’s 2020 return of income is not due to be provided until 7 July 2020. If the customer does not provide their 2020 return of income on or before 28 March 2020 they will use 110% of their 2019 RIT to calculate their 28 March 2020 provisional tax instalment amount.

The entries must be made as at the date chosen and not a later date, such as the date we process the request. Consequential adjustments may then have to be made to ICA balances and returns back to that date (which could have further income tax, UOMI and penalty implications). For more information on this, please see our recently published operational position OP20/01 Commissioner’s operational position on Part 10B transfers of excess tax, effective date for ICA entries. classic.ird.govt.nz/ technical-tax/op-positions/op-2001-transfers-of-excess-tax-effective-dates-for-ICA-entries.html EOT dashboard in myIR Reminder – if you are looking for your extension of time (EOT) dashboard in myIR you will find it under the Tax Preparer TAB > Manage Agency.

AGENTS ANSWERS Inland Revenue’s tax agents’ update 1 Issue No 244 • April 2021 • IR787 We have several planning calendars to help you meet your obligations. Remember that if a due date falls on a weekend or public holiday, we can receive your return and payment on the next working day without a penalty being applied. But for provincial anniversary dates, this only applies if you're in the province celebrating the holiday, and only if you usually make tax payments over-the-counter at Westpac. Payday filing version 2 As we've signalled in recent months, from 1 April 2021 we now require all employers to use the new payday filing format (Version 2) which provides more Employment Information and Employee Detail information. We have been working with payroll software providers to help ensure they build Version 2 into their systems in good time. For employers who file through software, they should notice little change but should contact their payroll software provider if they have questions about the changes. Similarly, for those who use Payroll Bureaus or an intermediary service, there will likely be no impact as their payroll service provider will have made the necessary changes. For those filing on-screen through myIR or on paper, Version 2 has already been in place since April 2020. Those who have their own inhouse software will need to build Version 2 into their systems. If you have clients who are having trouble doing this they can find the developer kit at ird.govt.nz/digital-service-providers/services-catalogue/returns-and-information/payday-filing If they have any questions or need help to prepare for this change, they can contact us at PaydayReporting@ird.govt.nz Important note on amendments Amendments to Employment Information (EI) must be made using the same version as the original file. For example, if an employer has filed through Version 1 they must amend through Version 1. For more information Employers who file through software can talk to their software provider about what's changed, or visit ird.govt.nz/payday-filing-version-2 AGENTS ANSWERS • Issue No 244 • April 2021 2 E-file decommissioning on 16 April On 16 April 2021, E-File will be decommissioned. In preparation for this, we are no longer accepting E-File registrations. E-File is being replaced with new gateway services which software providers are building into their systems. The software providers are deciding which aspects they will build before E-File is decommissioned on 16 April 2021. We will have E-File available up until 4pm 16 April 2021 for submitting 2020 and earlier tax year returns. However, your software provider could move to the new gateway services before 16 April 2021. If you're unsure, check the timing with your software provider. From this date we will also remove the E-File contact channels including the dedicated email and phone lines. To ensure you get a confirmation receipt for returns filed on 16 April 2021, we recommend that you submit your returns by midday. If you file up to 4 pm and don't get a confirmation, you can confirm that the return has been received by using the new Return service to check its status or by checking the period in myIR from 17 April 2021 onwards. If you try to file through E-File after 4pm on 16 April 2021 the returns will be rejected. You'll need to talk to your software provider. Regardless, you'll still be able to file via myIR. After 16 April 2021, if you need to amend a return that you've filed through E-File, you will be able to do this using gateway services or myIR. Return Acknowledgements (RAs) and Notices of Assessments (NOAs) will not be generated by E-File for any returns that haven't been processed by 16 April 2021. However, the RA or NOA will be available through the Document Service in gateway services, and in myIR. Talk to your software provider or visit ird.govt.nz/efile to find out more about this change. Final date for second Resurgence Support Payment With New Zealand now at alert level one, the final date to apply for the Resurgence Support Payment (RSP) for the period 28 February to 12 March 2021 is Monday 12 April 2021. Note: Applications for the first RSP for the period 15 February to 22 February closed on 22 March 2021. For more information about RSP, go to ird.govt.nz/updates/news-folder/resurgence-support-payment For more information about all the support available to businesses, go to business.govt.nz/covid-19/financial-support-for-businesses/ Employee share schemes As part of Inland Revenue's focus to help customers get it "right from the start" we are undertaking a program to help our customers with their Employee Share Scheme (ESS) Reporting. We are issuing letters to employers (and their agents) who have been identified as possibly providing benefits under an ESS. Broadly, an ESS is an arrangement for issuing or transferring shares in a company to past, present and future employees. The arrangement must be connected to the person's employment or service. Employers are required to provide employment information to Inland Revenue when they provide ESS benefits to employees. The current ESS rules have applied since 29 September 2018 to benefits provided under an ESS (subject to transitional provisions). Certain widely offered schemes are "Exempt ESS", subject to different tax and reporting rules. The letters provide education on reporting, income, deductions and the transitional rules, and encourage employers to provide Inland Revenue with voluntary disclosures for any ESS benefits not reported or mistakes identified. You can find more information on: • the tax implications of an ESS at ird.govt.nz/employing-staff/paying-staff/employee-share-schemes/ ess-rules • voluntary disclosures at ird.govt.nz/managing-my-tax/fixing-mistakes-in-my-return/ make-a-voluntary-disclosure Employers and their tax agents can contact Inland Revenue through the following email address ESSIncome@ird.govt.nz if they wish to provide a voluntary disclosure. AGENTS ANSWERS • Issue No 244 • April 2021 3 Reminder for employers to review the Employer Superannuation Contribution Tax (ESCT) rate Employers need to review the ESCT rate for each employee at the start of each tax year (1 April) and apply it in their payroll software. Resources for help: • Information about ESCT on our website at ird.govt.nz/employing-staff/deductions-from-income/ employer-superannuation-contribution-tax • a tool to help employers work out the ESCT rate for each employee at ird.govt.nz/employing-staff/ deductions-from-income/employer-superannuation-contribution-tax/work-out-esct-rate • Our Employer's guide IR335. For employers who use payroll software, the extent to which the ESCT calculation is automated varies across software packages. Employers should check with their payroll software provider for specific instructions how this is managed within their software, and the settings necessary to ensure the correct ESCT rate is applied for each employee. We will be monitoring ESCT deductions later in the year and will get in touch with employers who may need assistance. Reminder about new campaign for real estate sector We have identified that real estate salespersons/agents are claiming a high level of expenses relative to their income. We believe that people are claiming private expenses but not keeping logbooks or other business records to support a deduction. We plan to provide education and offer webinars to real estate firms to help customers file the correct returns. As part of your end of year client review, you may wish to ensure that your clients are keeping sufficient records to support expenses claimed. If we are concerned your client has overclaimed expenses, we'll send you a letter asking your client to provide records to support expenses claimed. Please contact us if you have any questions at realestate@ird.govt.nz If you have identified that errors have occurred then your client should complete a voluntary disclosure and submit it to us.

Inland Revenue released a public statement on 12 March 2021 regarding the new 39% tax rate, which includes a warning against avoiding the new rate (read a copy of this statement over the page). In addition, there are corresponding changes to PAYE and secondary tax rates, RLWT, ESCT, FBT, RSCT and Māori authority distribution non-declaration rates which also came into effect 1 April 2021. Employers and payroll software providers will need to ensure that payroll systems and processes are updated with the correct rates. Although the new 39% tax rate will apply to all income over $180,000 earned by an individual from 1 April 2021, please note that payers of interest such as banks and other financial institutions, are not required to make the new 39% RWT rate available to their customers until 1 October 2021.

Follow our page today linkedin.com/showcase/Inland-Revenue-NZ-for-tax-professionals AGENTS ANSWERS • Issue No 244 • April 2021 4 Public Statement issued 12 March 2021 From April 2021 a new marginal tax rate of 39% will apply to income earned by individuals over $180,000pa. There have been corresponding changes to FBT, ESCT, RLWT, RSCT, RWT and the non-declaration rate for Māori Authority distributions. These changes were introduced in the Taxation (Income Tax Rate and Other Amendments) Bill. The new tax rate might be seen by some high-income individuals as providing an increased motivation to explore ways to reduce their exposure to the new rate, however, any activity undertaken with the primary intent of reducing a person's exposure to the higher 39% marginal rate is likely to be viewed as tax avoidance. Inland Revenue has several published statements which address tax avoidance that are relevant to the introduction of the new 39% marginal tax rate. Transactions, restructuring and arrangements which exhibit features that are similar to, or align with, a scenario or arrangement contemplated in our externally published statements will always be of concern to us. We will be utilising our information gathering and data analysis capabilities to identify changes in behaviour early and will engage with those customers to understand those changes in behaviour. Examples of behaviours that might concern us include: 1. Restructuring of a personal service provider business into a company/trust coupled with a reduction in individual income; 2. Withdrawing funds from a company/trust as a loan rather than salary/dividend or other taxable distribution, especially where this results in an overdrawn current account; 3. Diverting income-distributions to low-income shareholders/beneficiaries if the benefit of the funds is still enjoyed by a high-income person; 4. Paying a spouse or family member a salary where no service is provided in return; 5. Adopting different tax treatment to bring forward income or defer expenditure; 6. Altering the timing (bringing forward or otherwise) of any income-based payment where it is linked to existing contractual terms or practice for the date for payment (bonuses, redundancy payments, vesting of share options, etc); 7. Any arrangement which alters or mitigates the application of the changes to the other impacted tax types. Our existing published statements include: • Interpretation Statement IS 13/01 "Tax Avoidance & the interpretation of BG1 and GA1" outlines the Commissioner's view of the law on tax avoidance in New Zealand. This statement was recently reviewed by Inland Revenue and released for public consultation in December 2020 (with submissions due by 31 March 2021). See the updated versions here: PUB00305 & PUB00305 QB2 (use of discretionary trusts & marginal tax rates). • Revenue Alert 11/02 considers taxpayers who divert income from a business or activity to a trust or company and when Inland Revenue will consider the arrangement tax avoidance. • Revenue Alert 18/01 & 18/01a discuss dividend stripping and when proceeds from share sales are at high risk of being treated as a dividend for income tax purposes. • Interpretation Statement 19/02 "Income tax – attribution rule for income from personal services" provides guidance on when the attribution rule for income from personal services in ss GB 27 to GB 29 will apply. • Interpretation Statement 18/01 "Taxation of Trusts – Income Tax" outlines the Commissioner's view on income tax law as it applies to Trusts, including specifying when income is required to be taxed in the hands of the beneficiary. We intend to reissue Revenue Alert 11/02 shortly. The reissue does not reflect a substantial change to our approach, we have simply reframed the existing Revenue Alert in the context of the introduction of the new marginal tax rate on 1 April 2021. Customers should think carefully about the application of these statements to their factual situation, seek advice, and if certainty is required, they should apply for a binding ruling.
AGENTS ANSWERS Inland Revenue’s tax agents’ update 1 Issue No 255 • April 2022 • IR787 2022 tax policy and remedial changes now law More than 100 policy and remedial changes have recently been passed by government as part of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2021–22, GST, and Remedial Matters) Act. Our website has new and updated information and guides reflecting these changes, which include changes to property, trusts, GST, KiwiSaver and more. There is a series of webinars covering the 2022 changes available at ird.govt.nz/2022-changes Implementation date for GST invoicing changes is April 2023 The implementation date for the changes to GST rules for invoicing and record keeping has been moved to 1 April 2023. These changes seek to modernise the record keeping and invoicing requirements for GST. More detailed information about these changes will be available in the lead up to 1 April 2023. Update to the provisional tax safe harbour rules Please remind your clients that the requirement to pay provisional tax instalments in full and on time has been removed for customers using the safe harbour option. We will only charge use-of-money-interest (UOMI) if there is still an amount unpaid after the terminal tax due date. All other existing qualifications remain, and late payment penalties still apply. We will continue to bill using the information we hold including reminder notices and alerts in myIR. Relief of use-of-money interest extension The relief of use-of-money interest (UOMI) has been extended to 8 April 2024 for taxpayers significantly adversely impacted by COVID-19. If you or your client have already let us know your client has been affected by COVID-19 you will not need to do anything. If your client has subsequently been impacted by COVID-19 you or your client will need to notify us through myIR or regular communication channels. To notify us via myIR, go to the client > I want to > Notify of impact of COVID-19. For more information go to ird.govt.nz (search keywords: s 183ABAC). FBT rate changes marketing campaign The FBT rates increased from 1 April 2021 and many customers may not be applying the best rate for their circumstances. Around 90% of customers use the single rate that is now 63.93%. It’s a good idea to review whether your clients are on the best rate. More changes have recently been enacted which aim to reduce compliance costs and simplify FBT calculations. Employers can use a flat 49.25% rate for fringe benefits provided to employees with gross annual cash pay under $160,000. This will apply retrospectively to the 2021-2022 tax year. We’re running an online advertising campaign from 18 April to 15 May aimed at FBT-registered customers to: • increase awareness of these rate changes, and • encourage them to review the rate they’re using. You can review these FBT rules and rates at ird.govt.nz/get-fringe-benefit-tax-right AGENTS ANSWERS • Issue No 255 • April 2022 2 COVID-19 support packages receipts - key information for 2022 filing This information will help your clients to fill out their tax returns for the 2021/2022 tax year. There is a “Government subsidies field” in the 2022 IR3/IR3NR returns to report taxable COVID-19 receipts. What are 2022 taxable COVID-19 receipts They include: • Wage Subsidy Scheme (WSS) – August 2021 wage subsidy payments plus payments received after 1 April 2021 for earlier schemes that were paid late. The August 2021 wage subsidy payments include all those listed on Work and Income’s website at workandincome.govt.nz/covid-19/wage-subsidy/ended-covid-19-payments.html • Leave Support Scheme (LSS) – payments received between 1 April 2021 and 31 March 2022. • Short-Term Absence Payment (STAP) – payments received between 1 April 2021 and 31 March 2022. • Cultural Sector Emergency Relief Grant (CSERG) – new grant available from 28 February 2022 – payments received up to 31 March 2022. They do not include the Resurgence Support Payment (RSP) and Covid Support Payment (CSP). These payments are not taxable income so are not reported in the “Government subsidies” field of the IR3/IR3NR. However, expenses that are paid for using these support payments are not deductible. If tax has not been deducted at source If taxable COVID-19 receipts have not had tax deducted at source, they are required to be reported in the “Government subsidies” field of the IR3/3NR. For the 2022 year, WSS, LSS, STAP amounts will pre-populate into the return and will be visible in the “Income Summary” in myIR. • They will include payment amount, date and type of payment eg WSS. • Agents and/or customers will need to verify the amount is correct before filing. • CSERG amounts will not pre-populate and must be manually added to the “Government subsidies” field. Definition of “Reportable Income” amended The definition of “reportable income” has been amended effective 1 April 2022 to include WSS, LSS and STAP (but not CSERG). This change enables some customers who were required to file an IR3 as a result of receiving these payments in 2021, to now be eligible to receive a pre-populated auto-calculated income tax assessment for 2022 if all income is now “Reportable Income”. Repayments made in the 2022 year Only repayments made in the 2022 year for subsidies that were also received in the 2022 year will be offset. Repayments made in the 2022 year for subsidies that were received in the 2021 year, will not be offset. This is because the repayment has already been recognised and offset against the subsidy which was not taxed, or not fully taxed, in the 2021 year. 2022 client questionnaires To ensure all taxable Covid-19 payment receipts are captured and the correct amounts are reported, your 2022 client questionnaires must include a question to determine which Covid-19 payments have been received by the client, either personally or through an associated entity. Updated IR1251 guide An update IR1251 2022 guide to support the above changes will be available from 1 April 2022. Agents Answers comments generally on topical tax issues relevant to tax agents.

This includes the requirement to prepare a statement of profit or loss and a statement of financial position. The Tax Administration (Financial Statements - Domestic Trusts) Order 2022 was made on 7 March 2022. This Order sets minimum standards for financial statements prepared by trusts subject to these new disclosure rules.

These write offs don’t apply to customers who are required to file an IR3 tax return but we can consider write-offs for these customers in some circumstances. You can find more information in Standard Practice Statement 18/04 Options for relief from tax debt. Individuals who have been issued a 2020 IR3 that have only received reportable income will be eligible for the write-off. You will need to contact us to have your client’s assessment type updated so the write-off can be applied. It is important to remember each taxpayer will have circumstances unique to them and there is a range of additional tax relief available for the 2020 year for those whose income has been affected by a downturn in business due to COVID-19.

This will allow you to perform intermediary functions from any level (e.g. customer or account) in myIR. • Alerts will be centralised for all clients you subscribe to. These will be sorted by client, account and due date and you’ll be able to filter them. Relevant quick links will appear against each account. You’ll also have an “Alerts” tab within the “Manage agency” link for your agency’s alerts. • You’ll be able to select up to 50 clients as favourites so you can easily access them. You’ll also be able to quickly find clients by IRD number or name through a client search screen. • When completing Employment Information (EI) files as part of the payroll process, you’ll be able to enter a negative value in the ‘prior period adjustment’ fields to adjust prior periods, if certain validations are met. • Audit correspondence will be electronic and saved in myIR. Audit letters will be visible to Owner and Administrator logons. You can see more detail on these upcoming changes at ird.govt.nz/changes-intermediaries. We’ll keep this page updated so keep an eye out. New webinars We’re kicking off a new series of webinars which will provide more detail on the changes you can expect to see in October. Our first webinars are available now on our webinar page ird.govt.nz/bt-webinars.

AGENTS ANSWERS Inland Revenue’s tax agents’ update 1 Issue No 259 • August 2022 • IR787 Cost of living payments If you have clients eligible for the Cost of Living payment (where their income tax for 31/03/2022 has been assessed), the first payment of $116.67 will be automatically paid into their bank account on Monday 1 August. Credit union customers may not receive their payment until 2 August 2022. Please note the date displayed in myIR is the processing date and may be earlier than the day the payment is received. Also, due to the large volume, payments will be staggered throughout the day of each payment date, so some customers will get paid before others. Find out more at: ird.govt.nz/cost-of-living-payment This payment is automatically paid to eligible customers. Tax agents cannot be linked to the Cost of Living account. There will be a small number of customers who are eligible whose returns will not be finalised by 1 August. This means that they will not receive the first payment on 1 August and we will contact these customers directly to advise that their eligibility will be assessed once their return has been finalised. Available Subscribed Capital record-keeping requirement This recently published statement sets out the Commissioner’s approach to applying the statutory record-keeping requirements that are necessary to substantiate distributions of Available Subscribed Capital (ASC). You can find it at taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/operational-statements/2022/os-22-01 Approved Advisor Group Status Inland Revenue would like to acknowledge that the Institute of Certified NZ Bookkeepers (ICNZB) meets the requirements under section 20B(5) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and have been granted Approved Advisor Group status by the Commissioner, with effect from 29 June 2022. Approved Advisor Groups give tax advice and follow a certain code of conduct. In being an Approved Advisor Group, members of ICNZB will be able to claim the right of non-disclosure. Provisional tax payments due on a weekend or public holiday Some intermediaries using the “standard method” for calculating instalments of provisional tax for their clients have had an issue where an instalment date falls on a weekend or a public holiday. This occurs when you pay an instalment on the next working day and file the return for the year before on the same day. Instalments (other than the final instalment) should only be calculated using a 10% uplift if the tax return for the year before has not been filed on or before the instalment date. Where the instalment date is not a working day, we treat a payment made on the next working day as being on time. A “working day” as defined in s 13 of the Legislation Act 2019 means the due date would be a Saturday, a Sunday or a public holiday. However, we also treat a return filed on the next working day as being filed on the instalment date. This means the correct calculation is a 5% uplift. The 10% uplift would only be appropriate if the return is filed after the next working day. Please note, regional anniversary days are not public holidays and are treated as working days for instalment calculation purposes. So, a 10% uplift can be used when the return is filed the day after an anniversary day. AGENTS ANSWERS • Issue No 259 • August 2022 2 Home office expenses This is a clarification of the article in Agents Answers issue No. 249 September 2021. Companies and home office expenditure A company can claim a deduction where it has reimbursed an employee or shareholder-employee for expenses incurred in the use of their home (so that the employee or shareholder-employee are not out-of-pocket) provided there is a sufficient connection between the expenses incurred and the business income that is being generated. The company needs to keep accurate records. A company cannot claim a deduction if it has not incurred the home office expenses. For example, if a company uses an employee’s or shareholder-employee’s home office (that the company does not own), and the employee / shareholder-employee pays all the expenses relating to the home office. There is more information and options for employers in Determination EE003. You can find it at taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/ (search keyword: EE003) Reimbursement of employees who work from home Determination EE003: Payments provided to employees that work from home; Employee use of telecommunications tools and usage plans in their employment. Where an employer pays an employee a reimbursement allowance for necessary additional costs incurred due to working from home, the payments may be exempt income of the employee under section CW 17 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA 2007). This means that the employee will not need to pay tax on this. For the period 1 October 2021 to 31 March 2023 Determination EE003 allows an employee to receive an exempt payment of: • $20 where they use their own telecommunications tools (such as a laptop, desktop, headset, mobile phone, home phone) and / or usage plans (such as mobile phone plan, internet plan, landline plan). • Or $15 if the employee does not use their own telecommunications tools and / or usage plans. The amount of the allowance paid may be more, but both the employer and employee will need to be able to show that they have the evidence to demonstrate that some other amount is appropriately treated as exempt income. Any amount paid will be taxable income to the employee to extent that it is higher than the costs incurred by the employee. There are additional options set out in EE003 for the following situations: • an employee uses their personal telecommunications tools and / or usage plans principally for business purposes. • an employee uses their personal telecommunications tools and / or usage plan principally for private purposes. • an employee has purchased new home office equipment. Square metre rate for premises used for both business and private purposes Operational Statement OS 19/03 An employee may also be able to apply the method in Operational Statement OS 19/03 2019 square metre rate for dual use of premises (issued 4 July 2019 and adjustments issued in 2020 and 2021) to work out their expenses and use that figure as the basis to seek reimbursement. The company may claim a deduction for the amount reimbursed. OS 19/03 provides guidance on calculating deductions under section DB 18AA Square metre rate method of the ITA 2007. It allows customers who run a business from home (ie owner operators, shareholder-employees, contactors) to use a simplified method for the calculation of deductions for premises that are used for both business and personal purposes. It removes the requirement for a customer to keep detailed records of utility costs incurred on their private residence and apportion these utilities costs between the business and private use of their residence. The amount that can be claimed as a deduction is calculated by following the detailed steps set out in OS 19/03. Guidance on how to make an adjustment for part year claims is also included in OS 19/03. You can find the OS 19/03 at taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/ (search keyword: OS 19/03) Agents Answers comments generally on topical tax issues relevant to tax agents.

AGENTS ANSWERS Inland Revenue’s tax agents’ update 1 Issue No 252 • December 2021 • IR787 RWT rate for clients earning over $180,000 a year From 1 April 2021 a new top tax rate of 39% was introduced for individuals who earn over $180,000 a year. Updating RWT rates If any of your clients will earn over this amount, any interest they earn from New Zealand bank accounts and investments will need to have the 39% resident withholding tax (RWT) rate applied. They should be able to select the 39% rate through their online banking portal. Otherwise, they’ll need to contact their bank or investment provider directly to get this updated. Inland Revenue cannot update the RWT deduction rate for customers. Other possible tax implications for these customers • As interest payers did not need to make this rate available until 1 October 2021, RWT will have been under- deducted from 1 April 2021 up until the date it was updated. • Due to the under deduction, they may have an end of year tax liability for the 2021-2022 year. • Under-deductions of RWT may also have implications for provisional tax customers. This includes clients who are already provisional taxpayers using the estimation method, or where the under-deduction will result in their residual income tax (RIT) exceeding $60,000. Emails and letters were sent in late November In late November we sent emails and letters to customers who need to update their RWT rate, and letters to tax agents acting on behalf of their clients. More information For more information about using the correct RWT rate, visit ird.govt.nz/rwt-rate or refer to the October Agents Answers. Have you filed your clients’ IR4s? Remember IR4 Companies tax returns were due on 7 July for companies that do not have an extension of time to file. Times are tough for businesses right now with the continued impacts of COVID-19. While payment is not required until 7 Feb/April 2022, you are still required to file your clients’ returns. Continuing to file ensures your information is up-to-date and accurate. It will also help support any applications for the Government’s COVID-19 relief packages. If COVID-19 has impacted your clients’ ability to pay, there are ways we can help including, by setting up an instalment arrangement in myIR to pay off tax over time. If COVID-19 has impacted their ability to file or pay then please let us know as soon as you can, as they will not be charged penalties and interest as long as they keep to the terms of the arrangement to pay off the outstanding tax. Set up an instalment arrangement in myIR. Alternatively, you can send us a note in myIR to explain the situation and we will take that into consideration. If your clients are no longer trading, remember to let us know by completing a Non-active company declaration - IR433. Go to ird.govt.nz/IR4 for more information. KiwiSaver default provider transfer As of 1 December, the KiwiSaver default providers are Bank of New Zealand, Booster, BT Funds Management (Westpac), Kiwi Wealth (Kiwibank), Simplicity and Smartshares. Following the findings of a Government review announced last May, all KiwiSaver default members must be in a balanced fund.

Follow our page today linkedin.com/showcase/Inland-Revenue-NZ-for-tax-professionals AGENTS ANSWERS • Issue No 252 • December 2021 2 What happens for your clients during the transfer process Your clients who are KiwiSaver default members with the 5 default providers that were not re-appointed (AMP, ANZ, ASB, Fisher Funds and Mercer) are now being transferred to one of the new default providers. Your clients do not need to take any action for this transfer to occur. During the transfer, any new deductions and contributions Inland Revenue receives will be sent to these members’ newly allocated default schemes. Funds that were sent to these members’ previous default schemes will be transferred from the old to the new schemes directly. This transfer process is expected to take several months as providers have 75 days to complete the necessary actions. How we are informing default members about the transfer We are informing default members about the transfer, who their new default scheme provider is, and providing a product disclosure statement that explains how their new default fund works. We are sending these in digital form where we have a valid email address, and the remainder are being sent via post. Members who have made an active choice to remain with their default provider, are under 18 or have been identified as a deceased customer by IR are not being transferred. If your clients want to confirm if they are a default member, they will need to contact their KiwiSaver provider. They can confirm who their KiwiSaver provider is by logging into myIR. More information For more information about the KiwiSaver default provider review, visit the MBIE website: mbie.govt.nz/business- and-employment/business/financial-markets-regulation/kiwisaver/kiwisaver-default-fund-changes/ Clean Car Discount scheme From 1 July 2021 the Clean Car Discount scheme was introduced to make it more affordable to buy low CO2 emission vehicles. The scheme is administered by Waka Kotahi (NZTA) who have information about the scheme on their website. nzta.govt.nz/ You can find guidance on the income tax, GST and FBT implications of the scheme, including how vehicles subject to the scheme will be valued for depreciation and FBT purposes on our website ird.govt.nz/topics/clean-car-discount-scheme Postponing customer reminder about their Small Business Cashflow loan Last month we’d planned to contact tax agents of customers who took out the Small Business Cashflow loan (SBCS) between May and July 2020. This was to remind them of the interest-free period and next steps. We’ve decided to postpone these reminders until early in the new year. We know businesses, and as a result tax agents and intermediaries, are under a lot of pressure right now. While we wanted to provide as much advanced notice as possible about SBCS loan status, including the option to avoid interest, we realise that doing so before the end of the year is too soon. We’ll provide a further update about the SBCS in the new year. Loan balances can be reviewed in myIR at any time. For more information visit ird.govt.nz/sbcs
AGENTS ANSWERS Inland Revenue’s tax agents’ update 1 Issue No 241 • December 2020 • IR787 We have several planning calendars to help you meet your obligations. Remember that if a due date falls on a weekend or public holiday, we can receive your return and payment on the next working day without a penalty being applied. But for provincial anniversary dates, this only applies if you're in the province celebrating the holiday, and only if you usually make tax payments over-the-counter at Westpac. Haven't filed your clients' companies tax returns yet? The due date for companies with an extension of time to complete their 2019 tax year IR4 was 31 March 2020. If you haven't already filed your clients' returns, it's time to do it. We know this year has been tough for a lot of businesses, but they still need to file a return. If they cannot pay their business taxes on time due to the impact of COVID-19 we may be able to help. The best thing to do is to get in touch with us as soon as you can. If your clients have not traded for more than 12 months, let us know by completing a Non-active company declaration - IR433. You can do this in myIR; go to I want...More (you’ll need the customer master link). Go to ird.govt.nz/IR4 for more information. Customer master link The customer master link is only available to tax agents and only one tax agent can have it at a time. To link at customer level, you must hold an authority to act (A2A) that allows you access to all tax types. This link controls whether you are authorised to receive mail at a customer level rather than at account level. If you: • don't have the customer master link, or • have the customer master link without mail being set to redirect to your agency the summary of account (and all mail issued at customer level) will be issued to your client. Any mail that contains multiple tax types, relates to the client themselves, rather than a particular tax type, or anything that may be of a sensitive nature, is generally sent at the customer level. Examples of letters issued at customer level include: • confirmation of an instalment arrangement • change of balance date • pre-audit review • no objection to strike off. The customer master link also allows you to: • change your client's address at the customer level as opposed to the account level in myIR • action a non-active company or trust declaration. If you hold an A2A (as above) you can also apply for an IRD number on behalf of your client. To check if you have the customer master link, run your Client List report. (continued on next page) AGENTS ANSWERS • Issue No 241 • December 2020 2 Please note that there are still some letters issued at the customer level that will continue to go to your client, even if you have the customer master link in place with mail redirected to your agency. For example, Linking/delinking letters and notice of direct credit. Read the full list of correspondence that will be sent to the client at ird.govt.nz/updates/news-folder/ letters---tax-agent-redirect Changes coming for paid parental leave in March 2021 A number of proposed changes will allow New Zealand families to manage their paid parental leave in myIR. Most of these changes impact the person applying for paid parental leave. Some customer details for self-employed people, such as contact details will be pre-populated, but the customer will still need to provide us with their income details. A regulation change will mean tax agents (or anyone with the authority to sign a statutory declaration) will no longer need to verify income details for clients applying for paid parental leave. Go to ird.govt.nz/ppl-changes for more information about the changes. Upcoming webinars Our new webinar series will tell you about some of the changes you can expect to see in 2021. You don't need to register and they're available to watch at your convenience. The first webinar is an introduction to the key changes coming next year, it is aimed at tax intermediaries. Keep an eye on our website for more videos arriving at ird.govt.nz/webinars L Letters reminder If your client has not provided you with the information needed to complete their tax return, you can issue a reminder letter (L letter): • in myIR from the tax preparer tab, or • by calling our 0800 456 678 self service line. L letters are available from 1 August to 14 February. Where D-deferred status was approved for the 2019 return filing year, the L letter will not issue for 2020 in myIR. This is a known issue we are currently investigating. You can still issue the L letter through the self-service line, provided your client has an extension of time for 2020. E-File to be decommissioned April 2021 E-File will be decommissioned on 16 April 2021. This change impacts tax agents who currently use E-File. Returns can be filed through E-File up until 16 April 2021, but we'll be encouraging tax agents that use E-File to file their clients' tax returns before 31 March 2021. E-File is being replaced with an array of new Gateway Return Services which software providers are building into their systems. They are selecting which aspects to build before E-File is decommissioned, focusing on those that are most critical for their customers. They will be talking to you about this functionality. We have been working closely with the software providers to ensure a smooth transition. The new services are designed to improve customer experience, providing similar functionality to E-File but also a lot more. For example: • we can pre-populate the information we already hold in returns • you can upload and send supporting documents to us when filing a return • some of the feedback we've had from intermediaries about things that could be improved are addressed, such as allowing up to 20 transfers on a return. If you have any questions about the new functionality, please talk to your software provider.

It applies for the period 5/11/2020 to 31/3/2021 Lessors and lessees may have agreed to extend lease terms (or intend to do so) due to the financial impacts of COVID-19. The time period in the definition of "finance lease" has been extended using s 6I of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to allow certain extended leases to continue to be treated as operating leases. • COV 20/11: Variation of section 15D(2) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 for applications to change GST taxable period This COVID-19 variation determination was issued on 4 November 2020. It applies for the period 4/11/2020 to 31/3/2021. The determination recognises that the impact of COVID-19 means some taxpayers may now wish to file on a one-monthly basis to provide earlier access to any GST refunds. It allows the change of taxable period to take effect much sooner than would otherwise be the case.

AGENTS ANSWERS Inland Revenue’s tax agents’ update 1 Issue No 231 • February 2020 • IR787 No cheques from 1 March A friendly reminder that from 1 March 2020 we will stop accepting payment by cheque, including cheques dated after 1 March 2020. There are several payment methods offered by us and the banks: • Pay online through the bank Your clients can make payments to us through their bank's online banking facilities. This can be fast, easy, secure and they can post-date their payment. • Pay online in myIR Your clients can make payments to us in their myIR account with their credit or debit card. They can also set up a direct debit and select the date of the payment. We recognise that online payments may not suit everyone. The following options are also available: • Automatic payment authority form - IR586 Your clients can set up an automatic payment from their bank account to us by completing our IR586 form and giving it to their bank. The IR586: - is most suitable for fixed or regular payments, such as debt or arrears - allows for two signatures - is available on our website, or we can post it on request. Please check bank processing times for automatic payments. • Cash or Eftpos at Westpac Your clients can make cash or Eftpos payments to us at a Westpac branch. They'll need to remember their barcode to ensure the payment can be correctly allocated. The barcode is printed on the return or statement, or created from our website ird.govt.nz/make-a-payment/paying-at-westpac We encourage you to speak with your clients that still pay by cheque to help them find the payment method that best suits them. For more information on these payment methods visit ird.govt.nz/cheques Income equalisation schemes From April 2020 we will manage income equalisation schemes in our new system. This will mean: • You can tell us about deposits, and request withdrawals for income equalisation in myIR. The paper form (the IR155) will be discontinued. • You can make deposits electronically in myIR or via internet banking. Use the new account code - EQU - Income Equalisation. (continued on next page) We have several calendars you can use to plan ahead to help you meet your obligations. Remember that if a due date falls on a weekend and public holiday, we can receive your return and payment on the next working day without a penalty being applied. AGENTS ANSWERS • Issue No 231 • February 2020 2 • All withdrawals will be paid out by direct credit. • You can see scheme balances and other transactions, such as interest, at any time in myIR under the new accounts (Income Equalisation) Note: You don't need to link to these new accounts - if you're already linked to your client for income tax, you will automatically be linked to their income equalisation scheme. • Deposits and withdrawals will be shown in your client's income summary and prepopulated into the "other income" field on their income tax returns in myIR. Once the income equalisation schemes move into our new system you will no longer need to use cheques for deposits or withdrawals. Deposits can be made using an alternative payment method and you can supply your bank account details for withdrawals. For more information about alternative payment methods visit: ird.govt.nz/payments Prescribed interest rate decreases The prescribed rate used to calculate fringe benefit tax on low-interest, employment-related loans has decreased from 5.77% to 5.26% effective 1 October 2019.

New tax technical website coming We're building a new tax technical website to help people find tax technical answers more quickly. The new site will be available on the main Inland Revenue site but will operate separately to it. We're improving the site in stages throughout 2020. This first release is planned to be available in the next few months and will make it easier to browse and search our tax technical publications, public consultations, and the Tax Information Bulletin (TIB). Over the year we will add more features including: • the ability to browse for keywords eg motor vehicles, depreciation rates • filters to narrow your results • better linking between publications and other websites • better interlinking of TIB issues and their individual publications. The development of this website follows on from our work to modernise the Inland Revenue website over the past year. Employer-provided travel from home to a distant workplace New operational statement OS 19/05 clarifies and simplifies the tax rules around employer-provided travel to distant workplaces. For example, a person who works in Wellington but lives in Auckland, or who travels greater distances in working from home or at multiple workplaces. It sets out our approach to determining whether or not employer-provided travel to a distant workplace is exempt from income tax (PAYE) or fringe benefit tax (FBT). We recognise that some taxpayers may need time to implement the approach set out in OS 19/05. We do not expect taxpayers to apply the statement to travel taken before 1 April 2020. However, taxpayers can apply the statement from the date it is issued if they wish to. You can find the statement at www.ird.govt.nz (search keyword OS 19/05).

Please note: Any draft returns or draft secure mail in myIR will be deleted during the system shutdown. Changes coming in 2021 Changes for paid parental leave in March From March (date to be confirmed), customers will be able to apply for and manage their paid parental leave in myIR. Some customer details for self-employed people, such as contact details, will be pre-populated. However, the customer will still need to provide us with their income details. This will mean that from next month tax agents will no longer need to verify income details for clients. These regulation changes are currently going through Parliament. Visit ird.govt.nz/ppl-changes for more information about the proposed changes. In mid-February we'll be sending another update to paid parental leave customers to make sure they're ready for the changes. Changes for New Zealand foreign trusts from 1 March We're making some improvements to the way we manage New Zealand foreign trusts (NZFT). We're setting up a new "NZ foreign trust account" in myIR so that from 1 March it will be easier to manage NZFTs on behalf of your clients. You'll be able to: • link to your client's NZFT account • update their details online eg connected persons • view previously provided NZFT information and send web messages in myIR instead of email • file your client's NZFT annual returns and make payments online • register an IRD number then an NZ foreign trust account in myIR or cease an account registration. You may need to consider creating different client lists if you wish to allocate different levels of access and, where appropriate, create new logons for your staff who handle NZFTs. We'll be sending an update directly to New Zealand foreign trusts later this week to remind them of the changes. More information can be found at ird.govt.nz/foreign-trust-changes (continued on next page) AGENTS ANSWERS • Issue No 242 • February 2021 2 Changes to unclaimed money from 1 March We're making improvements to the way we administer unclaimed money. Unclaimed money arises when a holder (an organisation that holds money that has been untouched by the owner for an extended period of time) makes all reasonable efforts to find the owner but is unsuccessful. Once this happens, the money and all information held about the owner, must be sent to us. What the changes mean for you The main change you will notice is a new "Unclaimed money holder" account in myIR for organisations that hold unclaimed money. This means that from 1 March you'll be able to: • link to your client's unclaimed money holder account if they submit unclaimed money • manage their details in myIR including filing, paying, viewing transactions and monitoring correspondence. Other proposed changes These changes are dependent on legislation which is expected to pass in March 2021: • The length of time that money is held before becoming "unclaimed" may change. Currently it takes 6 or 25 years depending on the type of funds. Under the revised rules all types of funds held may be deemed "unclaimed" after 5 years. There will be a transitional period of 2 years to help shift to the new timeframe. • Holders of unclaimed money may need to provide more customer information which will help claimants identify that the unclaimed money is theirs and whether to pursue a claim. • If holders have unclaimed money to send to us, they may need to submit schedules more regularly and payments will need to be made at the same time. We'll confirm the filing and payment dates once the legislation has passed. There will also be changes to the process for customers who submit a claim for unclaimed money that has been transferred to us. More information about the proposed changes can be found at ird.govt.nz/unclaimed-money-changes On 3 February we sent an update directly to holders who have recently filed unclaimed money with us, to make sure they're ready for the changes. Role of tax agents and other intermediaries We've had questions from tax agents about their role and that of other intermediaries. We've clarified how tax agents and other intermediaries can co-exist. Find out more on our website: ird.govt.nz/updates/news-folder/tax-agents-and-other-intermediaries Moving to Payday filing Version 2 From 1 April, we will require all employers to use the new payday filing format (Version 2). Version 2 has been available since April 2020 and provides more employee information and employee details than the current Version 1. Payroll software developers are those most affected by this change and we have been working with them to help ensure they build Version 2 into their systems in good time. For employers who file on-screen through myIR or paper there is no change as the Version 2 changes have been in place since April 2020. For employers who use a Payroll Bureau or Intermediary service there will likely be no impact as their payroll service provider will make any necessary changes. For employers who file through software, they should notice little change. Employers who have their own inhouse systems will need to build Version 2 into their system prior to April 2021. It's important to note that amendments to EI will have to be made using the same version as the original file. For example, if you file through Version 1 you must amend through Version 1. We are asking customers who file through software, to contact their payroll software provider if they want to know more about what will be changing and when. AGENTS ANSWERS • Issue No 242 • February 2021 3 GST treatment of payments to GST-registered bodies corporate under the Leaky Homes Financial Assistance Package (FAP) A payment under the FAP scheme from MBIE (on behalf of the Crown) to a GST-registered body corporate is subject to GST. The payments are a grant or subsidy from the Crown under section 5(6D) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 so are considered to be made in response to a supply from the body corporate. A GST-registered body corporate which receives these payments must include the GST component in their GST return and pay for any net GST output tax. A body corporate which is not registered (and not liable to be registered) for GST does not have to account for GST. The detailed position is set out in a Commissioner's Statement: CS 20/05 GST treatment of payments received by a GST registered body corporate from the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment under the Leaky Homes Financial Assistance Package. Changes to IR3 for wage subsidy recipients All wage subsidy payments are taxable to the individual who received the payment. Where an employer received and passed on the payment to their employee as part of their wages, tax was required to be deducted and returned on the Employer Information forms. For all customers who received the wage subsidy, but did not have tax deducted at source, a new box has been added to the IR3 for 2021 titled "Government Subsidies", to include this income. We recommend that wage subsidy receipts are discussed with clients when preparing their 2021 tax returns. Some clients may have received the wage subsidy directly, other clients via an associated entity. You can go to ird.govt.nz/wage-subsidies for more information about the various scenarios that apply to individuals and how to correctly report the wage subsidy in their return where an employer has not deducted PAYE. Income tax - more information requests 2020 income tax year A large number of requests for more information are yet to be finalised. You must review and confirm all "Income tax – more information requests" for each client. This includes confirming the income provided is correct and/or adding in additional income and expenses (if appropriate) before 31 March 2021. For those not confirmed by this date, an income assessment will be finalised based on the information we hold. Important reminder about final tax due date If your client has an amount to pay and an extension of time, their 2020 final tax is due 7 April 2021. Please get in touch with your client about any amount owing and advise them how and when to pay. If they can't pay you can help them through the process of making an instalment arrangement before the due date. See Instalment arrangements for clients (ird.govt.nz) To finalise the assessment • Identify clients yet to have their automatic assessments finalised. You can get this information by exporting your client list report and filtering the "Individual filing group" column to show "auto issued - more info". • Look at each individual client to check if their automatic assessment has been finalised. In myIR if this has been finalised in the income tax account you will see "ontime processed". If not you will see "request to complete." • Confirm with your client their income sources for the 2020 income year and finalise the assessment. • Select the Tax Preparer tab> enter the client IRD number> select access client> click on the Income tax account> select the periods tab> click on Request to complete> Follow the prompts to complete the client's assessment>submit. If your client has been selected for "request more information" and also has "other income" to submit you can enter the additional income at this step. Once submitted the assessment will update to your client's income tax account. Ensure your clients' bank account details are up to date so that any credits can be refunded directly to their account. AGENTS ANSWERS • Issue No 242 • February 2021 4 GST registration and continuous nil filers We will be reviewing the GST registration of customers who have been filing nil GST returns for 6 months or more. We plan to contact agents and clients to check GST registrations if we consider that the GST activity might have ceased. We are aware that a lot of businesses affected by Covid 19 will not have had their usual level of activity during 2020 and we will take that into account in our contact selection. As part of your end of year client review, and to help clients maintain correct tax registrations and reduce administration or compliance costs, you may wish to look at whether some of your clients should be ceasing their GST registration. Please also remember to check whether an apportionment or change-of-use adjustment is required for any non-taxable use of goods or services. There may be output tax payable for assets retained at cessation so contact us early if alternative payment arrangements need to be considered. We will continue this process on an on-going basis. Tax pooling transfers from purchased funds that become excess tax If an excess arises from purchased tax pooling funds, special rules apply to the effective date the excess is available at to transfer. The amount of the excess tax can only be: • transferred forward to a future provisional or terminal tax liability of the tax payer with an effective date no earlier than the start of the year it is being transferred to, or • transferred to a tax type of the tax payer for which tax pooling is allowed to be used to pay an increased amount of tax with an effective date no earlier than the original due date for that tax type, or • transferred to another tax obligation of the tax payer or to another tax payer with an effective date no earlier than the date the request to transfer the excess purchased tax pooling funds is received, or • refunded. Where a transfer request does not comply with tax pooling rules, we will decline the request, or reverse it if it has been processed incorrectly. You can find more technical information in Tax Information Bulletin, Vol 23 No 8, Oct 2011 pages 40 to 42. Calculating the tax payable on beneficiary income We're changing 2 of our guides (IR6G and IR288) to make it clearer how trustees should be working out the tax they need to pay on income allocated to beneficiaries as beneficiary income. Where trustees are paying tax on behalf of the beneficiaries, they must first calculate tax on the total taxable income of the beneficiary, including other income not received from the estate or trust. As set out in the guide, the normal tax rates for that level of taxable income are to be used. It is not correct to apply the normal tax rates to just the beneficiary income from the trust. After calculating the tax on the total taxable income, the proportion of beneficiary income to the total taxable income determines the tax to be paid by the trustees on the beneficiary income. The changes are to the guides for the year ended 31 March 2021 and following. We will not be devoting resources to identifying underpaid tax on beneficiary income by trustees who may have incorrectly calculated the tax payable relying on previous guides.

It is designed to sit alongside public ruling BR Pub 14/09: Meaning of 'Anything Occurring on Liquidation' When a Company Requests Removal from the Register of Companies. It confirms that the first step legally necessary to achieve liquidation when a liquidator is appointed is the special resolution of shareholders to appoint a named liquidator. QB 20/04: Do certain supplies wholly or partly consist of land for the compulsory zero-rating (CZR) rules? This new QWBA is a follow-up to Interpretation Statement IS 17/08 and provides guidance on the meaning of land for the purposes of the compulsory zero-rating (CZR) rules. It confirms that a supply that wholly or partly consists of land (and which satisfies certain other requirements) must be zero-rated for GST purposes. IS 20/09: GST – Unconditional gifts This interpretation statement provides guidance on the meaning of "unconditional gift" for GST purposes. A payment made to a GST-registered non-profit body that is an "unconditional gift" is not "consideration" for a supply of goods or services and is not subject to GST. IS 20/09 replaces two earlier articles published in Tax Information Bulletin, November 1990 and July 1991.

AGENTS ANSWERS Inland Revenue’s tax agents’ update 1 Issue No 236 • July 2020 • IR787 We have several planning calendars to help you meet your obligations. Remember that if a due date falls on a weekend or public holiday, we can receive your return and payment on the next working day without a penalty being applied. But for provincial anniversary dates, this only applies if you're in the province celebrating the holiday, and only if you usually make tax payments over-the-counter at Westpac. COVID-19: New self-service options for customers facing hardship Use-of-money interest and penalties remission You and your clients can now apply through myIR for remission of penalties and interest if they have been impacted by COVID-19. You would have received an email advising of this on 8 June 2020. Log in to myIR. In myIR, under the client, select the "I want to" menu, then click "notify of impact by covid-19". The following criteria apply for requests for remission: • Some or all amounts owing were due on or after 14 February 2020. • The customer's ability to pay by the due date, either physically or financially, has been significantly affected by COVID-19. • The customer has contacted us as soon as practicable to request relief and will be required to pay the outstanding tax as soon as practicable. Once you or your client have submitted a request, you cannot submit another one. Although if you or your client wish to provide more information you can send a web message through myIR. Instalment arrangements A similar process will apply for setting up an instalment arrangement in myIR. There is a new check box at the end of the self-service instalment arrangement process – 'I have been affected by COVID-19'. This is subject to the same criteria as use-of-money interest and penalties remission. When processed, the arrangement will take effect automatically overnight. However, if the arrangement defaults, and the core tax is not paid, the penalties and interest will be reinstated from the original due date. If your client gets into this position, we strongly recommend that they contact us as soon as possible to discuss other options that may be available to them. Small business cashflow (loan) scheme applications extended to 24 July Applications for the small business loan have been extended until 24 July. Businesses can apply for a loan through myIR. Eligible businesses will be entitled to a loan amount of $10,000 plus $1,800 per full-time-equivalent employee, to a maximum of $100,000. The annual interest rate is 3% beginning from the date of the loan being provided. Interest will not be charged if the loan is fully repaid within 1 year.

Income tax – more information requests Individual clients who don't have an extension of time (EOT) and have received an 'Income tax – more information request' letter have 45 days to review and finalise their assessment. The letter will confirm the date it needs to be finalised by. You can see your client's 2020 EOT status by filtering the 'Current year EOT status' column on your client list report. You (or your client) must review this information (add in any additional income and expenses, if appropriate) and finalise it within the required timeframe. If your client's mail is being redirected, this letter will be sent to you. Otherwise, it will go directly to your client. If we do not hear from you within the set timeframe, we'll assume the information is correct and finalise the income tax assessment.

AGENTS ANSWERS Inland Revenue’s tax agents’ update 1 Issue No 247 • July 2021 • IR787 We have several planning calendars to help you meet your obligations. Remember that if a due date falls on a weekend or public holiday, we can receive your return and payment on the next working day without a penalty being applied. But for provincial anniversary dates, this only applies if you're in the province celebrating the holiday, and only if you usually make tax payments over-the-counter at Westpac. Bright-line regular campaign launches from June A bright-line direct marketing campaign advises customers who have recently sold/transferred a residential property to check whether the bright-line property rule applies. The letters will be issued under the client's IRD number. The tax agent redirect will determine whether the letter goes to the customer or their tax agent. The bright-line campaign letters will be available in myIR. We cannot send one letter with all your clients' information on it as we need to make sure client information from secure lists is not visible to all agency administrators. One letter to the agency would be visible to all owners and administrators in myIR. We will send these letters as soon as we become aware of a potential bright-line property transaction, usually within a month of the transaction, to give you or your client an early head's up. If the property sale/transfer is subject to the bright-line property rule and your client has not completed the Bright-line residential property sale information form – IR833, please complete and file the form. Otherwise let us know by email if the bright- line property rule does not apply to your client's transaction. Accounting for Wage Subsidy Scheme (WSS) payments in IR3/IR3NR return The 2021 income tax filing season's here. Any wage subsidies received by clients (including indirectly from an associated entity) need to be returned in their IR3/IR3NR's. If the WSS payment was fully taxed at source, they don't need to report this separately. Where tax has not been deducted automatically and included in Employer Information forms, your clients need to return the WSS payments in the new 'Government subsidies' field. We've added a 'Wage Subsidies Received' indicator to customers that received a WSS payment directly and to customers that received one from an associated entity. This ensures IR3s are issued to these customers as they cannot receive an automatically issued income tax assessment. If a client got their subsidy from their employer, they won't have this indicator. New guide IR1251 Accounting for the wage subsidy – example scenarios for individuals We've produced an IR1251 guide which you can find at ird.govt.nz (search keywords: wage subsidy self- employed). This guide includes examples for sole traders, partners, shareholder-employees, trustees and other people that have received the subsidy either directly or indirectly (through their business). We've made changes in myIR If your clients received a WSS payment directly, the WSS amount is pre-populated into the Government subsidies field in their IR3/IR3NR for 2021, but you can change it, for example, if a portion of the subsidy was included in the 2020 year or some/all of it was repaid by 31 March 2021. (continued on next page) AGENTS ANSWERS • Issue No 247 • July 2021 2 You might also need to change the information if they received money indirectly without tax deducted or received Leave Support Scheme or Short-Term Absence payments. Please note: for software users, the wage subsidy details are now available in Gateway Services but will only pre- populate if your provider has updated their software to make this information available to you. We're also aware of issues with WSS amounts not displaying in the income summary in myIR. We are working on this. Tips to help you: • Check whether WSS payments are included and whether they were received directly, indirectly, or both, and to both business and personal bank accounts. • Wage subsidies must pass to an individual person (or be refunded to the Ministry of Social Development). For companies in a loss position the WSS payment must still go to the shareholder. • Shareholder-employees that get a regular salary may have tax deducted - you must check the payment date and relevant weeks for that specific WSS payment to determine if it was fully taxed, for example, for the wage subsidy, was this fully passed on within 12 weeks after payment? • Salary/wage expenditure that is funded by a wage subsidy payment is non-deductible. 2021 Income tax – more information request From the end of May through to the end of July all individual clients of tax agents (excluding IR3 filers) will receive an 'Income Tax – more information request' letter. Clients who have been issued an 'Income tax – more information request' that requires finalising will display a filing expectation of 'Auto-issued – more info' under the "individual filing group' column on your client list report. Individual clients who don't have an extension of time (EOT) and have received an 'Income tax – more information request' letter will have 45 days to review and finalise their income tax assessment. The letter will confirm the date it needs to be finalised by. You can see your client's 2021 EOT status by filtering the 'Current year EOT status' column on your client list report.

Valuing assets when selling From 1 July new rules come into force for how assets are to be valued when they are sold as a bundle, for example a sale of commercial property or a business. Typically, a buyer wants more of the price to be allocated to taxable or depreciable assets, while a seller wants less. The new rules make it clear that both parties have to make the same allocation. The rules also set out the process that must be followed if the buyer and seller can't agree an allocation, which includes notifying Inland Revenue.

AGENTS ANSWERS Inland Revenue’s tax agents’ update 1 Issue No 258 • July 2022 • IR787 First time provisional tax liabilities satisfied by tax pooling credits and the early payment discount Since the introduction of income tax to the START system, we haven’t allowed early payment discounts (EPD) for customers who used tax pooling credits to pay their provisional tax liability. This has impacted the 2019, 2020 and 2021 income tax years and some late processed 2018 income tax returns. On review, it was determined that the Income Tax Act (ITA) did not permit taxpayers to claim the EPD when the provisional tax liability was satisfied by use of tax pooling credits. The ITA has since been amended so that it now allows EPD to be applied for taxpayers using tax pooling credits. This legislative change applies to the 2020 income tax year onwards. The legislative amendments have resulted in the following outcomes for taxpayers: 2020 income year onwards For eligible taxpayers for 2020 years onwards, where the return is filed after the changes have been made in START, the crediting of the EPD will happen automatically. For eligible taxpayers whose 2020 and 2021 income tax returns were received prior to the START change being made, these will require manual intervention by us. If you have customers who are in this category, please review the affected return in myIR. If this EPD has not been now granted, please contact us. 2018 and 2019 income years Currently the law does not permit taxpayers to claim the EPD if they use tax pooling credits to satisfy a first-time provisional tax liability in these years. We are currently reviewing this situation and a further update will follow. Use-of-money interest (UOMI) rate change – date correction The article about the new UOMI rates in our May AA issue incorrectly stated the rates were effective from 9 May 2022.

New look newsletter update As mentioned last month, we are updating our newsletters to provide you with a better, more consistent approach to make it easier for you to know where to go for the latest news from Inland Revenue. Here’s a reminder about what is changing: • The look of all our newsletters will be refreshed making them easier to read and recognise as from Inland Revenue. • We’re combining this Agents Answers and the Tax Intermediaries Update into one newsletter. You’ll initially begin receiving this fortnightly, however you will get the option to change the frequency via a subscription centre on our website. • The new subscription centre on our website will give you the option to ‘opt-in’ (or opt-out) of all our newsletters and to choose the frequency for when they’re sent to you. When is this change happening? We’re just making the final changes now so expect to receive the new look newsletter in your inbox from around August.
AGENTS ANSWERS Inland Revenue’s tax agents’ update 1 Issue No 235 • June 2020 • IR787 We have several planning calendars to help you meet your obligations. Remember that if a due date falls on a weekend or public holiday, we can receive your return and payment on the next working day without a penalty being applied. But for provincial anniversary dates, this only applies if you're in the province celebrating the holiday, and only if you usually make tax payments over-the-counter at Westpac. COVID-19 initiatives Recently the Government announced more tax changes to assist New Zealand businesses manage the impacts of COVID-19. Small business cashflow (loan) scheme (SBCS) Applications are now open until 12 June for the Small Business Cashflow Scheme (SBCS) - a one-off loan to businesses impacted by COVID-19. The SBCS is for businesses with 50 full-time equivalent employees or less, including sole traders and those that are self-employed. In most cases, eligible businesses will be entitled to a loan amount of $10,000 plus $1,800 per full- time-equivalent employee, to a maximum of $100,000. The eligibility criteria is the same as for the Wage Subsidy Scheme (WSS) and businesses can apply even if they haven't applied for the WSS. Businesses will have to declare they're a viable business, use the money for core business operating costs and enter into a legally binding loan contract. Applications for the loan are now open in myIR account under "I want to" and are open till 12 June 2020. Funds will be paid directly into your business bank account within 5 working days once approved. You must be legally allowed to borrow money for your entity to be able to apply for the SBCS loan. This means you cannot apply for the loan on behalf of your clients. For more details on how the scheme will work, eligibility criteria and a calculator to determine the loan amount that can be borrowed, go to ird.govt.nz/Covid19 Temporary loss carry-back Businesses expecting to make a loss in either the 2020 year or the 2021 year can use that loss to offset profits they made the year before. In other words, they can carry the loss back 1 year to the preceding income year. This can be done before the loss year return is filed. There are 2 ways to claim your loss carry-back. • Include the carried-back loss in your tax return – we will automatically refund any overpaid tax. • Ask for a refund of any provisional tax you have paid for 2020 if you are going to carry back a loss from 2021. We can refund some or all of the tax already paid for the preceding year before the loss year has finished by enabling customers to estimate their loss. Note: These loss carry-back refunds will be paid out to the bank account we have on record, including to where there are redirects in place. They will not be offset against other debt your clients may have due (except debt for income tax in the same period). So please continue to help your clients who have any other payments due - the usual payment options are available. (continued on next page) AGENTS ANSWERS • Issue No 235 • June 2020 2 If your clients choose to use the loss carry-back scheme they (or you on their behalf) must first elect to participate in the scheme under the "I want to" section of myIR. Refunds will be processed quicker for claims made through myIR. Log in or register for a myIR account today. Note: You do not need to have filed the loss year return to claim the loss carry-back. For more information, how to claim and implications for shareholder employees go to ird.govt.nz/loss-carry-back New discretion to vary requirement To help customers manage the impacts of COVID-19, Inland Revenue now has a discretion to vary a requirement when it would be impossible, impractical or unreasonable to comply as a consequence of COVID-19. Under this new discretion, we can extend a due date, deadline, time period or timeframe. It is also possible to modify a procedural or administrative requirement, such as the way that something must be done. We'll let you know when any change is made through our website and other communication channels as appropriate. Go to ird.govt.nz/Updates/News-Folder/covid-19-new-discretion-to-vary-a-requirement- under-an-inland-revenue-act for more information.

New rules for reporting residential property income From the 2019-20 income year onwards, you can now only claim deductions up to the total amount of income you earn from your residential rental property. You can no longer use excess deductions from your property to offset other income such as salary and wages. Most residential properties are subject to the new residential property deduction rules (also known as the ring- fencing rules). The rules do not apply to some residential properties such as your main home and residential properties that are subject to the mixed-use asset rules. Including residential property income in your income tax return The new rules mean that when you complete your 2019-20 income tax return, your total residential rental property deductions generally cannot be more than your residential property income. If you have excess deductions, also known as rental losses, this amount must be carried forward to the next year that you earn income from your residential property. If you sell your residential property and still have excess deductions these can be transferred to another residential rental property. If you own more than one residential rental property you can combine their income and deductions if you use the portfolio method. You will now enter the residential rental information in the "Residential rental income" (for myIR) or "Residential property" (for paper return) section of your income tax return. (continued on next page) AGENTS ANSWERS • Issue No 235 • June 2020 3 In myIR you will need to manually select "Residential rental income". Currently, the "Other Rental Income" box in myIR is automatically selected - this is for the like of commercial properties where a loss can still be claimed. If you have residential rental income you must: • make sure both "Residential rental income" and "Other rental income" are selected in the "Build your return" section • leave the "Other rental income" fields as nil if you do not have other rental income. If you do have other rental income (property that the residential rental property deduction rules do not apply to) then complete those fields as normal. We encourage you to use the Residential property deductions worksheet - IR1226 to help you work out the amounts and where to enter these in your income tax return. We also encourage you to use the Rental income guide - IR264 and the relevant income tax return guide. You can find these on our website. For more information about the residential property deduction rule changes go to ird.govt.nz/ring-fencing Income tax – request for more information for linked clients Until the end of July, we're sending income tax assessments in batches to most New Zealanders. However, this year we've changed the process for your linked clients who receive reportable income only, ie they are not IR3 customers. Any clients you're linked to, at the time we process them, will be issued an "Income tax – more information request". If your client mail is being redirected, this letter will be sent to you. Otherwise, it will go directly to your client. You (or your client) will need to review, add any more information needed, and complete the assessment. If you (or your client) don't review and complete the assessment, we'll complete it automatically: • on 31 March 2021 if your client has an Extension of Time (EOT) • after 45 days if your client does not have an EOT. Check out our on-demand webinar for more details ird.govt.nz/about-us/business-transformation/webinars It's also a good time to check your clients' details are up to date, including their bank account details. Kilometre rates for the business use of vehicles for the 2020 income year Instead of making a claim for the business use of a motor vehicle based on the actual costs, a taxpayer may elect to have a deduction for the business use portion based on a kilometre rate method. In accordance with section DE 12 of the Income Tax Act 2007, the Commissioner must from time to time set the kilometre rates for the business use of vehicles as an alternative method for businesses to claim motor vehicle running costs. As the Commissioner relies on third-party information to set the kilometre rates and that information is not yet available to us due to COVID-19, we cannot review the present rates. The 2019 kilometre rates will continue to apply for the time being. We will review the rate once we get the information from our third-party. In the meantime, taxpayers can file returns and if there is a material change once we do set the new rates, they may adjust their 2020 motor vehicle expense claims under section 113 or section 113A of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Employers may continue to use the current rates as a reasonable estimate of expenditure incurred by an employee for the business use of a private motor vehicle, until these rates are reviewed. The current rates are: Vehicle typeTier one rateTier two rate Petrol or diesel79 cents30 cents Petrol hybrid79 cents19 cents Electric79 cents9 cents Operational Statement 19/04 provides further information on the use of the kilometre rates.

Follow our page today linkedin.com/showcase/Inland-Revenue-NZ-for-tax-professionals AGENTS ANSWERS • Issue No 235 • June 2020 4 Direct debits in myIR We have made some changes to the direct debit process. You can no longer initiate a direct debit payment for your client to approve in myIR. If your client wants to pay us by direct debit, they'll need to set up an "authority" for their own bank account in myIR. Setting up the authority is a one-off process and your client will need to do this separately for each new bank account before a direct debit payment can be made. However, you can continue to pay by direct debit for a client if you have sole signing authority on the bank account being used. For example, if it's your agency's own bank account or your client has organised this authority with their bank. This replaces the old process where you confirmed you had sole signing authority on a bank account by ticking a box when you set up the payment. New bank account update service A new bank account service on the IR website enables individual clients to update their bank accounts in limited circumstances. That is, if we have been unable to issue them a disbursement as they either have no bank account listed, or the disbursement has been returned by the bank. The "Failed Direct Credit" and "Bank account Number Required" letters we send have been updated to include the option for clients to use the new service on the website, with the URL and a unique token. The unique token: • will always start with '47' • will only be valid for 30 days, and • can only be used once. The letters will be sent directly to clients with or without a myIR account unless the tax agent has the refund re-direct on. We will perform validation checks on the web requests. If the client's bank account is successfully updated, we will send the standard letter confirming the bank account update. If the web request fails validation, we will issue a Failed bank account update letter requesting the bank account be updated within myIR or asking the client to contact Inland Revenue. Website changes complete and tax technical site live Our work to redevelop the Inland Revenue website is complete, with all content now housed on our new site. This includes the first release of our new and improved tax technical website www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz, the place to go to view all rulings, determinations, interpretation statements and more. Over the past few months we've been beta-testing the tax technical site. The customer feedback received helped us further improve this website before the official release. We'll make further improvements to the site throughout 2020.
AGENTS ANSWERS Inland Revenue’s tax agents’ update 1 Issue No 246 • June 2021 • IR787 We have several planning calendars to help you meet your obligations. Remember that if a due date falls on a weekend or public holiday, we can receive your return and payment on the next working day without a penalty being applied. But for provincial anniversary dates, this only applies if you're in the province celebrating the holiday, and only if you usually make tax payments over-the-counter at Westpac. Business Finance Guarantee Scheme ends 30 June 2021 On 30 June 2021, the Business Finance Guarantee Scheme (BFGS) will cease. This means that any BFGS loans must be approved, signed and documented by 30 June 2021 to be eligible. However, the loan does not have to be drawn down by this date. As any loan applications submitted under the BFGS involve a heavily administrative process to approve, it is recommended that these are submitted as soon as possible to meet the close date. For more information visit treasury.govt.nz/news-and-events/news/business-finance-guarantee-scheme- conclude-30-june Have your clients received the wage subsidy? If your client received the wage subsidy during the 2020–21 tax year, this is taxable income. If they received it through an employer with tax deducted, you do not need to do anything else. However, if your client is: • self-employed, or • received the wage subsidy directly, or • through an associated entity (for example a company, partnership, or trust) and tax was not deducted you'll need to declare this income by completing an Individual tax return IR3. For the 2020 year the income needs to go in the "other income" field and for the 2021 year onwards it needs to go in the "Government Subsidies" field. For more information on how to declare the wage subsidy not taxed at source, go to ird.govt.nz (search keywords: wage subsidy self-employed). AGENTS ANSWERS • Issue No 246 • June 2021 2 2021 End of year process – Individual income tax assessments From the end of May through to the end of July we'll be issuing automatic income tax assessments for most New Zealanders. For tax agents, there have been minimal changes to the process from last year. However, from the 2021 tax year there are a few things that now form part of an individual's end of year process. These are: • If a New Zealand tax resident has portfolio investment entity (PIE) income, a PIE square-up is included in their individual income tax return. • A "Government subsidies" field in the IR3 income tax return to add any wage subsidy received that has not been taxed at source. All individual clients of tax agents (excluding IR3 filers) will receive an 'Income tax – more information request' letter. If your client's mail is being redirected, you will receive this. Otherwise, it will go directly to your client. Clients who have been issued an "Income tax – more information request" that requires finalising, will display a filing expectation of "Auto-issued – more info" under the "Individual filing group" column on your client list report. You (or your client) must review this information, add any additional income and expenses as appropriate, and finalise within the required timeframe, ie • before 31 March if your client has an extension of time (EOT) • within 45 days if your client doesn't have an EOT. The letter will confirm the date it needs to be finalised by according to the client's situation. You can see your clients 2021 EOT status by filtering the "Current year EOT status" column on your client list report. If you are using Gateway services software to send income tax returns to us, you may also be able to "confirm" or amend the "more information request" in your software. Talk to your provider as to whether they offer this functionality. If you don't use Gateway services or don't have the above functionality in your software, you will need to use myIR to finalise the assessment.

If your clients own residential property, deductions (expenses) can only be claimed up to the total amount of income they earn from residential rental property. You can no longer use excess deductions from property to offset income from other sources, such as salary and wages. Most residential rental properties are subject to the residential property deduction rules (also known as the ring- fencing rules). The rules do not apply to some residential properties, such as the main home, and residential properties that are subject to the mixed-use asset rules. For more information about the rules, and how to include residential rental income in income tax returns, go to ird.govt.nz/ring-fencing Real estate sector campaign As you may be aware Inland Revenue is looking closely at real estate salesperson/agent customer groups. We have identified that these groups are claiming a high level of expenses relative to their income. Our information suggests some of these customers are claiming private expenses and are not keeping logbooks or retaining other business records to support a deduction. Our initial approach was to raise awareness and provide education tools to encourage customers to do the right thing from the start. These materials are available on our website ird.govt.nz/pages/campaigns/real-estate-agents We're now moving to the next phase of our campaign, identifying those customers that fall outside industry norms. If we're concerned someone has overclaimed expenses or we identify other compliance risks, we'll send you a letter on behalf of your clients, asking you to review their tax returns and provide records to support expenses claimed.

AGENTS ANSWERS Inland Revenue’s tax agents’ update 1 Issue No 257 • June 2022 • IR787 Campaign for residential rental property interest limitation rules New interest limitation rules have been introduced which phase out the ability to allow interest paid on loans as deductible expenditure when the loan was for a residential rental property. We did an initial awareness campaign in March and we’re now also running targeted online and radio advertising. Direct marketing (letters and emails) is planned for early June. The campaign targets potentially impacted customers: • confirming the rules have been passed into law, and • directing them to information and tools to help them understand if and how they may be affected. Customers with a redirect to a tax agent will be excluded from the direct marketing communications. Flu vaccine vouchers and FBT With flu season underway, a reminder that FBT is not payable on flu vaccine vouchers provided by an employer to a staff member to get their vaccination done at their doctor (or some other clinic). These vouchers are exempt under section CX 24 Benefits related to Health and Safety of the Income Tax Act 2007. Updating our trusts content on the website With the recent legislative changes, we are aware that you have some questions about trusts. We will be updating our content on the website over the next few weeks to answer some of the questions you’ve asked us. In the meantime, if you have any urgent questions, please continue to email them to your agent account manager. Our improved newsletters will give you more choice Soon we’ll be introducing a new-look newsletter with subscription options so you can choose what interests you and how often you want to receive it. This includes the various tax policy, tax technical and tax agent publications. We have listened to customer feedback and we’ve heard you would like a: • similar experience across all of our publications • visual design that matches our websites and makes working between the 2 easier • “one-stop shop” so you can consolidate various mailing lists and receive information all in one place • central place to view and amend your subscription options. We’re combining the Tax Intermediaries Update and Agents Answers into the “Tax Agents Newsletter”. There will be options to include Tax Technical headlines and a list of the current public consultations. Important Messages will receive a refreshed look and will also be available on our website. This new design will reduce duplication of information and ensure the updates you receive are the most current. You do not need to do anything – your existing subscriptions to the newsletters you receive will remain the same. However, you will now have the option to consolidate what you receive from us, and choose whether to receive this weekly, fortnightly or monthly. We’ll be in touch with more information closer to the time, including a link for updating your subscription options (should you choose to do so).

The time period in the definition of “finance lease” has been extended using s 6I of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to allow certain extended leases to continue to be treated as operating leases.

This includes clients who have had an: • income tax assessment issued • income tax assessment request where more information has subsequently resulted in a refund. To ensure your clients receive any refunds they are entitled to, please update their bank account details in myIR. Or you can use the refund redirect option if you hold written authority to receive client refunds and operate a disbursement account. If you want to set up a disbursement account to receive client refunds please contact your Account Manager. Please do not to add your own agency bank account to the client's account. (continued on next page) AGENTS ANSWERS • Issue No 232 • March 2020 2 To add a client's bank account in myIR Select the Tax Preparer tab>enter the client's IRD number>click access client, select the Income Tax account> click More next to I want to> Under payment and refunds section select update a refund bank account.

Automatically issued income tax assessments - request for more information 2018/2019 income tax year Please confirm the income is correct or add in the additional income by 31 March 2020. For those not confirmed or where there is no additional information provided, an income assessment will be finalised based on the information we hold. To finalise the assessment • Identify clients yet to have their automatic assessments finalised. You can get this information by exporting your client list report and filtering the 'Individual filing group' column to show 'auto issued - more info'. • You will need to look at each individual client to check if their automatic assessment has been finalised. In myIR if this has been finalised in the income tax account you will see "ontime processed" if not you will see "request to complete." • Confirm with your client their income sources for the 2018/2019 income year and finalise the assessment. Select the Tax Preparer tab> enter the client IRD number> select access client> click on the Income tax account> select the periods tab> click on Request to complete> Follow the prompts to complete the client's assessment>submit. If your client has been selected for 'request more information' and also has 'other income' to submit you can enter the additional income at this step. Once submitted the assessment will update to your client's income tax account. Ensure your clients' bank account details are up to date so that any credits can be refunded directly to their account. If your client has a debit and an extension of time, their 2019 terminal tax is due 7 April 2020. Keeping email addresses up to date in myIR We've recently noticed a growing number of our customers' email addresses are no longer in use or have been changed without letting us know. This applies to both you and your customers. If a tax agent leaves your firm, the responsibility for ceasing logon for that user sits with the account owner. With the next stage of transformation just around the corner, and our move to more digital services, it's more important than ever to have up-to-date email contacts. Please check your myIR account and update any email addresses or cease any logons that are no longer required if necessary. Please also pass this reminder on to your clients. SPS 20/01 Tax payments - when received in time We have recently published a standard practice statement that sets out Inland Revenue's practice for accepting tax payments as having been received in time. From 1 March 2020, we will no longer accept cheques as a method for payment of tax. Customers are encouraged to use direct banking facilities when they make tax payments (or when refunds are issued). You can find SPS 20/01 at www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: SPS 20/01, then click "Technical" at top of page). AGENTS ANSWERS • Issue No 232 • March 2020 3 Updating investment income allocations in myIR for 1 April reporting changes From 1 April investment income reporting is changing. If your clients receive investment income, you will need to ensure that their investment income payer (eg their bank) has their IRD number to avoid being them charged the non-declaration rate of 45%. If your client has a joint account, we will split any investment income reported equally across all the joint account holders who have provided a valid IRD number to the payer. If this allocation isn't correct, you can update it in myIR using the following steps: 1. Select the income tax account 2. In the Earning summary section, select view details 3. Select the income period dates for the period the investment income was earned. 4. Select Update investment percentage. 5. Next to the payer they have received investment income from, select view detail 6. All accounts listed with that payer will show, along with an account identifier (as provided by the payer) and ownership percentage. Select View detail. Note: If an account identifier hasn't been provided by the payer, it will show "not identified". You can continue with the below steps if this shows. 7. The table shows the dates the income has been received. Select Add ownership period. 8. Complete the From field and the Ownership percentage field. Then click next. Note: If the To field is left blank, the updated percentage will remain until you advise us otherwise. 9. Review the details and select the Confirmation checkbox. Click Submit. The percentage and income received in the dates provided will be updated instantly. The update will only be made to the individual's ownership percentage. Other account holders will need to update their details separately. For more information about investment income reporting changes visit ird.govt.nz/investment-income Deducting financial arrangement expenditure that arises from foreign exchange losses If your client is a New Zealand tax resident required to apply the financial arrangement rules to foreign bank accounts or term deposits, expenditure that arises from a decline in value of foreign currency may be deductible. This is despite the accounts or deposits being held or used for private or non-business purposes. The general permission will be satisfied for both interest-bearing and interest-free bank accounts and deposits. Also the private limitation will not apply to deny a deduction. The financial arrangements rules do not apply to excepted financial arrangements. This means that the above will not be relevant to a bank account that is a "variable principal debt instrument" of someone who holds instruments of that type with a total NZ dollar value every day of $50,000 or less. Different considerations apply for borrowing transactions. So, the deductibility discussed above only covers deposits and bank accounts with credit balances at year end. Any of your clients who think they have been adversely affected by Inland Revenue action or advice on this issue in the past may ask for their position to be reviewed. Requests will be considered on a case by case basis according to the principles set out in Standard Practice Statement 16/01 - Requests to amend assessments. New website for Research and Development Tax Incentive The Research and Development Tax Incentive (RDTI) supports Government's target to increase New Zealand's R&D expenditure to 2% of GDP by 2027. In February a new RDTI website was introduced to help businesses understand the benefits of undertaking R&D and to encourage more businesses to invest in it. Designed for busy business-decision-makers, the website features an easy-to-follow introductory guide to RDTI eligibility and a step-by-step overview of how to apply. If you have clients who undertake R&D or may be considering it, we encourage you to point them to this site. The RDTI is jointly administered by Inland Revenue and Callaghan Innovation, and information on the new website has been developed collaboratively by both agencies with support from MBIE.

Follow our page today linkedin.com/showcase/Inland-Revenue-NZ-for-tax-professionals AGENTS ANSWERS • Issue No 232 • March 2020 4 RWT exemption register We have introduced a new online RWT exemption register that lists the IRD numbers of all customers who are exempt from having RWT deducted from the interest and dividends they receive. Currently we issue successful applicants with a certificate of exemption from RWT. This process will remain in place until 31 March 2020. From 1 April, payers of investment income (eg payers of interest and dividends) will access the register to confirm which of their customers have RWT exempt status. They will no longer ask for or accept physical certificates of exemption. The register: • is automatically populated by Inland Revenue • identifies customers only by their IRD number • can be searched by exemption status, IRD number and when the information was last updated • is updated overnight every business day (Monday to Friday) - so it provides near real time information. Payers can use the register now to verify if a customer has an exemption, or to check the exemption status (eg cancelled, revoked or end-dated, ie expired). If a customer has an exemption under an Act that is not administered by Inland Revenue, they may need to apply to us to be included on the register. If you are a charity registered with Charities Services you do not need to apply for RWT exempt status. We will automatically put you on the register. A factsheet has been developed to help payers understand what the changes from 1 April 2020 will mean for them. You can find out more and access the register and factsheet at ird.govt.nz/rwt-exemption Tax technical beta site available in late March As part of our work to build a new and improved tax technical website, we're making a beta, or test version available ahead of the first published release. We're planning to make the beta site available in late March, accessible via the existing tax technical section of the Inland Revenue website. We're keen to get your thoughts and feedback on the new look and feel, features and layout of the tax technical site and we encourage you to visit the beta version when it's available. You will be able to provide comments using the feedback button on each beta page. Feedback we receive during this time will help us to improve the site before the first release. Key services unavailable over Easter For a few days in April over the Easter break we'll be undergoing system changes to make tax more straightforward. At this time, myIR will be unavailable and our offices and phone lines will be closed. We'll update you with exact dates and times in our April Agents Answers and on our website closer to the time. Tax relief - COVID-19 Coronavirus Tax relief and income assistance is available to people affected by the downturn in business due to the COVID-19 Coronavirus. We have a range of ways to help depending on your clients' circumstances. Agents are asked to please work with your clients about what they need to do. There is more information on the tax relief available at ird.govt.nz/Updates/News-Folder/tax-relief-coronavirus
AGENTS ANSWERS Inland Revenue’s tax agents’ update 1 Issue No 243 • March 2021 • IR787 We have several planning calendars to help you meet your obligations. Remember that if a due date falls on a weekend or public holiday, we can receive your return and payment on the next working day without a penalty being applied. But for provincial anniversary dates, this only applies if you're in the province celebrating the holiday, and only if you usually make tax payments over-the-counter at Westpac. Final stage of our business transformation We've now gone live with the first release of the final stage of our business transformation. We have a series of on-demand webinars that help you understand some of the key things that have changed. The latest webinars that will be of interest to you are: • Changes coming in April 2021, including: - legislative changes - the move to the new payday filing format (version 2) - the decommissioning of E-File. • 3 webinars for New Zealand foreign trusts (including those that are, or have, tax agents). These webinars detail how to get set up and manage these trusts in myIR. To view these webinars visit ird.govt.nz/bt-webinars You can find more information about the changes here: • New Zealand foreign trusts ird.govt.nz/foreign-trust-changes • Unclaimed money (Note: some changes are dependent on legislation which is expected to pass soon) ird.govt.nz/unclaimed-money-changes • Paid parental leave ird.govt.nz/ppl-changes Reminder about Payday filing version 2 From 1 April, we will require all employers to use the new payday filing format (Version 2). Version 2 has been available since April 2020 and provides more Employee Information and Employee Detail Information than the current Version 1. We have been working with payroll software developers to help ensure they build Version 2 into their systems in good time. Employers who have their own in-house systems will need to build version 2 into their system prior to April 2021. To find out more go to ird.govt.nz/payday-filing-version-2 In-work tax credit (IWTC) grace period From 1 April 2021, a 2-week grace period comes into effect for the IWTC. This means customers can keep receiving IWTC payments for up to 2 weeks when taking an unpaid break from work. This could be as customers transition between jobs, are unpaid for a period of time or leave employment. Customers will need to let us know if their employment situation changes to ensure they receive the correct entitlement. This is because there is a delay in receiving customer's employment details from employers. Visit ird.govt.nz/in-work for more information about the change. AGENTS ANSWERS • Issue No 243 • March 2021 2 Finalising 2020 Income tax – more information requests We have a high number of 'Income tax - more information requests' waiting to be finalised by 31 March 2021. For every client that has been issued an Income tax – more information request, you or your client must review the information (adding any additional income and expenses, if appropriate) and finalise by 31 March 2021. The auto calculation process is designed to be quick and delays in completing a client's income tax assessment can have impacts to the client and Inland Revenue. We are aware that there is no easy way for you to identify these clients. We have produced a list for each tax agency to help them with this. Account managers will be contacting tax agents who have 20 or more linked to their tax agency that are not yet finalised. E-File to be decommissioned 16 April E-File will be decommissioned on 16 April 2021. This change impacts tax agents who currently use E-File. E-File is being replaced with an array of new Gateway Return Services which software providers are building into their systems. The software providers are choosing what functionality to build before E-File is decommissioned, focusing on those that are most critical for their customers. If you have any questions, talk to your software provider. We will have E-File available up until 16 April for 2020 tax year returns. However, your software provider could move to the new Gateway Services before 16 April – if you're unsure, check the timing with your provider. myIR logons Gateway Return Services use myIR credentials, not your E-File logon. Each staff member who will use Gateway Services in future will need their own myIR logon. You may need to set up unique myIR logons for impacted staff that don't already have one. The ability to carry out or perform certain actions is based on the user's level of access in myIR. To set up new myIR logons for your staff, and set levels of access, go to our website: ird.govt.nz/topics/myir-secure-online-services/create-web-logon-access-for-a-myir-account More information We will provide more detailed FAQs on our website about the changes soon. You can also check out our webpage for general updates: ird.govt.nz/topics/intermediaries/e-file We have been working closely with the software providers for a considerable time to ensure a smooth transition from E-File to Gateway Services. If you have any questions about the software functionality that will be available to you, and when it will be available, please contact your software provider. New campaign for real estate sector We have identified that real estate salespersons/agents are claiming a high level of expenses relative to their income. We believe that people are claiming private expenses but not keeping logbooks or other business records to support a deduction. We plan to provide education and offer seminars to real estate firms to help customers file the correct returns. As part of your end of year client review, you may wish to ensure your clients are keeping sufficient records to support expenses claimed. If we are concerned someone has overclaimed expenses, we'll send them a letter asking them to provide records to support expenses claimed. Please contact us if you have any questions at realestate@ird.govt.nz Client offshore and needs an IRD number? There is an alternative process for any clients offshore who cannot provide the required evidence of a fully functional New Zealand bank account or customer due diligence to get an IRD number. You can find details on our website ird.govt.nz/topics/proof-of-identity In general, the requirements include identification documentation, in English, certified in the country of residence. Applications can then be sent through to a specific email address: offshore@ird.govt.nz AGENTS ANSWERS • Issue No 243 • March 2021 3 Income return errors in e-Filed returns Some common errors are delaying the processing of your clients' income tax returns. Please note: • Don't add an address or phone number for a client into the return if there is no change. • Include the area code if a new contact phone number is a landline. • Do not electronically file an IR3 return if your client has been issued an 'Income tax – more information request'. If they have other income to add, you can manage this in myIR when reviewing and finalising the 'more information request.' If the wrong return is filed your client may miss out on automatic write offs that only apply to auto-calc clients. • Loss brought forward: - The loss needs to be the exact amount, not rounded up to the whole dollar amount. - When claiming the loss brought forward (where the loss is greater than the net income) please only claim the amount required to clear the net income claim, not the full loss. - Include any loss brought forward when there is income to offset it against. - Excess ICA credits brought forward are being entered as loss brought forward on individuals returns and may or may not be included in the correct box. 2021 Individual income tax assessments Please take the opportunity to ensure the correct income tax assessment is generated for your clients for the 2021 income year by ensuring we have the most up-to-date income sources recorded. Go to the 'summary' tab in your client's income tax account, select 'Manage' in the 'Current income types' heading and add or delete the appropriate income sources. You can find more information on our website: ird.govt.nz/roles/tax-agents/individual-income-tax-for-clients-of-agents ird.govt.nz/about-us/videos/webinars/business-transformation/previous-business-transformation- webinars/income-tax-assessments Filing imputation returns for consolidated group members A reminder that consolidated group members (including the nominated company) that are not part of an imputation group, are required to maintain their own imputation account (separate to the consolidated group's account). IR4Js will be issued for consolidated group members. Please file them by the due date of the nominated company return. Technical decision summaries We'll now be publishing our technical decisions summaries (TDS) for both adjudication and private rulings. This will start with adjudication decisions from mid-2021 with private rulings following for applications received on or after 1 June 2021. A TDS will generally be published on the Tax Technical website within 3 months of the final decision. How this affects you Any clients you have who are party to an adjudication or private ruling will be sent a draft summary of the TDS to check it doesn't breach confidentiality or include commercially sensitive information. They'll be asked to limit comments to issues of confidentiality or sensitivity only, as we cannot alter the final decision reached. They'll have 1 month to comment. Further information and contacts You'll find details of the policies and principles of technical decision summaries in the "Guidelines for the Publication of Technical Decision Summaries" taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz (keywords: about technical decision summaries).

It concludes that in general, monthly retirement payments received by retired United Nations staff members are taxed as pensions under s CF 1(g) of the Income Tax Act 2007. IS 21/01 – GST and agency A new interpretation statement considers whether a person is acting as an agent or as a principal for the purposes of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. It is primarily concerned with the application of sections 60(1) and (2) of the GST Act and identifies features that indicate when an agency relationship will exist in relation to a supply.

AGENTS ANSWERS Inland Revenue’s tax agents’ update 1 Issue No 254 • March 2022 • IR787 Tax policy and remedial changes are coming  More than 100 policy and remedial changes are expected to take effect on or before 1 April 2022. The changes include the following • New interest limitation rules will phase out the ability to claim interest on loans for residential rental properties. • The bright-line property rule will include a new 5-year bright-line period for new builds. Changes will also ensure a main home is not taxed and certain transfers of ownership do not trigger the bright-line property rule. • More reporting requirements for trusts to improve the transparency of trusts and their financial positions. • A new process for returning employer contributions to the employer account when an employee is no longer a KiwiSaver member. • Employers will no longer be able to change employment information through myIR or Gateway Services if it has been 4 years or more since the return was first filed. • Child support customers will be assessed on a ‘net’ income base by incorporating investment income and no longer offsetting losses from earlier years. On-demand webinars We will have a series of on-demand webinars to help you understand some of the key changes that may impact your customers. To view these webinars, visit ird.govt.nz/2022-changes A webinar on changes to trusts is now available. Webinars on property, GST, FBT and more will be available later this month. Marketing campaign A marketing campaign will run throughout March to raise awareness of the proposed rental property interest limitation rules. Advertising will run in both online and outdoor media. We’ll also send emails and letters to customers who show rental income in recent tax returns. Customers with a mail redirect to a tax agent will not receive these emails and letters. Reminder tax pooling Your clients may be able to use tax pooling to meet their 2021 provisional and end-of-year tax obligations. An indicator will be added to the 2021 Income Tax account of customers that intend to use tax pooling funds to meet their provisional tax obligations. The indicator is added automatically based on customer schedules sent to Inland Revenue by tax pooling intermediaries. Tax pooling intermediaries have up to 75 days after your client’s terminal tax date to transfer a payment from the tax pooling account into the customer account, at which time it becomes a tax payment. The indicator prevents automatic policing actions from occurring during that 75-day timeframe. For example, we won’t issue debt letters or transfer credits to offset amounts due in the income tax account. Your clients may still be issued statements of account and myIR will show this amount is due. You can check if your client has a tax pooling indicator through the client list report or check the ‘Additional period details’ report under the ‘More’ menu in your client’s Income Tax account. If no indicator is showing, contact a tax pooling intermediary in the first instance.

A taxable activity is a continuous or regular activity undertaken by any person that supplies or intends to supply goods or services for money or other reward. If your client is continuously filing nil GST returns, it may suggest that they are no longer carrying out a taxable activity. Letters issued in February If your client received a letter about our intention to cancel their GST registration, please consider whether they are carrying on a taxable activity. If you agree that their GST registration needs to be cancelled, you do not need to contact us. Their final GST return should be filed with the required adjustments.

AGENTS ANSWERS Inland Revenue’s tax agents’ update 1 Issue No 234 • May 2020 • IR787 We have several planning calendars to help you meet your obligations. Remember that if a due date falls on a weekend or public holiday, we can receive your return and payment on the next working day without a penalty being applied. But for provincial anniversary dates, this only applies if you're in the province celebrating the holiday, and only if you usually make tax payments over-the-counter at Westpac. COVID-19 and UOMI We understand the effect that COVID-19 has had on the income and businesses of many of our customers. We acknowledge that many customers will be coming under increasing financial pressure to pay their taxes in full and on time. This might mean that to maintain a business’s long-term viability, arrangements might need to be made about a business’s ability to pay their tax. In response to this we've clarified what support is available to taxpayers and we’ve updated our Covid-19 use of money interest (UOMI) webpage at ird.govt.nz (search keywords: covid-19, uomi). 2020 end of tax year process From mid-May to the end of July we’ll be running the automatic end of tax year process for most New Zealanders. This year all individual clients of tax agents (excluding IR3 filers) will receive an ‘income tax – more information request’ letter. If you have your clients mail redirected you will receive this letter, otherwise, your clients will receive this themselves. We are sending the letters in batches so you will not get them all at once. You are required to review and finalise your clients’ income tax assessment for the tax year ending 31 March 2020. In myIR, you can add additional income and/or expense information and finalise the assessment. For clients with an extension of time you have until 31 March 2021 to do this. Remember, for quicker processing of refunds you can update your clients bank account details in myIR. Gifting donation tax credits A law change that applies for the 2008-09 and later income years clarifies that: • donation tax credits for individuals, and • gift deductions for companies and Maori authorities are not available for gifts to donee organisations when they are made by way of a full or partial debt forgiveness. They are limited to gifts of cash or cash equivalents such as payments made by bank transfers, credit card or cheques. The amendment brings the law into alignment with the policy intent. It also includes a savings provision for taxpayers who have already filed a donation tax credit claim or an income tax return before 17 December 2019 relying on the previous law.

We are also producing a webinar to help you complete the 2019-20 end of year supplementary return. You and your clients may find this a valuable resource. Granting a permanent easement – tax treatment A provision in the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Act 2020 amends the tax treatment of a one-off payment for the grant of a permanent easement. Periodic payments for a permanent easement and any payment for the grant of a non-permanent easement (whether one-off or periodic), remain taxable. However, one-off payments for the grant of a permanent easement are not taxable. This amendment applies retrospectively from 1 April 2015.

Reporting is required to be made for payments made on or after April 1, 2020. For more information please contact investmentincomereporting@ird.govt.nz ACC invoicing delayed until October ACC are also providing support and assistance during this challenging time.

AGENTS ANSWERS Inland Revenue’s tax agents’ update 1 Issue No 245 • May 2021 • IR787 We have several planning calendars to help you meet your obligations. Remember that if a due date falls on a weekend or public holiday, we can receive your return and payment on the next working day without a penalty being applied. But for provincial anniversary dates, this only applies if you're in the province celebrating the holiday, and only if you usually make tax payments over-the-counter at Westpac. Tax treatment of Resurgence Support Payment (RSP) The RSP is a payment to help support viable and ongoing businesses or organisations due to a COVID-19 alert level increase to level 2 or higher, for a period of 7 days or longer. GST-registered businesses must return GST on payments received under the RSP. These businesses will be able to claim input tax deductions for expenditure funded by payments under the RSP. Payments received under the RSP are not subject to income tax. Expenditure funded by payments under the RSP is not deductible for income tax. The payment must be used to cover business expenses such as wages and fixed costs. Where the RSP is used to cover the payment of wages then standard PAYE deductions, and reporting, are required. Client list report and filing statistics As of 1 May 2021, the income tax section of the Client list report and the EOT dashboard now display 2020-21 income year details. This means you no longer have access to the 2019-20 income tax information however, you can still check your 2019-20 return filing statistics by changing the date in the drop down in the EOT display for each client list. 2021 Income tax – more information required From late May to end of July 2021 we will be sending "Income tax – more information requests for individual clients" (excluding IR3 filers). If you have your clients' mail redirected you will receive this letter, otherwise, your clients will receive this themselves. You are required to review, add any additional information income or expenses (if appropriate), and complete your clients' income tax assessments. This can be done through myIR. If you are using Gateway Services software to send income tax returns to Inland Revenue, you may also be able "finalise" or "amend" the "more info request" in your software. Talk to your provider as to whether they offer this functionality. We encourage you to confirm these in a timely manner so your clients are aware of their end of year tax position promptly and receive any refund they may be entitled to (including Working for Families). What's new for 2021 • From the 2021 year onwards any PIE income and tax will be included in your clients' end of year income tax assessments. This is calculated using prescribed investor rates (PIR), rather than income tax rates. Recent law changes mean that where PIE tax has been overpaid or underpaid it will form part of the overall income tax assessment and be offset against any income tax over or under payment. (continued on next page) AGENTS ANSWERS • Issue No 245 • May 2021 2 • Schedular payment clients who have received the COVID-19 Wage subsidy will receive a 2021 IR3 individual income tax return as they are required to declare this income. • If your clients receive joint investment income, we will allocate this from the information the investment income provider has returned. Where an investment provider only holds one IRD number, 100% of the income will be allocated to that IRD number. It is important that your clients advise their investment income provider of their IRD number so income can be correctly allocated. You can also update the ownership percentage of the investment income in myIR providing the client has this income showing. You can find out more about the end of year process: • at our webpage ird.govt.nz/roles/tax-agents/individual-income-tax-for-clients-of-agents, or • by watching our webinar at ird.govt.nz (keyword: webinar) Debt campaign for clients with debts under <$10k Following the SMS debt pilot in December last year and consultation with tax agent professional bodies and IR's Tax Agent Cohort, from 1 June 2021, we will begin contacting clients of agents directly about outstanding arrears if: • the debt is more than 60 days overdue, and • the amount of the debt is between $200-$10,000, and • the debt is assessed (ie not missed provisional tax instalments), and • the client account is active, and • there is no active tax pooling indicator on the client's account. We will contact customers by phone or SMS message. Any letters issued will continue to follow standard client mail redirect rules. This allows agents, who deal with client debt, 60 days from the due date to organise a payment plan (via instalments or in full) with their client directly. However, if the debt is not under positive arrangement after 60 days, we will start recovery action directly with the client. It's important that we continue to take action on these debts to uphold our responsibility to the NZ Government and help support COVID-19 initiatives. Sale/purchase of a business or property - purchase price allocation From 1 July 2021 new rules require both parties to the sale and purchase of 2 or more assets with different tax treatments to allocate the same amounts for each asset. These amounts will normally be in line with the market value. If there is no agreement on amounts allocated and certain thresholds are exceeded, the seller will have 3 months from the date of settlement to determine an allocation and notify this to both the buyer and Inland Revenue. If after 3 months the seller has not made a notification, then the buyer has 3 months to notify the seller and Inland Revenue. Notifications to Inland Revenue can be made through myIR and should include the phrase "Purchase price allocation" in the subject line. The notification should include both parties' names, IR number, date of agreement and settlement, transaction value and price allocation at the level of asset classes that are subject to particular income or deduction rules. When neither party determines and notifies an allocation, then the Commissioner may determine the allocation. You can view the special report on our Tax Policy website at taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2021/2021-sr-arferm-act AGENTS ANSWERS • Issue No 245 • May 2021 3 Feasibility expenditure From the 2020/2021 income year new rules apply for feasibility expenditure. For total expenditure related to completing, creating or acquiring property (business assets) of $10,000 or less in a year, an immediate deduction is available. This is the de minimis rule. For the same type of expenditure totalling more than $10,000, where the property is subsequently abandoned before it is completed, created or acquired, a deduction of the expenditure can be spread equally over 5 years from the year the property is abandoned. For abandoned property that is later completed, created or acquired within 7 years of the last year of the spread, all deductions (excluding deductions claimed under the de minimis rule) will be treated as income in the income year of completion, creation or acquisition. This is referred to as the "clawback". You can view the special report on our Tax Policy website at taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2021/2021-sr-arferm-act Loss carry forward – new business continuity test for companies From the 2020/2021 income year a new business continuity test applies to losses carried forward. The existing loss carry forward rules requiring 49% shareholder continuity continue to apply. Companies that meet the shareholder continuity test do not need to meet the business continuity test. The business continuity test allows a company to carry forward losses after a change in ownership (where there has been a breach in shareholder continuity) so long as the underlying business continues. That is, there is no "major change" in the business activities for either 5 years after the change in ownership or the period when the losses are used up (whichever is earlier). Whether there is a "major change" will depend on the extent the same assets, activities and operations continue to be used to generate income for the company. The commentary from the Supplementary Order Paper to the Taxation (Annual Rates 2020 21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill contains details of the new business continuity test and is available at: taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2021/2021-commentary-arferm-bill-supplementary Further details will be published in the Tax Information Bulletin in the coming months. The Commissioner's Position on NZ IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers The Commissioner has considered the impact of New Zealand Equivalent to International Financial Reporting Standard 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (NZ IFRS 15), which applies from 1 January 2018, on the meaning of "derived" and "incurred" for taxation purposes. It is considered that NZ IFRS 15 does not change the meaning of "derived" and "incurred" for taxation purposes and as a result, does not change the law of taxation because: • There have been no significant changes to the New Zealand case law on when income is derived and expenditure is incurred. • Case law has made it clear that the time that income is derived may differ for tax and accounting purposes, because each are looking to achieve different things. • Historically the test of when income is derived has been more influenced by accounting standards. However, since the move to a global-gross approach (from a net approach) in the income tax legislation, it is less likely that accounting standards will influence when income is derived for tax purposes. • The test for when expenditure is incurred is a statutory test that is not influenced by accounting standards. Changing accounting standards cannot change the statutory test for deductibility. • The Courts will not be prepared to accept an asymmetry of tax treatment where accounting standards would affect the income tax treatment of income derived but not the income tax treatment of expenditure incurred. This would particularly be the case where such a treatment would lead to deferred income with up-front expenditure and no matching of income and expenditure.

You can find all them on our website taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/ Enter the number in the search box, eg RA 21/01. RA 21/01: Diverting personal services income by structuring revenue earning activities through a related entity such as a trading trust or a company: the circumstances when Inland Revenue will consider this arrangement is tax avoidance. This Revenue Alert was issued ahead of the introduction of the new top marginal tax rate. It reiterates the Commissioner's view on this matter which follows the Supreme Court's decision in Penny and Hooper v CIR. From 1 April 2021 additional reporting obligations for trusts and new information gathering rules have been introduced to assist the Commissioner to identify any changes or increased use of trust structures to mitigate the impact of the new tax rate. DEP106: General Depreciation Determination: Tax Depreciation Rates for e-scooters and e-bicycles used in the ordinary course of business, and e-scooters, e-bicycles and bicycles (pedal) used for short term hire of 1 month or less DEP106 sets depreciation rates for e-scooters and e-bicycles used in the ordinary course of business and for short- term hire and pedal bicycles used for short-term hire. IS 21/02: Income tax – Calculating income from personal services to be attributed to the working person This Interpretation Statement provides guidance on how to calculate the amount of income from personal services that is attributed to the working person under the attribution rule in the Income Tax Act 2007. The attribution rule may apply if an entity earns income from supplying services that are personally performed by an associated person (the working person). The rule is aimed at ensuring the appropriate amount of income is recognised as being the working person's income – so taxpayers in this situation can't use associated entities to achieve a tax advantage. IS 19/02: Income tax – attribution rule for income from personal services This previously published Interpretation Statement is related to IS 21/02. It provides guidance on when to calculate the amount of income from personal services that is attributed to the working person under the attribution rule in the Income Tax Act 2007. CS 21/01: Commissioner's Statement – Income tax treatment of facilitation payments to farmers and debt remission on settlement of a loan This statement sets out the Commissioner's approach to facilitation payments to farmers and debt remission arising from the settlement of loans to farmers.
AGENTS ANSWERS Inland Revenue’s tax agents’ update 1 Issue No 256 • May 2022 • IR787 Use-of-money interest (UOMI) rate change Effective from 9 May 2022, the UOMI rates on underpayments and overpayments of tax changed. The new rates are: • underpayments – 7.28% (up from 7.00%) • overpayments – 0.00% no change from current rate. We review the rates regularly to ensure they are aligned with market interest rates. 2022 Income tax – more information request From late May to the end of July 2022 we will be sending “Income tax – more information requests” for individual clients (excluding IR3 filers). If you have your clients’ mail redirected you will receive this letter, otherwise, your clients will receive this themselves. You are required to review, add any additional income or expenses (if appropriate), and complete your clients’ income tax assessments. You and your clients can do this through myIR. If you are using Gateway Services software to send us income tax returns, you may also be able to “finalise” or “amend” the “more information request” in your software. Talk to your provider to see if they offer this functionality. We encourage you to confirm these in a timely manner so your clients are aware of their end-of-year tax position and receive any refund they may be entitled to (including Working for Families). What’s new for 2022 From the 2022 year if your client has a shareholder, LTC, partnership or beneficiary link with a commencement date within the last 2 years and has received no income from these entities, they will receive an “Income tax – more information request”. If your client has no reportable income, we will apply a “no assessment indicator” and no further action is required unless there is income to return. You will be able to identify these customers from your client list report. The definition of “reportable income” now includes payments received from the Wage Subsidy Scheme (WSS), the Leave Support Scheme (LSS), and the Short-Term Absence Payments. It does not include the Cultural Emergency Relief Sector Grant. This enables some customers who were required to file an IR3 in 2021 as a result of receiving these payments, to now be eligible to receive an “Income tax – more information request”. A Government subsidy field is now included in the “Income tax – more information request”. WSS, LSS and STAP payments will pre-populate into the “Income tax – more information request” and be visible in the income summary in myIR. You can find out more about the end-of-year process at ird.govt.nz/roles/tax-agents/individual-income-tax- for-clients-of-agents 2022 paper income tax returns We have listened to your feedback around the unnecessary paper return packs being issued for some clients. We have now made a change to our paper return select so that we won’t send one to anyone who is linked to an intermediary for income tax. If you need a paper return, these can still be printed off our website. Agents Answers comments generally on topical tax issues relevant to tax agents.

AGENTS ANSWERS Inland Revenue’s tax agents’ update 1 Issue No 240 • November 2020 • IR787 We have several planning calendars to help you meet your obligations. Remember that if a due date falls on a weekend or public holiday, we can receive your return and payment on the next working day without a penalty being applied. But for provincial anniversary dates, this only applies if you're in the province celebrating the holiday, and only if you usually make tax payments over-the-counter at Westpac. Simplifying our processes Self-correcting income tax return errors If you or your clients notice that an error has been made in an income tax return: • you or your client can self-correct these in myIR • you can correct the return via E-File (or Gateway Services in future). Use-of-money interest (UOMI) is minimised when errors are corrected in real-time. Loss carried forward income mismatch When your client declares a loss for one income tax year, subject to continuity rules, this loss can be carried forward and offset against income in a future year. Errors occur when a wrong loss balance figure or an out-of-date loss balance is used. These transactions can be due to: • a shareholder continuity breach • subvention payment made • company amalgamations • consolidated group transactions, or • losses used to pay shortfall penalties or tax debt. To check the balance of the loss to carry forward, you can generate a "Client List Report" by selecting the Tax Preparer tab > Agency reports > Client list report > select your client list > Run report and Export. Under the Income Tax Information section, the Loss carried forward column records the balance to transfer to the income tax return of your client. Nil returns If a customer has: • a loss balance from earlier years waiting to be offset against future income, but • no taxable income in the current year they would file a "Nil" return. In the "Nil" return for the current year, it is important that the loss carried forward figure is also disclosed in the corresponding box of the income tax return. Shareholder salary mismatch We see errors occurring between a company claiming a deduction for payment of a shareholder salary and the recipient of the salary not declaring it as income. When you are filing a company Income tax return - IR4 and there is shareholder salary to declare, please ensure that the Shareholder Salary box is updated along with the IRD number of the shareholder the income is allocated to. AGENTS ANSWERS • Issue No 240 • November 2020 2 Research & Development tax incentive Research & Development tax incentive tax credits (RDTI) Do you have any clients claiming a refundable RDTI credit through their IR3, IR3NR, IR6, IR8, IR9 or IR44 for the 2020 tax year? You and your clients will not find the RDTI refundable keypoints in the 2020 returns. The broader refundable method was only introduced under urgency in the COVID-19 tax bill and retrospectively applied to the 2020 tax year. Please don't adjust the tax return to include the refundable tax credits. We will make any adjustments once the outcome of the application has been determined. This will ensure your credits are calculated and applied correctly. You can email any questions to R&Dtiteam@ird.govt.nz Research & development tax incentive: Certifiers The R&D tax incentive certifier application form is now available for those interested in becoming an IRD approved R&D Tax Incentive certifier. The form asks you to list any licenced auditors you employ, as well as the names of any partners, directors, or principals authorised to provide R&D certificates. You are also required to make a statutory declaration on the application form stating that you: • are competent in applying the appropriate legal and accounting standards relating to R&D tax credits, and • have the appropriate technical knowledge to assess R&D. If we approve your application, we'll let you know and will publish your approval on our website. Your approved R&D certifier status takes effect from the date of your application. Licenced auditors To be approved as an R&D certifier, a firm must declare that they include or employ one or more licenced auditors (as approved by the Financial Markets Authority). Where a firm is approved as an R&D certifier, they will be required to provide us with the names of licenced auditors in their employ. Please go to our website ird.govt.nz (search keyword: Research) There is more information in our R&D guide IR1240 in the Approved R&D certifiers section. Filing date change for RDTI general approval applications If you're filing a general approval application for the R&D Tax Incentive (RDTI) for the 2020/2021 income tax year, you now have until the 7th day of the 5th month after the end of the first income year. The change is for a situation where you could not apply on time because the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted any of the following: • planning or doing eligible research and development • appropriately obtaining necessary information • getting advice. The change is effective from 1 September 2020 to 30 September 2021. Income tax and supplementary return due dates Please note that the extension for filing a general approval application does not apply to your income tax and supplementary return due dates. If you need more time to file your income tax and supplementary return, you can email r&dtiteam@ird.govt.nz AGENTS ANSWERS • Issue No 240 • November 2020 3 Information requests during audits/reviews When your client is subject to an audit or review we will generally use myIR web messages and letters for requests for information. In the past we asked for a reply within 28 days. With the increased use of electronic mail the response time is now 21 days. Once we receive the information, we'll be in touch with you within 21 days about the progress and next stages of the audit or review. The shorter timeframe does not apply to: • non-disclosure rights, and • Agreements to amend assessment(s) forms, which remain at 28 days. If your clients can't meet that timeframe, they can ask for an extension. Income tax – more information request If you receive an "Income tax – more information request", you (or your client) must finalise it in myIR by the due date. The date to finalise the more information request is: • 31 March if the client has an extension of time • 45 days after the date of issue if there is no extension of time (the date will be in the letter). For those not finalised or where there is no additional information provided, an income assessment will be issued based on the information we hold. If a client's mail is being redirected for income tax, this letter will be sent to you. Otherwise, it will go directly to your client. Steps to finalise the assessment • Identify clients yet to have their "more info request" finalised. You can get this information by exporting your client list report and filtering the "Individual filing group" column to show "auto issued – more info". • Look at each individual client in their income tax account in myIR. If this has been finalised you will see "on time processed" otherwise it will show "request to complete." • Confirm with your client their income sources for the 2019/2020 income year and finalise the assessment. This might include calculating expenses for clients receiving schedular income. Once submitted the assessment will update to your client's income tax account and an income tax assessment notice will issue. If your client has been sent a "more information request" please do not file an IR3 return through E-File or file a paper return as these will be treated as a duplicate return and slow down processing. It can take up to 10 weeks to process. Editing the assessment in myIR is the quickest way to finalise your client's assessment. We're working closely with software providers to ensure that the new income tax return filing service will allow you to amend or finalise these assessments through your software. Remember to check your client's bank account details are up-to-date so any credits can be refunded directly to their account. For more help Our "Income tax assessments for individual clients of tax agent's" webinar can help you through the process of reviewing and finalising assessments. Go to ird.govt.nz/webinars AGENTS ANSWERS • Issue No 240 • November 2020 4 Client mail redirection Most letters we issue will redirect to a tax agent if you requested "mail to tax agent" when you linked to your client. This includes all "Income tax – more information request" letters, Notices of assessment and Summary of accounts. You can check and edit where each client's mail will go by account type in myIR, either in the "Delink" or "Manage links service" under "Client maintenance". You can enter up to 50 IRD numbers at a time. The "Mail to:" column will show the current setting for each account. You can edit it by clicking on the hyperlink. Redirecting a letter to your tax agency means your client: • will not get a paper copy • will not get an email from us to say they have an unread letter in myIR • can see a copy in the "Correspondence" tab in their myIR. It's a good idea to check this regularly when you're managing your clients' accounts. It's important to make sure the addresses for your clients are up to date. They can also check and update their address in myIR. Changes coming to foreign trusts in March 2021 We're making some improvements to the way we manage New Zealand Foreign Trusts. (NZFTs) We're setting up a new foreign trust section in myIR. This means that from early March 2021 it will be easier to manage NZFTs on behalf of your clients in myIR. You'll be able to: • link to your client's NZFT account • update their details online from your myIR account • view previously provided NZFT information and send web messages in myIR instead of email • file your client's NZFT annual returns and make payments online • register a NZFT online in myIR or cancel an existing NZFT. You may need to consider different levels of access and, where appropriate, create new logons for your staff who handle NZFTs. We’ll be sending an update directly to New Zealand foreign trusts in early November to make sure they’re aware of the changes. More information will be added to our website as we work through the final details so keep an eye out for further updates at ird.govt.nz/foreign-trust-changes Agents Answers comments generally on topical tax issues relevant to tax agents.

Unclaimed money arises when a holder (an organisation that holds money or untouched accounts) makes all reasonable efforts to find the owner but is unsuccessful. Once this happens, the money and all information held about the owner, must be sent to us. What the changes mean for you The main change you will notice is a new" Unclaimed money holder" account in myIR. This means that from early March you'll be able to: • link to your client's unclaimed money holder account if they file unclaimed money • manage their details in myIR including filing, paying, viewing transactions and monitoring correspondence. Other changes The length of time that money is held before becoming "unclaimed" may change. Currently it takes 6 or 25 years depending on the type of funds. Pending legislation changes passing next year, all types of funds held may be considered "unclaimed" after 5 years. There will be a transitional period to help shift to the new timeframe Holders of unclaimed money may need to provide more customer information if they have it and will be able to file more frequently. The additional information will be used to help owners identify which money is theirs and whether to pursue a claim. There will also be changes to the process for customers who submit a claim for unclaimed money that has been transferred to us. On 10 November we’ll be sending an update directly to holders who have recently filed unclaimed money with us to make sure they’re aware of the changes. New tax technical item published We have recently published: • CS 20/05 Commissioner's Statement GST treatment of payments received by a GST registered body corporate from the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment under the Leaky Homes Financial Assistance Package This Commissioner's statement discusses payments received by GST registered bodies corporate from the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment under the Leaky Homes Financial Assistance Package (FAP) scheme.

Final round of Business Transformation implemented The final round of our Business Transformation has now been implemented and the changes to our system are live. A recap of the key changes and some helpful information is available in our Day 1 information pack ird.govt.nz/day1intermediaries GST and provisional tax due date extended to 4 November Due to the timing of the recent system shutdown over Labour Day weekend, we understand that some businesses may have struggled to file and pay GST and provisional tax by the 28 October due date. The Government has extended the due date to 4 November. Details for filing GST in the new version of myIR can be found in the day 1 pack link above. The decision to allow this extension was made quickly and there may be some instances where our systems show some variations. If you have not yet filed, please note that: • myIR will still show 28 October as the filing due date, however, you will not be penalised as long as you file and pay your GST and provisional tax on or before 4 November. • automated messaging has been turned off, however if you receive one between now and 4 November, please ignore it, and make sure you file and pay on time by 4 November. More information For more information about the recent changes including links to the Day 1 pack and detailed webinars, visit ird.govt.nz/changes-intermediaries. We’ve also contacted your clients directly about myIR and other changes. Significant support is available for businesses impacted by COVID-19. For the latest updates visit business.govt.nz/covid-19 Managing third party access All customers, including your clients, have the ability to restrict third party myIR access. If you are linking a client or find you no longer have access to a client, you may see the following message: This client no longer allows third party myIR access. Please contact your client to discuss their preferences. You will need to ask your client to log into myIR > select Manage my profile > I want to... >Manage third party access Under the question ‘Do you want to allow third parties to request access to your accounts’ they will need to change the “No” to “Yes” for you to have myIR access. Upcoming contact about Wage Subsidy Scheme (WSS) receipts We have processed a number of 2021 IR3/IR3NR Income tax returns where WSS payments received by customers directly (not via an associated entity) were not reported in the “Government Subsidies” field of the return. We made the decision not to select these returns for review at the time the return was filed but would follow these up outside our high service demand period. Contacting you by web message or directly We will shortly (currently planned for mid-November 2021) contact tax agents (and customers without tax agents) by web message requesting these returns be reviewed to ensure the WSS payments are reported. For most, the web message will be sent to the web logon who filed the return in Gateway Services or myIR. There are, however, some tax agents with 10 or more affected clients. Our Account Managers will directly contact these tax agents with a list of their clients who need a review. AGENTS ANSWERS Inland Revenue’s tax agents’ update 1 Issue No 251 • November 2021 • IR787 Your action If you receive a web message or are contacted by your Account Manager, please review the WSS payment detail with your client and make the necessary amendment. Where you find the amount to be included differs to the amount shown in the web message or advised to you, please include a supporting note (and/or information) as necessary when amending your client’s return. Find out more If you need further information on how the WSS receipts should be accounted for, please go to the IR1251 guide on our website. Reminding customers about their Small Business Cashflow loan This month we’re contacting tax agents of customers who took out the Small Business Cashflow loan (SBCS) between May and July 2020. We’ll remind them of their client’s loan obligations and the option to avoid interest by repaying the loan in full within the first 2 years if they can. We’ll contact SBCS loan customers without a tax agent directly. We understand the pressure many business owners are under, and that it might not be possible to pay the loan off before the interest is charged. That’s ok. Repayments are not compulsory in the first 24 months. For more information about the loan, including applying head to ird.govt.nz/sbcs 2021 Income tax – more information requests There are many “Income tax - more information requests” for clients of tax agents yet to be finalised. This is a reminder that you must review and confirm all “Income tax – more information requests” that have been issued for your clients. This includes confirming the income included is correct and/or adding additional income and expenses as necessary before 31 March 2022. Your unfiled returns report will help you to identify which clients still have an “Income tax - more information request” needing to be reviewed or amended and then completed. For more information on this report, go to ird. govt.nz/roles/tax-agents/unfiled-returns-report You can finalise the assessment in myIR or if you are using Gateway Services to file income tax returns you may also be able to complete and amend the more information request via your software. Talk to your software provider to see if they provide this functionality. We encourage you to finalise these in a timely manner so your clients are aware of their tax position and receive any refund they may be entitled to as soon as possible (including Working for Families). Ensure your clients’ bank account details are up to date so that any credits can be refunded directly to their account.

On 15 October 2021 Inland Revenue published two documents for public consultation: • An Officials Paper on the Order in Council (OIC) which prescribes the minimum standard for financial reporting by trustees, and • A draft Operational Statement (OS) setting out Inland Revenue’s proposed approach to applying the trust information gathering powers contained in sections 59BA and 59BAB of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Trustees will be required to provide: • summary financial information from their statement of profit or loss and statement of financial position which will be prepared to the minimum standard prescribed by the OIC • the nature and amount of any settlement made on the trust during the year • the details of anyone who is a settlor of the trust • the amount of any distributions made during the year, and the details of the beneficiary who received the distribution • details of any person who has powers to appoint or remove trustees and beneficiaries or amend the trust deed.

The project will use household income as the unit of analysis, so people taking part will be asked for financial information about themselves and their dependent children. Their partners will also be asked for financial information. Individuals will be legally required to provide this information. We will be asking for information in 3 stages: • In November 2021, individuals will be asked to provide details of their partner and dependent children. This will give us accurate information about whose income will be included in the analysis. • In January 2022, individuals and their partners will be asked for information about the entities and business undertakings they have an interest in. Individuals will also be asked about the entities their dependent children have an interest in. • In May 2022, individuals and their partners will be asked to provide further information to help us calculate measures of income for our analysis. All the information provided will be kept confidential and will not be used to reassess anyone’s tax liability. The research will be published in a report to be made public in mid-2023. The project will not make any policy recommendations, but the analysis will improve future tax policy advice. We have contacted the individuals’ tax agents to let them know their clients who have been selected to take part in the study. If you have any questions about the project, email etrproject@ird.govt.nz Voice channel hours for individuals We’ve changed the voice channel hours for individuals. They are now Monday to Friday 8am to 6pm. Saturday’s hours remain the same, at 9am to 1pm. The agents' phone line hours, Monday to Friday 8am to 5pm remain unchanged. 95% of our customers contact us between 8am and 6pm, and only 5% between 6pm and 8pm. The new hours respond to the ongoing customer preference for digital channels initially observed during COVID-19 and support our vision to increase customer self-service and boost the uptake of web messaging.

Tax technical items We’ve recently published this item: IS 21/04 Income Tax & GST - Deductions for businesses disrupted by the Covid-19 Pandemic Many businesses have faced significant disruption because of COVID-19. Some businesses have had to downscale or temporarily suspend their operations. Others have had to close completely. However, expenses and losses may still be incurred while the business is not operating. Whether a business has ceased operating temporarily or permanently has implications for whether it can claim income tax deductions for any expenditure or loss incurred.

We have several planning calendars to help you meet your obligations. Remember that if a due date falls on a weekend or public holiday, we can receive your return and payment on the next working day without a penalty being applied. But for provincial anniversary dates, this only applies if you're in the province celebrating the holiday, and only if you usually make tax payments over-the-counter at Westpac. Final business transformation changes coming The final release of our Business Transformation programme will go live as planned in late October. As with previous releases, we are migrating our systems over a public holiday to reduce the number of business days that we need to be closed. We will close at 3pm on Thursday 21 October and will reopen on the morning of Thursday 28 October. We understand with our system shut down that businesses may struggle to file and pay GST and provisional tax by 28 October. Ministers have agreed (dependent on passing an Order in Council) that businesses and individuals will now have until 4 November to file and pay. If you or your clients would like to file before we upgrade our services, you can do that before 21 October. Or you can have a look at the changes that are coming up at ird.govt.nz/changes-intermediaries, and file once our services come online again. Ways we can help if COVID-19 has impacted your or your clients’ ability to pay These include • setting up an instalment arrangement in myIR to pay off the tax over time. If COVID has impacted you or your clients’ ability to file or pay, please let us know as soon as you can as they will not be charged penalties and interest as long as they keep to the terms of the arrangement to pay off the outstanding tax. This can be set up before we closie down our systems for the release, or from 28 October. • sending us a note in myIR to explain the situation and we will take that into consideration. Our key services will be unavailable myIR secure online services and Gateway Services will be unavailable and our phone lines and offices will be closed from 3pm Thursday 21 October until the morning of Thursday 28 October. If you have a direct debit or automatic payment set up with your bank to process whilst we’re shut down, this will be processed once we reopen on 28 October. The effective date will be the date you’ve requested the payment to be made, not the processing date. All drafts, such as returns and secure mail, will be deleted during the upgrade process. If you have saved any drafts in myIR, make sure you finish them before 3pm on Thursday 21 October, so you do not lose them. Employment Information (EI) returns for payday filing that are due over the closure can be filed early if you’re able to. The days during the temporary shutdown won’t count as working days for filing periods. Filing can be completed up to 3pm on Thursday 21 October and can be resumed from the start of business on Thursday 28 October.

This will allow you to perform intermediary functions from any level (eg account or customer) in myIR. • Workspace is being removed but there will be new functionality such as a favourites list and improved search options to access clients easily. • Name-based search – we've listened to your feedback - you’ll be able to search using the names, IRD numbers or customer identifiers of all clients you’re authorised to access. • Correspondence – subscriptions will now include return, payment and other account alerts and will be capped at 1,250 accounts. If you have 1,250 or under, we don’t require you to do anything, we’ll move them across for you. If you have over 1,250 subscriptions, you should have already been contacted about your options. If this is not the case, please contact your account manager. • Child support deduction notices along with s157 and s154 deduction notices will be sent electronically to customers and their employers (following mail redirect where applicable). Other changes planned to go live on 28 October • The way we manage payroll Employee/Employer relationships will change. If you or your client haven’t included an employee in your Employment Information and they have no cease date, or they continually show as having nil earnings, the relationship will be ceased after 3 months. In some circumstances the employee’s details will need to be provided again if they return to work for you. For more information visit ird.govt.nz/changes-businesses • If you or any of your clients has an employee who becomes liable for child support payments, we’ll contact you/ them with the information needed to make these deductions on their behalf. • If any of your clients are still using the ‘file upload’ option to manage payroll in myIR, they need to ensure their file format is updated to payday filing Version 2. If they’re filing through software, all commercial software providers now have the Version 2 option, however they may still want to check that they’re using the right version to file. If they’re filing through paper or myIR ‘on screen’ then they’re already using Version 2. Amendments to Employment Information need to be made using the same version as the original file. • Audit correspondence will now be saved in myIR. Some audit letters dating back to February 2017 will be visible to Owner and Administrator logons. We have contacted affected clients directly with instructions on how to downgrade a logon to a Restricted administrator if they don’t wish for the letters to be seen by Administrator logons. More information More information about the upcoming changes, including detailed webinars, can be found at ird.govt.nz/changes-intermediaries April 2021 tax rate changes – new RWT rate available From 1 April 2021 a new top tax rate of 39% was introduced for individuals who earn over $180,000 in a year. Payers of interest, such as banks and other financial institutions had until 1 October 2021 to have this rate available for their customers to use. Now that the 1 October implementation date has passed, please remind any of your clients who earn over $180,000 to update their RWT deduction rate with their bank or other interest income provider. Most banks enable customers to self-select the appropriate rate through their online banking portal, so customers should check that option first before contacting their bank. You may wish to advise relevant clients that the change in rate may result in a year-end tax liability in the 2021- 2022 tax year for RWT being under deducted from their interest income up until the date they changed the rate. Note that Inland Revenue cannot update the RWT deduction rate for customers. They need to opt into the higher rate through their investment provider.

New GST payment option for some overseas businesses Your overseas clients in Australia, the UK, many European countries, Canada and the US can now make direct debit GST payments through their myIR accounts. To set up these payments: • log in to myIR • complete a direct debit mandate via settings – you only need to do this once • choose the GST tax account • select "Make a payment" on the summary screen • follow the directions for setting up a direct debit payment. Go to our website ird.govt.nz (search keywords: paying from overseas) for more details. Income tax - more information request If you receive an "Income tax - more information request" you (or your client) must review it, add in any additional income and expenses, if appropriate, and finalise it within the required timeframe: • 31 March if the client has an extension of time • 45 days after the date of issue if no extension of time (date will be in the letter). For those not confirmed within the timeframe or where there is no additional information provided, we will finalise the income assessment based on the information we hold. Steps to finalise the assessment • Identify clients yet to have their "more info request" finalised. You can get this information by exporting your client list report and filtering the "Individual filing group" column to show "auto issued – more info". • Look at each individual client to check if their "more info request" has been finalised. If this has been finalised in the income tax account in myIR you will see "ontime processed". If not you will see "request to complete." • Confirm with your client their income sources for the 2019/2020 income year and finalise the assessment. • Select the Tax Preparer tab> enter the client IRD number> select access client> click on the Income tax account> select the periods tab> click on Request to complete> Follow the prompts to complete the clients' assessment>submit. • If your client has been selected for "more info request" and also has "other income" to submit you can enter the additional income at this step. Schedular income expenses can also be included in the "more info request". Once submitted the assessment will update to your client's income tax account.

Final business transformation changes coming We’re now working through the final business transformation release.

Find out more at ird.govt.nz/covid-19 Law change for minors’ income exemption There is currently an exemption from income tax for minors who derive certain income totalling less than $2,340. A recent law change has added beneficiary income to the list of income types that are not tax exempt for minors. This amendment is retrospective. It applies from the 2012-13 tax year unless a return of income has been filed before the tax bill was introduced – 4 June 2020 – where the customer relied on the law as it previously stood. The amendment does not affect the minor beneficiary income rule in section HC 35 of the Income Tax Act 2007 where beneficiary income in excess of $1,000 is generally taxed in the trust return at the trustee rate. Beneficiary income of $1,000 or less should be taxed at the beneficiary’s marginal tax rate. Companies claiming home office expenses If a company uses a home office, that is, the home of one of its shareholders, it will not be able to claim a deduction for the office unless it has incurred the actual cost. This means that, if a company’s shareholder or director runs the company’s business through a home office and pays all expenses relating to the home office, the company has not incurred any expense and cannot claim a deduction. When a company can claim a deduction A company can claim a deduction in the following conditions: • The company can prove a nexus between its business income and the home office expense that the company is claiming. Any private portion cannot be claimed. • The company has incurred the expenditure within the income year the deduction is being claimed. That is, it has a liability to pay the expense either direct to the provider, or to the homeowner. Appropriate accounting records must be kept showing that these conditions have been satisfied, along with any agreement allowing the company to use the home. Income treatment in the hands of the home office owner Under section CW 17 of the Income Tax Act 2007, a reimbursement paid to an employee in connection to their employment or service is exempt income to the employee. This is provided that a deduction would be allowable if the employment limitation didn’t exist. This includes payments made to a shareholder employee. So, if the company reimburses a shareholder employee for the use of their home office, and that office is used to fulfil their duties as a shareholder employee, the payment would be exempt income. Section CW 17 cannot be used in instances where there is no employer/employee relationship. In these instances, general tax rules would apply. This could create income in the hands of the home office owner, that would in turn need to be offset with the related expenses incurred by the owner. How look-through companies are affected An owner of a look-through company (LTC) cannot be a shareholder employee. If certain conditions are met, they can be an employee with PAYE deductions made on all employee income received. If the owner is an employee, section CW 17 applies as above. If the owner is not an employee of the LTC, they are able to claim the home office in their own right – provided a nexus exists between the expenditure and the income they receive from the LTC.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a U.S. Source Withholdable Payment does not include any payment that is not treated as a withholdable payment in relevant U.S. Treasury Regulations. jj) An Entity is a “Related Entity” of another Entity if either Entity controls the other Entity, or the two Entities are under common control. For this purpose control includes direct or indirect ownership of more than 50 percent of the vote or value in an Entity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, New Zealand may treat an Entity as not a Related Entity of another Entity if the two Entities are not members of the same expanded affiliated group as defined in section 1471(e)(2) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. kk) The term “U.S. TIN” means a U.S. federal taxpayer identifying number. 17 ll) The term “New Zealand TIN” means a New Zealand taxpayer identifying number. mm) The term “Controlling Persons” means the natural persons who exercise control over an Entity.

Article 4 Application of FATCA to New Zealand Financial Institutions 1. Treatment of Reporting New Zealand Financial Institutions. Each Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution shall be treated as complying with, and not subject to withholding under, section 1471 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code if New Zealand complies with its obligations under Articles 2 and 3 of this Agreement with respect to such Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution, and the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution: 24 a) identifies U.S. Reportable Accounts and reports annually to the New Zealand Competent Authority the information required to be reported in subparagraph 2(a) of Article 2 of this Agreement in the time and manner described in Article 3 of this Agreement; b) for each of 2015 and 2016, reports annually to the New Zealand Competent Authority the name of each Nonparticipating Financial Institution to which it has made payments and the aggregate amount of such payments; c) complies with the applicable registration requirements on the IRS FATCA registration website; d) to the extent that a Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution is (i) acting as a qualified intermediary (for purposes of section 1441 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code) that has elected to assume primary withholding responsibility under chapter 3 of subtitle A of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code; (ii) a foreign partnership that has elected to act as a withholding foreign partnership (for purposes of both sections 1441 and 1471 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code); or (iii) a foreign trust that has elected to act as a withholding foreign trust (for purposes of both sections 1441 and 1471 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code), withholds 30 percent of any U.S. Source Withholdable Payment to any Nonparticipating Financial Institution; and e) in the case of a Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution that is not described in subparagraph 1(d) of this Article and that makes a payment of, or acts as an intermediary with 25 respect to, a U.S. Source Withholdable Payment to any Nonparticipating Financial Institution, the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution provides to any immediate payor of such U.S. Source Withholdable Payment the information required for withholding and reporting to occur with respect to such payment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution with respect to which the conditions of this paragraph 1 are not satisfied shall not be subject to withholding under section 1471 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code unless such Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution is treated by the IRS as a Nonparticipating Financial Institution pursuant to subparagraph 2(b) of Article 5 of this Agreement. 2. Suspension of Rules Relating to Recalcitrant Accounts. The United States shall not require a Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution to withhold tax under section 1471 or 1472 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code with respect to an account held by a recalcitrant account holder (as defined in section 1471(d)(6) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code), or to close such account, if the U.S. Competent Authority receives the information set forth in subparagraph 2(a) of Article 2 of this Agreement, subject to the provisions of Article 3 of this Agreement, with respect to such account. 3. Specific Treatment of New Zealand Retirement Plans. The United States shall treat as deemed-compliant FFIs or exempt beneficial owners, as appropriate, for purposes of sections 1471 and 1472 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code New Zealand retirement plans described in Annex II. For this purpose, a New Zealand retirement plan includes an Entity established or located in, and regulated by, New Zealand, or a predetermined contractual or legal arrangement, operated to provide 26 pension or retirement benefits or earn income for providing such benefits under the laws of New Zealand and regulated with respect to contributions, distributions, reporting, sponsorship, and taxation. 4. Identification and Treatment of Other Deemed-Compliant FFIs and Exempt Beneficial Owners. The United States shall treat each Non- Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution as a deemed-compliant FFI or as an exempt beneficial owner, as appropriate, for purposes of section 1471 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. 5. Special Rules Regarding Related Entities and Branches That Are Nonparticipating Financial Institutions. If a New Zealand Financial Institution, that otherwise meets the requirements described in paragraph 1 of this Article or is described in paragraph 3 or 4 of this Article, has a Related Entity or branch that operates in a jurisdiction that prevents such Related Entity or branch from fulfilling the requirements of a participating FFI or deemed-compliant FFI for purposes of section 1471 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code or has a Related Entity or branch that is treated as a Nonparticipating Financial Institution solely due to the expiration of the transitional rule for limited FFIs and limited branches under relevant U.S. Treasury Regulations, such New Zealand Financial Institution shall continue to be in compliance with the terms of this Agreement and shall continue to be treated as a deemed-compliant FFI or exempt beneficial owner, as appropriate, for purposes of section 1471 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, provided that: 27 a) the New Zealand Financial Institution treats each such Related Entity or branch as a separate Nonparticipating Financial Institution for purposes of all the reporting and withholding requirements of this Agreement and each such Related Entity or branch identifies itself to withholding agents as a Nonparticipating Financial Institution; b) each such Related Entity or branch identifies its U.S. accounts and reports the information with respect to those accounts as required under section 1471 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code to the extent permitted under the relevant laws pertaining to the Related Entity or branch; and c) such Related Entity or branch does not specifically solicit U.S. accounts held by persons that are not resident in the jurisdiction where such Related Entity or branch is located or accounts held by Nonparticipating Financial Institutions that are not established in the jurisdiction where such Related Entity or branch is located, and such Related Entity or branch is not used by the New Zealand Financial Institution or any other Related Entity to circumvent the obligations under this Agreement or under section 1471 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, as appropriate. 28 6. Coordination of Timing. Notwithstanding paragraphs 3 and 5 of Article 3 of this Agreement: a) New Zealand shall not be obligated to obtain and exchange information with respect to a calendar year that is prior to the calendar year with respect to which similar information is required to be reported to the IRS by participating FFIs pursuant to relevant U.S. Treasury Regulations; b) New Zealand shall not be obligated to begin exchanging information prior to the date by which participating FFIs are required to report similar information to the IRS under relevant U.S. Treasury Regulations; c) the United States shall not be obligated to obtain and exchange information with respect to a calendar year that is prior to the first calendar year with respect to which New Zealand is required to obtain and exchange information; and d) the United States shall not be obligated to begin exchanging information prior to the date by which New Zealand is required to begin exchanging information. 7. Coordination of Definitions with U.S. Treasury Regulations. Notwithstanding Article 1 of this Agreement and the definitions provided in the Annexes to this Agreement, in implementing this Agreement, New Zealand may use, and may permit New Zealand Financial Institutions to use, a definition in relevant U.S. Treasury Regulations in lieu of a corresponding definition in this Agreement, provided that such application would not frustrate the purposes of this Agreement. 29 Article 5 Collaboration on Compliance and Enforcement 1. Minor and Administrative Errors. Subject to any further terms set forth in a competent authority arrangement concluded pursuant to paragraph 6 of Article 3 of this Agreement, the Competent Authority of the United States may make an inquiry directly to a Reporting Financial Institution in New Zealand where it has reason to believe that minor or administrative errors may have led to incorrect or incomplete information reporting or resulted in other infringements of this Agreement. The competent authority arrangement may provide that the Competent Authority of the United States shall notify the Competent Authority of New Zealand when it makes such an inquiry of a Reporting Financial Institution in New Zealand regarding the Reporting Financial Institution’s compliance with the conditions set forth in this Agreement. The Competent Authority of New Zealand shall notify the Competent Authority of the United States where it has reason to believe that minor or administrative errors may have led to incorrect or incomplete reporting or resulted in other infringements of this Agreement. The Competent Authority of each Party shall apply its domestic law to obtain corrected and/or complete information or to resolve other infringements of this Agreement. 2. Significant Non-Compliance. a) A Competent Authority shall notify the Competent Authority of the other Party when the first-mentioned Competent Authority has determined that there is significant non- compliance with the obligations under this Agreement with respect to a Reporting Financial Institution in the other jurisdiction. The Competent Authority of such other Party 30 shall apply its domestic law (including applicable penalties) to address the significant non-compliance described in the notice. b) If, in the case of a Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution, such enforcement actions do not resolve the non- compliance within a period of 18 months after notification of significant non-compliance is first provided, the United States shall treat the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution as a Nonparticipating Financial Institution pursuant to this subparagraph 2(b). 3. Reliance on Third Party Service Providers. Each Party may allow Reporting Financial Institutions to use third party service providers to fulfill the obligations imposed on such Reporting Financial Institutions by a Party, as contemplated in this Agreement, but these obligations shall remain the responsibility of the Reporting Financial Institutions. 4. Prevention of Avoidance. The Parties shall implement as necessary requirements to prevent Financial Institutions from adopting practices intended to circumvent the reporting required under this Agreement. Article 6 Mutual Commitment to Continue to Enhance the Effectiveness of Information Exchange and Transparency 1. Reciprocity. The Government of the United States acknowledges the need to achieve equivalent levels of reciprocal automatic information exchange with the Government of New Zealand. The Government of the United States is committed to further improve transparency and enhance 31 the exchange relationship with New Zealand by pursuing the adoption of regulations and advocating and supporting relevant legislation to achieve such equivalent levels of reciprocal automatic information exchange. 2. Treatment of Passthru Payments and Gross Proceeds. The Parties are committed to work together, along with Partner Jurisdictions, to develop a practical and effective alternative approach to achieve the policy objectives of foreign passthru payment and gross proceeds withholding that minimizes burden. 3. Development of Common Reporting and Exchange Model. The Parties are committed to working with Partner Jurisdictions and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development on adapting the terms of this Agreement and other agreements between the United States and Partner Jurisdictions to a common model for automatic exchange of information, including the development of reporting and due diligence standards for financial institutions. 4. Documentation of Accounts Maintained as of June 30, 2014. With respect to Reportable Accounts maintained by a Reporting Financial Institution as of June 30, 2014: a) The United States commits to establish, by January 1, 2017, for reporting with respect to 2017 and subsequent years, rules requiring Reporting U.S. Financial Institutions to obtain and report the New Zealand TIN of each Account Holder of a New Zealand Reportable Account as required pursuant to subparagraph 2(b)(1) of Article 2 of this Agreement; and b) New Zealand commits to establish, by January 1, 2017, for reporting with respect to 2017 and subsequent years, rules 32 requiring Reporting New Zealand Financial Institutions to obtain the U.S. TIN of each Specified U.S. Person as required pursuant to subparagraph 2(a)(1) of Article 2 of this Agreement.

New Zealand shall be granted the benefit of any more favorable terms under Article 4 or Annex I of this Agreement relating to the application of FATCA to New Zealand Financial Institutions afforded to another Partner Jurisdiction under a signed bilateral agreement pursuant to which the other Partner Jurisdiction commits to undertake the same obligations as New Zealand described in Articles 2 and 3 of this Agreement, and subject to the same terms and conditions as described therein and in Articles 5 through 9 of this Agreement. 2. The United States shall notify New Zealand of any such more favorable terms, and such more favorable terms shall apply automatically under this Agreement as if such terms were specified in this Agreement and effective as of the date of the signing of the agreement incorporating the more favorable terms, unless New Zealand declines in writing the application thereof.

FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF NEW ZEALAND: FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 1 ANNEX I DUE DILIGENCE OBLIGATIONS FOR IDENTIFYING AND REPORTING ON U.S. REPORTABLE ACCOUNTS AND ON PAYMENTS TO CERTAIN NONPARTICIPATING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS I. General A. New Zealand shall require that Reporting New Zealand Financial Institutions apply the due diligence procedures contained in this Annex I to identify U.S. Reportable Accounts and accounts held by Nonparticipating Financial Institutions. B. For purposes of the Agreement, 1. All dollar amounts are in U.S. dollars and shall be read to include the equivalent in other currencies. 2. Except as otherwise provided herein, the balance or value of an account shall be determined as of the last day of the calendar year or other appropriate reporting period. 3. Where a balance or value threshold is to be determined as of June 30, 2014 under this Annex I, the relevant balance or value shall be determined as of that day, and where a balance or value threshold is to be determined as of the last day of a calendar year under this Annex I, 2 the relevant balance or value shall be determined as of the last day of the calendar year or other appropriate reporting period. 4. Subject to subparagraph E(1) of section II of this Annex I, an account shall be treated as a U.S. Reportable Account beginning as of the date it is identified as such pursuant to the due diligence procedures in this Annex I. 5. Unless otherwise provided, information with respect to a U.S. Reportable Account shall be reported annually in the calendar year following the year to which the information relates. C. As an alternative to the procedures described in each section of this Annex I, New Zealand may permit Reporting New Zealand Financial Institutions to rely on the procedures described in relevant U.S. Treasury Regulations to establish whether an account is a U.S. Reportable Account or an account held by a Nonparticipating Financial Institution. New Zealand may permit Reporting New Zealand Financial Institutions to make such election separately for each section of this Annex I either with respect to all relevant Financial Accounts or, separately, with respect to any clearly identified group of such accounts (such as by line of business or the location of where the account is maintained). 3 II. Preexisting Individual Accounts. The following rules and procedures apply for purposes of identifying U.S. Reportable Accounts among Preexisting Accounts held by individuals (“Preexisting Individual Accounts”). A. Accounts Not Required to Be Reviewed, Identified, or Reported. Unless the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution elects otherwise, either with respect to all Preexisting Individual Accounts or, separately, with respect to any clearly identified group of such accounts, where the implementing rules in New Zealand provide for such an election, the following Preexisting Individual Accounts are not required to be reviewed, identified, or reported as U.S. Reportable Accounts: 1. Subject to subparagraph E(2) of this section, a Preexisting Individual Account with a balance or value that does not exceed $50,000 as of June 30, 2014. 2. Subject to subparagraph E(2) of this section, a Preexisting Individual Account that is a Cash Value Insurance Contract or an Annuity Contract with a balance or value of $250,000 or less as of June 30, 2014. 3. A Preexisting Individual Account that is a Cash Value Insurance Contract or an Annuity Contract, provided the law or regulations of New Zealand or the United States effectively prevent the sale of such a Cash Value 4 Insurance Contract or an Annuity Contract to U.S. residents (e.g., if the relevant Financial Institution does not have the required registration under U.S. law, and the law of New Zealand requires reporting or withholding with respect to insurance products held by residents of New Zealand). 4. A Depository Account with a balance of $50,000 or less. B. Review Procedures for Preexisting Individual Accounts With a Balance or Value as of June 30, 2014, that Exceeds $50,000 ($250,000 for a Cash Value Insurance Contract or Annuity Contract), But Does Not Exceed $1,000,000 (“Lower Value Accounts”). 1. Electronic Record Search. The Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution must review electronically searchable data maintained by the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution for any of the following U.S. indicia: a) Identification of the Account Holder as a U.S. citizen or resident; b) Unambiguous indication of a U.S. place of birth; c) Current U.S. mailing or residence address (including a U.S. post office box); 5 d) Current U.S. telephone number; e) Standing instructions to transfer funds to an account maintained in the United States; f) Currently effective power of attorney or signatory authority granted to a person with a U.S. address; or g) An “in-care-of” or “hold mail” address that is the sole address the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution has on file for the Account Holder. In the case of a Preexisting Individual Account that is a Lower Value Account, an “in- care-of” address outside the United States or “hold mail” address shall not be treated as U.S. indicia. 2. If none of the U.S. indicia listed in subparagraph B(1) of this section are discovered in the electronic search, then no further action is required until there is a change in circumstances that results in one or more U.S. indicia being associated with the account, or the account becomes a High Value Account described in paragraph D of this section. 3. If any of the U.S. indicia listed in subparagraph B(1) of this section are discovered in the electronic search, or if there is a change in circumstances that results in one or more U.S. indicia being associated with the account, then the Reporting New Zealand Financial 6 Institution must treat the account as a U.S. Reportable Account unless it elects to apply subparagraph B(4) of this section and one of the exceptions in such subparagraph applies with respect to that account. 4. Notwithstanding a finding of U.S. indicia under subparagraph B(1) of this section, a Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution is not required to treat an account as a U.S. Reportable Account if: a) Where the Account Holder information unambiguously indicates a U.S. place of birth, the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution obtains, or has previously reviewed and maintains a record of: (1) A self-certification that the Account Holder is neither a U.S. citizen nor a U.S. resident for tax purposes (which may be on an IRS Form W-8 or other similar agreed form); (2) A non-U.S. passport or other government-issued identification evidencing the Account Holder’s citizenship or nationality in a country other than the United States; and 7 (3) A copy of the Account Holder’s Certificate of Loss of Nationality of the United States or a reasonable explanation of: (a) The reason the Account Holder does not have such a certificate despite relinquishing U.S. citizenship; or (b) The reason the Account Holder did not obtain U.S. citizenship at birth. b) Where the Account Holder information contains a current U.S. mailing or residence address, or one or more U.S. telephone numbers that are the only telephone numbers associated with the account, the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution obtains, or has previously reviewed and maintains a record of: (1) A self-certification that the Account Holder is neither a U.S. citizen nor a U.S. resident for tax purposes (which may be on an IRS Form W-8 or other similar agreed form); and 8 (2) Documentary evidence, as defined in paragraph D of section VI of this Annex I, establishing the Account Holder’s non- U.S. status. c) Where the Account Holder information contains standing instructions to transfer funds to an account maintained in the United States, the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution obtains, or has previously reviewed and maintains a record of: (1) A self-certification that the Account Holder is neither a U.S. citizen nor a U.S. resident for tax purposes (which may be on an IRS Form W-8 or other similar agreed form); and (2) Documentary evidence, as defined in paragraph D of section VI of this Annex I, establishing the Account Holder’s non- U.S. status. d) Where the Account Holder information contains a currently effective power of attorney or signatory authority granted to a person with a U.S. address, has an “in-care-of” address or “hold mail” address that is the sole address identified for the Account Holder, or has one or more U.S. telephone numbers (if a non-U.S. telephone number is also associated with the 9 account), the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution obtains, or has previously reviewed and maintains a record of: (1) A self-certification that the Account Holder is neither a U.S. citizen nor a U.S. resident for tax purposes (which may be on an IRS Form W-8 or other similar agreed form); or (2) Documentary evidence, as defined in paragraph D of section VI of this Annex I, establishing the Account Holder’s non- U.S. status. C. Additional Procedures Applicable to Preexisting Individual Accounts That Are Lower Value Accounts. 1. Review of Preexisting Individual Accounts that are Lower Value Accounts for U.S. indicia must be completed by June 30, 2016. 2. If there is a change of circumstances with respect to a Preexisting Individual Account that is a Lower Value Account that results in one or more U.S. indicia described in subparagraph B(1) of this section being associated with the account, then the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution must treat the account as a U.S. Reportable Account unless subparagraph B(4) of this section applies. 10 3. Except for Depository Accounts described in subparagraph A(4) of this section, any Preexisting Individual Account that has been identified as a U.S. Reportable Account under this section shall be treated as a U.S. Reportable Account in all subsequent years, unless the Account Holder ceases to be a Specified U.S. Person. D. Enhanced Review Procedures for Preexisting Individual Accounts With a Balance or Value That Exceeds $1,000,000 as of June 30, 2014, or December 31 of 2015 or Any Subsequent Year (“High Value Accounts”). 1. Electronic Record Search. The Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution must review electronically searchable data maintained by the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution for any of the U.S. indicia described in subparagraph B(1) of this section. 2. Paper Record Search. If the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution’s electronically searchable databases include fields for, and capture all of the information described in, subparagraph D(3) of this section, then no further paper record search is required. If the electronic databases do not capture all of this information, then with respect to a High Value Account, the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution must also review the current customer master file and, to the extent not contained in the 11 current customer master file, the following documents associated with the account and obtained by the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution within the last five years for any of the U.S. indicia described in subparagraph B(1) of this section: a) The most recent documentary evidence collected with respect to the account; b) The most recent account opening contract or documentation; c) The most recent documentation obtained by the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution pursuant to AML/KYC Procedures or for other regulatory purposes; d) Any power of attorney or signature authority forms currently in effect; and e) Any standing instructions to transfer funds currently in effect. 3. Exception Where Databases Contain Sufficient Information. A Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution is not required to perform the paper record search described in subparagraph D(2) of this section if the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution’s electronically searchable information includes the following: 12 a) The Account Holder’s nationality or residence status; b) The Account Holder’s residence address and mailing address currently on file with the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution; c) The Account Holder’s telephone number(s) currently on file, if any, with the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution; d) Whether there are standing instructions to transfer funds in the account to another account (including an account at another branch of the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution or another Financial Institution); e) Whether there is a current “in-care-of” address or “hold mail” address for the Account Holder; and f) Whether there is any power of attorney or signatory authority for the account. 4. Relationship Manager Inquiry for Actual Knowledge. In addition to the electronic and paper record searches described above, the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution must treat as a U.S. Reportable Account any High Value Account assigned to a relationship manager (including any Financial Accounts aggregated with such High Value Account) if 13 the relationship manager has actual knowledge that the Account Holder is a Specified U.S. Person. 5. Effect of Finding U.S. Indicia. a) If none of the U.S. indicia listed in subparagraph B(1) of this section are discovered in the enhanced review of High Value Accounts described above, and the account is not identified as held by a Specified U.S. Person in subparagraph D(4) of this section, then no further action is required until there is a change in circumstances that results in one or more U.S. indicia being associated with the account. b) If any of the U.S. indicia listed in subparagraph B(1) of this section are discovered in the enhanced review of High Value Accounts described above, or if there is a subsequent change in circumstances that results in one or more U.S. indicia being associated with the account, then the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution must treat the account as a U.S. Reportable Account unless it elects to apply subparagraph B(4) of this section and one of the exceptions in such subparagraph applies with respect to that account. c) Except for Depository Accounts described in subparagraph A(4) of this section, any 14 Preexisting Individual Account that has been identified as a U.S. Reportable Account under this section shall be treated as a U.S. Reportable Account in all subsequent years, unless the Account Holder ceases to be a Specified U.S. Person. E. Additional Procedures Applicable to High Value Accounts. 1. If a Preexisting Individual Account is a High Value Account as of June 30, 2014, the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution must complete the enhanced review procedures described in paragraph D of this section with respect to such account by June 30, 2015. If based on this review such account is identified as a U.S. Reportable Account on or before December 31, 2014, the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution must report the required information about such account with respect to 2014 in the first report on the account and on an annual basis thereafter. In the case of an account identified as a U.S. Reportable Account after December 31, 2014 and on or before June 30, 2015, the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution is not required to report information about such account with respect to 2014, but must report information about the account on an annual basis thereafter. 2. If a Preexisting Individual Account is not a High Value Account as of June 30, 2014, but becomes a High 15 Value Account as of the last day of 2015 or any subsequent calendar year, the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution must complete the enhanced review procedures described in paragraph D of this section with respect to such account within six months after the last day of the calendar year in which the account becomes a High Value Account. If based on this review such account is identified as a U.S. Reportable Account, the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution must report the required information about such account with respect to the year in which it is identified as a U.S. Reportable Account and subsequent years on an annual basis, unless the Account Holder ceases to be a Specified U.S. Person. 3. Once a Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution applies the enhanced review procedures described in paragraph D of this section to a High Value Account, the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution is not required to re-apply such procedures, other than the relationship manager inquiry described in subparagraph D(4) of this section, to the same High Value Account in any subsequent year. 4. If there is a change of circumstances with respect to a High Value Account that results in one or more U.S. indicia described in subparagraph B(1) of this section being associated with the account, then the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution must treat the account as a U.S. Reportable Account unless it elects 16 to apply subparagraph B(4) of this section and one of the exceptions in such subparagraph applies with respect to that account. 5. A Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution must implement procedures to ensure that a relationship manager identifies any change in circumstances of an account. For example, if a relationship manager is notified that the Account Holder has a new mailing address in the United States, the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution is required to treat the new address as a change in circumstances and, if it elects to apply subparagraph B(4) of this section, is required to obtain the appropriate documentation from the Account Holder. F. Preexisting Individual Accounts That Have Been Documented for Certain Other Purposes. A Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution that has previously obtained documentation from an Account Holder to establish the Account Holder’s status as neither a U.S. citizen nor a U.S. resident in order to meet its obligations under a qualified intermediary, withholding foreign partnership, or withholding foreign trust agreement with the IRS, or to fulfill its obligations under chapter 61 of Title 26 of the United States Code, is not required to perform the procedures described in subparagraph B(1) of this section with respect to Lower Value Accounts or subparagraphs D(1) through D(3) of this section with respect to High Value Accounts. 17 III. New Individual Accounts. The following rules and procedures apply for purposes of identifying U.S. Reportable Accounts among Financial Accounts held by individuals and opened on or after July 1, 2014 (“New Individual Accounts”). A. Accounts Not Required to Be Reviewed, Identified, or Reported. Unless the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution elects otherwise, either with respect to all New Individual Accounts or, separately, with respect to any clearly identified group of such accounts, where the implementing rules in New Zealand provide for such an election, the following New Individual Accounts are not required to be reviewed, identified, or reported as U.S. Reportable Accounts: 1. A Depository Account unless the account balance exceeds $50,000 at the end of any calendar year or other appropriate reporting period. 2. A Cash Value Insurance Contract unless the Cash Value exceeds $50,000 at the end of any calendar year or other appropriate reporting period. B. Other New Individual Accounts. With respect to New Individual Accounts not described in paragraph A of this section, upon account opening (or within 90 days after the end of the calendar year in which the account ceases to be described in paragraph A of this section), the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution must obtain a self- certification, which may be part of the account opening documentation, that allows the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution to determine whether the Account Holder 18 is resident in the United States for tax purposes (for this purpose, a U.S. citizen is considered to be resident in the United States for tax purposes, even if the Account Holder is also a tax resident of another jurisdiction) and confirm the reasonableness of such self-certification based on the information obtained by the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution in connection with the opening of the account, including any documentation collected pursuant to AML/KYC Procedures. 1. If the self-certification establishes that the Account Holder is resident in the United States for tax purposes, the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution must treat the account as a U.S. Reportable Account and obtain a self-certification that includes the Account Holder’s U.S. TIN (which may be an IRS Form W-9 or other similar agreed form). 2. If there is a change of circumstances with respect to a New Individual Account that causes the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution to know, or have reason to know, that the original self-certification is incorrect or unreliable, the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution cannot rely on the original self- certification and must obtain a valid self-certification that establishes whether the Account Holder is a U.S. citizen or resident for U.S. tax purposes. If the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution is unable to obtain a valid self-certification, the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution must treat the account as a U.S. Reportable Account. 19 IV. Preexisting Entity Accounts. The following rules and procedures apply for purposes of identifying U.S. Reportable Accounts and accounts held by Nonparticipating Financial Institutions among Preexisting Accounts held by Entities (“Preexisting Entity Accounts”). A. Entity Accounts Not Required to Be Reviewed, Identified or Reported. Unless the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution elects otherwise, either with respect to all Preexisting Entity Accounts or, separately, with respect to any clearly identified group of such accounts, where the implementing rules in New Zealand provide for such an election, a Preexisting Entity Account with an account balance or value that does not exceed $250,000 as of June 30, 2014, is not required to be reviewed, identified, or reported as a U.S. Reportable Account until the account balance or value exceeds $1,000,000. B. Entity Accounts Subject to Review. A Preexisting Entity Account that has an account balance or value that exceeds $250,000 as of June 30, 2014, and a Preexisting Entity Account that does not exceed $250,000 as of June 30, 2014 but the account balance or value of which exceeds $1,000,000 as of the last day of 2015 or any subsequent calendar year, must be reviewed in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph D of this section. C. Entity Accounts With Respect to Which Reporting Is Required. With respect to Preexisting Entity Accounts described in paragraph B of this section, only accounts that are held by one or more Entities that are Specified U.S. 20 Persons, or by Passive NFFEs with one or more Controlling Persons who are U.S. citizens or residents shall be treated as U.S. Reportable Accounts. In addition, accounts held by Nonparticipating Financial Institutions shall be treated as accounts for which aggregate payments as described in subparagraph 1(b) of Article 4 of the Agreement are reported to the New Zealand Competent Authority. D. Review Procedures for Identifying Entity Accounts With Respect to Which Reporting Is Required. For Preexisting Entity Accounts described in paragraph B of this section, the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution must apply the following review procedures to determine whether the account is held by one or more Specified U.S. Persons, by Passive NFFEs with one or more Controlling Persons who are U.S. citizens or residents, or by Nonparticipating Financial Institutions: 1. Determine Whether the Entity Is a Specified U.S. Person. a) Review information maintained for regulatory or customer relationship purposes (including information collected pursuant to AML/KYC Procedures) to determine whether the information indicates that the Account Holder is a U.S. Person. For this purpose, information indicating that the Account Holder is a U.S. Person includes a U.S. place of incorporation or organization, or a U.S. address. 21 b) If the information indicates that the Account Holder is a U.S. Person, the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution must treat the account as a U.S. Reportable Account unless it obtains a self-certification from the Account Holder (which may be on an IRS Form W-8 or W-9, or a similar agreed form), or reasonably determines based on information in its possession or that is publicly available, that the Account Holder is not a Specified U.S. Person. 2. Determine Whether a Non-U.S. Entity Is a Financial Institution. a) Review information maintained for regulatory or customer relationship purposes (including information collected pursuant to AML/KYC Procedures) to determine whether the information indicates that the Account Holder is a Financial Institution. b) If the information indicates that the Account Holder is a Financial Institution, or the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution verifies the Account Holder’s Global Intermediary Identification Number on the published IRS FFI list, then the account is not a U.S. Reportable Account. 22 3. Determine Whether a Financial Institution Is a Nonparticipating Financial Institution Payments to Which Are Subject to Aggregate Reporting Under Subparagraph 1(b) of Article 4 of the Agreement. a) Subject to subparagraph D(3)(b) of this section, a Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution may determine that the Account Holder is a New Zealand Financial Institution or other Partner Jurisdiction Financial Institution if the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution reasonably determines that the Account Holder has such status on the basis of the Account Holder’s Global Intermediary Identification Number on the published IRS FFI list or other information that is publicly available or in the possession of the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution, as applicable. In such case, no further review, identification, or reporting is required with respect to the account. b) If the Account Holder is a New Zealand Financial Institution or other Partner Jurisdiction Financial Institution treated by the IRS as a Nonparticipating Financial Institution, then the account is not a U.S. Reportable Account, but payments to the Account Holder must be reported as contemplated in subparagraph 1(b) of Article 4 of the Agreement. 23 c) If the Account Holder is not a New Zealand Financial Institution or other Partner Jurisdiction Financial Institution, then the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution must treat the Account Holder as a Nonparticipating Financial Institution payments to which are reportable under subparagraph 1(b) of Article 4 of the Agreement, unless the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution: (1) Obtains a self-certification (which may be on an IRS Form W-8 or similar agreed form) from the Account Holder that it is a certified deemed-compliant FFI, or an exempt beneficial owner, as those terms are defined in relevant U.S. Treasury Regulations; or (2) In the case of a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI, verifies the Account Holder’s Global Intermediary Identification Number on the published IRS FFI list. 4. Determine Whether an Account Held by an NFFE Is a U.S. Reportable Account. With respect to an Account Holder of a Preexisting Entity Account that is not identified as either a U.S. Person or a Financial Institution, the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution must identify (i) whether the Account Holder has Controlling Persons, (ii) whether the Account 24 Holder is a Passive NFFE, and (iii) whether any of the Controlling Persons of the Account Holder is a U.S. citizen or resident. In making these determinations the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution must follow the guidance in subparagraphs D(4)(a) through D(4)(d) of this section in the order most appropriate under the circumstances. a) For purposes of determining the Controlling Persons of an Account Holder, a Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution may rely on information collected and maintained pursuant to AML/KYC Procedures. b) For purposes of determining whether the Account Holder is a Passive NFFE, the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution must obtain a self-certification (which may be on an IRS Form W-8 or W-9, or on a similar agreed form) from the Account Holder to establish its status, unless it has information in its possession or that is publicly available, based on which it can reasonably determine that the Account Holder is an Active NFFE. c) For purposes of determining whether a Controlling Person of a Passive NFFE is a U.S. citizen or resident for tax purposes, a Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution may rely on: 25 (1) Information collected and maintained pursuant to AML/KYC Procedures in the case of a Preexisting Entity Account held by one or more NFFEs with an account balance or value that does not exceed $1,000,000; or (2) A self-certification (which may be on an IRS Form W-8 or W-9, or on a similar agreed form) from the Account Holder or such Controlling Person in the case of a Preexisting Entity Account held by one or more NFFEs with an account balance or value that exceeds $1,000,000. d) If any Controlling Person of a Passive NFFE is a U.S. citizen or resident, the account shall be treated as a U.S. Reportable Account. E. Timing of Review and Additional Procedures Applicable to Preexisting Entity Accounts. 1. Review of Preexisting Entity Accounts with an account balance or value that exceeds $250,000 as of June 30, 2014 must be completed by June 30, 2016. 2. Review of Preexisting Entity Accounts with an account balance or value that does not exceed $250,000 as of June 30, 2014, but exceeds $1,000,000 as of December 31 of 2015 or any subsequent year, must be completed within six months after the last day of 26 the calendar year in which the account balance or value exceeds $1,000,000. 3. If there is a change of circumstances with respect to a Preexisting Entity Account that causes the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution to know, or have reason to know, that the self-certification or other documentation associated with an account is incorrect or unreliable, the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution must redetermine the status of the account in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph D of this section. V. New Entity Accounts. The following rules and procedures apply for purposes of identifying U.S. Reportable Accounts and accounts held by Nonparticipating Financial Institutions among Financial Accounts held by Entities and opened on or after July 1, 2014 (“New Entity Accounts”). A. Entity Accounts Not Required to Be Reviewed, Identified or Reported. Unless the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution elects otherwise, either with respect to all New Entity Accounts or, separately, with respect to any clearly identified group of such accounts, where the implementing rules in New Zealand provide for such election, a credit card account or a revolving credit facility treated as a New Entity Account is not required to be reviewed, identified, or reported, provided that the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution maintaining such account implements policies and procedures to prevent an account balance owed to the Account Holder that exceeds $50,000. 27 B. Other New Entity Accounts. With respect to New Entity Accounts not described in paragraph A of this section, the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution must determine whether the Account Holder is: (i) a Specified U.S. Person; (ii) a New Zealand Financial Institution or other Partner Jurisdiction Financial Institution; (iii) a participating FFI, a deemed-compliant FFI, or an exempt beneficial owner, as those terms are defined in relevant U.S. Treasury Regulations; or (iv) an Active NFFE or Passive NFFE. 1. Subject to subparagraph B(2) of this section, a Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution may determine that the Account Holder is an Active NFFE, a New Zealand Financial Institution, or other Partner Jurisdiction Financial Institution if the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution reasonably determines that the Account Holder has such status on the basis of the Account Holder’s Global Intermediary Identification Number or other information that is publicly available or in the possession of the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution, as applicable. 2. If the Account Holder is a New Zealand Financial Institution or other Partner Jurisdiction Financial Institution treated by the IRS as a Nonparticipating Financial Institution, then the account is not a U.S. Reportable Account, but payments to the Account Holder must be reported as contemplated in subparagraph 1(b) of Article 4 of the Agreement. 28 3. In all other cases, a Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution must obtain a self-certification from the Account Holder to establish the Account Holder’s status. Based on the self-certification, the following rules apply: a) If the Account Holder is a Specified U.S. Person, the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution must treat the account as a U.S. Reportable Account. b) If the Account Holder is a Passive NFFE, the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution must identify the Controlling Persons as determined under AML/KYC Procedures, and must determine whether any such person is a U.S. citizen or resident on the basis of a self- certification from the Account Holder or such person. If any such person is a U.S. citizen or resident, the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution must treat the account as a U.S. Reportable Account. c) If the Account Holder is: (i) a U.S. Person that is not a Specified U.S. Person; (ii) subject to subparagraph B(3)(d) of this section, a New Zealand Financial Institution or other Partner Jurisdiction Financial Institution; (iii) a participating FFI, a deemed-compliant FFI, or an exempt beneficial owner, as those terms are defined in relevant U.S. Treasury Regulations; 29 (iv) an Active NFFE; or (v) a Passive NFFE none of the Controlling Persons of which is a U.S. citizen or resident, then the account is not a U.S. Reportable Account, and no reporting is required with respect to the account. d) If the Account Holder is a Nonparticipating Financial Institution (including a New Zealand Financial Institution or other Partner Jurisdiction Financial Institution treated by the IRS as a Nonparticipating Financial Institution), then the account is not a U.S. Reportable Account, but payments to the Account Holder must be reported as contemplated in subparagraph 1(b) of Article 4 of the Agreement. VI. Special Rules and Definitions. The following additional rules and definitions apply in implementing the due diligence procedures described above: A. Reliance on Self-Certifications and Documentary Evidence. A Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution may not rely on a self-certification or documentary evidence if the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution knows or has reason to know that the self-certification or documentary evidence is incorrect or unreliable.

For purposes of determining the aggregate balance or value of Financial Accounts held by an individual, a Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution is required to aggregate all Financial Accounts maintained by the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution, or by a Related Entity, but only to the extent that the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution’s computerized systems link the Financial Accounts by reference to a data element such as client number or taxpayer identification number, and allow account balances or values to be aggregated. Each holder of a jointly held Financial Account shall be attributed the entire balance or value of the jointly held Financial Account for purposes of applying the aggregation requirements described in this paragraph 1. 35 2.

The following Entities shall be treated as Non-Reporting New Zealand Financial Institutions and as exempt beneficial owners for purposes of sections 1471 and 1472 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, other than with respect to a payment that is derived from an obligation held in connection with a commercial financial activity of a type engaged in by a Specified Insurance Company, Custodial Institution, or Depository Institution. A. Governmental Entities.

[Taxation (International Investment and Remedial Matters) Act 2012](/new-legislation/act-articles/taxation-international-investment-and-remedial-matters-act-2012 "Taxation (International Investment and Remedial Matters) Act 2012")

AIL and associated persons remedial
===================================

2012 amendment to legislation relating to the approved issuer levy, definition of associated persons and trusts.

In 2009 a change was made to the associated persons definition. This had the unintended consequence of making some bond issuers and bond holders associated persons when they were only associated through the use of a bond trust.

This meant that bond issuers were required to pay non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) on interest payments to non-resident bond-holders. Prior to the 2009 changes, they were able to pay the approved issuer levy which applies at a lower rate than NRWT.

#### Key features

Section RF 12(1)(a)(ii) has been amended so that a zero rate of NRWT is still available in cases when the approved issuer and the non-resident are associated only due to the use of a trust which has been established for the principal purpose of protecting and enforcing the rights which the beneficiaries of a trust have under the registered security.

Note that if the non-resident is also associated with the issuer for another reason (for example if the non-resident owns 50% of the shares in the issuer) they are not eligible for a zero rate of NRWT.

#### Application date

The amendments apply for the 2010-11 and later income years. This is consistent with the date on which the new associated persons definition in subpart YB began to apply.

#### Detailed analysis

Section RF 12(2) provides a zero rate of NRWT if the conditions in section RF 12(1) are met.

Section RF 12(1)(a) sets out three requirements, for the zero rate of NRWT. These are that that AIL has been paid, that the bond-holder and bond issuer are not associated and that the interest is not jointly derived by a resident.

The Act amends section RF 12(1)(a)(ii) so that, if the approved issuer and the non-resident person who receives the interest are associated only due to the use of a trust which has been established for the principal purpose of protecting and enforcing the rights which the beneficiaries of a trust have under a debt security, then a zero rate of NRWT is still available if AIL is paid.

**Example**

![A diagram example of how the non-resident bond holder can associate in several ways with the NZ approved issuer because of the bond trust.](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/4/c/4c61ee004ba376f88ff2bf9ef8e4b077/page-44.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214412&hash=64F41FF226E7AEEFEF3100908D49CB99)

In the above example the non-resident bond holder could be associated in several ways with the New Zealand approved issuer because of the bond trust.

The non-resident bond holder is a beneficiary of the bond trust so would be associated with the trustee of the bond trust under section YB 6.

If the approved issuer appointed the trustee of the bond trust they would be associated with the bond trust under section YB 11. Alternatively, in some cases the approved issuer could potentially qualify as a settlor of the trust and be associated with the trustee under section YB 8. In either case the tri-partite rule in section YB 14 would come into play and deem the approved issuer and the non-resident bond holder to be associated with each other because they are each associated with the trustee of the trust.

If the approved issuer and the non-resident bond holder are associated only due to one of the above circumstances, that is they are associated only because of the existence of the bond trust, then they will still be able to get a zero rate of NRWT in cases where AIL was paid (and the interest was not jointly derived by a resident).

If the non-resident bond holder was associated for a reason that is not due to the existence of the bond trust, such as holding 50% of the shares in the approved issuer, then they would not qualify for a zero rate of NRWT under section RF 12.

How to use this document The AIM Business use cases show sequences of IR’s gateway Return Service operations that could be used to achieve a specific business outcome. They do not comprise a comprehensive list of all required business outcomes, nor are they prescriptive or intended to inhibit software innovation in any way. Additionally the processes described to invoke the Returns service operations should not inhibit innovation to combine calls across the Gateway Service to achieve the same outcome or solve business needs not described here. The AIM worked examples provides sample calculations to reference for AIM. Business rules for AIM eligibility Inland Revenue’s Gateway Services will enforce the following AIM eligibility rules: Notes 1 The linking/delinking between a tax agent with their client/s is excluded from the scope of Gateway Services. This action must be done using the existing online services channel, which may take up to 48 hours. 2 The terms ‘Activity Statement’, ‘Statement of Activity’ and ‘SOA’ are used interchangeably and represent the same meaning. SN Criteria 1 Customer is not one of a class of customers excluded from using AIM (partnerships, Maori authorities, super funds and look through companies). 2 Customer is ‘active’. 3 Customer is not a member of an income tax consolidated group. 4 The tax year for which the customer wants to use AIM is not a transitional year (i.e. they have not changed their balance date in that year) . 4 IN CONFIDENCE Summary of AIM use cases # Business use case File Prepop Retrieve Status Retrieve Return Retrieve Filing Obligation 1 Confirm user’s eligibility to use AIM service 1 2 Submit a new Statement of Activity 2 1 3 Retrieve the status of previously submitted Statement of Activity and next filing obligation 1 2 4 Retrieve previously submitted Statement of Activity 1 5 Amend and submit a Statement of Activity 3 2 1 5 IN CONFIDENCE Use Case 01: Confirm user’s eligibility to use AIM service Confirm user’s eligibility to use AIM service User Accounting Software IR Gateway Services 1 .

He has no previous business knowledge and his parents suggest he meet with their accountant to get some advice. The accountant suggests Murphy sets up a company, start using a basic accounting software package and elect into paying provisional tax using the AIM approach to help him budget in his first year of business. Murphy’s company has a March balance date and will pay GST and provisional tax using the AIM approach on a two-monthly basis. Murphy does not make any profit in the first few months but starts to make a profit towards the end of the year. He will pay provisional tax under AIM as follows: GST and provisional tax payment dates 28-Jun 2018 28-Aug 2018 28-Oct 2018 15-Jan 2019 28-Feb 2019 7-May 2019 Total prov tax Terminal tax due Income earned during current year Nil Nil NIL 20,000 30,000 50,000 28,000 AIM payment amount Nil Nil Nil 5,600 8,400 14,000 28,000 Nil AIM will help Murphy budget for tax correctly in his first year of operation as he pays tax as he earns income. Example 2 Sandy has just completed a qualification in graphic design and has decided to set up a business designing websites for customers. Being new to business Sandy approaches an accountant to understand what her tax obligations are and what dates tax payments need to be made. Her accountant recommends that Sandy use an accounting software package and suggests some options. Given Sandy is going to use accounting software to keep track of how her business is doing she thinks it makes sense to use an AIM-capable accounting system which also calculates her provisional tax liability. Sandy’s business has a March balance date and will pay GST and provisional tax using AIM on a twomonthly basis. For the first part of the year Sandy makes no profit but as the year progresses Sandy’s business starts making a profit. Under AIM Sandy will pay provisional tax as follows: GST and provisional tax payment dates 28-Jun 2018 28-Aug 2018 28-Oct 2018 15-Jan 2019 28-Feb 2019 7-May 2019 Total prov tax Terminal tax due Income earned during current year Nil Nil 3,000 7,500 12,000 18,000 6,108 AIM payment amount 315 788 1,855 3,150 6,108 0 19 IN CONFIDENCE Example 3 Benson Electrical Ltd is considering using AIM. They currently use accounting software, pay GST every two months, and have a March balance date. Their accountant talks to them about using AIM due to the unpredictable nature of the contracts they are being awarded. The inability to plan in the past has resulted in exposure to use-of-money interest. They generally have a slow start to the financial year but business picks up in the latter half. Their business is steadily growing and their residual income tax is $180,000 in 2017 and $220,000 in 2018. They ask their accountant to show them what their provisional tax liability would look like under different methods for the 2019 year and how exposure to use-of-money interest would differ. In this scenario, their possible use-of-money interest 1 costs range between nil and $6,880.

On its third AIM provisional tax payment date, the software calculated that Tussock Socks Ltd owed $500 in provisional tax to Inland Revenue and submitted the Statement of Activity showing this amount to be due. Instead of paying $500 to Inland Revenue, Tussock Socks Ltd only paid $100. Tussock Socks Ltd will be liable for UOMI and late payment penalty on the $400 underpayment until it is paid (or the liability is extinguished by a future instalment period). Example 5 Cameo Jewels Ltd is a small jewellery company using AIM to pay its provisional tax. It calculates its provisional tax payments using software, and makes the payments accordingly. At year-end the company meets with its accountant who discovers their depreciation was calculated incorrectly and a bad debt had not been written off, resulting in additional income tax due of $300. Cameo Jewels Ltd pays this amount of terminal tax and has no UOMI or shortfall penalty applied. As these errors are simple oversights it is likely Cameo Jewels Ltd has taken reasonable care in the calculation of its tax liability.

AIM champions help Inland Revenue make provisional tax even easier for small businesses
=======================================================================================

**02 August 2018**

Customers are likely to be the biggest advocates for the new Accounting Income Method (AIM) as Inland Revenue looks to improve the product for year two.

AIM is a pay-as-you-go method for provisional tax designed for small businesses where payment is only required when a profit is made.

Inland Revenue customer segment leader Richard Owen says AIM’s benefits are truly game changing.

“Ask any small business owner whether they would like to take the guesswork out of provisional tax, have less exposure to the penalties and interest system and no big tax bill at the end of the year, then you have normally done enough to pique their interest.

“What we’ve always known though is that few want to be early adopters. Many small businesses don’t have the resources to trial every bit of new technology that comes to market.

“Instead we know that they would much rather see what their peers think about AIM before deciding over the next year whether it will work for them.”

The team at Prue Anderson Accounting in Whanganui are enthusiastic early adopters.

Office manager Sandy Sloan says the team prides itself on being quick to welcome the new ways of working associated with modern accountancy and AIM is an extension of that philosophy.

“We want AIM to be successful since a pay-as-you-go system for provisional tax is better for most customers and takes the stress out of taxation.

“Even though calculating shareholder salaries in the first AIM return was a bit of a challenge, there were no nerves in our office about using AIM and we think the majority of eligible provisional taxpayers should embrace it.

“The big test will be at the end of the tax year where we expect our clients will avoid a big bill in the end of year wash up.”

Mr Owen says Inland Revenue along with many small businesses will be eager to hear the experiences of the team at Prue Anderson Accounting as they use AIM to calculate more accurate provisional tax payments for their customers.

“Our early adopters are at the forefront of the big technological changes designed to make tax simpler. We’re grateful to all them for putting in the time and effort to lead the way and feel confident that their early investment will already be paying off.

“Their feedback will not only help us and the software providers improve AIM but will also attract many more to it in the coming years.”

Registrations are now closed for the current tax year but newly established businesses can still join AIM at any time. A bill currently before parliament proposes a change to allow existing businesses to join at any time during the tax year.

Te maraurau AIM me ngā whakaritenga pūmanawa AIM eligibility and software requirements
======================================================================================

Business rules for AIM eligibility
----------------------------------

The following rules apply when using the return service.

*   The customer must not be part of a group excluded from using AIM, for example partnerships, Maori authorities, super funds and look-through companies.
*   The customer must be active.
*   The customer must not be a member of an income tax consolidated group.
*   The tax year the customer wants to use AIM is not a transitional year, for example they have not changed their balance date in that year.

AIM-capable software requirements
---------------------------------

AIM works on a self-certification model. A software system must meet the proposed definition of an AIM-capable accounting system contained in [section RC 7B of the Income Tax Act 2007](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2017/0003/latest/DLM6912493.html)
 in order to gain approval from the Commissioner.

### Definition in legislation

To meet the definition and be approved as an AIM-capable accounting system, the core software accounting package must have the ability to:

*   generate and keep comprehensive financial accounts, including accounting income and expenditure, ledger accounts, trial balances, bank account reconciliations and journals on an on-demand basis, in accordance with good accounting and tax practices
*   calculate tax liabilities using tax adjustments in accordance with the technical determination
*   for tax adjustments not included in the determinations, ensure they reasonably accurately assess tax liabilities
*   recalculate all financial accounts and liabilities retrospectively and produce reports as required by the Commissioner and e-communicate electronically with Inland Revenue and provide the right level of help and assistance to its users.

### Client intermediation

The linking and delinking of a client by their tax agent is excluded from the scope of gateway services. This can be done in myIR Secure Online Services.

[Link to a client account](/topics/intermediaries/linking-client-accounts/link-to-a-client-account)

### Year to date calculations

AIM payments are based on a year to date calculation. Software must be able to work out all financial accounts and liabilities retrospectively and produce reports. This allows for errors to be corrected easily.

### Working out AIM adjustments

Your software needs to incorporate end of year adjustments throughout the year to more accurately reflect taxable income.

Read our determinations for the minimum adjustments required:

### Statements of activity

Software will need to send us information with each payment that shows how it came to this amount. This is a statement of activity and is not treated as an income tax return. Indicative technical schemata for statements of activity are available on GitHub.

The accounting income method (AIM) for paying provisional tax As part of legislation enacted on 21 February 2017, the Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Act 2017, a new method for calculating provisional tax was introduced – the accounting income method (AIM). The new method for calculating provisional tax will be available alongside existing methods – the standard uplift, the estimate method and the GST ratio method. AIM is not replacing these methods. A growing number of small businesses use accounting software. Businesses wanting to calculate their provisional tax obligation using AIM will use upgraded software (an AIM-capable accounting system) which will calculate provisional tax based on current year accounting income information. The summary of determinations provides detail for software developers and the minimum tax adjustments required for AIM-capable systems. The new rules introducing the AIM method of calculating provisional tax have application to the 2018–19 and later income years. Overview AIM is designed to fit better within the existing and ordinary processes of a business and is more reflective of the current year to date financial performance of a business. Under AIM, provisional tax is integrated into business processes and payment amounts are based on current year tax adjusted income. This should provide businesses using AIM with more certainty that they are paying the right amount of tax as it will be paid as income is earned. AIM is available to taxpayers who: • have annual gross income of under $5 million (although there is the ability for some exceptions to this rule); • use an AIM-capable software system; • have not been liable in one of the last four years for a shortfall penalty in relation to their use of AIM; • have not returned tax liabilities using the AIM method with the sole purpose or effect of consistently, year-on - year, reducing their tax liabilities below reasonably accurate amounts; • are not a member of a class of taxpayers excluded from using AIM; and • for the current year, have not failed more than twice to give the Commissioner information required under the AIM method. New payment dates for paying provisional tax under the AIM method have been created. Overpaid amounts of provisional tax paid through AIM can be refunded upon request of the taxpayer before year-end . AIM taxpayers will provide Inland Revenue with a Statement of Activity on or before each instalment date. When an AIM taxpayer makes the provisional tax payments calculated by their AIM-capable software they will not have use-of-money interest exposure should the year end residual income tax result in a different tax liability. AIM provisional tax payments cannot be made through a tax pool, however, tax pooling can be used for terminal tax and reassessment liabilities. Overpaid provisional tax in an AIM taxpaying company may be transferred to the AIM company shareholders to meet their provisional tax liabilities on the dates that their provisional tax is due. The C ommissioner may approve taxpayers who have gross income over the $5 million threshold to use, or continue to use, AIM where the Commissioner is satisfied there is minimal risk that approval will result in less net revenue collected, this is referred to as large business AIM capable software. The following graphic illustrates how AIM works in practice. The following examples display how AIM would apply: Example 1 Murphy has recently finished a painting apprenticeship and intends to set up his own house painting business. He has no previous business knowledge and his parent suggest he meet with their accountant to get some advice. The accountant suggests Murphy sets up a company, start using a basic accounting software package and elect into paying provisional tax using the AIM approach to help him budget in his first year of business. Murphy’s company has a March balance date and will pay GST and provisional tax using the AIM approach on a two - monthly basis. Murphy does not make any profit in the first few months but starts to make a profit towards the end of the year. He will pay provisional tax under AIM as follows: GST and provisional tax payment dates 28-Jun 2018 28-Aug 2018 28-Oct 2018 15-Jan 2019 28-Feb 2019 7-May 2019 Total prov tax Terminal tax due Income earned during current year Nil Nil Nil 20,000 30,000 50,000 28,000 AIM payment amount Nil Nil Nil 5,600 8,400 14,000 28,000 Nil AIM will help Murphy budget for tax correctly in his first year of operation as he pays tax as he earns income. Example 2 Sandy has just completed a qualification in graphic design and has decided to set up a business designing websites for customers. Being new to business Sandy approaches an accountant to understand what her tax obligations are and what dates tax payments need to be made. Her accountant recommends that Sandy use an accounting software package and suggests some options. Given Sandy is going to use accounting software to keep track of how her business is doing she thinks it makes sense to use an AIM-capable accounting system which also calculates her provisional tax liability. Sandy’s business has a March balance date and will pay GST and provisional tax using AIM on a two-monthly basis. For the first part of the y ear Sandy makes no profit but as the year progresses Sandy’s business starts making a profit. Under AIM Sandy will pay provisional tax as follows: GST and provisional tax payment dates 28-Jun 2018 28-Aug 2018 28-Oct 2018 15-Jan 2019 28-Feb 2019 7-May 2019 Total prov tax Terminal tax due Income earned during current year Nil Nil 3,000 7,500 12,000 18,000 6,108 AIM payment amount 315 788 1,855 3,150 6,108 0 Example 3 Benson Electrical Ltd is considering using AIM. They currently use accounting software, pay GST every two months, and have a March balance date. Their accountant talks to them about using AIM due to the unpredictable nature of the contracts they are being awarded. The inability to plan in the past has resulted in exposure to use-of -money interest. They generally have a slow start to the financial year but business picks up in the latter half. Their business is steadily growing and their residual income tax is $180,000 in 2017 and $220,000 in 2018. They ask their accountant to show them what their provisional tax liability would look like under different methods for the 2019 year and how exposure to use-of -money interest would differ. In this scenario, their possible use-of-money interest 1 costs range between nil and $6,880. GST and provisional tax payment dates 28-Jun 28-Aug 28-Oct 15-Jan 28-Feb 7- May Total prov tax Income earned during current year 108,000 Nil 178,000 250,000 178,000 143,000 Implied tax on taxable income 30,240 Nil 49,840 70,000 49,840 40,040 239,960 Provisional tax methods and due dates for payment 28-Jun 28-Aug 28-Oct 15-Jan 28-Feb 7- May Total prov tax Terminal tax due UOMI incurred AIM 30,240 0 49,840 70,000 49,840 40,040 239,960 0 0 Uplift 105% 77,000 77,000 77,000 231,000 8,960 737 Uplift 110% 66,000 66,000 66,000 198,000 41,960 3,449 Estimate 40,000 60,000 90,000 190,000 49,960 6,880 1 Calculation is based on UOMI rates of 8.22% and 1.02%. It also takes into account the new provisional tax rules of no use-of -money interest for residual income tax less than $60,000 (extension of safe harbour rules) and no use of money interest on the first two provisional tax instalments if using uplift. AIM providers approval and revocation Software providers are required to apply under section 15U of the Tax Administration Act 1994 for approval for their AIM-capable accounting systems. The Commissioner may approve a person as an approved AIM provider if approving the person would not negatively affect the integrity of the tax system. As part of the application process AIM providers are required to complete a statutory declaration, specifying the name of the products, declaring that the products will be regularly updated and any other information required by the Commissioner. Providers may apply for approval for a product which will deliver AIM to businesses with gross income under $5 million a year or for use by a class of taxpayers with gross income over $5 million a year. The Commissioner will approve an application in the latter circumstance if the Commissioner decides that there is minimal risk that approval will result in less net revenue collectable from the class of taxpayers over time. The Commissioner may revoke a person’s approval as an approved AIM provider in certain circumstances: • if anything in their statutory declaration is not true or does not continue to be true after it is made; • if revoking the approval protects the integrity of the tax system. Where approval is revoked it does not take effect until the next tax year to allow taxpayers using the software to complete the tax year so they are not disadvantaged. The Commissioner must consult with the provider before revoking their approval so both parties can discuss any concerns and have the opportunity to resolve them. Software providers may also voluntarily revoke the Commissioner’s approval. A person must notify the Commissioner of their choice to revoke the Commissioner’s approval under section 15W of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Where a person makes such a choice under section 15W they must notify all end-users of the person’s products that will be affected by the revocation. The revocation takes effect in the following tax year. Under section 15X of the Tax Administration Act 1994 the Commissioner may publish a notice regarding approvals or revocations. AIM-c apable accounting system A software system must meet the definition of an AIM-capable accounting system in order to gain approval from the Commissioner. The term “AIM-capable accounting system” is defined in section RC 7B(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007. Section RC 7B(3) requires the software system to have a number of features which include the ability to: • generate and keep comprehensive financial accounts, including accounting income and expenditure, ledger accounts, trial balances, bank account reconciliations, and journals, on an on-demand basis, in accordance with good accounting and tax practices; • calculate tax liabilities using tax adjustments in accordance with a determination under section 91 AAX of the Tax Administration Act 1994; • for tax adjustments not included in the determinations, ensure they work towards reasonably accurate assessments of tax liabilities; • recalculate all financial accounts and liabilities retrospectively and produce reports as required by the Commissioner; and • communicate electronically with Inland Revenue and provide the right level of customer support to its users. Section RC 10B of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that the amount calculated by the AIM-capable accounting system is the amount of provisional tax the taxpayer must pay the Commissioner on the instalment date. AIM eligibility criteria The eligibility criteria for using the AIM method are set out in section RC 5 of the Income Tax Act 2007. To be eligible to use AIM a taxpayer must: • elect to use it before their first payment date; • use an AIM-capable accounting package (as defined in section RC 7B) that is up to date; • have gross income below $5 million or have approval from the Commissioner as a previous user of AIM if their income is over $5 million; or • be a member of the class of taxpayers with income over $5 million using a software package the Commissioner has approved for AIM (as large business AIM capable software). A provisional taxpayer does not need to be GST-registered to use AIM. Where a provisional taxpayer chooses to use AIM and is not GST registered they must pay provisional tax on a two-monthly basis. If a taxpayer misses a payment the existing interest and penalties rules apply to the underpaid amount. Ineligible to use AIM In certain circumstances a taxpayer may be excluded from using AIM. Section RC 5(5B) of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that a taxpayer can be excluded from using AIM if the taxpayer: • has been liable in 1 of the last 4 years before the current year for a shortfall penalty in relation to their use of AIM; • has consistently and systematically used AIM to inaccurately assess its tax liabilities; • is a member of a class of taxpayers which is excluded from using AIM in a determination issued by the Commissioner under section 91 AAY of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (see Determination A1); • has failed more than twice in the current tax year to give the Commissioner information in the prescribed form (Statement of Activity). The Statement of Activity is important because it demonstrates the robustness of the accounting system behind the amount paid as provisional tax. If this information is not provided to Inland Revenue, there would be no evidence that a comprehensive accounting system is being used by the business to calculate its accounting income results. As the Statement of Activity reports would be cumulative, if one is missed it could be supplied in the following period. Where a taxpayer is removed from AIM under section RC 5(5C) of the Income Tax Act 2007 they are treated as using the estimation method for the whole of the current income year and may be subject to use-of-money interest. Determinations The determinations are an integral part of AIM as they outline the tax adjustments that may be required to accounting income to determine the amount of provisional tax payable for an instalment period. These determinations have recently been signed and are included in this Tax Information Bulletin to provide a complete guide to AIM. Broadly, d eterminations issued by the Commissioner detail for software developers the minimum tax adjustments required within the AIM capable software to calculate provisional tax payments and the information required to be provided with AIM payments. They also act as a guide for taxpayers and their agents on the options available in calculating their payments. The Commissioner may issue determinations in two circumstances: • technical determinations under section 91 AAX of the Tax Administration Act 1994; and • a determination excluding classes of taxpayers from using AIM under section 91 AAY of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Technical determinations detail the tax adjustments required for accounting income and expenditure under the AIM method and Inland Revenue’s information requirements regarding AIM. In making technical determinations the Commissioner must have regard to three areas: • the accuracy resulting from the tax adjustments; • the compliance costs incurred by taxpayers in making these adjustments; and • the resources available to the AIM software providers. In making a determination to exclude classes of taxpayers from using AIM the Commissioner must have regard to the risk that allowing the class of taxpayers to use the AIM method will result in less net revenue collectable from that class of taxpayers over time. Where a d etermination is issued under section 91 AAX or 91 AAY the Commissioner must give at least 120 days notice of the implementation date in a publication chosen by the Commissioner. Determinations issued under either section must also be published within 30 days of the making of the determination in a publication chosen by the Commissioner. Technical determinations The AIM method must result in a reasonably accurate assessment of the tax liabilities for a taxpayer. Accounting income and expenditure does not necessarily equate to net income for tax purposes. For this reason a series of tax adjustments are required to be made to accounting income and expenditure to accurately calculate the provisional tax liability. Software providers delivering AIM will build these tax adjustments into their software systems. The minimum adjustments that may be required are outlined in the technical determinations section of this Tax Information Bulletin. Adjustments not defined in the technical determinations will be designed by the software providers themselves, with the requirement they always calculate tax liabilities using tax adjustments that result in reasonably accurate assessments of tax liabilities for taxpayers. These may include accruals or estimates for other matters that would typically be adjusted for in the year-end process – for example, entertainment expenditure is not required to be adjusted for but developers may want to include the adjustment to get a more accurate level of provisional tax paid for their customers. Summary of technical determinations issued by the Commissioner Examples on how the determinations will apply are included in the technical determinations as interpretation aids. 1. Depreciation – Determination A8 Subpart EE of the Income Tax Act 2007 quantifies the amount of depreciation recovery income that is income under Part C and quantifies the amount of depreciation loss a person is allowed as a deduction where the provisions of Part D are satisfied. The Commissioner’s depreciation determination requires a person to choose for an income year to either calculate depreciation and/or amortisation related amounts using the relevant provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 or to exclude such amounts from accounting income and expenditure. An AIM-capable accounting system will have the functionality to allow taxpayers to calculate depreciation and/or amortisation related amounts within their accounting software or calculate such amounts outside their accounting software and then include them as a user defined adjustment in their accounting software. 2. Trading stock – Determination A5 The Commissioner’s trading stock determination details the tax adjustment required for trading stock as that term is defined in section EB 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The determination applies to taxpayers who operate a periodic inventory system where their stock-take periods do not align with their AIM instalment periods. It does not apply where a taxpayer has a perpetual inventory system that adjusts accounting income and expenditure to record movements in trading stock for the AIM instalment period, as stock movements using that system should be incorporated into accounting income and expenditure. Where a person operating a periodic inventory system does not complete a physical stock-take to determine closing stock for the AIM-instalment period the determination requires that a tax adjustment is made so that the person’s closing value of their trading stock for the period equals the closing value of their trading stock for the income year before the current income year under section CH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The opening value of the person’s trading stock for the next AIM instalment period is equal to the closing stock value. The tax adjustment in the determination is intended to achieve the same outcome for an AIM instalment period as section EB 23 of the Income Tax Act 2007 achieves for an income year. The effect of the tax adjustment is to allow a deduction to accounting expenditure for the purchases made during the AIM instalment period. Where the closing value of a taxpayer’s trading stock for the income year before the current income year is materially different from the closing value of a taxpayer’s trading stock for the AIM instalment period a physical stock-take should be undertaken to ensure a reasonably accurate calculation of the provisional tax liability for the income year. An AIM-capable accounting system will have the functionality to allow a user defined adjustment which allows a value for the closing stock to be manually entered into the software. 3. Livestock – Determination A10 The Commissioner has issued a livestock determination which applies to livestock which is excluded from being trading stock due to the application of section EB 2(3)(f) of the Income Tax Act 2007. Changes in numbers and values of livestock on hand from one year to the next can have a significant impact on a farmer’s gross income. To ensure the provisional tax liability under AIM is calculated with sufficient accuracy where a taxpayer does not have a perpetual inventory system to determine the closing value of livestock for an AIM instalment period, the taxpayer must complete a physical stock-take for the AIM instalment period. A tax adjustment must be made to record the closing stock value which has been determined by the physical stock-take. 4. Private expenditure – Determination A4 A person is denied a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is of a private or domestic nature. This is set out in section DA 2(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007. The Commissioner has issued a private expenditure determination which requires a tax adjustment to accounting expenditure to the extent to which that expenditure includes expenditure which is of a private or domestic nature. 5. Losses – Determination A7 The AIM provisional tax method calculates the provisional tax liability based on year-to - date accounting income and expenditure for the current income year. Where a loss arises in an earlier AIM instalment period that loss may be carried forward and offset against accounting income and expenditure for the next AIM instalment period until the loss is fully utilised. This should automatically occur within the AIM-capable software as it will calculate year-to -date income and expenditure. In the event that a taxpayer has a loss balance under section IA 3(4) of the Income Tax Act 2007 from a prior income year , that loss becomes available to the taxpayer using AIM on the date the income tax return for the prior income year is assessed. The loss balance carried forward is allowed as a tax adjustment to increase accounting expenditure in the instalment period the assessment takes place. The utilisation of losses that arose in a prior AIM instalment or prior income year are still subject to the commonality and continuity rules in the Income Tax Act 2007. Where these rules mean that a loss is not available in an AIM instalment period, a system or user defined adjustment will be required to ensure the software system calculates the provisional tax liability for the income year correctly. Companies are not permitted to use loss offsets or subvention payments in AIM. 6. Accounts receivable and accounts payable – Determination A6 The Commissioner has issued a determination detailing a tax adjustment for accounts receivable and accounts payable. The determination provides that where a taxpayer is not registered for GST or is registered for GST on the payments basis they are not required to accrue accounts receivable and accounts payable in calculating accounting income and expenditure. Where a taxpayer is registered for GST on the hybrid basis they are required to accrue receivables when calculating accounting income and are required to calculate accounting expenditure on a cash basis. For taxpayers not registered or registered on the payments or hybrid basis an election may be made to accrue accounts receivable and accounts payable in calculating accounting income and expenditure. If an election is made it cannot be revoked. Taxpayers registered for GST on an invoice basis must accrue accounts receivable and accounts payable when calculating accounting income and expenditure under AIM. 7. Provisions – Determination A9 As a general principle a provision will not meet the test of being incurred and therefore will not be deductible for tax purposes due to the application of section DA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The Commissioner has issued a determination which requires that where accounting expenditure includes a provision, a tax adjustment is made to exclude that expenditure. However, the d etermination permits a provision to be included in accounting expenditure where the provision relates to expenditure on employment income for a shareholder of a company. A deduction for such expenditure is limited to the extent to which the company pays tax as an agent of the shareholder in relation to the provision for shareholder remuneration income. 8. Tax rates – Determination A3 The Commissioner’s tax rates determination prescribes the tax rates which an AIM-capable accounting system must apply to a taxpayer’s net positive accounting income and expenditure (after tax adjustments) for an AIM instalment period. An AIM-capable accounting system calculates the provisional tax liability on a year to date basis using the tax rates set out in Schedule 1, Part A, of the Income Tax Act 2007. 9. Information and form – Determination A2 The Commissioner’s information and form determination sets out the information required and prescribed for the purposes of sections 45 and 45B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 by AIM taxpayers and providers. Further details are set out below regarding the information which AIM taxpayers and providers will be required to provide to the Commissioner. Exclusion determination Under section 91 AAY of the Tax Administration Act 1994 the Commissioner may determine that a class of taxpayers must not use the AIM method. The Commissioner has issued a determination under section 91 AAY (Determination A1) excluding the following classes of taxpayers from using the AIM method: • trustees and beneficiaries of a trust; • partnerships; • taxpayers who have investments in foreign investment funds or controlled foreign companies for the income year; • Māori authorities; • portfolio investment entities; and • superannuation funds. Payment dates Taxpayers who use the AIM method are required to make provisional tax payments more often – in line with their GST filing dates. Taxpayers registered for monthly GST will make payments twelve times a year and those not registered, registered two or six-monthly for GST will make payments six times a year. The payment dates for each AIM instalment are prescribed by section RC 9(4B) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and align with the payment dates for GST. Refunds Under section RM 6B of the Income Tax Act 2007 the Commissioner can refund amounts of overpaid AIM provisional tax throughout the income year where the AIM payments to date are greater than the AIM calculation of the tax liability year -to -date. There is no requirement for a taxpayer to file an imputation credit account return mid-year to access an overpayment of AIM provisional tax. Section 120 VB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that no use-of-money interest is payable to the Commissioner on overpaid AIM provisional tax. Information requirements Information will be provided to Inland Revenue by both the AIM taxpayer and the AIM provider. Under section 45 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 taxpayers using the AIM method are required to provide the Commissioner with a Statement of Activity on or before each AIM instalment date. An AIM-capable accounting system will have the functionality to map ledger accounts into a Statement of Activity form which is provided to the Commissioner through the software itself. The Statement of Activity form is not a tax return. It is a summary of what is in the accounting software at the date the Statement of Activity is provided to the Commissioner. Under section 45B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 AIM providers must provide information to the Commissioner when and if requested in relation to their AIM-capable software products. The Commissioner cannot require taxpayer- specific information to be provided under this section. Information required by the Commissioner under section 45B must be provided within six months of the end of the tax year. Collection of this information will assist the Commissioner with further policy development and improvements to AIM. Interest and penalties Where an AIM taxpayer makes the payments calculated by their AIM-capable accounting software by the instalment date section 120 KBC of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that they will not be exposed to use-of-money interest should the year-end residual income tax liability result in a different tax liability, until their terminal tax date. This is subject to the taxpayer not having entered a provisional tax interest avoidance arrangement which is defined in section 120 KBB(4) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. If an AIM taxpayer pays less than what their AIM-capable accounting software calculates, use -of -money interest will be imposed on the shortfall from the date of underpayment. Late payment penalties may also apply if a payment of provisional tax is made after the AIM instalment date. Section RC 5C of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that where an AIM provisional taxpayer has been removed from AIM they will be required to use the estimate method and will be subject to use-of-money interest. Section 120 VB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that no use-of-money is payable by the Commissioner on overpaid AIM provisional tax. The definition of “tax position” in section 3(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 has been amended so that the use of the AIM provisional tax method, including the use of the software, is within the meaning of the term “tax position” in the Tax Administration Act 1994. This will require that taxpayers take reasonable care in the calculation of their provisional tax payments throughout the year in terms of section 141A of the Tax Administration Act 1994. However section 141B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 has been amended to provide that a taxpayer does not take an unacceptable tax position merely by using the AIM method and an approved AIM provider’s AIM-capable accounting system. Taxpayers paying AIM provisional tax using a large business AIM-capable accounting system or who have been approved to continue using AIM as their income has grown over $5 million will continue to be subject to the unacceptable tax position penalty. Under section 119(1)(cb) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 the Commissioner may determine the amount of provisional tax due under AIM if the tax liabilities calculated are not reasonably accurate assessments of tax liabilities for the relevant income and expenditure. Example 4 Tussock Socks Ltd has been paying its provisional tax using AIM. On its third AIM provisional tax payment date, the software calculated that Tussock Socks Ltd owed $500 in provisional tax to Inland Revenue and submitted the Statement of Activity showing this amount to be due. Instead of paying $500 to Inland Revenue, Tussock Socks Ltd only paid $100. Tu ssock Socks Ltd will be liable for UOMI and late payment penalty on the $400 underpayment until it is paid (or the liability is extinguished by a future instalment period). Example 5 Cameo Jewels Ltd is a small jewellery company using AIM to pay its provisional tax. It calculates its provisional tax payments using software, and makes the payments accordingly. At year-end the company meets with its accountant who discovers their depreciation was calculated incorrectly and a bad debt had not been written off, resulting in additional income tax due of $300. Cameo Jewels Ltd pays this amount of terminal tax and has no UOMI or shortfall penalty applied. As these errors are simple oversights it is likely Cameo Jewels Ltd has taken reasonable care in the calculation of its tax liability. Example 6 Tiger Fins Corporation is a fishing company that uses specialised fishing industry software approved by Inland Revenue as large business AIM capable (for businesses whose turnover is over $5 million). It has discovered that if it categorises its catch in different fish quantities and qualities it can lower its income tax liability. Upon receipt of the company’s Statement of Activity and audit queries, this misuse of the company’s software is brought to Inland Revenue’s attention. Tiger Fins Corporation (as a large business AIM-capable taxpayer) would be removed from AIM, placed in the estimate method, be subject to UOMI and late payment penalties on what the company’s income was determined to be by the Commissioner. It is also likely the company would be considered to have taken an unacceptable tax position in the calculation of its tax liability Tax pooling Sections RP 17 and RP 17B of the Income Tax Act 2007 provide that tax pooling cannot be used for AIM provisional tax. However, tax pooling can continue to be used for terminal tax and reassessments. Transfers of overpaid provisional tax Under section LA 6(2)(db) of the Income Tax Act 2007 a company using AIM may transfer excess tax credits to shareholders and reduce the shareholders’ use of money interest liability. Section 120 LB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that the amount transferred does not give rise to a tax credit for the shareholder but is treated as transferred tax paid for the year that the provisional tax credit relates to. The total amounts transferred to the shareholder are pro-rated against all of their provisional tax instalments for the year. The transfer is treated as a refund for the purposes of the AIM Company’s imputation credit account. Example 7 Bogart Bugles Ltd is a retailer that sells musical instruments, owned equally by John and Lynn. They elect to use AIM for their businesses and in the income year ending 31 March 2019 make the following overpayments in AIM. All parties have a March balance date. Provisional tax payment dates 28-Jun 2018 28-Aug 2018 28-Oct 2018 15-Jan 2019 28-Feb 2019 7-May 2019 Bogart Bugles Ltd AIM overpayments $100 $100 $100 $100 $100 $100 Shareholder provisional tax liability due dates $200 $200 $200 In this instance, Bogart Bugles Ltd can easily transfer its overpaid provisional tax at year-end to John and Lynn to meet their provisional tax liabilities. As the dates align there will be no UOMI charges on John and Lynn. Example 8 Murray’s Mutts Ltd is a dog breeding operation owned by Sarah and Gareth. Murray’s Mutts Ltd has an agreed July balance date, as is common in the dog breeding industry. Sarah and Gareth have standard March balance dates. The payment schedule for the 2019 income year would look as follows: Provisional tax payment dates 28 Aug 2018 28 Oct 2018 15 Jan 2019 28 Feb 2019 7 May 2019 28 June 2019 28 Aug 2019 Murray’s Mutts Ltd AIM overpayments $100 $100 $100 $100 $100 $100 Shareholder provisional tax liability due dates $150 $150 $150 In this instance, Murray’s Mutts Ltd would be able to transfer its excess provisional tax payments to Sarah and Gareth despite there being a mismatch in their provisional tax dates. These transfers would be calculated and transferred at Murray’s Mutts Ltd’s year-end. Murray’s Mutts Ltd’s transfer is limited to the amount of overpaid tax in Murray’s Mutts Ltd – that is, the company cannot transfer more than $450 as the transfer cannot be more than Sarah and Gareth’s provisional tax underpayment for the year. Payments can be transferred to Sarah and Gareth at their 2019 provisional tax dates, negating any UOMI exposure.
The accounting income method (AIM) for paying provisional tax As part of legislation enacted on 21 February 2017, the Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Act 2017, a new method for calculating provisional tax was introduced – the accounting income method (AIM). The new method for calculating provisional tax will be available alongside existing methods – the standard uplift, the estimate method and the GST ratio method. AIM is not replacing these methods. A growing number of small businesses use accounting software. Businesses wanting to calculate their provisional tax obligation using AIM will use upgraded software (an AIM-capable accounting system) which will calculate provisional tax based on current year accounting income information. The summary of determinations provides detail for software developers and the minimum tax adjustments required for AIM-capable systems. The new rules introducing the AIM method of calculating provisional tax have application to the 2018–19 and later income years. Overview AIM is designed to fit better within the existing and ordinary processes of a business and is more reflective of the current year to date financial performance of a business. Under AIM, provisional tax is integrated into business processes and payment amounts are based on current year tax adjusted income. This should provide businesses using AIM with more certainty that they are paying the right amount of tax as it will be paid as income is earned. AIM is available to taxpayers who: • have annual gross income of under $5 million (although there is the ability for some exceptions to this rule); • use an AIM-capable software system; • have not been liable in one of the last four years for a shortfall penalty in relation to their use of AIM; • have not returned tax liabilities using the AIM method with the sole purpose or effect of consistently, year-on - year, reducing their tax liabilities below reasonably accurate amounts; • are not a member of a class of taxpayers excluded from using AIM; and • for the current year, have not failed more than twice to give the Commissioner information required under the AIM method. New payment dates for paying provisional tax under the AIM method have been created. Overpaid amounts of provisional tax paid through AIM can be refunded upon request of the taxpayer before year-end . AIM taxpayers will provide Inland Revenue with a Statement of Activity on or before each instalment date. When an AIM taxpayer makes the provisional tax payments calculated by their AIM-capable software they will not have use-of-money interest exposure should the year end residual income tax result in a different tax liability. AIM provisional tax payments cannot be made through a tax pool, however, tax pooling can be used for terminal tax and reassessment liabilities. Overpaid provisional tax in an AIM taxpaying company may be transferred to the AIM company shareholders to meet their provisional tax liabilities on the dates that their provisional tax is due. The C ommissioner may approve taxpayers who have gross income over the $5 million threshold to use, or continue to use, AIM where the Commissioner is satisfied there is minimal risk that approval will result in less net revenue collected, this is referred to as large business AIM capable software. The following graphic illustrates how AIM works in practice. The following examples display how AIM would apply: Example 1 Murphy has recently finished a painting apprenticeship and intends to set up his own house painting business. He has no previous business knowledge and his parent suggest he meet with their accountant to get some advice. The accountant suggests Murphy sets up a company, start using a basic accounting software package and elect into paying provisional tax using the AIM approach to help him budget in his first year of business. Murphy’s company has a March balance date and will pay GST and provisional tax using the AIM approach on a two - monthly basis. Murphy does not make any profit in the first few months but starts to make a profit towards the end of the year. He will pay provisional tax under AIM as follows: GST and provisional tax payment dates 28-Jun 2018 28-Aug 2018 28-Oct 2018 15-Jan 2019 28-Feb 2019 7-May 2019 Total prov tax Terminal tax due Income earned during current year Nil Nil Nil 20,000 30,000 50,000 28,000 AIM payment amount Nil Nil Nil 5,600 8,400 14,000 28,000 Nil AIM will help Murphy budget for tax correctly in his first year of operation as he pays tax as he earns income. Example 2 Sandy has just completed a qualification in graphic design and has decided to set up a business designing websites for customers. Being new to business Sandy approaches an accountant to understand what her tax obligations are and what dates tax payments need to be made. Her accountant recommends that Sandy use an accounting software package and suggests some options. Given Sandy is going to use accounting software to keep track of how her business is doing she thinks it makes sense to use an AIM-capable accounting system which also calculates her provisional tax liability. Sandy’s business has a March balance date and will pay GST and provisional tax using AIM on a two-monthly basis. For the first part of the y ear Sandy makes no profit but as the year progresses Sandy’s business starts making a profit. Under AIM Sandy will pay provisional tax as follows: GST and provisional tax payment dates 28-Jun 2018 28-Aug 2018 28-Oct 2018 15-Jan 2019 28-Feb 2019 7-May 2019 Total prov tax Terminal tax due Income earned during current year Nil Nil 3,000 7,500 12,000 18,000 6,108 AIM payment amount 315 788 1,855 3,150 6,108 0 Example 3 Benson Electrical Ltd is considering using AIM. They currently use accounting software, pay GST every two months, and have a March balance date. Their accountant talks to them about using AIM due to the unpredictable nature of the contracts they are being awarded. The inability to plan in the past has resulted in exposure to use-of -money interest. They generally have a slow start to the financial year but business picks up in the latter half. Their business is steadily growing and their residual income tax is $180,000 in 2017 and $220,000 in 2018. They ask their accountant to show them what their provisional tax liability would look like under different methods for the 2019 year and how exposure to use-of -money interest would differ. In this scenario, their possible use-of-money interest 1 costs range between nil and $6,880. GST and provisional tax payment dates 28-Jun 28-Aug 28-Oct 15-Jan 28-Feb 7- May Total prov tax Income earned during current year 108,000 Nil 178,000 250,000 178,000 143,000 Implied tax on taxable income 30,240 Nil 49,840 70,000 49,840 40,040 239,960 Provisional tax methods and due dates for payment 28-Jun 28-Aug 28-Oct 15-Jan 28-Feb 7- May Total prov tax Terminal tax due UOMI incurred AIM 30,240 0 49,840 70,000 49,840 40,040 239,960 0 0 Uplift 105% 77,000 77,000 77,000 231,000 8,960 737 Uplift 110% 66,000 66,000 66,000 198,000 41,960 3,449 Estimate 40,000 60,000 90,000 190,000 49,960 6,880 1 Calculation is based on UOMI rates of 8.22% and 1.02%. It also takes into account the new provisional tax rules of no use-of -money interest for residual income tax less than $60,000 (extension of safe harbour rules) and no use of money interest on the first two provisional tax instalments if using uplift. AIM providers approval and revocation Software providers are required to apply under section 15U of the Tax Administration Act 1994 for approval for their AIM-capable accounting systems. The Commissioner may approve a person as an approved AIM provider if approving the person would not negatively affect the integrity of the tax system. As part of the application process AIM providers are required to complete a statutory declaration, specifying the name of the products, declaring that the products will be regularly updated and any other information required by the Commissioner. Providers may apply for approval for a product which will deliver AIM to businesses with gross income under $5 million a year or for use by a class of taxpayers with gross income over $5 million a year. The Commissioner will approve an application in the latter circumstance if the Commissioner decides that there is minimal risk that approval will result in less net revenue collectable from the class of taxpayers over time. The Commissioner may revoke a person’s approval as an approved AIM provider in certain circumstances: • if anything in their statutory declaration is not true or does not continue to be true after it is made; • if revoking the approval protects the integrity of the tax system. Where approval is revoked it does not take effect until the next tax year to allow taxpayers using the software to complete the tax year so they are not disadvantaged. The Commissioner must consult with the provider before revoking their approval so both parties can discuss any concerns and have the opportunity to resolve them. Software providers may also voluntarily revoke the Commissioner’s approval. A person must notify the Commissioner of their choice to revoke the Commissioner’s approval under section 15W of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Where a person makes such a choice under section 15W they must notify all end-users of the person’s products that will be affected by the revocation. The revocation takes effect in the following tax year. Under section 15X of the Tax Administration Act 1994 the Commissioner may publish a notice regarding approvals or revocations. AIM-c apable accounting system A software system must meet the definition of an AIM-capable accounting system in order to gain approval from the Commissioner. The term “AIM-capable accounting system” is defined in section RC 7B(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007. Section RC 7B(3) requires the software system to have a number of features which include the ability to: • generate and keep comprehensive financial accounts, including accounting income and expenditure, ledger accounts, trial balances, bank account reconciliations, and journals, on an on-demand basis, in accordance with good accounting and tax practices; • calculate tax liabilities using tax adjustments in accordance with a determination under section 91 AAX of the Tax Administration Act 1994; • for tax adjustments not included in the determinations, ensure they work towards reasonably accurate assessments of tax liabilities; • recalculate all financial accounts and liabilities retrospectively and produce reports as required by the Commissioner; and • communicate electronically with Inland Revenue and provide the right level of customer support to its users. Section RC 10B of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that the amount calculated by the AIM-capable accounting system is the amount of provisional tax the taxpayer must pay the Commissioner on the instalment date. AIM eligibility criteria The eligibility criteria for using the AIM method are set out in section RC 5 of the Income Tax Act 2007. To be eligible to use AIM a taxpayer must: • elect to use it before their first payment date; • use an AIM-capable accounting package (as defined in section RC 7B) that is up to date; • have gross income below $5 million or have approval from the Commissioner as a previous user of AIM if their income is over $5 million; or • be a member of the class of taxpayers with income over $5 million using a software package the Commissioner has approved for AIM (as large business AIM capable software). A provisional taxpayer does not need to be GST-registered to use AIM. Where a provisional taxpayer chooses to use AIM and is not GST registered they must pay provisional tax on a two-monthly basis. If a taxpayer misses a payment the existing interest and penalties rules apply to the underpaid amount. Ineligible to use AIM In certain circumstances a taxpayer may be excluded from using AIM. Section RC 5(5B) of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that a taxpayer can be excluded from using AIM if the taxpayer: • has been liable in 1 of the last 4 years before the current year for a shortfall penalty in relation to their use of AIM; • has consistently and systematically used AIM to inaccurately assess its tax liabilities; • is a member of a class of taxpayers which is excluded from using AIM in a determination issued by the Commissioner under section 91 AAY of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (see Determination A1); • has failed more than twice in the current tax year to give the Commissioner information in the prescribed form (Statement of Activity). The Statement of Activity is important because it demonstrates the robustness of the accounting system behind the amount paid as provisional tax. If this information is not provided to Inland Revenue, there would be no evidence that a comprehensive accounting system is being used by the business to calculate its accounting income results. As the Statement of Activity reports would be cumulative, if one is missed it could be supplied in the following period. Where a taxpayer is removed from AIM under section RC 5(5C) of the Income Tax Act 2007 they are treated as using the estimation method for the whole of the current income year and may be subject to use-of-money interest. Determinations The determinations are an integral part of AIM as they outline the tax adjustments that may be required to accounting income to determine the amount of provisional tax payable for an instalment period. These determinations have recently been signed and are included in this Tax Information Bulletin to provide a complete guide to AIM. Broadly, d eterminations issued by the Commissioner detail for software developers the minimum tax adjustments required within the AIM capable software to calculate provisional tax payments and the information required to be provided with AIM payments. They also act as a guide for taxpayers and their agents on the options available in calculating their payments. The Commissioner may issue determinations in two circumstances: • technical determinations under section 91 AAX of the Tax Administration Act 1994; and • a determination excluding classes of taxpayers from using AIM under section 91 AAY of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Technical determinations detail the tax adjustments required for accounting income and expenditure under the AIM method and Inland Revenue’s information requirements regarding AIM. In making technical determinations the Commissioner must have regard to three areas: • the accuracy resulting from the tax adjustments; • the compliance costs incurred by taxpayers in making these adjustments; and • the resources available to the AIM software providers. In making a determination to exclude classes of taxpayers from using AIM the Commissioner must have regard to the risk that allowing the class of taxpayers to use the AIM method will result in less net revenue collectable from that class of taxpayers over time. Where a d etermination is issued under section 91 AAX or 91 AAY the Commissioner must give at least 120 days notice of the implementation date in a publication chosen by the Commissioner. Determinations issued under either section must also be published within 30 days of the making of the determination in a publication chosen by the Commissioner. Technical determinations The AIM method must result in a reasonably accurate assessment of the tax liabilities for a taxpayer. Accounting income and expenditure does not necessarily equate to net income for tax purposes. For this reason a series of tax adjustments are required to be made to accounting income and expenditure to accurately calculate the provisional tax liability. Software providers delivering AIM will build these tax adjustments into their software systems. The minimum adjustments that may be required are outlined in the technical determinations section of this Tax Information Bulletin. Adjustments not defined in the technical determinations will be designed by the software providers themselves, with the requirement they always calculate tax liabilities using tax adjustments that result in reasonably accurate assessments of tax liabilities for taxpayers. These may include accruals or estimates for other matters that would typically be adjusted for in the year-end process – for example, entertainment expenditure is not required to be adjusted for but developers may want to include the adjustment to get a more accurate level of provisional tax paid for their customers. Summary of technical determinations issued by the Commissioner Examples on how the determinations will apply are included in the technical determinations as interpretation aids. 1. Depreciation – Determination A8 Subpart EE of the Income Tax Act 2007 quantifies the amount of depreciation recovery income that is income under Part C and quantifies the amount of depreciation loss a person is allowed as a deduction where the provisions of Part D are satisfied. The Commissioner’s depreciation determination requires a person to choose for an income year to either calculate depreciation and/or amortisation related amounts using the relevant provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 or to exclude such amounts from accounting income and expenditure. An AIM-capable accounting system will have the functionality to allow taxpayers to calculate depreciation and/or amortisation related amounts within their accounting software or calculate such amounts outside their accounting software and then include them as a user defined adjustment in their accounting software. 2. Trading stock – Determination A5 The Commissioner’s trading stock determination details the tax adjustment required for trading stock as that term is defined in section EB 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The determination applies to taxpayers who operate a periodic inventory system where their stock-take periods do not align with their AIM instalment periods. It does not apply where a taxpayer has a perpetual inventory system that adjusts accounting income and expenditure to record movements in trading stock for the AIM instalment period, as stock movements using that system should be incorporated into accounting income and expenditure. Where a person operating a periodic inventory system does not complete a physical stock-take to determine closing stock for the AIM-instalment period the determination requires that a tax adjustment is made so that the person’s closing value of their trading stock for the period equals the closing value of their trading stock for the income year before the current income year under section CH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The opening value of the person’s trading stock for the next AIM instalment period is equal to the closing stock value. The tax adjustment in the determination is intended to achieve the same outcome for an AIM instalment period as section EB 23 of the Income Tax Act 2007 achieves for an income year. The effect of the tax adjustment is to allow a deduction to accounting expenditure for the purchases made during the AIM instalment period. Where the closing value of a taxpayer’s trading stock for the income year before the current income year is materially different from the closing value of a taxpayer’s trading stock for the AIM instalment period a physical stock-take should be undertaken to ensure a reasonably accurate calculation of the provisional tax liability for the income year. An AIM-capable accounting system will have the functionality to allow a user defined adjustment which allows a value for the closing stock to be manually entered into the software. 3. Livestock – Determination A10 The Commissioner has issued a livestock determination which applies to livestock which is excluded from being trading stock due to the application of section EB 2(3)(f) of the Income Tax Act 2007. Changes in numbers and values of livestock on hand from one year to the next can have a significant impact on a farmer’s gross income. To ensure the provisional tax liability under AIM is calculated with sufficient accuracy where a taxpayer does not have a perpetual inventory system to determine the closing value of livestock for an AIM instalment period, the taxpayer must complete a physical stock-take for the AIM instalment period. A tax adjustment must be made to record the closing stock value which has been determined by the physical stock-take. 4. Private expenditure – Determination A4 A person is denied a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is of a private or domestic nature. This is set out in section DA 2(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007. The Commissioner has issued a private expenditure determination which requires a tax adjustment to accounting expenditure to the extent to which that expenditure includes expenditure which is of a private or domestic nature. 5. Losses – Determination A7 The AIM provisional tax method calculates the provisional tax liability based on year-to - date accounting income and expenditure for the current income year. Where a loss arises in an earlier AIM instalment period that loss may be carried forward and offset against accounting income and expenditure for the next AIM instalment period until the loss is fully utilised. This should automatically occur within the AIM-capable software as it will calculate year-to -date income and expenditure. In the event that a taxpayer has a loss balance under section IA 3(4) of the Income Tax Act 2007 from a prior income year , that loss becomes available to the taxpayer using AIM on the date the income tax return for the prior income year is assessed. The loss balance carried forward is allowed as a tax adjustment to increase accounting expenditure in the instalment period the assessment takes place. The utilisation of losses that arose in a prior AIM instalment or prior income year are still subject to the commonality and continuity rules in the Income Tax Act 2007. Where these rules mean that a loss is not available in an AIM instalment period, a system or user defined adjustment will be required to ensure the software system calculates the provisional tax liability for the income year correctly. Companies are not permitted to use loss offsets or subvention payments in AIM. 6. Accounts receivable and accounts payable – Determination A6 The Commissioner has issued a determination detailing a tax adjustment for accounts receivable and accounts payable. The determination provides that where a taxpayer is not registered for GST or is registered for GST on the payments basis they are not required to accrue accounts receivable and accounts payable in calculating accounting income and expenditure. Where a taxpayer is registered for GST on the hybrid basis they are required to accrue receivables when calculating accounting income and are required to calculate accounting expenditure on a cash basis. For taxpayers not registered or registered on the payments or hybrid basis an election may be made to accrue accounts receivable and accounts payable in calculating accounting income and expenditure. If an election is made it cannot be revoked. Taxpayers registered for GST on an invoice basis must accrue accounts receivable and accounts payable when calculating accounting income and expenditure under AIM. 7. Provisions – Determination A9 As a general principle a provision will not meet the test of being incurred and therefore will not be deductible for tax purposes due to the application of section DA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The Commissioner has issued a determination which requires that where accounting expenditure includes a provision, a tax adjustment is made to exclude that expenditure. However, the d etermination permits a provision to be included in accounting expenditure where the provision relates to expenditure on employment income for a shareholder of a company. A deduction for such expenditure is limited to the extent to which the company pays tax as an agent of the shareholder in relation to the provision for shareholder remuneration income. 8. Tax rates – Determination A3 The Commissioner’s tax rates determination prescribes the tax rates which an AIM-capable accounting system must apply to a taxpayer’s net positive accounting income and expenditure (after tax adjustments) for an AIM instalment period. An AIM-capable accounting system calculates the provisional tax liability on a year to date basis using the tax rates set out in Schedule 1, Part A, of the Income Tax Act 2007. 9. Information and form – Determination A2 The Commissioner’s information and form determination sets out the information required and prescribed for the purposes of sections 45 and 45B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 by AIM taxpayers and providers. Further details are set out below regarding the information which AIM taxpayers and providers will be required to provide to the Commissioner. Exclusion determination Under section 91 AAY of the Tax Administration Act 1994 the Commissioner may determine that a class of taxpayers must not use the AIM method. The Commissioner has issued a determination under section 91 AAY (Determination A1) excluding the following classes of taxpayers from using the AIM method: • trustees and beneficiaries of a trust; • partnerships; • taxpayers who have investments in foreign investment funds or controlled foreign companies for the income year; • Māori authorities; • portfolio investment entities; and • superannuation funds. Payment dates Taxpayers who use the AIM method are required to make provisional tax payments more often – in line with their GST filing dates. Taxpayers registered for monthly GST will make payments twelve times a year and those not registered, registered two or six-monthly for GST will make payments six times a year. The payment dates for each AIM instalment are prescribed by section RC 9(4B) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and align with the payment dates for GST. Refunds Under section RM 6B of the Income Tax Act 2007 the Commissioner can refund amounts of overpaid AIM provisional tax throughout the income year where the AIM payments to date are greater than the AIM calculation of the tax liability year -to -date. There is no requirement for a taxpayer to file an imputation credit account return mid-year to access an overpayment of AIM provisional tax. Section 120 VB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that no use-of-money interest is payable to the Commissioner on overpaid AIM provisional tax. Information requirements Information will be provided to Inland Revenue by both the AIM taxpayer and the AIM provider. Under section 45 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 taxpayers using the AIM method are required to provide the Commissioner with a Statement of Activity on or before each AIM instalment date. An AIM-capable accounting system will have the functionality to map ledger accounts into a Statement of Activity form which is provided to the Commissioner through the software itself. The Statement of Activity form is not a tax return. It is a summary of what is in the accounting software at the date the Statement of Activity is provided to the Commissioner. Under section 45B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 AIM providers must provide information to the Commissioner when and if requested in relation to their AIM-capable software products. The Commissioner cannot require taxpayer- specific information to be provided under this section. Information required by the Commissioner under section 45B must be provided within six months of the end of the tax year. Collection of this information will assist the Commissioner with further policy development and improvements to AIM. Interest and penalties Where an AIM taxpayer makes the payments calculated by their AIM-capable accounting software by the instalment date section 120 KBC of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that they will not be exposed to use-of-money interest should the year-end residual income tax liability result in a different tax liability, until their terminal tax date. This is subject to the taxpayer not having entered a provisional tax interest avoidance arrangement which is defined in section 120 KBB(4) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. If an AIM taxpayer pays less than what their AIM-capable accounting software calculates, use -of -money interest will be imposed on the shortfall from the date of underpayment. Late payment penalties may also apply if a payment of provisional tax is made after the AIM instalment date. Section RC 5C of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that where an AIM provisional taxpayer has been removed from AIM they will be required to use the estimate method and will be subject to use-of-money interest. Section 120 VB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that no use-of-money is payable by the Commissioner on overpaid AIM provisional tax. The definition of “tax position” in section 3(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 has been amended so that the use of the AIM provisional tax method, including the use of the software, is within the meaning of the term “tax position” in the Tax Administration Act 1994. This will require that taxpayers take reasonable care in the calculation of their provisional tax payments throughout the year in terms of section 141A of the Tax Administration Act 1994. However section 141B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 has been amended to provide that a taxpayer does not take an unacceptable tax position merely by using the AIM method and an approved AIM provider’s AIM-capable accounting system. Taxpayers paying AIM provisional tax using a large business AIM-capable accounting system or who have been approved to continue using AIM as their income has grown over $5 million will continue to be subject to the unacceptable tax position penalty. Under section 119(1)(cb) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 the Commissioner may determine the amount of provisional tax due under AIM if the tax liabilities calculated are not reasonably accurate assessments of tax liabilities for the relevant income and expenditure. Example 4 Tussock Socks Ltd has been paying its provisional tax using AIM. On its third AIM provisional tax payment date, the software calculated that Tussock Socks Ltd owed $500 in provisional tax to Inland Revenue and submitted the Statement of Activity showing this amount to be due. Instead of paying $500 to Inland Revenue, Tussock Socks Ltd only paid $100. Tu ssock Socks Ltd will be liable for UOMI and late payment penalty on the $400 underpayment until it is paid (or the liability is extinguished by a future instalment period). Example 5 Cameo Jewels Ltd is a small jewellery company using AIM to pay its provisional tax. It calculates its provisional tax payments using software, and makes the payments accordingly. At year-end the company meets with its accountant who discovers their depreciation was calculated incorrectly and a bad debt had not been written off, resulting in additional income tax due of $300. Cameo Jewels Ltd pays this amount of terminal tax and has no UOMI or shortfall penalty applied. As these errors are simple oversights it is likely Cameo Jewels Ltd has taken reasonable care in the calculation of its tax liability. Example 6 Tiger Fins Corporation is a fishing company that uses specialised fishing industry software approved by Inland Revenue as large business AIM capable (for businesses whose turnover is over $5 million). It has discovered that if it categorises its catch in different fish quantities and qualities it can lower its income tax liability. Upon receipt of the company’s Statement of Activity and audit queries, this misuse of the company’s software is brought to Inland Revenue’s attention. Tiger Fins Corporation (as a large business AIM-capable taxpayer) would be removed from AIM, placed in the estimate method, be subject to UOMI and late payment penalties on what the company’s income was determined to be by the Commissioner. It is also likely the company would be considered to have taken an unacceptable tax position in the calculation of its tax liability Tax pooling Sections RP 17 and RP 17B of the Income Tax Act 2007 provide that tax pooling cannot be used for AIM provisional tax. However, tax pooling can continue to be used for terminal tax and reassessments. Transfers of overpaid provisional tax Under section LA 6(2)(db) of the Income Tax Act 2007 a company using AIM may transfer excess tax credits to shareholders and reduce the shareholders’ use of money interest liability. Section 120 LB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that the amount transferred does not give rise to a tax credit for the shareholder but is treated as transferred tax paid for the year that the provisional tax credit relates to. The total amounts transferred to the shareholder are pro-rated against all of their provisional tax instalments for the year. The transfer is treated as a refund for the purposes of the AIM Company’s imputation credit account. Example 7 Bogart Bugles Ltd is a retailer that sells musical instruments, owned equally by John and Lynn. They elect to use AIM for their businesses and in the income year ending 31 March 2019 make the following overpayments in AIM. All parties have a March balance date. Provisional tax payment dates 28-Jun 2018 28-Aug 2018 28-Oct 2018 15-Jan 2019 28-Feb 2019 7-May 2019 Bogart Bugles Ltd AIM overpayments $100 $100 $100 $100 $100 $100 Shareholder provisional tax liability due dates $200 $200 $200 In this instance, Bogart Bugles Ltd can easily transfer its overpaid provisional tax at year-end to John and Lynn to meet their provisional tax liabilities. As the dates align there will be no UOMI charges on John and Lynn. Example 8 Murray’s Mutts Ltd is a dog breeding operation owned by Sarah and Gareth. Murray’s Mutts Ltd has an agreed July balance date, as is common in the dog breeding industry. Sarah and Gareth have standard March balance dates. The payment schedule for the 2019 income year would look as follows: Provisional tax payment dates 28 Aug 2018 28 Oct 2018 15 Jan 2019 28 Feb 2019 7 May 2019 28 June 2019 28 Aug 2019 Murray’s Mutts Ltd AIM overpayments $100 $100 $100 $100 $100 $100 Shareholder provisional tax liability due dates $150 $150 $150 In this instance, Murray’s Mutts Ltd would be able to transfer its excess provisional tax payments to Sarah and Gareth despite there being a mismatch in their provisional tax dates. These transfers would be calculated and transferred at Murray’s Mutts Ltd’s year-end. Murray’s Mutts Ltd’s transfer is limited to the amount of overpaid tax in Murray’s Mutts Ltd – that is, the company cannot transfer more than $450 as the transfer cannot be more than Sarah and Gareth’s provisional tax underpayment for the year. Payments can be transferred to Sarah and Gareth at their 2019 provisional tax dates, negating any UOMI exposure.

Air conditioning installer sentenced for tax fraud
==================================================

**29 September 2024** A Wellington air conditioning installer was sentenced to community detention on tax fraud charges.   
   
David Wayne Field was sentenced in the Hutt Valley District Court on September 24 on 15 charges of knowingly filing false and misleading GST returns, not filing income tax and GST returns and failing to apply for registration for GST.  
   
Field was self-employed and involved in a number of business activities including installation and maintenance of air conditioning units operating under the name Kiwi Chill. He also drove a taxi and has a rental property.  
   
**Taxpayers outside the system**  
   
Inland Revenue started an investigation into Field as part of a regular Hidden Economy compliance programme to identify and review persons and businesses that may be operating outside of the tax system.   
   
This area of focus can include reviews of customers who may not be aware they have exceeded the threshold for GST registration, or may have intentionally only reported one or more sources of income but have another source of income that they do not disclose to IR. They may also be intentionally operating outside of the tax system and may have also been previously warned by IR and are still electing not to comply.      
   
Inland Revenue’s aim is to identify customers operating outside the tax system, totally or partially, and return them to the system with their tax obligations sorted.   
    
Outside the system customers are already included in a range of other existing HE network initiatives such as:  
• Crypto  
• Horticulture  
• Construction.   
   
Inland Revenue uses a range of data and information such as Wage Subsidy Scheme and property data to help find those outside the system.   
   
**The Field case facts**  
   
Field applied the Ministry of Social Development for the Covid-19 Wage Subsidy. Information on Inland Revenue’s system showed he was self-employed, however he had a significant number of outstanding income tax and GST Returns.  
   
In November 2019 Field filed 7 false and misleading GST returns; Between March 2017 and 2022 he didn’t file income tax returns; and between January 2020 and March 2022 he didn’t file GST returns. All that was to evade the assessment and payment of tax.  
   
In March 2021 he was given an extension of time to sort his outstanding tax obligations. He filed one outstanding GST return but then reverted to not filing GST returns.   
   
Between 1 April 2016 – 1 July 2018, Field was not registered for GST. Even so, Kiwi Chill regularly issued customers with “Tax Invoices” showing a GST registration number which was Field’s personal IRD number.  
   
The 7 NIL GST returns Field filed for the periods September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2019 for the company Aircon and Refrigeration Services Limited were false.  
   
In January 2024, the Defendant filed all the outstanding income tax and GST returns and filed amended GST returns for the 7 periods he had previously filed NIL returns for.  
   
**Total fraud**  
   
The total fraud amounts to $249,747.04 which Field has now paid.   
   
He was sentenced to three months community detention with a 7pm to 7am curfew.

Aligning GST and Provisional tax payments
=========================================

2007 amendments align the payments of provisional tax with GST payments and provide a new method of calculating provisional tax - the GST ratio method.

### Changes to the Income Tax Act

**_Section RC 7(6) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section MB 6(5) of the Income Tax Act 2004; section RC 8 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section MB 7 of the Income Tax Act 2004; section RC 9(7) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section MB 8(6) of the Income Tax Act 2004; section RC 9 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section MB 8 of the Income Tax Act 2004; section RC 10(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section MB 9(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act 2004; sections RC 16(2) and RC 16(5) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and sections MB 15(2) and MB 15(11) of the Income Tax Act 2004; section RC 17(4)(a) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section MB 15(8)(a) of the Income Tax Act 2004; sections RC 18(2) and RC 18(4) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and sections MB 17(2) and MB 17(4) of the Income Tax Act 2004; section RC 19(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section MB 18(2) of the Income Tax Act 2004; sections RC 21(2) and (3), of the Income Tax Act 2007 and sections MB 20(2) and (3) of the Income Tax Act 2004; section RC 25(6) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section MB 24(5) of the Income Tax Act 2004; section RC 26(5) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section MB 25(5) of the Income Tax Act 2004; Schedule 13 part B of the Income Tax Act 2007 and of the Income Tax Act 2004_**

A number of remedial amendments have been made to the provisions which align the payments of provisional tax with GST payments and provide a new method of calculating provisional tax based on a percentage of GST taxable supplies - the GST ratio method. These amendments give effect to the original intent of the scheme.

#### Key features

*   Section RC 7(6) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section MB 6(5) of the Income Tax Act 2004 have been amended to provide that taxpayers who, after the first instalment, cease using the GST ratio method to calculate their provisional tax liability can elect to pay GST six-monthly. This amendment corrects a legislative oversight whereby the incorrect payment due dates were specified in section RC 7(6) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section MB 6(5) of the Income Tax Act 2004. The amendment correctly specifies that taxpayers who change from paying GST every two months to paying GST six-monthly will pay their provisional tax in two instalment on the dates specified in columns C and F of Schedule 13, part A.
*   Sections RC 8(3) and RC 8(7) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and sections MB 7(3) and MB 7(7) of the Income Tax Act 2004 have been amended. The legislation previously required taxpayers who used the GST ratio calculation method to base their GST ratio on information from two years ago, being the latest available information. However, there will be instances when taxpayers will have to calculate the GST ratio based on information from three years ago if they have an extension of time to file their later year's tax returns. Two new subsections have been inserted, sections RC 8(3B) and RC 8(7B), to enable information from three years ago to be used to base the ratio calculation on, provided that the information is available for that year and the year is not a transitional year, or the assessment for that year is not subject to a dispute or challenge.
*   An amendment has been made to section RC 9(7) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section MB 8(6) of the Income Tax Act 2004 to correct a cross-referencing error. The reference to section RC 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section MB 6 of the Income Tax Act 2004 has been removed.
*   Section RC 9(9) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section MB 8(8) of the Income Tax Act 2004 have been amended to clarify that new provisional taxpayers are liable to pay use-of-money interest as if they were liable to pay provisional tax in either: three, two or one instalment depending on when they start their taxable activity.
*   Section RC 9(9)(b)(ii) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section MB 8(8)(b)(ii) of the Income Tax Act 2004 have been amended to clarify that the subparagraph only applies to six-monthly GST payers who start business part-way through a year, and not in any other circumstance.
*   Two cross-referencing changes have been made to section RC 10(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section MB 9(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act 2004. The section now also refers to sections RC 9(7) and (8) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and sections MB 8(6) and (8) of the Income Tax Act2004.
*   To ensure consistency of terminology between the provisional tax legislation and that used in the Income Tax Act 2007, the following amendments have been made:
    *   the reference in section RC 16(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section MB 15(2) of the Income Tax Act 2004, to "preceding tax year" has been replaced by "preceding tax year and corresponding income year"; the reference to "whole tax year" has been replaced by "whole income year"; and
    *   the reference in section RC 16(5) of the Income Tax Act 2007 to "the tax year before" has been replaced by "a tax year earlier than".
*   When a taxpayer does not file a GST return for 60 days after the due date, he or she is required to discontinue use of the ratio method. However, taxpayers can apply to the Commissioner to continue to use the ratio method if the failure was due to circumstances beyond their control and they had a reasonable justification or excuse for the failure. Currently, the application must be in writing. However, an amendment has been made to section RC 17(4)(a) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section MB 15(8)(a) of the Income Tax Act 2004 that allows taxpayers to apply by phone or in writing.
*   A minor amendment has been made to section RC 18 (2) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section MB 17(2) of the Income Tax Act 2004 to correct an incorrect cross-reference. The reference to subsections (3) and (4) has been replaced with references to subsections (4) and (5).
*   An amendment has been made to section RC 18(4) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section MB 17(4) of the Income Tax Act 2004 that allows taxpayers who have elected to use the ratio method to subsequently decide, before the first instalment, not to use the ratio method. The amendment ensures that taxpayers who decide not to use the ratio method before the first instalment, for the purposes of the use-of-money interest rules, they are deemed never to have elected to use the ratio method.
*   Section RC 19(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section MB 18(2) of the Income Tax Act 2004 allows taxpayers who use the GST ratio method to calculate their provisional tax liability to adjust the calculation to take account of asset sales. An amendment has been made to this section to ensure that if taxpayers are on a payments basis for GST purposes they can only make the adjustment to the extent that they have received payment for the asset. The calculation of the ratio for the following year will also be reduced by the value of the asset sold, and again, only to the extent that the taxpayer has received payment for the asset.
*   Sections RC 21(2) and (3) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section MB 20(2) and (3) of the Income Tax Act 2004 have been amended to provide that when the due date for the payment of provisional tax would normally fall in April, the due date will move to 7 May. This is to allow additional time for businesses and tax agents to file GST/provisional tax returns previously due during the Easter period.
*   Changes have been made to section RC 25(6) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section MB 24(5) of the Income Tax Act 2004 which deal with consequences resulting from changes in balance dates. When, as a result of a change in balance date, a taxpayer changes from provisional tax dates in even months to odd months or from odd months to even months, the last period before the change in balance date will be for a part-period. The amendment ensures that the due dates for the payment of provisional tax for the part-period is 28 days after the end of that period unless the part-period ends in November, when the due date will be the 15 January, or the part-period ends in March, when the due date will be 7 May.
*   Taxpayers who pay GST six-monthly and subsequently cancel their GST registration are required to change their provisional tax payment dates and move from two provisional tax payments to three. An amendment has been made to section RC 26(5) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section MB 25(5) of the Income Tax Act 2004 to allow taxpayers to specify that the change in payment date takes effect from a future date, to align with the date they cancel their GST registration.
*   Schedule 13, part B of the Income Tax Act 2004 and the Income Tax Act 2007 has been amended to correct a drafting oversight. In the first column of the table for GST ratio taxpayers, the reference to "7-" should be "7-8".

#### Application date

The amendments apply from the beginning of the 2008-09 income year.

### Changes to the Tax Administration Act 1994

**_Sections 120KC(1)(b), 120KD(1) and (2) and 139C(2)(ab_**_)_

#### Key features

*   Section 120KC(1)(b) has been amended to provide that for the purposes of the use-of-money interest rules, a taxpayer's residual income tax for a year is payable in two instalments on:
    *   dates specified in columns C and F of Schedule 13, Part A of the Income Tax Act 2007 if the taxpayer pays GST on a six-monthly basis; and
    *   dates specified in columns D and F of Schedule 13, Part A of the Income Tax Act 2007 if they begin business after instalment B and more than 30 days before instalment D.
*   Section 120KD has been amended by:
    *   correcting a cross-referencing error in subsection (1) by correctly referring to both sections 120KE(1) and (3); and
*   Section 139C(2)(ab) has been inserted to provide a late payment penalty on late payments of provisional tax by taxpayers who use the GST ratio method of calculating provisional tax. Taxpayers who fail to pay on time will be liable for a late payment penalty on the lower of the actual ratio for the year or the ratio that applied at the due date. The late payment penalty will be imposed after the end of the income year when the actual ratio for the year is known.

#### Application date

The amendments apply from the beginning of the 2008-09 income year.

### Changes to the GST Act

**_Section 17(1)_**

#### Key feature

Section 17(1) has been amended by inserting new subsection (1B) which sets out the due date for special GST returns. The new subsection provides that the due date for special returns is the 28th of the month following the month in which the relevant sale was made. However, the due date for special GST returns for the November and March periods is 15 January and 7 May respectively.

#### Application date

The amendment applies to taxable periods ending on or after 30 November 2007.

Allocation guidelines
=====================

Applications from taxpayers for binding rulings (private rulings, product rulings or status rulings) will be assigned to relevant business units within Inland Revenue handled by:

*   the Tax Counsel Office (TCO)
*   appropriate personnel within the Customer and Compliance Services group, or
*   jointly by TCO and the Customer and Compliance Services group.

The criteria below form the basis for this allocation. This allocation is to be made on the basis of the technical issues contained within each ruling application, rather than on the basis of each application as a whole.

The allocation guidelines generally reflect the fact that TCO is the final point of technical decision-making for the Department (particularly on matters that are complex or have a high level of uncertainty) and the business unit ultimately responsible under the escalation process for resolving internal inconsistencies on the correct application of the legislation.

These criteria are only for initial allocation purposes. It is possible that some of the matters referred to may only become apparent during the actual processing of the ruling application. However, once issues within an application have been allocated to a business group for processing, it shall be that business group's responsibility to process those and they shall not be reallocated unless there are exceptional circumstances.

In exceptional circumstances, or where this is necessary or highly desirable due to relative workload demands and available resources, with the approval of the Chief Tax Counsel the allocation of a particular application may vary from these guidelines.

Allocation guidelines
---------------------

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| A. Issues within applications having the following characteristics will be allocated to TCO: |     |
| 1.  | Signification issues concerning the ability of the Department to rule |
| 2.  | Raising issues where there is a significant absence of, or possible or perceived deficiency in, IRD policy. |
| 3.  | Directly challenging an existing IRD policy or technical decision (whether this is based on new case law, or legislative change, or because the applicant regards the existing policy or decision to be legally incorrect). |
| 4.  | Raising issues where there are unresolved differences of views within IRD business groups on the correct application of the legislation. |
| 5.  | Raising issues where there is significant potential deficiency in, or unintended potential application or non-application of, specific legislative provisions. |
| 6.  | Raising significant interpretation issues in relation to new legislation. |
| 7.  | Raising issues or involving arrangements, having significant national implications, a wide precedential effect, or affecting an industry group. |
| 8.  | Raising issues or an arrangement that are the same as, or similar to issues already being handled by the TCO. |
| 9.  | Issues within product rulings that are not related to one or more private ruling applications (subject to guideline 3. in part C below). |
| 10. | Raising legal or factual issues that are particularly sensitive, of significant public or political interest, or otherwise controversial. |
| 11. | Raising issues of the interpretation of an anti-avoidance provision where those issues or equivalent arrangements have not previously been ruled upon. |
| 12. | Raising issues where the issue(s) may require a financial arrangement determination. Applications for special financial arrangement determinations are allocated to TCO. |
| 13. | Raising issues that have already been considered by the Customer and Compliance Services group as part of an indicative view. |
| 14. | Raising significant interpretation issues in relation to double tax agreements. |
| B. Applications for a substantive ruling on sections GC 6 to GC 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007 or for Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs) by way of binding ruling, will be allocated to, and handled by, the International Audit Unit to the extent that they do not involve ruling on interpretative questions regarding the meaning of the statutory language. |     |
| C.  Issues within applications having the following characteristics may be allocated to either TCO or Customer and Compliance Services group according to the particular nature of the issues or arrangement, the relative expertise or experience of personnel in the group, and/or available resources: |     |
| 1.  | Involving complex factual and/or technical interpretative issues. |
| 2.  | Raising issues regarding complex or specialised legislative provisions. |
| 3.  | Issues within product rulings where the issues or equivalent arrangements have previously been ruled on. |
| 4.  | Raising issues or facts that are the same as, or equivalent to, those considered previously by the group. |
| D.  Other issues within ruling applications (ie, not covered by the above criteria) will be allocated to, and handled by, the Customer and Compliance Services group. |     |

Ngā utunga tāpiri me ngā utunga tāpairi ā-rā Allowances and per diems
=====================================================================

Accommodation allowances 
-------------------------

### Accommodation payments

If you’re a contractor or entertainer and you work in the screen production industry, you may get an accommodation payment. These payments are sometimes called an accommodation allowance.

They are part of your gross income and usually taxed. If you have to file an income tax return, you need to include the payments in your return.

### Accommodation expenditure

You usually cannot deduct accommodation expenses because they are part of your private living costs. In limited cases, they can be deductible if you have to work away from where you normally live for a short time, usually 3 months or less.

There may be other times you can claim accommodation expenses. However, unless it’s for 3 months or less, we may ask you for more information to support your claim. This information should show how the expenses relate to the costs of earning your income as opposed to being private living costs.

You’ll need to keep all your invoices and receipts to support any expenses you claim against your taxes.

Other allowances
----------------

If you are an employee, you may receive allowances other than those mentioned above.

Per diems
---------

Some contractors or entertainers working in the screen production industry, receive per diem (per day) payments in addition to payment for their services.

Per diems are payments you receive to cover the cost of meals and other minor expenses (such as laundry or phone calls) you may have when you are required to work away from your town or country of normal residence.

They are part of your gross (total before tax) income and are subject to tax on schedular payments. If you are required to file an income tax return, you need to include per diems as part of your income on the return.

You can claim tax deductions for such work-related expenses against your end-of-year tax. These are called allowable deductions. To claim deductions, you have to file a tax return. You'll need to keep your invoices and receipts to support any tax deductions you claim.

On 1 July 2018 Inland Revenue updated an expenditure determination about people working in the screen production industry. Where you are required to work away from home and you incur expenses relating to your work and you receive per diems, the determination will apply to you.

The determination allows that from 1 July 2018, people working in the screen production industry are able to receive up to NZ$80 per day in per diem allowances without having schedular payment deducted. If you receive $80 or less in per diems a day, you won't need to keep your invoices and receipts for income tax purposes.

Per diem payments of more than $80 per day will need to have tax on schedular payments deducted by the payer on the amount over $80 (eg, if $90 is paid, schedular payments must be deducted from $10 of the payment). If you wish to claim per diem related expenditure greater than $80 for any day, you will need to keep all of your receipts in respect of that day.

If you receive a per diem payment but some goods or services for which the per diem is paid (eg meals) are provided, the $80 tax on schedular payments exemption is reduced. See the examples in the accordian.

If all your costs are met by the screen production company, the $80 exemption does not apply. Tax on schedular payments must be deducted from the full amount of any per diem payment you receive. You'll need to include any per diem received as gross (total before tax) income in your income tax return. As all costs are met by the screen production company, there will be no allowable deductions.

If your expenses amount to more than the per diem payment received, and you want to claim a deduction for the amount in excess of the per diem, you must keep receipts and invoices for all the expenses claimed for that particular day.

### GST returns

To complete your GST returns, you'll need to keep all your receipts and invoices regardless of how much you receive in per diems. Also, per diems are paid exclusive of GST, so when you prepare your GST invoice, you will need to calculate GST on the per diems received.

### Production companies

If you have a production where you will be paying a per diem of more than $80 and you can justify a higher amount, you can apply for a specific determination relating to that particular production.

Show all

Per diem of $80 while required to work away from your town of normal residence

You receive a per diem allowance of $80 while required to work away from your town of normal residence. You pay for the cost of the goods and services for which the allowance is paid. The payer does not have to deduct tax on schedular payments because the total payment does not exceed $80 per day.

Receiving a per diem allowance of $80 while working in your town of normal residence

You receive a per diem allowance of $80 and you are working in your town of normal residence. As you are working in your town of normal residence the determination does not apply. The payer has to deduct schedular payments from the per diem allowance of $80.

Receiving a per diem allowance of $80 and being provided with all meals while working

You receive a per diem allowance of $80. You are also provided with all meals while working, either on the set or at some other location. You haven't incurred the expense so the determination doesn't apply. The payer has to deduct tax on schedular payments from the per diem allowance of $80.

Payer provides goods and services to the value of $15 a day

The payer provides you with goods and services to the value of $15 per day. Therefore the maximum amount you can be paid as a per diem without tax on schedular payments being deducted is $65 per day.

Getting a per diem allowance of $95

You receive a per diem allowance of $95. You pay the cost of the goods and services for which the allowance is paid. The payer has to deduct tax on schedular payments from $15 of each daily payment as the payment exceeds the $80 threshold on a daily basis.

KOWHEORI-19 Ngā utunga tāpiri me ngā whakahokinga moni COVID-19 Employment allowances and reimbursements
========================================================================================================

During the COVID-19 pandemic many employees worked from home and some employees still do. Employers may have or may intend to make payments to employees during this time.

The following questions and answers provide guidance on when:

*   such payments can be made to employees tax-free
*   PAYE obligations arise
*   the employer can claim income tax or GST deductions.

We acknowledge many employers will not be in a financial position to make extra payments to employees working from home. This guidance is not intended to suggest employers should make the payments to employees.

[Determination EE004 - Tax treatment of reimbursing payments made to employees who work from home and or payments made for an employee’s use of personal telecommunications tools and or usage plans in their employment replaces Determination EE003 - Payments provided to employees that work from home](https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/determinations/miscellaneous/2023/ee004 "Tax treatment of reimbursing payments made to employees who work from home and/or payments made for an employee’s use of personal telecommunications tools and/or usage plans in their employment")

Question 1 - Working at home allowance

#### Question

I have decided to pay an allowance to my employees to recognise the inconvenience of working from home for an extended period. Is that amount subject to tax?

#### Answer

Yes. This would be taxable as an amount derived by the employee in connection with their employment. If the payment is to cover costs incurred by the employee, refer to question 3.

The payment would be subject to PAYE and deductible to the employer.

Question 2 - Payments to cover costs

#### Question

For tax purposes, how should I treat a payment to employees to cover costs arising from working from home?

#### Answer

If all the requirements below are satisfied, then the payment may be treated as:

*   tax-free (as exempt income) for the employee.
*   not subject to PAYE.
*   deductible for the employer.

For this determination to apply:

*   an employer must make a payment to an employee;
*   the payment must be for an expenditure or loss incurred (or likely to be incurred) by the employee;
*   the expenditure or loss must be incurred by the employee in deriving their employment income and not be private or capital in nature (but noting that the capital limitation does not apply to an amount of depreciation loss)
*   the employee must derive employment income from performing their job;
*   where an employee is working in part from home and in part outside home, the home-based work must be more than minor (e.g. the determination can apply to an employee who works at the employer’s premises on alternate days).

Costs could include:

*   increased electricity and other utility costs arising from working from home.
*   the cost of telecommunication tools and usage plans.
*   the cost of acquiring home office furniture or equipment.

Question 3 - Estimating payments to cover costs

#### Question

Can I estimate the reimbursement amount I pay to my employees?

#### Answer

Yes. You may make a reasonable estimate of the amount of expenditure likely to be incurred by an employee or a group of employees. If you do this, you need to retain sufficient information about how you calculated and supported the estimate.

Question 4 - Using the standard cost determinations

#### Question

Is there a simple way of estimating my employee’s working from home costs?

#### Answer

Yes. You can apply Determinations EE004.

This determination provides guidance on arrangements where employees agree to use their own devices (for example, phones) and usage plans (including phone and internet) for their employment.

It sets out proportions of expenditure or loss that the Commissioner will accept as being exempt income of an employee. The proportions differ depending on whether a device or usage plan is used by the employee principally for employment.

Where an employer pays a regular amount to an employee, the simplest option is to treat up to $7 per week of the amount paid as exempt income of the employee. See Determination EE004 for other options and details.

Where an employer pays an employee an allowance for general working from home costs, up to $20 of the amount paid can be treated as exempt income of the employee.

You do not have to apply the Determination. Instead, you can pay amounts based on your own reasonable estimates.

The options available under Determination EE004 are summarised in the following table. The table does not detail all the requirements of the Determination. The table must be read together with the Determination.

| What is the payment for? | How much is treated as exempt income? | When can I use this option? | What evidence do I need to keep? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Furniture or equipment | Up to $400 maximum ('safe harbour'). | The safe harbour amount is the only amount paid for furniture and equipment. | No evidence required. |
| 25% of cost of item.\* | Item is used at least partly for job. | *   Evidence of the employee's costs.<br>*   Evidence that the item is used for the employee's job. |
| 75% of cost of item.\* | Item is used mainly for job. | *   Evidence of the employee's costs.<br>*   Evidence that the item is used mainly for the employee's job. |
| 100% of cost of item.\* | Item is used exclusively for job. | *   Evidence of the employee's costs.<br>*   Evidence that the item is used exclusively for the employee's job. |
| Telecommunication usage plan costs | Up to $7 per week. | Plan used for job. | No evidence required. |
| 25% of employee's costs. | Cost is at least partly for job. | *   Evidence of the employee's costs.<br>*   Evidence that the cost is for the employee's job. |
| 75% of employee's costs. | Cost is mainly for job. | *   Evidence of the employee's costs.<br>*   Evidence that the cost is mainly for the employee's job. |
| 100% of employee's costs. | Cost is exclusively for job. | *   Evidence of the employee's costs.<br>*   Evidence that the cost is exclusively for the employee's job. |
| Other expenditure | Up to $20 per week. | The $20 per week amount is the only amount paid for other expenditure. | No evidence required. |

\* Assuming the item is a low-value asset. For items that are not low-value assets, the percentage is applied to the amount of depreciation loss.

Question 5 - Paying allowances for the cost of office furniture and equipment

#### Question

Can I pay an allowance (that is, an estimated amount) to my employees for equipment and furniture that they may have purchased or intend to purchase?

#### Answer

Yes. You can make a reasonable estimate of the amount likely to have been spent or will be spent by an employee or a group of employees. This answer assumes that the employee will own the furniture or equipment. If you are paying for equipment that you will take ownership of, see question 9.

You will need to support your estimate with evidence. This could be based on standard equipment prices and a survey of your employees’ equipment needs (taking into account equipment they already have). If you have many employees, surveying a sample of employees will be sufficient. You must also estimate the extent to which the equipment will be used by employees for their employment.

If you would rather avoid the administrative cost of estimating this amount, you can use the safe harbour option provided in Determination EE004. Under the safe harbour option, an employer may treat up to $400 of an amount paid to an employee for furniture and equipment costs as exempt income.

These payments are not subject to PAYE and are deductible to you as the employer.

Note that you cannot claim back GST on the purchase of furniture and equipment if it belongs to your employee.

Question 6 - Reimbursing employees for the cost of office furniture and equipment

#### Question

Are payments made to reimburse my employee for buying office furniture or equipment tax-free?

#### Answer

Part or all of a reimbursement paid to an employee for the cost of furniture or equipment may be paid tax-free. This answer assumes that the employee will own the furniture or equipment. If you are paying for equipment that you will take ownership of, see question 9.

The amount that you can reimburse tax-free is based on the depreciation loss that the employee could claim as a deduction on the assets (if the rule that normally prevents this did not apply).  For low-value assets purchased by employees, the depreciation loss is based on the cost of the goods (see the note on low-value assets below).  The amount that you can reimburse tax-free also depends on the extent to which the furniture and equipment is used by your employees for their employment.

Determination EE004 provides two options to help you to determine the amount that can be paid tax-free: the safe harbour option and the reimbursement option.

Under the safe harbour option, an employer may treat up to $400 of an amount paid to an employee for furniture and equipment costs as exempt income.

Under the reimbursement option, check the following scenarios.

*   Where there is evidence that an asset will be used exclusively for employment purposes, 100% of the depreciation loss on the asset (the cost of the asset, in the case of a low-value asset) can be paid as exempt income of the employee.
*   For an employee who uses an asset principally for their employment, an amount of up to 75% of the depreciation loss on the asset depreciation loss on the asset (the cost of the asset, in the case of a low-value asset) can be paid as exempt income of the employee.
*   For an employee who does not use an asset principally for their employment, an amount of up to 25% of the depreciation loss on the asset (the cost of the asset, in the case of a low-value asset) can be paid as exempt income of the employee. See Determination EE004 for conditions and further details.

These payments are not subject to PAYE and are deductible to you as the employer. Note that you cannot claim a GST deduction for the purchase of furniture and equipment if it belongs to your employee.

#### Note

Furniture or equipment assets are likely to be low-value assets. If so, the depreciation loss for the assets will be equal to their cost.

For an asset purchased before 17 March 2020 to be a low-value asset, it must have cost $500 or less. For an asset purchased on or after 17 March 2020 and before 17 March 2021 to be a low-value asset, it must have cost $5,000 or less. Note that on 17 March 2021, the low-value asset threshold decreased to $1,000.

Question 7 - Employees working only partly at home

#### Question

What if an employee works partly from home and partly outside of home?

#### Answer

Determinations EE004 can be applied in full to an employee who works partly from home and partly outside of their home, provided the home-based activity is more than minor.

Question 8 - Business tools and FBT

#### Question

I have supplied my employee with business tools such as a laptop to use at home and they are permitted incidental private use. Is that subject to FBT?

#### Answer

Generally, no. If the tools are supplied mainly for business use and the cost of the business tool to the employer is no more than $5,000 including GST then the provision of that tool will not be subject to FBT.

Question 9 - Accounting for business tools

#### Question

My employee purchased home office equipment and I reimbursed them on the condition that the equipment would belong to the business. What are the tax implications of this?

#### Answer

It seems that you may have effectively purchased the asset from your employee, or they may have purchased the asset on your behalf. If so, the asset now belongs to you as the employer. As a result, the payment to the employee will not be income of the employee, it will be a capital receipt. For you, as the employer, the tax treatment of the business tool will be the same as if you bought it directly. For example, you will be able to claim an income tax deduction for depreciation loss and a GST deduction for the purchase in the usual way. The Commissioner accepts that a tax invoice in the name of the employee in such situations is sufficient for claiming back the GST paid: Tax Information Bulletin Vol 11, No 9 (October 1999) at 82.

[Tax Information Bulletin - Vol 11 No 9 - October 1999](https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/tib/volume-11---1999/tib-vol11-no9)

Question 10 - Home office expenses incurred by employees

#### Question

As an employee, can I claim any deductions for the cost of setting up my home office?

#### Answer

No. An employee cannot deduct costs incurred in deriving income from employment.

There are a very limited number of expenses that can be claimed as deductions by individuals who are not in business. The expenses are limited to income tax return preparation fees, income protection insurance premiums, commission charged on interest and dividends, interest on money borrowed to buy shares and UOMI on late paid tax. You can learn more about types of individual expenses in the income tax section.

[Types of individual expenses](/income-tax/income-tax-for-individuals/types-of-individual-expenses)

Question 11 - Backpay of allowance

#### Question

Can I backpay my employee a lump sum amount to catch up on payments of the $15 weekly payment - going back to the beginning of the period covered by the determination, ie 17 March 2020?

#### Answer

Yes.

When back dating payments to employees you will need to consider the date you are back dating the payment to:

*   Determination EE004 applies to payments made by employers from 1 April 2023.
*   Determination EE003 applies to payments made by employers for the period from 1 October 2021 to 31 March 2023.
*   Determination EE002B applies to payments made from 18 March 2021 until 30 September 2021.
*   Determination EE002A applies to payments made on or before 17 March 2021.
*   Determination EE002 applies to payments made on or before 17 March 2020 to 17 September 2020.

Question 12 - Time limit for making payments

#### Question

Is there a time limit for making payments?

#### Answer

There is no stated time limit for when the payments must be made, but delay could make it harder to satisfy the requirements. The payments must be made for expenditure incurred by the employee.

As usual with tax matters, the onus is on taxpayers to show that this requirement is met. The longer employers delay before making these payments, the more doubt arises as to whether this requirement is met.

These determinations do not apply to payments made as part of a salary sacrifice arrangement.

[Taxation (International Investment and Remedial Matters) Act 2012](/new-legislation/act-articles/taxation-international-investment-and-remedial-matters-act-2012 "Taxation (International Investment and Remedial Matters) Act 2012")

Alternative thin-capitalisation test for some low asset companies
=================================================================

Taxation (International Investment and Remedial Matters) Act 2012 introduces an alternative thin-capitalisation test for some low asset companies, beginning 1 July 2009.

_Subsections FE 5(1B), FE 5(1D) and (1E), FE 5(1BC), FE 5(1BD) and FE 5(1BB) and sections FE 6B and FE 12B of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section 65B of the Tax Administration Act 1994_

The Act introduces an alternative thin capitalisation test for certain New Zealand-based groups with offshore investments. This will give certain New Zealand taxpayers an option to apply an alternative method under the thin capitalisation rules. New Zealand multinational groups that have a high level of arm's length debt (provided that certain other conditions are met) can choose a test for thin capitalisation based on a ratio of interest expenses to pre-tax cashflows, rather than on a debt-to-asset ratio.

#### Application date

The alternative thin-capitalisation test applies for income years beginning on or after 1 July 2009. The measure applies retrospectively so that companies that may have experienced difficulties immediately after the extension of the thin capitalisation rules will be able to obtain relief.

#### Key features

A new thin capitalisation test is available for certain New Zealand-based multinationals.

The test is available to a group if:

*   the worldwide debt of the multinational is more than 75% of its worldwide assets (excluding any recognised goodwill);
*   at least 80% of the worldwide group's debt is from lenders that are not associated with a member of the group; and
*   the New Zealand part of the multinational group and the worldwide group both have net income and net interest expenses (not net losses or net interest income).

The test is not available to entities that are non-residents or controlled by a single non-resident.

If the alternative test can be used, the taxpayer will calculate a ratio of net interest expense to net income, rather than the debt-to-asset ratio used under the existing test.

To the extent that the ratio for the New Zealand group is less than the lesser of 50% and 110% of the ratio for the worldwide group there will be no denial of interest deductions under the rules. If these conditions are not met, some interest deductions may be denied.

#### Detailed analysis

All references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless stated.

#### _Background_

The thin capitalisation rules, which limit excessive interest deductions against the New  
Zealand taxable income of multinationals, were extended in the Taxation (International  
Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Act 2009.

Previously, they applied only to non-residents and residents controlled by non-residents. The 2009 Act extended the thin capitalisation rules to other taxpayers with controlling interests in foreign companies. As part of the Taxation (International Investment and Remedial Matters) Act 2012, the rules have been further extended to some taxpayers with non-controlling interests in foreign companies.

Extending the rules has created difficulties for a small number of New Zealand-based groups reported to have high indebtedness.

The rules currently deny interest deductions if a group has a New Zealand debt-to-asset ratio that is both more than 75% and more than 110% of the worldwide debt-to-asset ratio of the group.

In other words, some deductions are denied if the group's debt appears to be concentrated in New Zealand.

The problem arises partly from the way assets are measured. Measurement is based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). GAAP does not allow the recognition of some intangible assets, such as internally developed goodwill. Companies that have highly valuable brands, for example, cannot include those in the measure of assets unless they were purchased on the open market. This increases the debt-to-asset ratio and increases the potential for interest deductions to be denied.

A New Zealand company with valuable brands that looks to expand offshore by taking on debt may therefore find itself subject to the thin capitalisation rules, even though it is not unreasonably arranging to have its debts in New Zealand.

There are good reasons for the exclusion of internally developed goodwill and some other intangible assets from the GAAP measure of assets. Primarily, it can be extremely difficult to value intangible assets if there has not been an arm's-length transaction.

However, in cases where a company has significant intangible assets that cannot be counted for the purpose of the thin capitalisation rules, it is possible that a debt-to-asset ratio will be a misleading indication of whether excessive debt has been stacked in New Zealand.

#### _Alternative test_

To address the problem that some New Zealand-based groups are facing, a new test has been developed as an alternative to the existing debt-to-asset ratio test. It uses a measure that approximates an interest coverage ratio (interest-to-cashflows). Arm's-length lenders may be prepared to lend against cashflows even when recognised assets are low (interest coverage is often used in lending covenants).

#### _Requirements for use of alternative test_

_Paragraph FE 5(1B)(ab)_

An "excess debt outbound entity" is, broadly speaking, a person who is subject to the thin capitalisation rules solely by reason of a direct or indirect outbound investment from New Zealand.

Paragraph (ab) of section FE 5(1B) provides that an excess debt outbound entity is not required to apply the existing thin capitalisation rule in section FE 6 if it is able to choose, and does choose, to apply the alternative rule in section FE 6B.

_Subsection FE 5(1BB)_

This subsection provides that a person can choose the alternative rule in section FE 6B if all of the following four requirements are met:

*   Both the New Zealand group and the worldwide group of the person must have a positive amount of adjusted net profit for the year (adjusted net profit is further defined in subsection FE 5(1BC) and is determined mainly using financial accounts).
*   Both the New Zealand group and the worldwide group of the person must have a positive amount of net interest expense, determined using the rules in the Income Tax Act as if there were no thin capitalisation rules, as if the relevant members of the worldwide group were residents, and as if the group were consolidated to eliminate internal balances and transactions (see commentary on section FE 12B).
*   The worldwide group's debt-to-asset ratio, excluding any recognised goodwill but otherwise determined using the existing thin capitalisation rules, must be 75% or more.
*   80% or more of the worldwide group's debt (calculated in the normal way under the thin capitalisation rules) must be from people that are not associated persons of a member of the group.

The first two requirements are to prevent distortion when the formula in section FE 6B is applied. The third requirement is that the worldwide group is highly indebted if all of its recognised goodwill is disregarded. If the group is not highly indebted in this circumstance, the existing test is more likely to work (it is less likely to be difficult for the company to push some debt offshore, for example). The fourth requirement is to ensure that most of the debt is genuinely arm's-length debt, and not, for example, capital injected by shareholders in the form of debt.

#### _Definition of adjusted net profit_

_Subsections FE 5(1BC) and FE 5(1BD)_

The adjusted net profit of a group is a proxy, albeit an imprecise one, for net cashflow from operations. It corresponds approximately to the "earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation" measure used in financial markets, usually referred to by its acronym EBITDA.

The formula begins with net profit before tax for the relevant group (New Zealand or worldwide), determined using generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and consolidating companies for the purposes of eliminating intra-group transactions (see commentary on section FE 12B). A net loss is treated as a negative net profit. A pre-tax measure is used partly because the measure of tax expense used for GAAP purposes is unlikely to be a meaningful indication of current tax liabilities (or associated cashflows).

For the New Zealand group, certain income arising from an interest in a foreign company is then removed, again using generally accepted accounting principles to measure this income. The income is removed if the interest is an income interest in a controlled foreign company, or an interest in a foreign investment fund that qualifies for the Australian exemption in subsection EX 35(1), or an interest in a foreign investment fund for which the attributable FIF income method is used.

This income is removed because it is typically not subject to tax in New Zealand. An important purpose of the thin capitalisation rules is to prevent excessive deductions being allocated to income that is not taxable in New Zealand.

Net interest deductions (deductions less income), as determined under the Income Tax Act but again on a consolidated basis, are then added to the remaining net profit. This gives an estimate of cashflows before interest expense. In the case of the worldwide group, relevant members are treated as if they were resident for this purpose.

Depreciation and amortisation, measured under GAAP, and again on a consolidated basis, are then added back. These are non-cash expenses.

#### _When there is no interest apportionment (no denial of deductions)_

_Subsections FE 5(1D) and (1E)_

An excess debt outbound entity is not denied any interest deductions under the apportionment rule in section FE 6B, if its New Zealand group's ratio of net interest to adjusted net profit is below the lesser of 50% or 110% of the worldwide group's net interest to adjusted net profit ratio.

For example, if the worldwide group's net interest to adjusted net profit ratio was 40%, the excess debt outbound entity would face some interest denial if the equivalent New Zealand group ratio was more than 44%. If instead, the worldwide group ratio was 60%, the excess debt outbound entity would face some interest denial if the New Zealand group ratio was more than 50%.

Net interest is defined in the same way as in subsections FE 5(1BB) and (1BD). The use of a net interest figure allows entities to reduce their apparent interest deductions for the purposes of thin capitalisation by on-lending their borrowings to foreign companies (pushing some debt offshore) and receiving corresponding interest income. Adjusted net profit is defined in subsections FE 5(1BC) and (1BD).

#### _The apportionment calculation_

_Section FE 6B_

If a person chooses to apply the alternative apportionment calculation and is not excluded by subsections FE 5(1D) and (1E) from having to actually apportion, section FE 6B is the section used to perform the actual apportionment.

The amount of interest deduction denied is given by the formula in subsection (2). In practice, deductions are denied by adding back income rather than reducing deductions. The terms in that formula are based on the interest-to-income ratio given by section FE 5(1E) and the thresholds seen in section FE 5(1D). "Net interest" is the actual amount of net interest deduction for the taxpayer (not the group) in the absence of the thin capitalisation rules.

Parallels with the existing interest allocation calculation in section FE 6 are evident.

**Example: Interest deductions denied**

X Co, a resident company with a single resident shareholder, owns 100% of Y Co, a foreign company. X Co would have net interest deductions of $1 million in the absence of the thin capitalisation rules, and the worldwide group would have net interest deductions of $3 million. X Co's adjusted net profit is $3 million and the worldwide group's adjusted net profit is $12 million. Assume X Co is able to use the alternative apportionment calculation. Then: **net interest** is $1 million;  
**NZ group ratio** is 0.333… ($1 million ÷ $3 million);  
**threshold ratio** is 0.275 (1.1 x $3 million ÷ $12 million); and the formula gives a result of $175,000 ($1 million x \[0.333... \- 0.275\] ÷ 0.333...).

Therefore only $825,000 of interest deductions is effectively permitted.

Note that if X Co instead had $825,000 of interest deductions in the first place, and the worldwide group's deductions were unchanged, the NZ group ratio would be exactly equal to 110% of the ratio for the worldwide group, and deductions would not be denied.

#### _Machinery provision_

_Section FE 12B_

Section FE 12B specifies that certain amounts used in the thin capitalisation test are to be calculated using generally accepted accounting principles and on a consolidated basis.

In the case of interest deductions and interest income, there are specific instructions to use tax concepts rather than accounting concepts to calculate the base amounts, but consolidation of these amounts is still undertaken using accounting principles. This is similar to the treatment of debt under the existing thin capitalisation test, in which the relevant debts are determined by the tax rules but consolidation occurs using accounting principles.

Section FE 12B also limits the consolidation of amounts of any non-resident group members to the amount that is attributable to New Zealand-sourced income.

#### _Administrative requirements_

_Section 65B of the Tax Administration Act 1994_

Taxpayers who use the proposed new rule must meet the following administrative requirements:

*   First, the taxpayer must advise the Commissioner, in any manner the Commissioner may specify, that the rule has been applied.
*   Secondly, the taxpayer must provide reconciliations of adjusted net profit to GAAP net profit, and of goodwill to items presented in the GAAP balance sheet, in any manner the Commissioner may specify.

The advice and reconciliations must be furnished to the Commissioner by the due date for the taxpayer's tax return for the relevant tax year under section 37 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The current procedure is to send these to [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#80e3efedf0e5f4e5eef4aee1f5f4e8eff2e9f4f9c0e9f2e4aee7eff6f4aeeefa)

These requirements will enable Inland Revenue to monitor the extent of use of the alternative thin capitalisation rule and the appropriateness of the measures used in it.

Recommendations This study contributes to the development of the future state of the tax system. It identifies the more viable options to decrease the influence of late payment penalty (LPP) on the impairment of the debt book. To support the effectiveness of these options, new sanctions are also presented as complementary tools to support increased tax compliance. Potential alternatives worth considering further to the current LPP regime Cap the LPP The LPP will only be applied up to a maximum cap. Capping would prevent the value of the debt book increasing because of the LPP. Remove LPP and apply cost of money only Previous research findings indicate that it is not specifically the LPP that is driving payment of tax obligations on time. Having a sanction of cost of money has significant merit, because the consequence of non-compliance is still present as interest is charged on the debt. This approach to non-compliance is more consistent with a commercial operating model. New collection tools worth considering Credit reporting Reporting people with outstanding tax obligations to credit agencies could be used as an effective tool for increasing compliance. Travel Restrictions Restricting overseas travel by debtors is an option that has been applied for other debt, and could be used as an effective tool to encourage compliance. Require tax clearance for government contracts Requiring contractors to gain tax clearance before being awarded government contracts is relatively common in other tax jurisdictions. Withhold government payments to debtors This could be a useful tool to get debtors to contact Inland Revenue about their debt. Director penalty notices A notice is issued in regard to a company’s PAYE obligations not being met. The effect of the notice is that if the debt is not resolved, the company director will become personally liable for the payment of the PAYE deduction. Compulsory electronic charge This would involve collecting tax debt by adding a charge to electronic transactions. Exploring alternatives to the late payment penalty scheme 5 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Section 2. Purpose of the study Is the Tax Administration Act (TAA) fit for the 21st century? The IR leadership team has been discussing some big ideas about the future of our tax system, in particular the legislation and the overall tax system we work with. Part of this discussion includes the potential to re- visit the interest and penalties regime. IR is increasing its focus on both the collection of debt and management of its debt book. In its current state the debt book is heavily impaired. High impairment means the value expected to be recovered is significantly lower than the face value. The intent of penalties is to provide customers with incentives to comply. However, the current penalty and interest (P&I) regime contributes significantly to the makeup of the overdue debt book. P&I regimes vary across tax types and social policies. LPP has been identified as being a major contribution for increases in tax debt, in June 2013 nearly 50% of the debt book was composed of interest and penalties charges. The purpose of this study is to gain insight into how the LPP is functioning and explore alternative options to the existing LPP regime, and is an input into the Encouraging Compliance Project, which is investigating policy and legislative settings applying to debt and penalties. Integration with IR debt work This work is consistent with requirements of the long term programme of the IR debt work, to improve the characteristics of the debt book. A key expectation of the IR debt work once implemented is that “penalty and interest regimes do not artificially inflate revenue on bad debt”. This programme builds on existing initiatives across IR and introduces new priorities, capabilities and technology to enable the organisation to achieve an improved future state for debt. It is expected that this study of the LPP regime will underpin IR’s ability to:  improve the understanding of and influence over customer behaviour  provide a wider range of more flexible policy options  treat customers differently, recognising that risk profiles and behaviours differ. Key research questions 1. What are the tools IR has currently available to encourage voluntary compliance? 2. How effective are these tools? 3. If the tools are not being used or under used, why? 4. What are the different tools other tax jurisdictions use to encourage voluntary compliance, and how effective are they at encouraging voluntary compliance? 5. Does Australian Tax Office (ATO) consider that removing the LPP has been effective? Exploring alternatives to the late payment penalty scheme 6 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Approach to this study 1. Review of the previous IR research involving the Identifying Sanction Thresholds 1 , and consider international practice relating to tax compliance 2 . 2. Focus group discussions were held with 21 staff from IR’s Collections business group based in Napier, Manakau and Takapuna (as suggested by the sponsor), three staff from Policy & Strategy, and the IR liaison with Business NZ, about the current LPP operating model. The participants identified suggestions for improvements, and feedback on alternative compliance tools. 3. Information was obtained from three staff from the ATO on removal of the LPP, and introduction of a cost of money penalty regime. 1 Intervening to reduce risk: identifying sanction thresholds among SME tax debtors; Poppelwell; ejournal of Tax research vol.1 0 no.2 2012. 2 Tax and Compliance, Lisa Marriott, Victoria University of Wellington, June 2013 Exploring alternatives to the late payment penalty scheme 7 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Section 3. Current state of the LPP Advocates of the existing LPP believe this penalty delivers compliant behaviour. The general view of Collections staff was that taxpayers are aware there are consequences to non- payment of their tax liabilities, but they are generally unaware or confused as to what these consequences are. This observation by Collections officers is supported by research with SMEs and tax agents (Poppelwell 2011) which found: The assumption that penalties and interest influence payment in the majority of cases is correct; the majority of SMEs say the penalties are at least quite influential for making sure they pay their business tax by the due dates. Interestingly, the fact that penalties merely exist appears to be the key motivation for paying tax on time for the majority of SMEs, rather than the structure, size of the penalties, or the interest charges. This is a consistent finding across SMEs that are currently in debt, SMEs with a debt history, and SMEs that have never had a tax debt. This research indicates that it is the avoidance of consequences for late payment that is driving compliant behaviour by taxpayers 3 as most SMEs are aware there are financial penalties for late payment of business tax, but lack specific knowledge of how they are applied. These findings are similar to that identified in the Canada Revenue Agency research which found that the majority of participants assumed there would be some sort of adverse financial consequence, such as interest, but awareness was low about how charges are calculated 4 . SMEs most commonly said that they simply want to avoid penalties altogether and that they always pay on time regardless. The research suggests that taxpayers are generally unaware of the mechanism of the LPP, so it does not support the notion that it is specifically the LPP that drives compliant behaviour. Impact on the debt book The late payment penalty has increased tax debt, contributing to nearly 50% of tax debt at June 2013. Although in the current system it is difficult to attribute tax payments to specific components of the debt (core, interest, penalties), modelling of the administrative data has provided an indication that around 50% of penalties may have been written off over 2009-12. 3 Awareness and imposition of penalties and interest for late payment can increase compliance in the early stages of the tax debt being incurred but counterproductive with aged debt. 4 Canada Revenue Agency. (December 2009). Attitudes towards payment of debt and compliance. Final Report. Prepared by Sage Rese arch for Canada Revenue Agency. Exploring alternatives to the late payment penalty scheme 8 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Operational experience of the LPP Escalation of the debt due to LPP 5 can cause people to ignore their obligations as they pass the debt tipping point 6 . Collections staff report that a large majority of tax agents negotiating the payment of debt have a starting position that does not include the LPP and will begin by negotiating the Core and Interest. This has a significant impact on the negotiation of the final settlement. Collections staff are constrained by maximising recovery where the amount can include core tax, and/or interest and/or civil penalties. The outcome of this can be that settlement on a long term debt, which is composed of a significant proportion of LPPs, may not include the LPP component. New Zealand’s LPP regime is “complex and relatively severe” (Marriott, 2013), compared to LPP used by other tax jurisdictions. Collections staff commented that the LPP is bitterly resented, especially by those that have the means to pay. 5 As at 30 June 2013 P&I made up 48% of the total debt overdue. 79% of P&I was linked to cases 2 years and older, and for cases > 5 years the P&I component is as high as 81% of the total debt. 6 Intervening to reduce risk: identifying sanction thresholds among SME tax debtors; Poppelwell; ejournal of Tax research vol.1 0 no.2 2012. Exploring alternatives to the late payment penalty scheme 9 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Section 4. Alternative options to the current LPP regime Remove the LPP and apply cost of money only There was general support for the removal of the LPP by Collections participants interviewed for this study. They considered that taxpayers found LPP difficult to understand. They supported retaining the cost for the use of money on the outstanding debt, which is a generally accepted charge for people in debt. It was acknowledged the interest rate would need to be at a level that would deter the use of IR as a viable finance option. Consistency with other collections regimes To facilitate the move to a dedicated loan management system and reduce the extent to which overdue amounts grow due to penalties, the LPP associated with student loan overseas based borrowers (OBB) was removed on 1 April 2012 and replaced with a late payment interest charge of 4% above the base interest rate, As well as creating simpler consequences for non-payment, the rationale for this was to reduce the rate at which OBB debt grows. This is seen by some as a barrier to keeping up-to-date with current repayment obligations. Australian Tax Office experience in removing the LPP The Time for Business report 7 was a catalyst for the changes in the approach that ATO took with taxpayers. This included a move away from culpability to a pecuniary focus, which was more consistent with a commercial operating model. This resulted in the removal of their LPP and introduction of a cost of money regime called the General Interest Charge (GIC). The ATO has also implemented the Business Activity Statement (BAS) 8 to increase the visibility of and have a better understanding of its clients. This mitigates the situation where people are not communicating with the ATO, as they have an obligation to submit their BAS. This is especially true of entities that have a small turnover. They have also established a business viability tool, to mitigate the risk of businesses incurring tax obligations that they are unlikely to pay. To support this regime there has been a change of emphasis to “on time lodgement” (Filing) for the taxpayers, with an increase in the culpability for non-lodgement. The ATO introduction of the GIC is covered in greater detail in Appendix 1. Pros:  Removal of the LPP would reduce the inflation of the IR debt book and also increase the proportion of recoverable debt.  Creates a more readily understood consequence for non-payment, which is consistent with standard business practice. Cons:  Owing debt to IR could be seen by businesses, as a cheaper alternative to other sources of finance. 7 Although the ATO tax environment was different to the NZ situation it is informative to review the changes that they instigated. See Appendix 1 8 BAS is a form submitted to the ATO by all businesses to report their taxation obligations Exploring alternatives to the late payment penalty scheme 10 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Cap the LLP Collections staff interviewed for this study suggested that capping the proportion of the LPP relative to the original core debt, or putting a cap on the age of the debt where LPP can be applied, could mitigate LPPs adding to the value of the debt book. The rationale for the LPP is to influence on time payment. If non-payment continues then the LPP is not effective in this situation and so applying a cap and imposing other compliance measures makes sense. The cap to the LPP could be imposed in a variety of ways e.g. as a fixed dollar amount, as a percentage of the core tax debt, or the age of the debt. Pros:  A cap will reduce the inflation of the IR debt book and also increase the proportion of recoverable debt.  This would ensure the LPP is applied only to the extent that it is effective in influencing payment.  A cap is used by other jurisdictions. The US Internal Revenue Service has a LPP that is subject to a cap. Cons:  If the cap is a percentage of a small debt, this may decrease the incentive to pay back the debt. Discretion to apply the LPP Under this option, it is envisaged that IR will have discretion as to whether LPP is applied to debt. The criteria for discretion in applying the LPP were not defined by participants, but the concept was debated. Collections staff were concerned about maintain consistency between taxpayers with the application of existing tools to encourage compliance. For example it was noted there can be regional variations and reliance on the knowledge and experience of Collections staff. It was considered that introducing flexibility in the ability to apply a penalty would add a significant degree of complexity to these decisions. Pros:  Could take into account the previous compliance behaviour of the tax payer.  Reduces the inflation of the IR debt book and also increase the proportion of recoverable debt. Cons:  Could increase inconsistent treatment of taxpayers. Exploring alternatives to the late payment penalty scheme 11 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Section 5. Compliance tools for consideration This section outlines the sanctions identified as feasible compliance tool options that could be considered for implementation by IR. Credit reporting Reporting of individuals with outstanding tax obligations to credit agencies had a substantial level of support from Collections staff who participated in this study, with some of the opinion that this would be “the best tool”. They believe this has a real consequence for many debtors which will lead them to resolve outstanding debt with IR. The Business NZ liaison saw a potential advantage of credit reporting as being increased transparency for business interactions. Businesses providing goods and services could have better visibility of the viability of entities they are trading with. From the research ‘Identifying Sanction Thresholds Among SME Tax Debtors’ 9 this sanction was considered to be effective by 62% of tax agent respondents. Travel restrictions Restricting overseas travel by debtors is an option that has been applied in Child Support debt, and is currently being considered in the case of student loans debt. Collections staff who participated in this study considered that this could have significant impact on directors of companies, although the thresholds would need to be worked out. A number of other tax jurisdictions also use this penalty, e.g. Australia, Denmark, Germany and Ireland. From the research ‘Identifying Sanction Thresholds Among SME Tax Debtors’ this sanction was considered to be effective by 64% of tax agent respondents. Require tax clearance for government contracts Contractors could be required to gain tax clearance before being awarded government contracts. This is relatively common in other tax jurisdictions e.g. Sweden, Spain, Norway and Germany. There may be an opportunity to pursue this option within the new government procurement system. Withhold government payments to debtors Collections participants considered that withholding government payments to debtors would be a useful tool to get debtors to contact IR about their debt. They would not get any potential refunds if they have debt, until they contact IR. This enforcement power is used by a number of other tax jurisdictions e.g. Australia, Canada, France and USA. 9 Intervening to reduce risk: identifying sanction thresholds among SME tax debtors; Poppelwell; ejournal of Tax research vol.10 no.2 2012. Exploring alternatives to the late payment penalty scheme 12 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Director penalty notices One of the tools available to the ATO is the issue of a director penalty notice. A notice is issued in regard to a company’s PAYE obligations not being met. The effect of the notice is that if not resolved, the company director they will become personally liable for the payment of the PAYE deduction. The action required is for the director to ensure that the company makes the outstanding payments, or to place the company into voluntary administration or liquidation. The result is that the company director is forced at an early stage to address the company’s solvency. Some Collections participants considered this may involve a trade off with the IR having priority on PAYE, so IR could lose more than it gains. There may be a requirement to consider IR having priority on PAYE. It was considered the implementation of the director penalty notices could be done better than the ATO, which would mitigate some of the negative operational experiences that occurred in Australia. Compulsory electronic charge This would be an extension of tools used for the collection of tax debt by incorporating modern payment methods. Transactional skimming would operate by IR having the ability to require financial institutions e.g. banks or other payment intermediaries to attach an additional charge on electronic transactions for taxpayers with outstanding tax debt. IR would take a portion of the funds due to the seller per electronic transaction, or the buyer would incur an additional Inland Revenue charge on top of the amount being spent. This collection at source option could provide IR access to the business cash flow, and may also be useful for people who have difficulty in managing their financial affairs. Exploring alternatives to the late payment penalty scheme 13 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Section 6. Learnings beyond the scope of this project Non-filing The current system may incentivise taxpayers to not file and drop outside the tax system altogether, so avoiding the visibility of their tax obligations. NZ has the lightest penalty for late filing of the countries examined in the ‘Tax and Compliance’ literature review (Marriott 2013), and also had the lowest level of on time lodgement. Having visibility of taxpayer obligations is critical in understanding the overall debt book, and the potential income for government. With the removal of the LPP and introduction of the GIC the ATO shifted its emphasis from paying on time to lodging (filing) on time. Business viability assessment tool Understanding the ability of a business in tax default to meet its obligations is important to maintain a level playing field for compliant businesses. The ATO maintains oversight of the viability of businesses with tax debt. This is a critical component of introducing a GIC, to prevent businesses developing unsustainable tax obligations. To assist, a model was developed with KPMG to determine the viability of businesses, and if they are determined to be unsustainable, proceedings can be issued to liquidate the business. Collections are currently investigating the ATO business viability assessment tool, as this type of resource could potentially be useful for IR. Exploring alternatives to the late payment penalty scheme 14 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Appendix 1: ATO introduction of the GIC Context for the ATO removal of the LPP In 1996 the Australian Federal Government began a consultation process with business about reducing ‘red tape’ and reforming the taxation system. In November 1996, the Small Business Deregulation Task Force made recommendations designed to alleviate the paper work and compliance burden imposed on small business. The report ‘Time for Business’ specifically highlighted concerns that taxpayers had about the imposition and calculation of penalties under the various taxation laws, in particular late payment penalties. In March 1997, the Prime Minister responded to the recommendations in his statement ‘More Time for Business’. The Government accepted that the complexity of the existing penalty arrangements was a major factor contributing to confusion and misunderstanding among taxpayers. The Commissioner of Taxation was asked to review all penalty arrangements with a view to rationalising and simplifying the system. The ATO, in consultation with professional bodies and taxpayer organisations, reviewed the penalty arrangements, in particular penalties under the various source deduction collection systems. The review found that the existing arrangements suffered from a number of drawbacks, including:  penalty calculations were not easily understood by taxpayers  inconsistent penalty rates and calculations existed across the different taxes and between classes of taxpayers  the difficulties in having the ATO's systems automate the calculation of penalties and issue account statements  the rate of penalty did not reflect market interest rates  the lack of commercial reality in the penalty rules which prevented the ATO from assisting taxpayers to minimise any escalation of outstanding debt. The Auditor General (Audit Report No 13 1996-1997 ‘Tax Debt Collection’) had separately commented that the ATO should improve its business systems to automatically impose late payment penalties. This report also suggested that ‘the ATO review the legislative framework for the ATLP \[additional taxes for late payment\] for all taxes....for the purpose of simplifying the relevant legislation and thus reduce the costs of compliance for both the community and the ATO’. The former ATO LPP regime It is useful to understand the previous approach to late payment penalties. For revenue lines related to source deduction, the penalties comprised a ‘culpability’ component, being a flat percentage of the tax not paid on time (at a maximum of 20% but usually imposed at 4%) of the amount not remitted, plus a ‘per annum’ component (set at 16% per annum). For taxes such as sales tax or fringe benefits tax, taxpayers faced a penalty calculated on a per annum basis calculated from the due date for payment. For income tax, the regime depended on the year of income involved. For years of income prior to 1993, late payment penalty applied at the rate of 20% per annum (reduced to 16% per annum from 1 October 1992). For income years from 1993, taxpayers were liable to two separate charges imposed under sections 207 and 207A of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (ITAA 1936), on any unpaid amount of tax:  late payment penalty (non-deductible) at the rate of 8% pa  interest (deductible) (at a rate provided for at section 214A ITAA 1936) which varied every 6 months. In short, taxpayers faced a variety of late payment regimes that were quite complex and punitive. Taxation Laws Amendment Act (No.3) 1999, which introduced Running Balance accounts and the General Interest Charge, represented a key part of the Government’s response to these concerns. Exploring alternatives to the late payment penalty scheme 15 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Introduction of the General Interest Charge (GIC). The GIC formed an integral part of a package of changes introduced in June 1999. This package of changes was aimed at improving the administration of the tax system by assisting taxpayers, especially small business taxpayers, to better understand and comply with their obligations, and removing punitive culpability provisions for late payment of some taxes. These changes included:  the introduction of Running Balance Accounts (RBAs). The RBA enabled the production of regular automated statements of account, hence assisting taxpayers to better understand and manage their tax affairs. The GIC, which enables interest to be calculated on the daily balance of the RBA, is an essential element of the RBA. The RBA has been expanded since its introduction to enable many taxpayer’s obligations and payments across revenue lines to be recorded on a single statement of account  abolition of complex and punitive penalty regimes and their replacement with a uniform interest charge which is fully tax deductible for all taxpayers  more time for business to remit certain withholding liabilities. This included the alignment of remittance dates in anticipation of a large number of businesses being required to make one payment each month or quarter to cover most tax debts  removal of offence provisions for non-remittance of a variety of taxes. The introduction of the GIC meant that the complex system of interest and punitive culpability penalties was replaced with a uniform regime for calculating and imposing a range of penalties including those for late payment. The GIC regime was intended to be transparent, consistent, commercially based and easy to administer. The GIC applies to almost all taxes, levies and charges administered by the Commissioner. These include:  an amount of tax, charge, levy or penalty that remains unpaid  an underpayment of tax following an amendment of an assessment  an underestimate of an instalment of tax  administrative overpayments not repaid (where appropriate notice requiring repayment has been given to the taxpayer). The GIC was set in accordance with the weighted average yield of the 13 week Treasury Note rate plus 8 percentage points, and was:  varied to reflect quarterly movements in the 13 week Treasury Note rate  calculated daily on a compounding basis  tax deductible. Operational context for the removal of the LPP by the ATO The tax environment in the early nineties was considered to be overly complex, a function of a number of contributing factors including:  Each tax product was developed in isolation  No consistency between products  Very difficult to administer  Different IT systems  Fiduciary duty role on the taxpayer. ATO operational experience There is no record of an evaluation of the changes that were implemented, but the general opinion of people who have been involved with the change is that it is consistent the expectations of the Small Business Deregulation Task Force recommendations. It is considered that some taxpayers are at times making a commercial decision to incur the General Interest Charge, rather than pay their tax liability. To mitigate the potential of providing an unfair advantage to compliant taxpayers a business viability assessment is conducted, and firmer actions, such as court action, is enacted if they are determined to be viable. Exploring alternatives to the late payment penalty scheme 16 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public The ATO has also implemented the Business Activity Statement (BAS) to increase the visibility and have a better understanding of the clients. This mitigates the situation when people are not communicating with the ATO, as they have an obligation to submit their BAS. This is especially true for entities that have a small turnover. With the introduction of the GIC, retrospective actions were difficult, and there were issues with situations where assessments involved time periods predating the introduction of the GIC. This meant that some people were disadvantaged under the new regime, so to mitigate this ATO introduced a short fall interest rate. To support this new regime there has been a change of emphasis from paying on time to on time lodgement (Filing) for the taxpayers, with an increase in the penalty associated with non-lodgement. To facilitate this, analytics are used to interrogate large data sets of non-lodgers, to determine who is seen in other parts of system as a having potential issues. Once likely candidates are identified they can be followed up.

Always use IR secure channels to update bank details
====================================================

**30 January 2019**

Inland Revenue is advising customers to always use its secure online services to update bank details and avoid scammers who target Kiwi taxpayers.

Automatic tax refunds are coming this year and in the last month two e-mail scams surfaced asking taxpayers to fill in a form to receive a refund owed to them.

IRD spokesperson Bernadette Newman says updated information is important but it should be done only through the department’s secure online channel – myIR.

“We do need that updated information ahead of major changes to the tax system scheduled from April. Having the right details means we can put refunds direct into customers bank accounts.

“For security and safety, it’s vital that’s done through our secure online channel. Anytime, anywhere – you can get it done with myIR.

“It makes checking and updating your information simpler, faster and more secure and avoids those scammers trying to rip off your refund.

“Once you’re registered you can update your details, check if you’re due a tax refund, look at your student loan details or working for Families tax credit details and review your KiwiSaver contributions.

“Business customers can manage GST, make payments by direct debit or using a credit/debit card and send attachments using secure e-mail.

“You can set myIR up on line – you just need your IRD number to register.

“There also the option to use Inland Revenue’s voice ID service which uses your unique voiceprint to quickly and securely confirm your identity. Once enrolled, you can change your details and reset your password for myIR. You'll no longer need to answer questions to prove who you are."

“Inland Revenue is serious about protecting your information and we use different measures and technologies to make sure only you can access your account,” says Bernadette Newman.

“Use our secure online services to give us the information we need to give you a refund. That way you, and not the scammers, will get the money.”

You may need to pay tax on prize money you win from sports events and competitions, even if your code lets you compete as an amateur.

Amateur sportspeople take part in a sport mainly for fun or fitness. Professional sportspeople do it for payment or financial reward.

You can be a professional for tax purposes even if your sporting code lets you compete as an amateur.

Amateur sportspeople
--------------------

If you are an amateur sportsperson, any prize money won is generally not taxable, regardless of the amount received, and you do not need to include this in your tax return.

For example, if you participate casually in competitions and win prize money that is not connected to your business or income-earning activity, you will have no tax consequences.

Professional sportspeople
-------------------------

If you’re a professional sportsperson for tax purposes, your tax return must include all the payments and prizes you receive. This includes:

*   appearance money
*   match fees
*   win bonuses
*   endorsements
*   contract payments
*   sponsorships
*   grants
*   prize money
*   prizes other than money
*   speaking endorsements
*   book sales
*   testimonials and benefit matches.

You will need to pay income tax on any payments and prizes you receive. You might also need to pay goods and services tax (GST).

How you pay income tax depends on whether you’re an employee or self-employed.

### If you’re an employee with salary or wages from sports

If you’re an employee who gets a salary or wages from sports, your tax (and the ACC earners’ levy) will be deducted before you get your pay.

Any amounts that have not had tax deducted from them must be included as income in your tax return. For example, from prizes not paid by your employer. You are treated as a contractor for this portion of your income.

### If you’re self-employed or a contractor

If you receive prize money over $500 as a participant in a single event, withholding tax must be deducted from the part that’s over $500. You must declare the total prize money (including the first $500) in your tax return.

You must complete a Tax rate notification for contractors - IR330C form, listing the activity as ‘participants in sporting events’. If you do not complete an IR330C, your income will be taxed at the no-notification rate of 45%.

#### Claiming expenses

You can claim up to $500 in expenses against that prize money received per event. This covers expenses such as travel costs, accommodation, and entry fees. You do not need to provide receipts for this. If it costs you more than $500 to take part in an event, you may want to claim the actual and reasonable costs instead. To do this, you will need receipts for everything you’ve spent.

If you take part in an event and do not win prize money, you can take deductions for what it cost you to participate, as allowed under the ordinary deduction rules for businesses.    

There are special rules for expenses if you buy an item of significant value. For example, a triathlon bike worth $12,000 will have to be depreciated over 3 years.

[Types of business expenses](/income-tax/income-tax-for-businesses-and-organisations/types-of-business-expenses)

#### Repaying expenses

If your club repays you the amount of your actual expenses, they do not deduct tax from it.

If they pay above your actual expenses, the excess amount will be paid as a schedular payment. Your club will deduct tax from it at 33%.

This also applies to repayments from other types of sporting organisations, including directly from a sponsor.

### International sportspeople

If you have come to New Zealand to play sport, you will need to decide if you are a New Zealand resident for tax purposes.

You will also need to decide if you are a resident for tax purposes if you live in New Zealand but compete overseas.

[International tax for individuals](/international-tax/individuals)

### Goods and services tax (GST)

If you received $60,000 or more in payments or prizes, you will need to register for GST. You may also register voluntarily if you earn less than this.

Amendments to Child Support Amendment Act 2013
==============================================

2013 amendments to Child Support Act covering 'income amount order' and taxable income, the definition of 'receiving carer', income adjustment and more.

_Sections 110B to 110H of the Child Support Amendment Act 2013_

A small number of technical and remedial amendments have been made to the Child Support Amendment Act 2013 to correct errors, clarify provisions and to include additional consequential changes.

### Background

Parliament enacted changes to the Child Support Act 1991 in April 2013 through the Child Support Amendment Act 2013. The key features of the Child Support Amendment Act 2013 are set out in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 25, No 5, June 2013.

### Key features

An estimate of taxable income may not be accepted or revoked if an "income amount order" is in force. The definition of "income amount order" has been updated as a result of amendments to section 106 of the Child Support Act 1991, which identifies the orders that a court may make. The updated definition reflects that a receiving parent will also be able to make an estimate of taxable income. An "income amount order" is now defined as a determination or an order that substitutes a new child support income amount, an amount of taxable income or adjusted taxable income, or an annual amount of child support.

New section 4A(1) and new section 8(1) have been amended to clarify that a parent or carer cannot apply for a formula assessment of child support if they are living in a marriage, civil union or de facto relationship with the parent from whom payment of child support is sought. Where there are more than two legal parents of the child, and two of these parents are living together in a marriage, civil union or de facto relationship (for example, the applicant and a legal step-parent) an application for formula assessment can still be made, as long as the parent making the application is not in a relationship with the parent from whom payment is sought.

New section 17 defines a parent to be a receiving carer if their care cost percentage is greater than their income percentage, and a parent to be a liable parent if their income percentage is greater than or equal to their care cost percentage. The policy intent is for a parent with a zero care cost percentage and a zero income percentage to be liable for at least a minimum amount of child support, where there is a receiving carer providing at least 35% of ongoing care. Section 17 has been amended to ensure that a parent with 100% of the care costs of a child and 100% of the income is defined as a receiving carer, despite their income percentage being equal to their care cost percentage.

Amendments to new section 35 clarify the income to be used for assessing adjusted taxable income for a child support formula assessment as follows:

*   The use of adjustments made to taxable income, as set out in new subsection 35(1), will apply to assessments of child support for the child support year starting 1 April 2015 and later child support years. For assessments of child support for the child support year starting 1 April 2014, the calculation of adjusted taxable income will be based on taxable income, without making any adjustments of the sort referred to in subsection 35(1).
*   The most recent tax year will be reviewed when determining if a person's taxable income was derived only from withholding income and the person has no adjustments of the sort referred to in subsection 35(1). If, in the most recent tax year, the person meets these two criteria, their taxable income will be taken to be their employment income for the calendar year immediately preceding the start of the child support year.
*   If the person does not meet the two criteria referred to above, their taxable income for a child support year must be their taxable income in the tax year immediately preceding the most recent tax year, including the inflation percentage for the child support year. Likewise, the adjustments under section 35(1) that must be applied are those that relate to the tax year immediately preceding the most recent tax year.
*   Additional consequential amendments have been made to the definition of "last relevant tax year".

Additional consequential amendments to Part 6A and section 103B of the Child Support Act 1991 have been made to reflect that under a formula assessment for child support there can now be more than two parties affected.

### Application date

The changes apply from 17 July 2013.

Amendments to disputes rules
============================

2006 amendments clarify and correct changes to the disputes resolution rule amendments in the Taxation (Venture Capital and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004.

### Sections 3, 89C, 89D, 89K, 89N and 89O of the Tax Administration Act 1994

A number of minor remedial amendments have been made to the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). The amendments clarify and correct changes to the disputes resolution rule amendments in the Taxation (Venture Capital and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004 (the amending Act).

### Two-month response period to a notice of disputable decision

Section 3 contains a definition of "response period" within which parties to a dispute must produce the relevant document. The two-month response period for taxpayers to issue a notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA) to their self-assessment or the Commissioner's assessment was changed in the amending Act to four months. However, the response period for a taxpayer to issue a NOPA to a disputable decision that is not a notice of assessment remained at two months.

For consistency, the two-month period for a taxpayer to issue a NOPA to a notice of disputable decision has been changed to four months. A change was recommended by the Finance and Expenditure Select Committee to ensure that the move to a four-month response period is limited to situations when a NOPA is issued under the disputes resolution process. The two-month response period to initiate challenge proceedings remains.

The amendment applies from 1 April 2005, the date the new disputes rules took effect.

### Commissioner may issue an assessment without first issuing a NOPA

Section 89C allows the Commissioner to issue an assessment without first issuing a NOPA in certain circumstances. Section 89C(db), introduced in the amending Act, provides for one such circumstance as being where the assessment is made in respect of facts and law which are identical to a previous assessment of the taxpayer "…for another income year…".

The amendment ensures that this exclusion applies to previous GST return periods as well as income years.

The amendment applies from the date of enactment, 3 April 2006.

### Suspension of the dispute in a test case

The amending Act introduced a new section 89O to allow for the suspension of a dispute following the outcome of a test case. The suspension may be agreed in relation to a dispute between the Commissioner and a taxpayer if the Commissioner has designated a case involving another taxpayer as a test case. Any applicable time bars are put on hold until the outcome of the test case.

The period of the suspension starts from the date of the agreement and ends on the earliest of:

*   the date of the court's decision in the test case; or
*   the date on which the test case or the dispute is otherwise resolved.

A further provision describes the period of time within which the Commissioner must make the assessment. The period could require the Commissioner to issue the assessment on the date of the relevant decision. Practically, it will not be possible to issue the assessment if the period from the application to the time bar is not included in the time allowed for the suspension.

The change to section 89O clarifies that the period starting on the date of the agreement (made within the time bar) is in addition to the period within which the Commissioner must make the assessment (the four-year time bar). If the agreement to suspend the dispute is reached shortly before the application of the time bar, the amendment allows a further 60 days to issue the assessment.

The amendment applies from the date of enactment, 3 April 2006.

### Application to High Court to issue an assessment without completing the disputes process

Section 89N applies in situations where the Commissioner applies to the High Court for an order to allow more time to complete the disputes process, or issue an assessment without completion of the disputes process.

The period of time is the total of the four-year time bar, and the period of time that starts on the date of the application (made within the time bar) and ends on the earliest of the date of the court's decision, the date on which the application or dispute is otherwise resolved. The period could require that the Commissioner issue the assessment on the date the relevant decision is made, rather than also allowing the time from the date of the application to the time bar to be included in the total time of the suspension.

The amendment clarifies that the period starting on the date of the application is in addition to the period within which the Commissioner must make the assessment (the four-year time bar).

The amendment applies from the date of enactment, 3 April 2006.

### Request for information under a statute

Section 89N(1)(c)(vi) enables the Commissioner to issue an assessment without completing the disputes process when the disputant has failed to comply with an information request.

The provision of information is generally required by the Commissioner under the TAA. The amendment replaces all references to the word "request" with the word "require" in the provision, allowing the Commissioner to issue an assessment without completing the disputes process.

The amendment applies from the date of enactment, 3 April 2006.

### Cross-reference correction

Under the previous rules, section 89D(2C) provides that if the Commissioner has made a GST assessment for a taxpayer, the taxpayer can dispute the assessment only if they provide a return for the relevant GST-return period. The new amendment now provides that the general requirement in section 16(3) of the GST Act for a return to contain a notice of assessment does not apply in this case.

The amendment applies from the date of enactment, 3 April 2006.

### Drafting

Section 89K(1)(a) has been re-drafted to correct duplicating amendments made by the earlier Taxation (Venture Capital and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004. The amendment applies to disputes commenced on and after 1 April 2005.

Amendments to make taxation of controlled foreign companies more symmetric
==========================================================================

2012 amendment to CFC rules addresses situation where income is being taxed while deductions for related expenditure are not being allowed.

_Sections DN 4, DN 8, DZ 19, EX 18A, EX 20C, EX 20D, EX 21B, EX 73, EZ 32C, EZ 32D, IQ 2 and YA 1 ("election commencement year", "elective attributing CFC", "elective attributing FIF")  of the Income Tax Act 2007, and sections 21, 37 and 44 of the Taxation (Tax Administration and Remedial Matters) Act 2011_

The controlled foreign company (CFC) rules were extensively reformed in 2009. A New Zealand resident with an income interest of more than 10% in a controlled foreign company is taxed on the passive profits earned by that company. Passive profits comprise passive income, such as interest and royalties, and deductions for related expenditure. To reduce compliance costs, there is also an "active business test": a CFC's profits are not taxed if the CFC's gross passive income is less than 5% of its total income.

In some cases the reformed rules are not working as they should, and income is being taxed while deductions for related expenditure are not being allowed. In particular:

*   Some CFCs that take out foreign currency loans to finance their active businesses are being taxed on foreign exchange gains on those loans, but are not allowed deductions if there are foreign exchange losses.
*   Some CFCs that incur expenditure in a year when they pass the active business test, to earn passive income in another year, are being taxed on the passive income but are not receiving deductions for the related expenditure.

The Taxation (Annual Rates, Returns Filing, and Remedial Matters) Act addresses these problems.

### Key features

When a CFC borrows money to fund its business, income from the loan will normally be taxable only if deductions would be allowed for expenditure on the loan. (Income from a loan would most commonly be an exchange rate gain on a foreign-currency loan.)

A taxpayer may elect not to apply the active business test to a CFC, to enable more deductions to be claimed for expenditure incurred in earning passive income. Restrictions apply to the use of deductions when an election has been made.

### Detailed analysis

#### Section DN 4

Section DN 4 restricts the use of an attributed loss of a CFC when the CFC is an "elective attributing CFC". A CFC is an elective attributing CFC when the taxpayer has elected not to apply the active business test to the CFC under section EX 73. The first year that an election applies in respect of a CFC is called the CFC's "election commencement year".

The policy principle underlying the legislation is that losses of an elective attributing CFC are tagged with the name of the CFC and the CFC's election commencement year.

The tagged losses may be used to reduce attributed CFC income, but only if the income comes from the same CFC which is still an elective attributing CFC (or FIF), or another elective attributing CFC (or FIF) with the same election commencement year. This condition applies in addition to the other, existing conditions for use of losses, such as jurisdictional ring-fencing.

Unused tagged losses of a CFC are forfeited if the election made in respect of the CFC expires or is revoked.

A new subsection (1B) has been added to section DN 4, to restrict the use of losses of elective attributing CFCs, in the way just described. Subsection (1) has also been rewritten to apply only to losses that are not from elective attributing CFCs; the effect of the rewritten provision is not intended to be different in any other respect from the original.

##### Example - loss of elective attributing CFC

A taxpayer has the following amounts of attributed CFC income and loss for the 2015-16 income year:  
CFC A (United States), loss of $80 million  
CFC B (United States), income of $60 million  
CFC C (United States), income of $20 million  
CFC D (United States), income of $10 million  
CFC E (United States), loss of $35 million  
CFC F (Austria), income of $50 million.

CFC A, CFC B and CFC F are elective attributing CFCs and all have an election commencement year of 2013-14. CFC D is an elective attributing CFC and has an election commencement year of 2014-15. CFC C and CFC E are not elective attributing CFCs.

Subsection (1B) allows the taxpayer to use $60 million of CFC A's loss, because CFC A and CFC B have the same election commencement year and there is $60 million of attributed CFC income from CFC B.

CFC A's loss may not be used to reduce CFC C's income (because CFC C is not an elective attributing CFC), CFC D's income (because CFC D has a different election commencement year), or CFC F's income (because CFC F is not resident in the United States).

The remaining $20 million of CFC A's loss cannot be used under section DN 4 and must instead be used under subpart IQ.

Subsection (1) allows the taxpayer to use $30 million of CFC E's losses, because CFC E is not an elective attributing CFC, CFC C and CFC D are resident in the United States and the combined income of CFC C and CFC D is $30 million.

The remaining $5 million of CFC E's losses cannot be used to reduce income from CFC F because CFC F is not a United States company, and must instead be used under subpart IQ.

#### Section DN 8

Section DN 8 makes changes having the same effect as the changes to section DN 4, except that they apply to FIF losses rather than attributed CFC losses.

#### Section DZ 19

Section DZ 19 has been repealed retrospectively. It was a temporary measure and has been replaced by other measures in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Returns Filing, and Remedial Matters) Act. (See changes to section EX 20C.)

#### Section EX 18A

Section EX 18A has been amended so that the taxpayer will calculate attributed CFC income or loss for a CFC if the CFC is an elective attributing CFC for the taxpayer.

The attribution calculation will be undertaken even if the CFC would otherwise be a non-attributing active CFC under section EX 21B.

#### Section EX 20C

Section EX 20C has been rewritten to change the tax treatment of a CFC's income from a loan that provides funds to the CFC. Income from a loan would typically be the result of an exchange rate gain on a foreign-currency loan.

In most cases, such income will be included in attributable income only to the extent that expenditure or loss relating to the loan would have been included (if there were any). That is, there will generally be symmetry between included income and included expenditure. Previously, the income was included completely.

The rewording of the section is not intended to have any other effects.

_Subsection EX 20C(2)_

Subsection EX 20C(2) contains the formula for net attributable CFC income or loss:  
_attributable CFC \- apportioned funding income \- apportioned funding costs \- other deductions_

"Attributable CFC" less "apportioned funding income" is, generally speaking, the gross taxable income of the CFC. "Attributable CFC" is calculated in the same way as it has always been, but the subtraction of "apportioned funding income" is new.

"Apportioned funding costs" and "other deductions" are, generally speaking, tax deductions of the CFC. They are calculated in the same way as they have always been, although some of the terminology in the relevant subsections has changed.

_Subsection EX 20C(3)_

Subsection EX 20C(3) defines apportioned funding income, which will not be attributed. Ordinarily, apportioned funding income will be determined by the formula:  
_funding income x funding fraction x (1 \- asset fraction)_

These terms are defined in more detail in subsections (5), (6) and (8).

In broad terms, "funding income x funding fraction" is the amount of income from loans the CFC has taken out, after adjusting for any on-lending.

Multiplication by _1 - asset fraction_ determines the portion of the income that relates to funding of active assets. This portion of the funding income is not taxable. In the same way, expenditure on the loan would be non-deductible if it related to the funding of active assets.

If a CFC is carrying on a business of banking or insurance or is directly or indirectly controlled by someone who is, there is no apportioned funding income.

_Subsection EX 20C(5)_

Subsection EX 20C(5) defines funding income, which appears in the equation in subsection (3). Funding income is income from a financial arrangement that provides funds to the CFC - income from a loan the CFC has taken out, in other words.

There will not normally be income from a loan, but there can be if, for instance, the loan is in a foreign currency and there is an exchange rate gain on conversion to New Zealand dollars.

Note that only income from financial arrangements is included. Contrast this with paragraph EX 20C(7)(a), which includes certain equity instruments as well as financial arrangements. The underlying assumption here is that a CFC will not have accrual income from equity instruments it has issued, though it may have deductible expenditure in some cases.

Paragraph (b) prevents income from being funding income if the financial arrangement is _expected_ to generate income. A key characteristic of a loan taken out is that it will result in expenditure, not income, over its term. If income is expected, it will be attributed.

Exchange rates can vary significantly, and it is quite likely that there will be income in at least one year of a long-term financial arrangement, even though it is not clear which year. The test in paragraph (b) is not intended to catch such a case. Rather, the test is intended to catch cases in which net income is reasonably expected over a particular period that is predictable in advance, such as the entire term of the arrangement or a specific sub-period of the term.

The test is applied when the CFC enters the arrangement and again if the terms of the financial arrangement are altered. It is an objective test. The intentions or expectations of the parties may be relevant, but it is a hypothetical reasonable person's expectations that are being evaluated.

_Subsection EX 20C(6)_

Subsection EX 20C(6) calculates the item "funding fraction". Funding fraction adjusts the amount of funding income to remove the effects of on-lending. That is, it makes an adjustment if the CFC has provided funding - implicitly out of the CFC's own borrowings - to an associated CFC.

The funding fraction is the proportion of funding which is _not_ implicitly on-lent.

It is compulsory to make the adjustment for on-lending when apportioned funding income is being calculated.

"Funding fraction" also applies in the calculation of apportioned funding costs, but in that case it is optional to make an adjustment for on-lending.

The difference between the cases of income and cost is due to incentives.

In the case of apportioned funding costs, there is an incentive to adjust for on-lending. This will often increase the amount of expenditure that is fully deductible. However, taxpayers are given the option to forego the advantages of adjustment if, say, the calculations would be too costly. The risk that tax revenue will be undermined as a result of this choice is limited.

In contrast, in the case of apportioned funding income, the incentive is _not_ to adjust for on-lending, because that will make more of the funding income tax-free. This would significantly increase the risks of tax revenue being undermined, particularly if choices were made to adjust for on-lending in the case of costs but not in the case of income.

Taxpayers can voluntarily avoid different outcomes for costs and income by adjusting for on-lending in both cases.

##### Example - calculation of funding fraction

A CFC has taken out a $25 million interest-only loan to fund its active business.

In 2013-14 the CFC has $10 million of funding income. Paragraph EX 20C(6)(c) gives a funding fraction of 1, because there is no on-lending (the item "group funding" is nil).

In 2014-15 the CFC lends $15 million, also on interest-only terms, to an associated CFC.

In 2015-16 the CFC has $10 million of funding costs and the CFC's New Zealand owner decides to rely on paragraph EX 20C(6)(b) to reduce compliance costs. "Funding fraction" is 1.

In 2016-17 the CFC has $10 million of funding income. "Funding fraction" is 0.4.

_Subsection EX 20C(8)_

Subsection EX 20C(8) calculates the item "asset fraction", which is the fraction of the CFC's assets that generate (gross) attributable income. On-lent amounts (see subsection (7)) are excluded from the calculation if they were excluded in subsection (6), and not otherwise.

A similar fraction is used for calculating apportioned funding costs. However, in that case the fraction is modified if the CFC is excessively debt funded, so that the deductions of an excessively debt funded CFC would be more limited than those of another CFC. The intention of the excessive debt-funding limitation is to discourage excessive debt funding. It would be inconsistent with this intention to also limit the taxation of any income arising from the debt.

##### Example - calculation of "asset fraction"

In 2015-16 a CFC takes out a $10 million interest-only loan to fund its business. There is no on-lending.

There is $1 million of income from the loan, owing to an exchange rate gain exceeding interest expense.

By value, 80% of the CFC's assets are used to derive an attributable CFC amount (passive income) and not to derive an amount that is not an attributable CFC amount. The asset fraction is therefore 0.8. The amount which can be subtracted as apportioned funding income is $200,000 and $800,000 remains attributable.

Suppose that instead there was $1 million of expenditure on the loan, and that the CFC is excessively debt-funded under section EX 20D with a cost fraction of 0.3. The cost fraction of 0.3 would be used to calculate the apportioned funding costs. Deductions of $300,000 would be attributed and $700,000 would be ignored.

#### Section EX 20D

Section EX 20D has been amended consequential to the changes made to section EX 20C.

#### Section EX 21B

Section EX 21B has been amended so that no active business test is carried out for a CFC when the CFC is an elective attributing CFC for the taxpayer.

#### Section EX 73

Section EX 73 is a new provision allowing the taxpayer to make an election. The taxpayer may elect not to apply the active business test to a CFC in which they have an income interest of 10% or more or to a FIF for which they use the attributable FIF income method.

_Subsection EX 73(1)_

A taxpayer may elect that a CFC or FIF in which they hold an income interest is an "elective attributing CFC" or "elective attributing FIF" (terms which are defined in section YA 1). The active business test in section EX 21B is not applied to such a CFC or FIF, and there is a full calculation of attributable income.

The election may be made only if the active business test would be applied; that is, only if it is for a CFC in which the person has a 10% or greater income interest, or for a FIF for which the attributed FIF income method is used.

_Subsection EX 73(2)_

A CFC or FIF may not be an elective attributing CFC or FIF if it carries on a business of banking or insurance or is controlled by somebody who does. Such entities are in any case extremely unlikely to be non-attributing active CFCs.

In addition, a CFC may not be an elective attributing CFC if it qualifies for the Australian exemption in section EX 22.

_Subsections EX 73(3) and (4)_

An election under section EX 73 is normally effective from the beginning of the income year following the notice of election. That is, elections must be prospective. This is to minimise the likelihood of elections being made only in cases in which a loss arises.

There are two exceptions to this general rule.

First, because section EX 73 applies for income years beginning on or after 1 July 2009, it is possible to make a retrospective election. A retrospective election must be made by the end of the income year in which the Taxation (Annual Rates, Returns Filing, and Remedial Matters) Act received Royal assent, or at a later time if Inland Revenue allows it. The expectation is that Inland Revenue would allow a late election only in extraordinary circumstances, such as when the taxpayer's income year ends very soon after the date of Royal assent (2 November 2012). When made, the election applies from the beginning of the first income year beginning on or after 1 July 2009, for a CFC or 1 July 2011, for a FIF.

Secondly, Inland Revenue has some general discretion to allow a late election. The expectation is that this general discretion would be rarely used, such as when a late election was due to factors beyond the taxpayer's control, and not in circumstances in which the election was made merely because a loss actually arose during the year.

_Subsections EX 73(5) to (8)_

An election under section EX 73, once it applies, is effective until it is revoked or expires. If it is revoked by the taxpayer or it expires, it ceases to be effective from the beginning of the income year in which it is revoked or expires.

In general, it is not intended that taxpayers will revoke elections. The concern here is that an election will be revoked after attributed deductions have been taken but before the related attributable income arises, leading to under-taxation.

However, revocation is possible if it is extremely unlikely that any related attributable income will arise after the revocation. For instance, revocation might be allowed if deductions were taken for exchange rate losses on a bank deposit, and the deposit was subsequently withdrawn and paid out as a dividend. In such a case, it is extremely unlikely that any more attributable income would arise from the deposit. For the revocation to be effective, it must not be made for a purpose or effect of reducing a tax liability, and Inland Revenue must agree to the revocation in writing.

With two exceptions, an election expires automatically if the CFC ceases to be a CFC in which the taxpayer holds an income interest of 10% or more or if the FIF ceases to be a FIF for which the taxpayer uses the attributable FIF income method. Note that a FIF that qualifies for the Australian exemption in section EX 35 is no longer a FIF for which the attributable FIF income method is used, which will trigger expiry of the election. Other exemptions from the FIF rules will have the same effect.

The first exception occurs when a CFC in which the taxpayer holds an interest of 10% or more becomes a FIF for which the taxpayer uses the attributable FIF income method (for instance, if the taxpayer maintains a holding of 20% in the foreign company but an unrelated - acquires the remaining 80% interest). In that case, the election continues to be effective but is treated as having been made for the FIF. The election commencement date is unchanged.

The second exception occurs in the reverse case, when a FIF for which the taxpayer uses the attributable FIF income method becomes a CFC in which the taxpayer has an income interest of more than 10% and which is not a non-attributing Australian CFC. Again, the election continues to be effective, but is treated as having been made for the CFC with no change to the election commencement date.

The election also expires automatically if the foreign company carries on a business of banking or insurance or is controlled by someone who does, or if a CFC becomes eligible for the Australian exemption in section EX 22.

_Subsection EX 73(9)_

Any CFC or FIF losses attributed to a taxpayer who was subject to an election under section EX 73 for the CFC or FIF, and have been carried forward under subpart IQ, are forfeited when the election is revoked or expires. The relevant losses (those implicitly tagged with the name of the CFC or FIF and an election year) are not carried forward from the previous year into the year in which the revocation or expiry is effective.

Any losses arising from the CFC or FIF in the year that an election ceases to be effective are either normal attributed losses under sections DN 4 or DN 8, if the losses are required to be attributed, or are not recognised at all.

##### Example - effect of revoking an election

In 2013-14 a taxpayer makes an election under section EX 73 in respect of a CFC. There is an attributed loss of $1.3 million in 2014-15, which is carried forward under subpart IQ. In 2015-16 there is attributed income of $0.6 million, which reduces the carried forward loss to $0.7 million. In 2016-17 an attributed loss of $0.4 million would be calculated.

Suppose that in 2016-17 the taxpayer sets up a banking business, so that the election expires. The remaining $0.7 million of historical losses are not carried forward to 2016-17. However, the attributed loss of $0.4 million is recognised as an ordinary attributed loss and may be used under section DN 4, including by carrying it forward under subpart IQ via section DN 4(3).

Suppose instead that in 2016-17 the CFC becomes Australian-resident and qualifies for the exemption in section EX 22. The remaining $0.7 million of historical losses are not carried forward to 2016-17, and the $0.4 million current-year loss is ignored.

When one of the exceptions in paragraphs EX 73(7)(a) or (b) applies, the tagged losses of the elective attributing CFC or FIF become tagged losses of the elective attributing FIF or CFC respectively, with no change to the date they were incurred. This is to ensure that if the election does subsequently expire, all losses - whether arising before or after the change from CFC to FIF (or vice versa) - are forfeited.

_Subsection EX 73(10)_

After an election is revoked or expired, it will usually not be possible to make another election in respect of the CFC or FIF. This is to prevent CFCs or FIFs from entering and exiting the tax system in a way that would result in recognition of deductions and non-recognition of related income.

However, following expiry another election may be made if certain conditions are met, and if Inland Revenue agrees to the new election. The expiry must have been due to an oversight, and notice of the new election must be made within a reasonable period.

More importantly, the new election must not be made with a purpose of allowing deductions to be attributed - at any time - without the attribution of corresponding income - also at any time.

It is not expected that Inland Revenue would agree to a new election in many cases, but there could be unusual cases in which it would be appropriate to be able to make a second election.

##### Example - a second election

In 2013-14 a taxpayer makes an election under section EX 73 in respect of a CFC.

In 2016-17 the directors of the CFC hold some board meetings in New Zealand while participating in trade shows here. They are unaware of the tax consequences of these meetings, one of which is that the CFC becomes a New Zealand resident. However, this is an isolated occurrence and the company ceases to be New Zealand-resident soon after. There is no real change in the activities or balance sheet of the company over its period of residence.

In 2017-18 the taxpayer asks to make a second election in respect of the CFC under section EX 73.

In deciding whether to agree to an election, Inland Revenue might take into account that: any losses attributed while the first election was active were forfeited; the company was subject to full taxation during its period of New Zealand residence; there was no obvious change in the business of the CFC or its assets or liabilities while it was resident; and the directors were unaware of the tax consequences of the New Zealand meetings.

_Subsection EX 73(11)_

Subsection EX 73(11) is an anti-avoidance provision, to prevent multiple elections and revocations or expiries by the transfer of a CFC interest between associated persons.

If a person has made an election in respect of a CFC or FIF and the election has expired or been revoked, an associated person will not be able to make an election in respect of that foreign company unless Inland Revenue agrees. Inland Revenue must be satisfied that the election has not been made with a purpose of allowing deductions to be attributed without the attribution of corresponding income.

There may be cases in which associated persons quite legitimately make elections in relation to a single CFC. It seems more likely that these would involve individuals rather than companies.

##### Example - election by an associated person

A parent makes and revokes an election for a CFC and then, on retirement many years later, transfers the CFC interest to an adult child who was previously not involved in the investment.

Acting completely independently, the adult child wishes to make an election for the CFC, and satisfies Inland Revenue that this will not lead to deductions being attributed when corresponding income is not.

_Subsection EX 73(12)_

Notices of election or revocation under section EX 73 must be made in writing, and provided to Inland Revenue using the prescribed form and by the prescribed means. The current procedure is to send a letter with the relevant details in it to [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2645494b564352434852084753524e49544f525f664f5442084149505208485c)
. For an initial election, the CFC or FIF in question should be identified, as should the period for which the election is made. For revocations or elections for which agreement is sought, further information will be required to satisfy Inland Revenue that the relevant conditions are met.

#### Section EZ 32C

Section EZ 32C, which was a temporary provision to allow certain exchange rate losses and gains of CFCs to be offset, has been repealed with retrospective effect. It has effectively been made redundant in any case by the addition of the item "apportioned funding income" to section EX 20C(2).

The effect of the retrospective repeal is that section EZ 32C never applies.

#### Section EZ 32D

Section EZ 32D is a transitional provision for CFCs that have income from borrowed funds. As a result of changes discussed above, income from such borrowed funds may be subtracted from attributable income under section EX 20C(2).

However, in calculating the amount of income to be subtracted, usually no account is taken of excessive debt-funding of the CFC. This can lead to a higher proportion of income being attributed but a lower proportion of corresponding deductions being allowed. In most cases this is intentional and designed to discourage excessive debt-funding (see the discussion of amendments to section EX 20C(8) above.

There are some cases, though, in which existing loans were taken out before the new CFC rules came into force in 2009. Under the old CFC rules, it is probable that the income and deductions were treated similarly: either both completely within the tax base or both completely outside of it, regardless of the level of debt. To provide some continuity in such cases, a taxpayer who has taken out loans before 21 June 2012 may take excessive debt-funding into account for those loans.

To apply section EZ 32D, the taxpayer effectively undertakes two calculations under subsection EX 20C(3)(b)(ii) for the CFC and adds the results together, instead of undertaking a single calculation under that subsection.

The first calculation is for funding income that relates to old funding arrangements - those entered into before 21 June 2012. The calculation under subsection EX 20C(3)(b)(ii) has been modified so that excessive debt-funding is taken into account, by using the item "cost fraction" instead of the item "asset fraction".

The second calculation is for the remaining funding income, and uses the item "asset fraction" as normally.

##### Example - transitional rule for excessively debt-funded CFCs

A taxpayer has a CFC that took out a $100 million loan in 2007-08. The outstanding balance of the loan in 2013-14 is $65 million. The CFC takes out another loan in 2013-14 of $40 million.

In 2013-14 there is $6.5 million of funding income from the old loan and $4.0 million of funding income from the new loan. The CFC's asset fraction is 0.6 but the CFC is excessively debt-funded and its cost fraction under section EX 20D is 0.4. The CFC has not lent money to anybody.

Under section EZ 32D, apportioned funding income is calculated in two parts.

First, there is apportioned funding income from the old loan of $6.5 million x 1 x (1 - 0.4) = $3.9 million, because the excessive debt funding is taken into account and the cost fraction is used.

And secondly there is apportioned funding income from the new loan of $4.0 million x 1 x (1 - 0.6) = $1.6 million, because excessive debt funding is not taken into account and the asset fraction must be used.

The total amount of apportioned funding income, which will be subtracted in the attribution formula in section EX 20C(2), is $5.5 million.

#### Section IQ 2

Section IQ 2 has been amended to restrict the use of a CFC loss or a FIF loss when the CFC or FIF is an elective attributing CFC or FIF.

Subsection (1) has been rewritten to apply only to losses that are not from elective attributing CFCs or FIFs. The effect of the rewritten provision is not intended to be different in any other respect from the original.

Subsection (1BA) has been added to section IQ 2 to restrict the use of losses of an elective attributing CFC or FIF. The amount of loss that may be used to reduce an income tax liability is limited to the amount of attributed income from elective attributing CFCs or FIFs having the same election commencement year as the CFC or FIF. Subsection (1BA), like subsection (1), also requires that the income be from CFCs or FIFs resident in the jurisdiction where the CFC or FIF was resident when the losses arose.

##### Example - use of carried forward losses of elective attributing CFCs

A taxpayer wholly owns four CFCs:

CFC A, United States, elective attributing CFC, election commencement year is 2013-14  
CFC B, United States, elective attributing CFC, election commencement year is 2013-14  
CFC C, United States, not an elective attributing CFC  
CFC D, Portugal, elective attributing CFC, election commencement year is 2013-14

Losses are carried forward to 2014-15 under subpart IQ as follows:

Losses of elective attributing CFCs: $12 million (United States, CFC A, 2013-14)  
Other CFC losses: $3 million (United States)

And there is CFC attributed income for 2014-15:

CFC A, $7 million  
CFC B, $1 million  
CFC C, $5 million  
CFC D, $7 million

$8 million of the $12 million loss that came from CFC A may be used to reduce income, because CFC A and CFC B have the same election commencement year as CFC A, are resident in the United States, and generate combined attributed income of $8 million. The remaining $4 million of loss is carried forward as a loss of the elective attributing CFC to 2015-16.

The $3 million loss that is not a loss of an elective attributing CFC may be used entirely, because CFC C is resident in the United States and has income of $7 million.

(See the discussion of amendments to sections DN 4 and DN 8 for more background information.)

#### Section YA 1 (election commencement year, elective attributing CFC, elective attributing FIF)

Section YA 1 defines the terms "election commencement year", "elective attributing CFC" and "elective attributing FIF". Their use has been described above.

An elective attributing CFC (or FIF) is an elective attributing CFC (or FIF) only for an interest holder who has made an election under section EX 73. Another holder of an interest in the same CFC who has not made an election does not treat the CFC as an elective attributing CFC. Similarly, the election commencement year of a particular elective attributing CFC is the election commencement year only for the interest holder who made the election.

### Application date

The amendments apply for income years beginning on or after 1 July 2009, which corresponds with the application date for the reformed controlled foreign company rules.

Amendments to the exemption for insurance CFCs
==============================================

2012 legislative amendment relating to controlled foreign companies, the CIR's ability to impose conditions on a determination, and reinsurance claim income.

_Sections 91AAQ(5B) and 91AAQ(4)(b) of the Tax Administration Act 1994_

As part of the Taxation (International Tax, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Act 2009, an exemption was introduced for insurance CFCs as a transitional measure until further work was done to develop special rules for financial CFCs more generally.

To qualify for this exemption the insurance CFC must first have applied for and obtained a determination from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, and this determination must not have expired or been revoked. Section 91AAQ of the Tax Administration Act 1994 regulates this process.

#### Discretion for Commissioner to impose conditions on a determination

The Act inserts section 91AAQ(5B) which enables the Commissioner to stipulate conditions that must be satisfied in addition to the existing requirements for a CFC or CFC group member to qualify as a non-attributing active CFC. For example, a determination could be made conditional on the insurer informing the Commissioner of any significant changes to its organisational structure, funding or major business activities.

Note that the Commissioner already has the ability to revoke a previously issued determination.

#### Reinsurance claim income is disregarded

To be granted a determination that an insurance CFC is a non-attributing active CFC, the Commissioner must be satisfied that the CFC does not earn a significant amount of its income from activities unrelated to the provision of insurance services that cover risks in the CFC's jurisdiction.

This is achieved through subparagraph 91AAQ(4)(b) which requires the Commissioner to consider if the insurance business of the CFC or group of CFCs earns all or nearly all of its income from:

*   premiums from insurance contracts (excluding reinsurance premiums) that cover risks that arise in the country or territory of the business of the CFC; and
*   proceeds from investment assets, but only if those investment assets are commensurate with the value of the insurance contracts.

There are basically three ways that an insurance CFC could fail to satisfy these requirements:

*   if it earned a significant proportion of income unrelated to premiums or investment proceeds, for example, banking or sales income;
*   if it earned a significant proportion of income from reinsurance premiums, or from premiums derived from insurance contracts that cover risks from a jurisdiction that is different from the one in which the CFC's business is located. Reinsurance premium income is disregarded because reinsurance contracts may effectively be insuring an ultimate risk that is in a different jurisdiction from the one in which the CFC is located; and
*   if the CFC held a level of investment assets that was in excess of the level that comparable insurance businesses would generally hold and earned a significant proportion of its income from these excess assets.

The original provision failed to recognise that insurers can receive another type of income in the form of reinsurance claim income for liabilities which they have reinsured. Amounts from reinsurance claims could be significant in some years when adverse events arise.

It would not be sensible to deny a determination in such circumstances as this would discourage insurance CFCs from taking out reinsurance to spread their risk.

For this reason, subparagraph 91AAQ(4)(b) of the Tax Administration Act has been amended to exclude reinsurance claim income when considering the total income of the CFC. Note that reinsurance premium income is still included when considering the total income of the CFC.

[Remedial items](/new-legislation/act-articles/taxation-gst-and-remedial-matters-act-2010/remedial-items "Remedial items")

Amendments to the GST transitional rules
========================================

Minor amendments to the transitional rules in tax legislation accommodate the GST rate change that became effective from 1 Oct 2010.

_Sections 78(3) and 78AA of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 and section 139B of the Tax Administration Act 1994_

Minor amendments have been made to the transitional rules in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 to accommodate the GST rate change that became effective from 1 October 2010.

### Background

As part of changes to the tax system announced by the Government in Budget 2010, the rate of GST increased from 12.5% to 15% from 1 October 2010. To help businesses transition to the new rate, further changes to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act) and the Tax Administration Act 1994 were introduced in the Budget night legislation, and as part of the Taxation (Annual Rates, Trans-Tasman Savings Portability, KiwiSaver, and Remedial Matters) Act 2010 to supplement the transitional rules already provided in the GST Act.

### Key features

#### _Effect of the rate increase on prescribed fees and charges_

Section 78(3) of the GST Act allows prescribed government fees and charges to automatically increase to cover the additional increase to the tax. This removes the legal and administrative costs of government agencies having to amend the relevant Acts and regulations to accommodate changes to the GST rate. The section contains a proviso to ensure that government benefits are not automatically adjusted to reflect changes to the rate. As previously drafted, this proviso had the effect of possibly exempting public authorities from paying the automatic increase in GST on a government fee or charge unless the prescribed Act or regulation (which set the fee or charge) was specifically amended to reflect the new GST rate. The proviso was not intended to have this effect and therefore has been amended to ensure that public authorities, required to pay a fee or charge set under an Act or regulation, are not exempt from paying the increase in GST.

#### _Corrections to legislative provisions_

Two drafting omissions in the transitional provisions, enacted as part of the Taxation (Annual Rates, Trans-Tasman Savings Portability, KiwiSaver, and Remedial Matters) Act 2010, have been corrected. Section 78AA(5) has been amended to correct an error in the description of the supplies to which the finance lease provisions apply. Section 78AA(12) has also been amended to insert a missing cross-reference.

The notification requirement in the finance lease transitional rules (section 78AA(4)(g)) has not been changed to align with the change made to section 78AA(5). A change to this section was considered undesirable, given the 30-day notification period had elapsed and the finance lease rules operate prospectively in respect of the 1 October 2010 rate change. Such a change could have had the effect of invalidating notices that had already been issued.

#### _Reinstatement of late payment grace period_

Section 139B of the Tax Administration Act was amended by the Taxation (Budget Measures) Act 2010 to enable a taxpayer's late payment grace period to be reinstated if the cause of the late payment was due to the GST rate change. The Budget night amendments, however, had the effect of only allowing reinstatement if penalties were remitted. Section 139B has, therefore, been further amended to ensure that remissions of interest attributable to the rate change can also be taken into account when reinstating a taxpayer's late payment grace period.

### Application dates

The amendments to sections 78(3) of the GST Act and 139B of the Tax Administration Act apply from 1 October 2010, the date of the GST rate change.

The amendments to section 78AA of the GST Act apply from 7 September 2010, the date those transitional rules were enacted.

Amendments to the life insurance taxation rules granting transitional relief
============================================================================

2010 changes to the rules for taxing life insurance business affect the scope of the grandparenting provisions applicable to life policies sold prior to the rules.

A number of changes have been made to the new rules for taxing life insurance business that were enacted as part of the Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Act 2009.

The changes made by the Taxation (Trans-Tasman Savings Portability, KiwiSaver, and Remedial Matters) Act 2010 affect the scope of the grandparenting provisions applicable to life policies, particularly workplace group policies, sold before the start of the new taxation rules. Remedial amendments have also been made to ensure that the new rules achieve their intended policy effect.

### Background

The Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Act 2009 significantly changed the taxation rules applicable to life insurance business. The new rules are designed to tax the income from term life business so that life insurance companies pay tax on their profits, like any other New Zealand business.

The new rules also contained a comprehensive set of transitional provisions that preserve the previous income treatment of life insurance policies sold before the application date.

In response to submissions received on the Taxation (Annual Rates, Trans-Tasman Savings Portability, KiwiSaver, and Remedial Matters) Bill, the Finance and Expenditure Committee recommended a number of technical amendments to the new rules.

### Key features

The main amendments to the new taxation rules for life insurance affect the scope of the transitional rules. Other changes have been made to correct technical problems identified with the new rules. The amendments are consistent with the policy intent of the new taxation rules for life insurance business.

### Detailed analysis

#### Grandparenting of life policies

Section EY 30 provides that policies contracted under the previous rules are grandparented and subject to transitional rules for a specified period. The application of the previous life rules is therefore preserved, for a limited period, for term policies sold before the start of the new taxation rules for life insurance business. Several changes have been made to clarify the scope of the grandparenting rules.

##### Workplace group policies

A number of technical changes have been made to the definition of "workplace group policy" (section EY 30(15)).

*   The definition now includes workplace group policies that are:
    *   sponsored by trustees of superannuation schemes;
    *   broker-administered pool schemes; or
    *   group policies sponsored by industry associations.
*   The definition also extends the scope of the life cover provided under a workplace group policy and now includes:
    *   business owners or the directors of businesses; and
    *   spouses, civil union partners and de facto partners of employees or members covered by the workplace group policy.
*   The definition of "workplace group policy", in the context of policies sponsored by an employer, previously required that the policy was "compulsory" for the relevant class of employees. The context and application of the word "compulsory" was unclear. Section EY 30(15) has been changed so that the employer is required to offer the employee the opportunity to join the life insurance policy.
*   The requirement about the payment of premiums has also been clarified and allows the life insurer and the employer to reach an agreement about who pays the premium.
*   Voluntary top-ups in cover by individuals covered by the workplace group policies are included in with the scope of these changes.

##### Life policies with a mix of products

New section EY 30(1B) allows elements of a life policy that are capable of being sold separately to be given a different tax treatment if the grandparenting rules provide for a different treatment. For example, a life policy may contain both a level premium policy and a yearly renewable term (YRT) product. New section EY 30(1B) allows the life insurer to treat each life product which can be taken as a separate contract for life insurance, as a "policy" in its own right when calculating transitional relief. Any split or division of a life policy must be transparent to the policyholder, and the supporting policy documentation must clearly show that there is a separate price for each life product that forms part of the life insurance policy.

Previously, the transitional rules treated a life policy as the sum of all its parts. This meant that changes to a life policy that included a YRT product and a level premium product would not qualify for transitional relief if the YRT product ceased to meet the requirements in EY 30(2) or EY 30(5).

##### Multiple-life policies

Section EY 30(3) has been clarified to allow life insurers to "look though" to the underlying life insured and treat each life accordingly under the grandparenting rules. For example, a group policy that covers a husband and wife can be treated as two contracts for life cover. In the event that an increase in the individual's life cover results in a breach of section EY 30(3)(e), the other lives covered by the policy will remain unaffected unless they too breach section EY 30(3)(e).

Section EY 30(3) applies when the life insurer can look through the life policy to the individual lives covered. The word "can" in the context of section EY 30(3)(b) is directed at whether the life insurer's systems are able look through to the lives insured, taking into account the systems that are employed in the income year in which the transitional relief is claimed.

##### Life insurance policies

Section EY 30(2) has been redrafted following changes to the treatment of multiple-life policies in section EY 30(3). Changes to section EY 30(3) had the potential to limit transitional relief to multiple life policies if the life insurer's systems could not look through to the individual lives covered. Section EY 30(2) therefore acts a default rule. It is expected to apply to:

*   single life policies;
*   multiple-life polices (such as husband and wife policies) if the life cover for the individuals is not separately identified; and
*   life policies that are not credit card repayment insurance and workplace group policies.

New section EY 30(2)(d) ensures that the redrafted section is limited to lives covered before the start of the new taxation rules for life insurance.

##### Level-premium policies

Section EY 30(5) has been amended to take into account CPI adjustments that may be made to level-premium policies if such adjustments are an agreed part of the life policy before the grandparenting start day. These adjustments will not cause level-premium life policies to lose transitional relief under section EY 30.

##### Life reinsurance of credit card repayment insurance and workplace group policies

Sections EY 30(11) and EY 30(14) have been amended so that transitional relief for life reinsurance of workplace group policies or credit card repayment insurance is based on whether the underlying product is also grandparented.

##### Increases in life cover during an income year

At the insurer's election, new section EY 30(5B) allows transitional relief for a life policy up to the date that it breaches the grandparenting rules. The deduction calculated under section EY 30(7) can now include part-year amounts - section EY 5(6).

For example, a life insurer compares the level of cover at the beginning of year 2 with the cover at the beginning of year 1. If the level of cover breaches the tolerances in the grandparenting rules, transitional relief will ordinarily end at the beginning of year 1 (section EY 30(10) - meaning of "Cover review period"), unless the life insurer is able to identify the point in time when the breach occurred during year 1.

Consequential changes have been made to sections EY 30(2)(c), EY 30(3)(e), EY 30(7) and EY 30(8) to allow for the transitional relief part-year calculation.

##### No restoration for life policies that lose grandparenting status

New section EY 30(5C) ensures that life policies that no longer qualify under the grandparenting rules are not restored in the next or subsequent cover review period(s).

#### Other matters

In addition to the changes to the grandparenting rules, the following sections have been amended to clarify their application.

*   The application of sections CR 4 and DW 4 (outstanding claims reserve for general insurance contract) to life insurers has been clarified by inserting references to the definition of "premium" and "pay" in section YA 1. The term "general insurance contract" has also been removed and means that the treatment of insurance contracts set out in International Financial Reporting Standard 4 does not apply to general insurance contracts sold by life insurers. Instead, the reserving rules in section EY 24 apply.
*   In section EY 5(4) the transfer of life reinsurance connected with the sale of life business is clarified.
*   The provisions relating to the outstanding claims reserve (section EY 24(2)(a)(ii)), the premium smoothing reserve (section EY 25(2)(a)(ii)), the unearned premium reserve (section EY 26(2)(a)(ii)) and the capital guarantee reserve (section EY 27(2)(a)(ii)) have been amended to clarify how the opening balances for these reserves should be calculated for the first year in which the new rules apply.
*   The definition of "savings product policy" in section YA 1 excludes situations when all or a portion of a premium connected with life risk is refunded to the policyholder. This should ensure that the return of such amounts does not result in the policy being treated as a "savings product policy".
*   A grammatical error in section EY 30(4) has been corrected.

### Application date

The changes apply from 1 July 2010. Life insurers have the option to apply the rules from the beginning of their income year, if that year includes 1 July 2010.

Amendments to the PIE rules
===========================

2011 changes to the portfolio investment entity rules including to how prescribed investor rates for recent migrants are set to more accurately reflect their income.

**_Sections DB 23, CX 56, HL 10, HL 21, HM 5, HM 6, HM 12, HM 14, HM 21, HM 25, HM 36, HM 38, HM 45, HM 56, HM 57B, IC 3, LS 2, OK 6B and table O17 of the Income Tax Act 2007; sections HL 10, HL 20 and MK 4 of the Income Tax 2004; section 57B of the Tax Administration Act 1994_**

Several amendments have been made to the portfolio investment entity (PIE) rules to ensure they operate as originally intended. The most significant of these is a change to how prescribed investor rates for recent migrants are set to more accurately reflect their income.

### Application dates

The amendments apply from various dates as set out below.

### Detailed analysis

#### _Prescribed investor rates for recent migrants_

**_Sections CX 56, HM 57B and LS 2_**

Section HM 57B provides that a recent migrant, in calculating their prescribed investor rate (PIR), must take into account their non-resident foreign-source income. Previously, PIRs were generally based on the lower of a person's New Zealand taxable income in the past two income years. However, this drafting resulted in an inappropriate outcome. Recent migrants often have very little New Zealand taxable income prior to migration. Accordingly, recent migrants were generally able to select low PIRs in their initial years in New Zealand, regardless of their actual New Zealand income.  
  
Under the new rule, it is a recent migrant's net, not gross, world-wide income that is counted when determining their PIR. That is, if the person incurred expenditure in deriving their non-resident foreign-sourced income, those expenses should be subtracted from that income before determining the appropriate PIR.

In addition to taking account of non-resident foreign source income, section HM 57B(4) provides that a transitional resident must include income that has been exempted under section CW 27 when determining their PIR. This is appropriate as PIEs are able to invest into New Zealand.

This new rule applies when a person first becomes resident in New Zealand; however, it has an enduring effect. In subsequent years, when the investor determines their PIR, they must continue to include their worldwide income from years when they were not resident and disregard income exempted under section CW 27.

##### Example 1

For the purposes of this example, assume that the top PIR in all years is 28% and applies if a person's New Zealand taxable income is over $70,000.

Mike will move to New Zealand on 1 April 2012 from France. His net taxable income from France and New Zealand in different income years will be:

| Year | France | New Zealand |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2010-11 | NZ$100,000 | NZ$0 |
| 2011-12 | NZ$125,000 | NZ$0 |
| 2012-13 | NZ$125,000 | NZ$0 |
| 2013-14 | NZ$30,000 | NZ$50,000 |
| 2014-15 | NZ$30,000 | NZ$50,000 |

The NZ$30,000 Mike earns from France in 2012-13 and later years (ie, after his migration) is investment income. As Mike qualifies as a transitional resident, this income is exempt income in New Zealand. Mike has no other income.

In all of the income years from 2012-13 to 2014-15, Mike will have a PIR of 28%.

For the 2012-13 year, Mike's worldwide taxable income in the previous two income years was $100,000 and $125,000.

For the 2013-14 year, Mike's worldwide taxable income in the previous two income years was $125,000.

In determining Mike's PIR for the 2014-15 year, the lower of Mike's income in the previous two income years was from the 2013-14 year. Considering that year, Mike's New Zealand taxable income was only $50,000 as his $30,000 French income was exempt under section CW 27. However, for the purposes of determining his PIR, this exemption is ignored, resulting in a 28% PIR.

#### _Exception if income significantly different_

Under section HM 57B(3), a person who has moved to New Zealand can choose for this section to not apply in one, or both, of the income years in which they are first resident if they expect their New Zealand taxable income for that year to be significantly lower than it was before they migrated. This may occur, for example, if the person has educational qualifications that are not recognised in New Zealand.

If a person elects for this rule not to apply, their PIR will be determined as usual; that is, based on their New Zealand taxable income. However, section CX 56 will not apply to any PIE attributed income they derive. This means the person will have to include any PIE income in their own tax return, although they will receive a credit for any tax paid by the PIE on their behalf.

This new rule applies to PIR calculations for the 2012-13 and later income years for both new and existing migrants to New Zealand.

#### _Investment by charities into PIEs_

**_Section HM 21_**

Section HM 21 has been amended to allow registered charities to hold more than 20 percent of a PIE and be a PIE's only investor, provided the charity earns only tax exempt income under section CW 41 or 42. This amendment allows a charity to control a PIE.

On its face this amendment seems inconsistent with the general principle that a PIE should be widely-held. The rationale for this general rule is that it prevents a person from controlling a PIE and using it as their personal investment vehicle, which could provide a tax advantage compared to investing directly. However, there is no mischief in allowing a charity to control a PIE as the charity's income would be exempt whether the income was derived directly or through a PIE.

This amendment applies from 29 August 2011.

#### _Income from life insurance_

**_Sections HL 10, HM 12 and HL 10 of the Income Tax Act 2004_**

Section HM 12 has been amended to ensure that PIEs are able to derive income from life insurance policies. PIEs are restricted to earning only passive types of income, such as income from financial arrangements and dividends. Income from life insurance policies is another type of passive income; however, such income was inadvertently not included in the list of types of income that a PIE can derive.

This amendment applies from the beginning of the PIE regime, 1 October 2007. Accordingly, similar amendments have been made to section HL 10 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and 2007.

#### _Intra-group financing of land investment companies_

**_Section IC 3_**

Section IC 3 has been amended to provide that a PIE is able to group with wholly owned subsidiaries, provided the subsidiaries are:

*   multi-rate PIEs;
*   land investment companies;
*   a company that meets the requirements of section HM 7(a) and (d) (ie, a company that could be a PIE if it elected to be one); or
*   foreign PIE equivalents.

This amendment is intended to accommodate intra-group financing between land investment companies and PIEs in the same tax group. For example, a subsidiary company of a PIE could be set up to borrow money and on-lend it to another subsidiary company, with that second company using the money to purchase land. Under the amended rules both companies would generally be able to group with the PIE. Such grouping was generally not previously possible.

This amendment applies from 29 August 2011.

#### _Double counting of income_

**_Sections HL 21, HM 56 and HL 20 of the Income Tax Act 2004_**

Under the previous PIE rules it was possible for some of an individual's taxable income to be counted twice when calculating their PIR. This occurred if a person informed a PIE of a rate that was too low, resulting in the PIE income becoming taxable income. The amount was counted twice because PIRs are determined with reference to both a person's taxable income and their attributed PIE income. Accordingly, the person's attributed PIE income would have been counted as both attributed PIE income and taxable income, possibly resulting in an excessively high PIR for subsequent years.

Accordingly, section HM 56 has been amended to ensure that this double counting does not occur.

This amendment applies from the beginning of the PIE regime, 1 October 2007. Similar amendments have therefore been made to section HL 21 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section HL 20 of the Income Tax Act 2004.

#### _Conditional entitlements_

**_Section HM 38_**

Section HM 38 sets out the appropriate tax treatment of conditional employer contributions to superannuation funds. These are contributions made on behalf of employees, but where the employee only becomes entitled to them after a vesting period, which is normally a minimum period of employment. Previously, the interest earned on a conditional employer contribution is taxed at the employee's rate if the vesting period is no longer than five years. If it is longer, the interest is taxed at the PIE's tax rate until the vesting period is over.

Section HM 38 has been amended so that, if a vesting period is within the five-year period, the interest earned on conditional employer contributions is taxed at the employee's tax rate. This removes any tax disadvantage of having a vesting period longer than five years.

This amendment applies from the beginning of the 2012-13 income year.

#### _Other amendments_

The other amendments to the PIE rules are as follows:

*   Section DB 23 has been amended to ensure that revenue account investors in a PIE cannot inappropriately claim deductions for the cost of an investment if they are not taxed on the proceeds of that investment. This amendment applies from 29 August 2011.
*   Section HM 14 has been amended to remove the requirement that a multi-rate PIE that is listed have only one investor class. This amendment applies from the beginning of the 2010-11 income year.
*   Section HM 45 has been amended to clarify that a PIE is able to make a voluntary payment of tax at any time, even if an investor has not reduced the amount invested in the PIE. This amendment applies from 29 August 2011.
*   Section HM 25 has been amended to shift the date that a PIE loses its PIE status by 1 day, to make the current PIE rules consistent with the rules that applied prior to 1 April 2010. This amendment applies from the beginning of the 2010-11 income year.
*   Sections HM 5 and 6 have been amended to correct minor drafting errors, with effect from the beginning of the 2010-11 income year.
*   Section HM 36 has been amended to clarify the types of expense a PIE is able to deduct from the net income of its investments on behalf of its investors. This amendment applies from the beginning of the 2010-11 income year.
*   Section LS 2 is amended to ensure that investors in a PIE receive tax credits for tax paid on their behalf if their attributed PIE income is not excluded under section CX 56. This amendment applies from the beginning of the 2010-11 income year.
*   New section OK 6B is inserted and table O17 is modified to ensure that a Māori Authority receives a credit to its Māori Authority credit account when it is attributed imputation credits by a PIE. A similar amendment has been made to section MK 4 of the Income Tax Act 2004. These amendments apply from 1 October 2007.
*   Section 57B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 has been modified to provide that a PIE which performs its tax calculations quarterly does not need to provide an investment summary for an exiting investor until the next 30 June if the PIE has made a payment of tax on behalf of that investor. This amendment applies from 29 August 2011.

Amendments to the portfolio investment entity rules
===================================================

2009 amendments to the portfolio investment entity (PIE) rules address identified technical problems or amend the rules to cater for different circumstances.

_**Sections CX 55, CX 56, DV 2, DV 4(B), DV 5, DV 7, HL 4(1), HL 4(2), HL 5B(1), HL 6, HL 7, HL 9, HL 10(2), HL 12(1), HL 13, HL 29(7), IC 3, LA 6(1), LE 1, LS 1, LS 2, OB 9B and YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007; sections HL 4(1), HL 4(2), HL 10(2), HL 11B(1), HL 12, HL 27(7), ME 4(1) and OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004; sections 31B(1), 57B(3B), 57B(6) and 61(1C) of the Tax Administration Act 1994**_

A number of remedial amendments have been made to the tax rules for portfolio investment entities (PIEs). These amendments ensure that the rules achieve their intended policy effect.

### Background

New tax rules for collective investment vehicles that meet the definition of a "portfolio investment entity" (PIE) were enacted by the Taxation (Savings Investment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act in December 2006.

The PIE rules were designed to alleviate a number of long-standing problems with the taxation of collective investment vehicles. The rules treat investment through PIEs largely in the same way as direct investment by individuals, thus removing long-standing disadvantages of saving through collective investment vehicles, such as superannuation funds being taxed at a rate higher than investors in those funds with a lower marginal tax rate. These reforms were particularly important given the implementation of KiwiSaver in 2007.

PIEs are not taxable on realised share gains made on investments in New Zealand and certain Australian companies. They pay tax on investment income for their individual investors at a rate of 19.5% or 30%, depending on the investor's income in the previous two years. Income earned through a PIE generally does not affect investors' entitlements to family assistance, their student loan repayments or child support obligations.

### Key features

The amendments in this Act are of a remedial nature and address technical problems that have been identified with the rules or amend the rules to cater for different circumstances. The amendments are consistent with the policy intent of the tax rules for portfolio investment entities. 

The Act also rewrites the PIE rules to ensure they are consistent with the plain language drafting approach adopted more generally across other pats of the Income Tax Act. In particular, the entire subpart HL is rewritten as subpart HM.

### Application dates

There are various application dates for the changes to the PIE rules. The amendments to the PIE rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 apply from 1 April 2008. The amendments to the PIE rules in the Income Tax Act 2004 are effective from 1 October 2007. The relevant amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994 are effective from 1 October 2007. The changes to the rules related to the rewrite apply from 1 April 2010 to prevent them having any retrospective application.

### Detailed analysis

##### _Australasian share gains exclusion_

Section CX 55 of the Income Tax Act 2007, which provides that proceeds from disposals of certain Australasian shares by PIEs are excluded income, has been amended to reinstate the previous Australian Stock Exchange listing and franking account requirements. These requirements were contained in the former section CX 55(1)(a)(ii) and (iii) and were inadvertently omitted when an amendment was made to this provision by the Taxation (Business Taxation and Remedial Matters) Act 2007.

##### _Transfer of expenditure to portfolio investment entities (PIEs)_

The PIE tax rules allow a superannuation fund or a unit trust (a member fund) that has not elected to be a PIE but that has invested in a PIE to transfer deductible expenditure to the PIE. A member fund may want to transfer expenditure to a PIE in this way as it may not have sufficient income against which to offset the expenditure. The member fund gains the tax benefit of the expenditure it transfers because the PIE offsets the transferred expenditure against the income that it earns for the member fund.

A number of remedial amendments to the expenditure transfer rules in subpart DV of the Income Tax Act 2007 have been made to ensure that they apply appropriately for PIEs that are portfolio tax rate entities.

Section DV 2(6) has been amended to ensure that the transferred expenditure is deductible to the portfolio tax rate entity in the income year the expenditure is transferred by the member fund.

Sections DV 2 and DV 5 of the Income Tax Act 2007 have been amended to provide that a portfolio tax rate entities deduction is limited to the member fund's share of the portfolio tax rate entities taxable income for the income year in which the expenditure is transferred (sections DV 2(8B) and DV 5(7B)).

Sections DV 4(B) and DV 7(1) provide that excess expenditure that cannot be transferred in a year can be carried forward by the member fund and transferred in a later income year.

##### _Entity type eligibility requirement_

Section HL 4(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and Income Tax Act 2004 has been amended to provide that an entity ceases to be a PIE if the entity fails to meet the entity type requirements in section HL 2(2). For example, the key entity type requirement for a portfolio tax rate entity is that the entity must be a company, superannuation fund or a group investment fund.

##### _Effect of failure to meet eligibility requirements_

Section HL 4(2)(a) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Income Tax Act 2004, concerning breaches of certain eligibility requirements, has been restructured to clarify that some requirements are on a class basis while others are on an entity basis. An entity ceases to be eligible to be a PIE if a portfolio investor class of the entity fails to meet a requirement of section HL 6 (Investor membership requirement) or section HL 9 (Investor interest size requirement) within the prescribed timeframes. New section HL 4(2)(ab) on the other hand, provides that an entity ceases to be eligible to be a PIE if the entity fails to meet a requirement of section HL 10 (Requirements relating to PIE investments) within the prescribed timeframes.

##### _Portfolio investor proxy_

Section HL 5B(1)(d) of the Income Tax Act 2007 has been repealed so that, for an investment in a PIE held through a portfolio investor proxy (PIP), the ultimate investor rather than the PIP is treated as the investor. This is relevant when PIEs are considering whether the investor membership requirement in section HL 6 or the investor interest size requirement in section HL 9 have been satisfied.

##### _Public unit trusts_

Section HL 6 of the Income Tax Act 2007 has been amended so that it is clear that there is no investor membership requirement for a portfolio investor class if the class itself is a public unit trust (that satisfies paragraphs (a) and (c) to (e) of the definition) or an investor in the class is a public unit trust. Similar amendments have been made to the investor interest size requirement in section HL 9.

##### _Investor interest adjustment_

Portfolio tax rate entities must make an adjustment to reflect the effect of the portfolio investor rate of an investor, within certain time periods. An amendment has been made to section HL 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007 to allow the Commissioner to extend the time limit for which an adjustment must be made if it is reasonable in the circumstances. This is to ensure that the PIE status of an entity is not automatically lost when the investor return adjustment requirement is not satisfied within the required time period.

##### _Application of fund withdrawal tax rules to superannuation funds that have elected to be portfolio tax rate entities_

An amendment has been made to section HL 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007 to ensure that the income that a PIE (that no longer files an income tax return) derives under the fund withdrawal tax rules should be treated as income to which no investor has an entitlement. This change effectively results in the PIE accounting for the fund withdrawal tax along with its other PIE tax obligations.

##### _Exemption for investor interest size_

Section HL 9 of the Income Tax Act 2007 sets out the investor interest size requirement for PIEs. The general rule in section HL 9(1) is that an investor in a portfolio investor class of the PIE cannot hold more than 20% of the portfolio investor class. The list of exceptions to this requirement has been amended to add a portfolio investor class of fewer than 20 persons, provided certain criteria are met.

##### _Exception for community trusts_

Community trusts are established to manage public assets and, as such, are analogous to entities that have exemptions applying to them, such as the Earthquake Commission and Auckland Regional Holdings. An amendment has therefore been made to sections HL 6 and HL 9 of the Income Tax Act 2007 to add "community trusts" to the list of investors to which exemptions apply.

##### _Land-owning companies_

As well as holding shares and debt investments, PIEs can also directly own land because passive investments in land can be a major element of a diversified investment portfolio. However, weaknesses in the previous law allowed land-rich active businesses (for example, rest homes and airports) to use the ability of portfolio investment entities to own land directly to their advantage and restructure themselves as PIEs. This was contrary to the policy intent of the portfolio investment entity rules, which were designed to be used by widely held passive savings vehicles.

In particular, previously, the weakness in the law allowed a land-rich active business to be effectively split up into a land-owning company (the PIE), and an operating company, using a structure that ensured the operating company did not "taint" the land-owing company and prevent it from being a PIE. This could be done by:

*   stapling shares in the land-owing company to shares in the operating company; or
*   leasing the PIE's land and buildings to an associated operating company and ensuring the operating company does not represent a significant portion of the PIE's total investments.

The weaknesses have been addressed by amending the income type requirement in section HL 10(2)(b)(iii) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and the Income Tax Act 2007, which previously provided that income under a lease of land meet the income type requirement. The amendment provides that income under a lease of land derived by a PIE from an associated person (which includes a company whose shares are stapled to the shares in the PIE) does not count as qualifying income for the purposes of the income type eligibility requirement in section HL 10(2)(b)(iii).

##### _Becoming a portfolio investment entity_

Section HL 13 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section HL 12 of the Income Tax Act 2004 contain rules dealing with consequences of an entity becoming a PIE. Section HL 13(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section HL 12(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act 2004 provide that an entity is considered never to have been a PIE if, within 12 months of the date of election to become a PIE, it fails to meet one or more of the eligibility criteria referred to in section HL 4.

These deeming provisions have been amended so they apply only if an entity fails to meet one or more of the eligibility requirements in section HL 6 (Investor membership requirement), HL 9 (Investor interest size requirement), or section HL 10.

##### _Credits received by portfolio tax rate entities_

The credit allocation rules for PIEs in section HL 29(7) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section HL 27(7) of the Income Tax Act 2004 have been amended to ensure that an investor with a portfolio investor exit period (exiting investor) is not able to gain a double benefit for the allocated amount of credits.

An exiting investor in a quarterly portfolio tax rate entity should be treated as receiving a credit which has been allocated to the investor in the quarter in which the exit occurs. Previously, under the wording of these provisions, the exiting investor may have got the benefit of credits that were allocated in previous quarters twice - first by the portfolio tax rate entity reducing its portfolio entity tax liability, and secondly by the investor being able to use the allocated credit against other tax liabilities. Therefore a clarifying amendment has been made to section HL 29(7) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section HL 27(7) of the Income Tax Act 2004 to ensure that the proper amount of credit is allocated to an exiting investor.

##### _Consolidated tax group including portfolio tax rate entities_

The policy intention of the grouping rules as they apply to portfolio tax rate entities is that the benefits of the wholly owned group rules apply when a portfolio tax rate entity parent owns 100% of the underlying companies and the underlying companies are portfolio tax rate entities or portfolio land companies. An amendment has been made to section IC 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007 to ensure this policy intent has been met.

##### _Use of allocated imputation credits_

A clarifying amendment has been made to section LE 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 to ensure that persons are allowed a tax credit if imputation credits are allocated to them under section HL 29(7)(b). The relevant persons are zero-rated portfolio investors such as companies and trustees, and investors with portfolio investor exit periods. Section LE 1(1B) provides that an investor in a portfolio tax rate entity who is allocated an imputation credit under section HL 29(7)(b) has a tax credit for the tax year of an amount equal to the imputation credit.

The main imputation crediting provision in section LE 1(1) refers to a person whose assessable income for an income year includes an imputation credit. This inclusion is achieved by section CD 15, which provides that an amount of a dividend is increased by an imputation credit attached to the dividend. This provision, however, is not applicable to investors in portfolio tax rate entities who are allocated imputation credits under section HL 29(7)(b) separately from any dividend.

Section LE 1(4) has consequently been repealed.

##### _Confirming refundability of certain tax credits for portfolio tax rate entities_

A clarifying amendment has been made to ensure that tax credits under section LS 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 are refundable to a portfolio tax rate entity (other than an entity that chooses to pay provisional tax). The relevant credits are credits (not being foreign tax credits) allocated to individual investors (other than investors with portfolio investor exit periods) under section HL 29 and credits arising under section HL 21(2).

The amendment confirming refundability of credits arising under section LS 1 involves including section LS 1 credits in the list of refundable credits in section LA 6(1). The section YA 1 definition of "refundable tax credit" has also been amended to include credits arising under section LS 1.

##### _Imputation credit of ICA company passed on by portfolio tax rate entity_

A change has been made to section ME 4(1) of the Income Tax Act 2004 to allow an imputation credit account (ICA) company an imputation credit for the amount of imputation credit allocated to it by a portfolio tax rate entity.

##### _Recording allocated credits in company investor's imputation credit account_

A new provision, section OB 9B, has been inserted in the Income Tax Act 2007 to ensure that a company investor in a portfolio tax rate entity can include imputation credits allocated to it under section HL 29(7)(b) in its imputation credit account. The imputation credit will be recorded in the company investor's imputation credit account on the date the credit is allocated by the portfolio tax rate entity to the investor.

Previously, section OB 9 allowed a company to include in its imputation credit account an imputation credit attached to a dividend derived by the company. This did not cater for a company investor in a portfolio tax rate entity which was allocated imputation credits under section HL 29(7)(b) separately from any distribution from the portfolio tax rate entity.

##### _Selection of incorrect portfolio investor rate_

An amendment has been made to the definition of "portfolio investor rate" in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 to allow the Commissioner to override a rate incorrectly selected by an investor; the exercise of this discretion would result in the default portfolio investor rate of 30% applying.

Normally, the portfolio investor rate is the rate that an investor notifies to the portfolio tax rate entity as the investor's prescribed investor rate. The portfolio tax rate entity is entitled to rely on the rate notified to it by the investor. Under the amendment, the rate notified by the investor to the portfolio tax rate entity will continue to apply as the portfolio investor rate unless the Commissioner has notified the entity that the rate notified by the investor is to be disregarded, in which case the default rate of 30% under paragraph (a) of the portfolio investor rate definition applies.

##### _Prescribed investor rates and trustees of charitable trusts_

The definition of "prescribed investor rate" in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 has been amended to prevent trustees of charitable trusts electing a 30% rate instead of being zero-rated portfolio investors. If charitable investors could elect a 30% rate they could access the benefit of refundable credits for portfolio investor allocated losses and excess imputation or other credits, something they could not get as zero-rated portfolio investors. This would be contrary to the policy intent of the portfolio investment entity rules.

##### _Prescribed investor rate for trustees_

An amendment has been made to section YA1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 to allow trustees to elect the 19.5% prescribed investor rate.

Section CX 56 has been amended so that portfolio investor allocated income allocated to a trustee that has had the 19.5% prescribed investor rate applied to that income, is not excluded income.

Section LS 2 has been amended to allow the trustee a tax credit for tax paid at the PIE level on the allocated income.

The changes will help trustees manage their provisional tax obligations.

##### _Listed PIEs electing to be portfolio tax rate entities_

To ensure there is consistency with the policy intent of the PIE rules, an amendment has been made to section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 that allows PIEs that are listed on a recognised exchange to elect to be portfolio tax rate entities.

##### _Information provided by portfolio tax rate entities to investors_

Section 31B(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, which contains the requirement for portfolio tax rate entities to provide information statements to zero-rated portfolio investors, has been repealed. This means that these investors are covered by the information statement rules in section 31B(3), which require portfolio tax rate entities to provide information statements to their investors by 30 June after the end of the tax year (or a later date if the entity has a late balance date). 

Previously, portfolio tax rate entities were required under section 31B(2B) to provide information statements to their zero-rated portfolio investors within one month of the end of the relevant period, which in practice was an insufficient period to comply with. Also, quarterly portfolio tax rate entities were required to issue a statement each quarter to zero-rated portfolio investors rather than on an annual basis.

##### _Returns by portfolio tax rate entities_

Section 57B(6)(c) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 has been amended to provide an additional month for portfolio tax rate entities that are ceasing to file their final return. This means that such entities have three months rather than the previous two months to provide their final return.

A cross-referencing correction to section 57B has been made in section 61(1C). The amended section 61(1C) requires a portfolio tax rate entity (not being an entity that chooses under section HL 23 to pay provisional tax) to disclose its interests in foreign companies or foreign investment funds by the due date for the entity's return under section 57B(7).

The provision in section 57B, containing the deadlines by when portfolio tax rate entities must perform their responsibilities for investors with portfolio investor exit periods, has been re-enacted as subsection (3B) - the provision previously had incorrectly been located within section 57B(7).

##### _Minor drafting corrections_

A number of amendments have been made to correct minor drafting and cross-referencing errors. These include:

*   Section HL 6(4)(a) and (b) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Income Tax Act 2004, relating to the investor membership requirement, have been amended to include a cross-reference to the paragraph that lists Auckland Regional Holdings.
*   Section HL 9(6)(a) and (b) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Income Tax Act 2004, relating to the investor interest size requirement, have been amended to include a cross-reference to the paragraph that lists Auckland Regional Holdings.
*   Section HL 12(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section HL 11B(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act 2004, relating to unlisted companies choosing to become portfolio listed companies, have been amended so that the reference to an unlisted company needing to have 100 shareholders has changed to an unlisted company needing to have at least 100 shareholders.

Amount of honoraria paid Royal New Zealand Plunket Trust volunteers that shall be regarded as expenditure incurred in production of that payment
================================================================================================================================================

This determination applies to honoraria paid by the Royal New Zealand Plunket Trust to volunteers undertaking voluntary activities for Plunket. It applies for the period 1 January 2018 to 31 March 2019. Reimbursement of expenses are exempt from income tax. This includes those in non-cash form, such as petrol vouchers, transport costs incurred in getting to and from the place of volunteering as well as those incurred in the course of volunteering. You can find more information in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 21, No 8, page 119.

### Application

All references to legislation are to the Income Tax Act 2007.

This determination is made under section RD 8(3) and shall apply to honoraria paid to the Royal New Zealand Plunket Trust (“Plunket”) volunteers who undertake voluntary activities for Plunket.

This determination may be cited as “Determination 18/02: _Determination of expenditure incurred for honoraria payments made by the Royal New Zealand Plunket Trust”_.

This determination shall apply for the period 1 January 2018 to 31 March 2019.

For the purposes of section CW 62B, “volunteer” means a person who freely undertakes an activity in New Zealand:

1.  Chosen either by themselves or by a group of which they are a member; and
2.  That provides a benefit to a community or another person; and
3.  For which there is no purpose or intention of private pecuniary profit for the person.

### Scope of definition

Honoraria paid to Plunket members come within the definition of “schedular payment” under section RD 8. Schedule 4, Part B requires PAYE to be deducted from honoraria at the rate of 33%.

Under section RD 3(1) a schedular payment is included in the definition of “PAYE income payment”. Consequently, any person who makes a schedular payment must deduct tax from it at the time it is made, unless an exemption applies.

Section CW 62B provides that an amount that is a reimbursement payment to cover expenses incurred by a volunteer when undertaking a voluntary activity, is exempt from income tax.

Section RD 8(3) allows the Commissioner to determine an amount or proportion of any schedular payment that is considered to be expenditure incurred that is exempt from income tax. If the Commissioner has made such a determination, the person making the schedular payment is only required to deduct tax from the amount that exceeds the determined expenditure amount.

### Determination

When any Plunket volunteer receives honoraria as reimbursement of expenditure that person had incurred in carrying out Plunket related activities, that payment up to a maximum of $800 per tax year, shall be regarded as expenditure incurred in the production of that payment. However, if the volunteer receives any reimbursement (in addition to honoraria) for expenditure they have incurred, the amount exempted under this determination ($800) shall be reduced by that additional reimbursement.

### Examples

##### Example 1

A Plunket volunteer receives honoraria of $500 in respect of the Plunket related activities carried out during the tax year. No other reimbursement had been paid during the year. The payer does not have to deduct withholding tax because the total payment does not exceed $800.

##### Example 2

A Plunket volunteer receives a payment of $625 at the end of February. During the tax year, in the preceding May, August and November the volunteer had also received three smaller payment of $100 each as reimbursement of travel expenses incurred for Plunket related activities, making a total of $925 for the year. Because the Plunket volunteer had received reimbursement payments of $300 earlier in the year, only $500 of the honorarium received in February could be regarded as expenditure incurred under this determination. Therefore, tax of $41.25 should be deducted from the balance ($125) of the honorarium.
