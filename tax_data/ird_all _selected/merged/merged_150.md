In this guide, the term "trust" also applies to estates unless specifically stated otherwise. This information doesn't apply to unit trusts (as these are treated as companies for income tax purposes) or trusts that are superannuation funds (as different rules apply). A glossary of terms is on page 6. Trust returns If your trust won't have any taxable income in any tax year, please call us on 0800 377 774 with the name and IRD number of the trust so we can record that a return isn't required for that year. However, if the trust receives any assessable income, eg, interest, the trustee must file a return, regardless of the amount derived. If the trust subsequently derives assessable income in a future year, the trust must send in a return. This only applies to trust returns. Estates are still required to file a return of income, regardless of whether or not they have derived assessable income. TRUSTS AND ESTATES 6 Glossary Associated persons Associated persons are defined as: • two companies • a company and a person other than a company • two relatives • a person and a trustee for a relative • a trustee and a beneficiary • trustees with a common settlor • a trustee and a settlor • a settlor and a beneficiary • a trustee and a person with the power of appointment or removal of the trustee • a partnership and a partner • two persons who are each associated with the same third person (tripartite test). For full details on associated persons read A guide to associated persons definitions for income tax purposes (IR620). You can download this from www.ird.govt.nz "Forms and guides". Charitable trust A charitable trust is one in which the income can be used only for charitable purposes. For more information on charitable trusts, read our guide Charitable organisations (IR255). Corpus This is the market value of any property settled on a trust, at the date of settlement. Disposition of property Any form of transfer, conveyance, assignment, settlement, delivery, payment or other allocation of property to a trust (or for its benefit) is a disposition of property. This includes dispositions made under a person's will and through intestacy (dying without a will). Inter vivos trust This is a trust settled during the lifetime of the settlor. This term is used when working out whether trustee income from overseas is subject to New Zealand income tax. www.ird.govt.nz 7 Resident You are a New Zealand tax resident in any of these situations: • you're in New Zealand for more than 183 days in any twelve-month period, or • you have an enduring relationship with New Zealand, or • you have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, or • you're away from New Zealand in the service of the New Zealand Government. Testamentary trust A trust created by a person's will, codicil or intestacy (dying without a will), or by a court order at the time of the person's death. Transitional resident A transitional resident is an individual who has arrived in New Zealand after 1 April 2006 and qualifies for a temporary tax exemption on their foreign income. To qualify as a transitional resident, the individual must not have been resident in New Zealand for the last 10 years, or have been a transitional resident before. For more information see, "Temporary tax exemption on foreign income for new migrants and returning New Zealanders" at www.ird.govt.nz TRUSTS AND ESTATES 8 Part 1 - Explaining the important concepts How a trust starts To create a trust, a person (the settlor) gives money or property to another person (the trustee), to be held in trust for the benefit of either the trust's beneficiaries, or a purpose recognised by law. There should be a signed trust deed (agreement) that acknowledges the settlement, but it's possible to establish a trust verbally. Trustees The trustee holds the trust's property in trust for the beneficiary, and administers or manages the trust. A trustee includes an executor or administrator of an estate, which may be the Public Trustee or the Mäori Trustee. Companies may also act as trustees. Settlors When a trustee of a trust owes an amount to a beneficiary of the trust, the beneficiary does not become a settlor when either: • the trust pays the beneficiary a market interest rate equal to or greater than the prescribed rate of interest, or • the amount retained in the beneficiary’s current account at the end of the income year is not more than $25,000. Note A settlor of the trust can include any person who at any time: • transfers value –to a trust, or –for the benefit of the trust, or –on terms of the trust • provides financial assistance to the trust for its value. These are called settlements. Trusts may also be settled by companies. www.ird.govt.nz 9 Determining who is a settlor of a trust and whether they're a resident is important for establishing whether the trust's overseas income is taxable in New Zealand. These factors also affect the category of a trust (complying, foreign, or non-complying - explained in Part 2 of this guide) and which distributions to beneficiaries are non- taxable. Settlement A settlement is any action that makes a person a settlor of a trust and includes any of the following: • disposal of any property to the trust for less than market value • property or funds made available to the trust for less than market value • services provided to the trust for less than market value • any property acquired from the trust or any service from the trustee for greater than market value. Settlement also includes any failure to act or enter into any or part of any of the above actions. The courts will only recognise that a valid trust has been created if it's covered in a trust deed. You should seek professional advice about drawing up a trust deed. Note Information a settlor must give us A New Zealand resident settlor must tell us the details within three months of making a settlement on a trust that doesn't have New Zealand resident trustees. The settlor must also give us the names and addresses of the trust's trustees and beneficiaries. For disclosure purposes, a settlement also includes a settlement made as a nominee of another person, or of a nominal amount made at the request of another person. A settlor of a trust who is resident in New Zealand for any part of the income year, may be taxed as an agent of the trustee on trustee income which is derived in that income year, if the trust ceases to have a New Zealand trustee. If all the trustees of the trust cease to be New Zealand residents, the settlor must tell us within three months of the date on which the trust ceased to have a resident trustee. TRUSTS AND ESTATES 10 In each of these situations, the settlor must complete a Settlors of trusts disclosure (IR462) form within three months and send it to us. How the trust earns income Usually, the money or property settled on the trust is used as an investment to earn further revenue, or as capital to fund a trading operation. This revenue becomes the trust's income as it's earned. The initial settlement on the trust isn't income for tax purposes, but the settlor may have to pay gift duty on it if it's received before 1 October 2011, depending on the value of the settlement. Estates The trust tax rules also apply to estates of people who have died, if such an estate continues to earn income after the person's death. When we refer to "trusts" in this guide we also include estates, unless specifically excluded by the context. The trust's income The trust's income is deemed to include certain settlements of property on a trust. • Property settled by a trustee of another trust so long as it would have counted as income if that trust had distributed the property to one of its beneficiaries instead (see page 21). • A settlement of property on a trust, which would, if not for the settlement, have constituted: –gross income of the settlor, or –a dividend for which the settlor would have, if not for settlement, been liable to deduct FDP (foreign dividend payment) if the settlor is a resident or if the settlor had been a resident in New Zealand and subject to our income tax laws at that time. • A settlement of property on a trust for which the settlor claims a deduction from gross income for New Zealand tax purposes. These property settlements are excluded from the definition of corpus. www.ird.govt.nz 11 The trust's income is separated into two parts for tax purposes: beneficiary income and trustee income. The tax on these two parts is then calculated separately, to arrive at the total tax payable on the trust's income. Here's how the income is allocated: • Beneficiary income is an amount of income derived by a trustee of the trust and allocated to a beneficiary during any income year that either: –vests absolutely in the beneficiary during that income year, or –is paid or applied for the benefit of the beneficiary within six months after the end of that income year. • Trustee income is all income the trust earns in its income year that: –does not vest absolutely in the beneficiary during that income year, or –is not paid or applied for the benefit of the beneficiary within six months after the end of that income year. Trusts can make other types of distributions, some of which will also be taxable. These other distributions are explained in Part 4 of this guide. How the trust's tax is calculated depends on the type of trust, and whether the settlor and/or trustees are New Zealand residents. The different types of trust are explained in Part 2 of this guide. Foreign trusts disclosure and record keeping rules Resident foreign trustees (including complying resident foreign trustees) are required, for each foreign trust they administer, to: • complete and submit to us a Foreign trust disclosure (IR607) form, and • keep financial and other records for New Zealand tax purposes. You can get the IR607 from our website www.ird.govt.nz "Forms and guides", or by emailing competent.authority@ird.govt.nz Disclosures must be completed by resident foreign trustees appointed: • if on or after 1 October 2006, within 30 days after the later of the date of appointment as a trustee, or the date of the trustee's arrival in New Zealand • if before 1 October 2006, within 60 days after the later of 1 October 2006, or the date of the trustee's arrival in New Zealand. More information Full details of the rules are in the Tax Information Bulletin Vol 18, No 5 (June 2006). TRUSTS AND ESTATES 12 Part 2 - Different types of trusts For income tax purposes, there are three types of trust: • complying trusts • foreign trusts • non-complying trusts. The type of trust is important, because it determines whether some distributions from a trust are taxable. Complying trusts A complying trust is one that has been taxed in New Zealand on all its trustee income since the date it began. Complying trusts include: • trusts settled by New Zealand residents with New Zealand trustees • estates of people who were New Zealand residents when they died • other trusts which have elected to become a complying trust. A trust remains a complying trust if, since settlement of the trust, the trustees have satisfied all their obligations for its income tax liabilities. A trust isn't a complying trust if: • the only trustee income is non-resident passive income, or • the trustees earn foreign-sourced income excluded from the meaning of gross income. If a trust ceases to meet the conditions for a complying trust in an income year, it will no longer be a complying trust - it will generally become a non-complying trust (see definition on page 13). A complying trust won't lose its complying status simply because one or more of the following apply: • the trust has no trustee income and there is no tax liability • the only trustee income is tax-exempt • the trust's deductible expenses or losses exceed the trustee income, so there is no tax payable on the net trustee income. www.ird.govt.nz 13 Foreign trusts A trust will be a foreign trust if none of its settlors have been resident in New Zealand since the later of these dates: • 17 December 1987 • the date the trust was first settled. A trust will cease to be a foreign trust if it makes any distribution after a settlor becomes a New Zealand resident, or if a New Zealand resident makes a settlement on the trust. Non-complying trusts A non-complying trust is any trust that is neither a complying trust nor a foreign trust at the time it makes a distribution. See page 23 for more information on distributions from a non-complying trust. It's generally a trust that has a resident settlor, has been established overseas with non-resident trustees, and hasn't been liable for New Zealand income tax since it was first settled. It also includes a trust where its trustee income has been liable for full New Zealand tax but the trustees haven't paid the tax. New arrivals in New Zealand New residents who arrive in New Zealand may have settled a trust before they arrived in this country. Such a trust would normally be a foreign trust, but it can elect to become a complying trust. The benefits of such an election will become clearer in Part 4 of this guide, because the type of trust affects how some distributions to beneficiaries are taxed. To change types, the trust must elect to pay New Zealand income tax on its trustee income within 12 months of when the settlor first arrives in New Zealand, unless the settlor is a transitional resident\*. If the settlor isn't a transitional resident the trustee income will become taxable in New Zealand, from the date the trust makes the election. If the settlor is a transitional resident, the 12 months to elect to change trust types starts on the date the settlor ceases to be a transitional resident. The trust should use an Election to pay income tax on trustee income (IR463) form to make this election. \* See glossary TRUSTS AND ESTATES 14 If the trust doesn't make an election, it'll be treated as one of the following: • a foreign trust, for any distribution that consists of income, capital profits or capital gains derived before the election expiry date • a non-complying trust, for any distribution that consists of income, capital profits or capital gains derived after the election expiry date. www.ird.govt.nz 15 Part 3 - How the trust's income is taxed Tax on trustee income The tax on a trust's trustee income (explained on page 11) is calculated at a flat rate of 33 cents in the dollar for all three different types of trust. General rule The trustee is liable for New Zealand income tax on income derived from New Zealand, irrespective of where the trustee lives. The trustee is also liable for New Zealand income tax on income derived from outside New Zealand where: • any settlor is resident in New Zealand at any time during the income year, or • any settlor of an inter vivos or a testamentary trust died while they were resident in New Zealand and a trustee is resident in New Zealand at any time during the income year. Exceptions to the general rule There are two situations in which a trustee isn't liable for income tax on trustee income derived from outside New Zealand. These apply where the trustee is resident outside New Zealand at all times during the income year and either: • no settlement has been made on the trust since 17 December 1987, or • the only settlements made on the trust were by settlors who weren't resident in New Zealand at the time of settlement and who haven't been resident in New Zealand since 17 December 1987. Neither exception applies where an election to pay tax on trustee income has been made by the trustee. These exceptions don't affect the liability to income tax for any settlor of the trust, for example, where the settlor elects to pay tax on trustee income. The trustee income remains liable for income tax for the purpose of determining whether the trust is a complying trust. TRUSTS AND ESTATES 16 Settlor liability If a trust was settled before 17 December 1987, and no settlement has been made on the trust since then, the settlor isn't liable for tax on trustee income unless they elect to pay tax on it. Any settlor of a trust who is a resident in New Zealand at any time during the income year is liable for income tax on trustee income as an agent of the trustee, with certain exceptions. If there's more than one New Zealand resident settlor, these settlors are jointly liable for the tax on trustee income. This means that any or all of the New Zealand resident settlors are liable for this tax. The New Zealand resident settlor won't be liable for the income tax on trustee income if any of these conditions are met. • A trustee is resident in New Zealand at all times during the income year. • The settlor, being a natural person (not a company), wasn't a New Zealand resident at the time they made any settlement on the trust, unless the settlor elects to pay tax on trustee income. • The settlor can show to our satisfaction that their share of the trust's tax liability is excessive, taking into account the settlements on the trust made by all settlors. • The trustee income is derived by the application of the accruals rules of the Income Tax Act to any amounts remitted by the settlor under any financial arrangement. Provisional tax If a trust's residual income tax (RIT) at the end of an income year is more than $2,500, it will generally have to pay provisional tax on the following year's income. RIT is the amount of tax due at the end of the year, after deducting all tax credits the trust can claim (except provisional tax payments). Provisional tax for trusts is explained fully in Part 6 of this guide. www.ird.govt.nz 17 Tax on beneficiary income New Zealand resident beneficiaries Beneficiaries who are New Zealand residents are liable for New Zealand income tax on all their income, from any source in the world. Beneficiary income they receive from any trust will be taxable in New Zealand, at their normal income tax rates. Beneficiaries under 16 may be subject to special rules. For more information, please see page 18. From the 2004-2005 income year, any amount derived by the trustee of a community trust is exempt from income tax. The distributions from community trusts aren't taxed on beneficiary income, instead they're included in the gross income of the beneficiaries. The trustee must pay tax on behalf of the beneficiary for income allocated to that beneficiary. The beneficiary can then claim a tax credit for the tax paid on their behalf. Beneficiaries are required to return all income received in their own personal tax return. However, the trustee and beneficiary can agree between themselves not to have tax deducted from trust income before the beneficiary receives it. This is called having the income "transferred direct", and it may be useful in cases such as when the beneficiary has other tax losses to offset against the trust income in their tax return. If the income is transferred direct and the beneficiary doesn't pay any tax on it, the trustees can still be held liable for the unpaid tax. Any distributions made from a non-complying trust to the beneficiary is taxed at 45%. If the trust subsequently gains its complying status, that distribution will be reversed. There are also some other trust distributions beneficiaries must declare for income tax purposes. These are explained in Part 4 of this guide. The nature of the trust's income continues when allocated to the beneficiaries. So interest earned by the trust and allocated to a beneficiary is interest income of the beneficiary. TRUSTS AND ESTATES 18 Timing of allocation of beneficiary income From the 2009-2010 income year onwards, the date by which income allocation to beneficiaries must be allocated, is the later of: • six months after balance date, or • the earlier of: –the date on which the trustee files the return of income for the income year, or –the date by which the trustee must file a return for the income year. Olive Family Trust is allocating income to beneficiaries for the year ended 31 March 2012. The trust return is due on 7 July 2012. The income should be allocated by: • 30 September 2012, or • the earlier of: –the date the return is filed, or –7 July 2012. Example If the trust has a tax agent, the extension of time for filing an income tax return still applies. Special rules for beneficiaries who are children (the "minor beneficiary rule") The minor beneficiary rule applies to income derived from 1 April 2001 or the equivalent income year. Certain distributions of beneficiary income to children under 16 (minors) on the balance date of the trust must be taxed at a final tax rate of 33%. The rule doesn't apply to income derived in that income year if the minor turned 16 during that year. Minor beneficiary income is taxed as trustees' income and isn't the minor's gross income. For the purposes of entries in a beneficiary's account with a trust, the tax on beneficiary income, although taxed as trustees' income, is still treated as being paid on behalf of the beneficiary. www.ird.govt.nz 19 The minor beneficiary rule applies to beneficiary income derived by a minor from property settled on a trust by: • a relative or legal guardian of the minor, or • a person associated with a relative or legal guardian. The rule applies to all beneficiary income distributed to a minor from a trust unless all the settlements on that trust were made: • by a settlor who received the property as an agent for the beneficiary from someone other than a relative, guardian or their associate • by a settlor who's been ordered by a court to pay damages or compensation to the minor • by a settlor against whom a protection order has been made under section 14 of the Domestic Violence Act 1995.\* • under the terms of a will, codicil, intestacy or any variations of these by a court, if the minor or their brother or sister, or half-brother or half-sister, was alive within 12 months after the date of the settlor's death. If a trust includes some settlements that fit within one of these criteria, and some settlements that don't, special rules apply. For more information see your tax agent or call us on 0800 377 774. The rule doesn't apply if: • the minor is a non-resident • the minor receives a child disability allowance under the Social Security Act 2018 • the minor receives beneficiary income from a group investment fund or Ma ̄ori authority • the beneficiary income derived is $1,000 or less in an income year. However, if the beneficiary's income is over $1,000, all the beneficiary income is subject to the rule. \* This exception only applies if the minor is a protected person in relation to the protection order and the settlement on the trust is made before the protection order is made, or during the time the protection order is in force. TRUSTS AND ESTATES 20 Beneficiaries and provisional tax If a beneficiary's residual income tax (RIT) is more than $2,500, they will generally have to pay provisional tax for the following year. RIT is the amount of tax due at the end of the year, after deducting all tax credits the beneficiary can claim, including tax paid by the trustee on the beneficiary's behalf, but excluding provisional tax payments. Our guide Provisional tax (IR289) explains these rules. Non-resident beneficiaries The trust must deduct NRWT (non-resident withholding tax) from any interest, dividends or royalties before the non-resident beneficiary receives them. This withholding tax is the final tax payable on the income. They should be able to claim a credit for their tax paid in their overseas tax return. Other income, such as income from a rental property, will be subject to New Zealand income tax at the normal rates. Beneficiary income retains its nature in the beneficiary's hands - for example, if the trust earned the income from dividends, the beneficiary should return it as dividends in their overseas tax return. Note If a trust has non-resident beneficiaries, our NRWT - payer's guide (IR291) contains information the trust administrators will need to know. If a beneficiary isn't a New Zealand resident, and they receive beneficiary income that didn't come from New Zealand sources, the beneficiary won't have to pay New Zealand income tax on this income. Beneficiaries temporarily ceasing to be resident If a beneficiary ceases to be a New Zealand resident and then becomes a New Zealand resident again within five years, they must pay New Zealand income tax on any beneficiary income or taxable distributions (explained in Part 4) received from a foreign or non-complying trust. In this situation, any beneficiary income or taxable distributions the beneficiary received while they were a non-resident, will be taxable as such in the year in which the beneficiary again becomes a New Zealand resident. www.ird.govt.nz 21 Part 4 - Other distributions to beneficiaries As well as distributing beneficiary income, as explained in Part 3, a trust can distribute money or assets to its beneficiaries by: • distributing trustee income accumulated in previous years • distributing capital profits or gains made from disposing of some of its assets or property • supplying trust property or services to the beneficiary for less than full value • acquiring property or services from the beneficiary for more than full value • making a distribution from the trust's corpus • settling sums or property for the benefit of another trust to the extent that if distributed to a beneficiary resident in New Zealand, the sum or property would have constituted beneficiary income or a taxable distribution to that beneficiary. A beneficiary who receives such a distribution may have to pay income tax on it. This will depend on the type of trust making the distribution. This is why the difference between complying trusts, foreign trusts and non-complying trusts is significant. Distributions of accumulated trustee income and capital profits or gains that were derived by the trust in the 1988 or earlier income years aren't treated as taxable distributions. Distributions from complying trusts If a complying trust makes a distribution of any of the types listed above, the beneficiary receiving the distribution won't have to pay income tax on it. This is the principal advantage of being a complying trust. TRUSTS AND ESTATES 22 Distributions from foreign trusts When a foreign trust makes a distribution of any of the types listed on page 21, it will be a taxable distribution unless it's from the trust's corpus, or from capital profits or gains from transactions with non-associated persons (an adjustment is made for any capital loss incurred in the year the profit was realised). This means the beneficiary must pay tax on the distribution at their normal tax rate. Order of sources of distributions to beneficiaries When a foreign trust makes a distribution to a beneficiary, for tax purposes the distribution will be considered to have come from different sources in the following order: 1. Income the trust derived in the current income year. 2. Income (other than beneficiary income) the trust derived in a previous income year (accumulated trustee income). 3. Any capital profit or gain realised in the current income year. 4. Any accumulated capital profit or gain realised in previous income years. 5. The corpus of the trust. However, there are certain distributions not subject to the order listed above. These are: • any distribution from a non-discretionary trust: –created by will, codicil or court order modifying the will or codicil –created on an intestacy, or –on which no settlement has been made since 17 December 1987 • any distribution from a foreign trust that has elected to become a complying trust • any distribution under which a beneficiary acquired trust property for less than market value • any distribution under which a beneficiary acquired services from the trust for less than market value. Except for the last two items in this list, the distributions are deemed to consist of amounts that reflect the terms of the trust deed, or that the trustee(s) determine(s). If a foreign trust doesn't keep enough records to accurately show the source of a distribution, it will be a taxable distribution. www.ird.govt.nz 23 Distributions that are taxable to the beneficiary If a New Zealand resident beneficiary receives a taxable distribution from a foreign trust, this distribution must be included in the beneficiary's tax return as part of their assessable income. This is on top of any beneficiary income the beneficiary receives from the trust. The beneficiary will then pay tax on the distribution at their normal income tax rates. If the beneficiary receiving the distribution from a foreign trust isn't a New Zealand resident, then they only have to pay New Zealand income tax on any part of the distribution that came from a source in New Zealand. Distributions from non-complying trusts When a non-complying trust makes a distribution of any of the types listed on page 21, it will be taxable unless it's from the trust's corpus. If the beneficiary receiving the distribution from a non-complying trust is a New Zealand resident, it's included in the person's tax return with their other income for the year. It will be taxed at a flat rate of 45 cents in the dollar. Distributions of beneficiary income are taxed at the beneficiary's normal tax rates. A complying trust which has become a non-complying trust because of the trustee's income tax obligations not being met, will become a complying trust retrospectively if the trustee satisfies their obligations, including penalties and interest. When a non-complying trust makes a distribution to a beneficiary, the same rules of order listed on page 22 apply. If a beneficiary has a tax loss from some other source If a beneficiary receives a taxable distribution from a non-complying trust, and that beneficiary has a loss or a loss to carry forward from some other source, they can claim a deduction against the distribution. Use this formula to calculate the amount of this deduction: a× b c In this formula: a is the amount of loss or loss carried forward b is the rate of tax on trustee income - 33 cents in the dollar (0.33) c is 45 cents in the dollar (0.45). TRUSTS AND ESTATES 24 Foreign tax credits Credits for foreign tax paid on a taxable distribution can only be claimed if the tax deducted by the foreign country is similar to New Zealand NRWT. Electing to become a complying trust There are some situations in which a foreign trust or a non-complying trust can elect to become a complying trust. If they want to do this, either the trustee, the settlor or the beneficiary must elect to pay tax on the trustees' worldwide income. The trustee income will then be taxed in New Zealand (when it otherwise may not have been taxable here), in the same way as a complying trust. This then allows it to make non-taxable distributions to its beneficiaries. The person making this election should fill in an Election to pay income tax on trustee income (IR463) form and send it to us. The following three types of trust can elect to become complying trusts if they make the election within the relevant time limits - see the following pages. New residents A trust settled by a non-resident settlor who became a New Zealand resident after 17 December 1987 may elect to become a complying trust. This election must be made within 12 months of the settlor becoming a New Zealand resident. Unless the settlor is a transitional resident\*, the 12 months to change trust type starts on the date the settlor ceases to be a transitional resident. If the trust makes an election it will be treated either as: • a foreign trust, for any distribution of income, capital profits or capital gains the trust derived before it made the election, or • a complying trust, for any distribution of income, capital profits or capital gains the trust derived after it made the election. This treatment doesn't apply if the trust fails to pay the tax on the trustees' income. The trust will be treated as a non-complying trust for any distributions made in the income year in which the tax isn't paid and in subsequent income years. Only distributions from amounts derived after the trust made the election will be treated as having been made from a non-complying trust. \* See glossary www.ird.govt.nz 25 If the election is made part-way through an income year, the income, profits or capital gains for the year must be allocated to the appropriate period that the trust was a foreign or complying trust, according to the date they were derived on. Settled in 1989 or later income years A non-complying or foreign trust settled during the 1989 or later income years, and not otherwise liable to New Zealand income tax on its trustee income, may elect to become a complying trust. The election must be made within the time for filing the trust's tax return for the income year of settlement. If New Zealand income tax is paid on all trustee income derived since the date of settlement, the trust will meet the complying trust definition at the date of the distribution. Complying trusts no longer liable for New Zealand tax A trust that was formerly a complying trust, but ceased to be liable for New Zealand income tax on its trustee income (for example, if the settlor becomes a non-resident), ceases to be a complying trust. However, such a trust can elect or re-elect to be a complying trust. The election must be made within the time for filing the tax return for the income year in which the trust ceased to be a complying trust. The income tax liability relating to trustee income for each income years since the trust began must also be satisfied. The trust will again be treated as a complying trust from the date it would otherwise have ceased to be liable for New Zealand tax. If no election is made, the trust will become a non-complying trust. To become a complying trust, it must make its election before the relevant time limit expires. Late elections cannot be accepted. Note TRUSTS AND ESTATES 26 Part 5 - Tax returns for trusts and beneficiaries The trust's tax return The trustee must file an IR6 tax return for the trust each year. This return is separate from the trustee's own personal tax return. In the IR6 return the trustee shows: • all income derived by the trust, including any income from a Mäori authority • the tax credits relating to that income • the allocation of income between beneficiary income and trustee income, and • any taxable distributions made. The trustee then calculates the tax payable on the beneficiary income, trustee income and taxable distributions. Allocation of RWT credits Any associated tax credits are generally also allocated in the same proportion as the income. However, if a trustee is paying income tax on beneficiary income on behalf of the beneficiaries, the trustee has the option of detaching some or all of the RWT credits associated with the resident passive income distributed to beneficiaries and reallocating the credits between beneficiaries and trustee to satisfy the income tax on beneficiary income and trustee income. The option of detaching RWT credits is only available to a trustee who pays income tax on beneficiary income on behalf of the beneficiaries. Note If the trustee detaches RWT credits from resident passive income distributed to a beneficiary (Beneficiary A), the trustee must pay Beneficiary A an RWT substitution payment equal to the amount of the detached RWT credits. The trustee can then either: • Reallocate the detached RWT credits to Beneficiary B by meeting Beneficiary B’s income tax on beneficiary income; • Retain the detached RWT credits to satisfy income tax on trustee income; or • A combination of both. The reallocated or retained RWT credit is not income of either Beneficiary B or the trustee – it is the transfer of RWT credits. www.ird.govt.nz 27 The RWT credits available to Beneficiary A are then reduced by the amount of the RWT substitution payment. The RWT substitution payment is treated as resident passive income that is beneficiary income of Beneficiary A. However, there is no liability or obligation on the trustee to withhold RWT in relation to the RWT substitution payment. The practical effect of the reallocation exercise is that the RWT credit is transferred from one taxpayer (Beneficiary A) to another (Beneficiary B or trustee) and the transferred RWT credit is used to satisfy the trustee’s obligations for satisfying the income tax liability on trustee income and/or Beneficiary B’s beneficiary income. Reallocating the RWT credits also means that Beneficiary A will not need to seek a refund from the Commissioner for the excess RWT credits and, instead, receives a cash payment from the trustee in substitution for the RWT credits. The trustee of the Olive Family trust derives $100 in interest, from which 33% tax has been deducted, leaving $67 in cash, and the trustee receives an entitlement to $33 in RWT credits. The Olive Family trust distributes all of the interest to Brook as beneficiary income, with Brook receiving $67 in cash and $33 in RWT credits. Brook has a marginal tax rate of 17.5%, which means her tax liability on her beneficiary income is $17.50. Since the trustee is paying income tax on beneficiary income for Brook, the trustee can detach $15.50 from the RWT credits allocated to Brook and pay her cash of $15.50 in substitution for the detached RWT credit. This leaves Brook with $17.50 of RWT tax credit – enough to satisfy her income tax on beneficiary income. Brook is in the same position as if she had obtained a refund of the excess RWT credit from the Commissioner. The trustee can retain the detached RWT credit of $15.50 to satisfy income tax on trustee income. Example Allocation of imputation credits The imputation credits must be allocated in proportion to the total distributions received from the trust. This also applies to Mäori authority credits and FDP (foreign dividend payment) credits attached to dividends distributed as beneficiary income. This means a trust can't choose to allocate credits to beneficiaries who may be better able to use them than other beneficiaries. TRUSTS AND ESTATES 28 Use this formula to allocate the imputation and FDP credits: a× b c In this formula: a is the total imputation and FDP credits attached to all dividends distributed to beneficiaries during the income year b is the total distribution, including capital distributions, to the particular beneficiary during the income year c is the total distributions made to all beneficiaries during the income year. The beneficiaries can then claim a credit for tax paid on their beneficiary income and taxable distributions (and their share of tax credits) in their personal income tax returns. Where a trust has no prospect or intention of deriving any assessable income in a given financial year, please call us on 0800 377 774 with the name and IRD number of the trust so we can record that a return isn't required for that year. However, if the trust receives any assessable income, for example, interest, the trustee must file a return, regardless of the amount derived. If the trust subsequently derives assessable income in a future year, the trust must send in a return. This only applies to trust returns. Estates are still required to file a return of income regardless of whether or not they have derived assessable income. Note The beneficiaries' tax returns A person who receives beneficiary income from any type of trust, or a taxable distribution from a foreign trust, must include this income in their tax return for that year and pay tax on it at their normal rates. If the trust has deducted tax before paying the income to the beneficiary, the beneficiary can claim a credit for this tax deducted. However, if the tax was deducted overseas, the maximum credit a New Zealand beneficiary can claim is the amount of New Zealand income tax payable on their share of the overseas trust income. If the trust's balance date isn't 31 March, the beneficiary must include any income from the trust in their tax return for the year that corresponds with the trust's accounting year. There's no need to make any separate calculations to allow for a difference in balance dates. www.ird.govt.nz 29 If a person receives beneficiary income or taxable distributions from a foreign or non-complying trust, they should fill in the details of the trust income on a Schedule of beneficiary's estate or trust income (IR307) form, and include this with their tax return. If the trust has a New Zealand tax agent, they will usually fill in an IR307 form for each beneficiary to include with their individual tax return. These forms will then show the beneficiaries how much income to declare, and the amount of any tax credits to claim. Any taxable distributions a beneficiary receives from a non-complying trust are to be included separately in the beneficiary's tax return. These distributions will be taxed separately at a flat rate of 45 cents in the dollar. Note Tax returns for a deceased person's estate The personal representative, executor or administrator of a deceased person's estate must file all tax returns the deceased person would otherwise have had to file and make sure any tax due is paid. The tax return to be used for the period to the date of death is an Individual tax return (IR3). The return must show their IRD number and include all gross income the deceased person derived up until that date. After the date of death, the person's estate will get a new IRD number and any income must be returned in an Income tax return: Estate or Trust (IR6). The first estate return will include all income derived and expenditure incurred from the date of death until the end of the return period. Even after an estate has been wound up, we can audit the deceased person's tax returns for previous years. If more tax becomes payable as a result of such an audit, the estate is still liable to pay this tax. If there are no estate funds available because the final distribution has been made, the executor or administrator is liable for the extra tax assessed. Charitable trusts or estates A trust will be a charitable trust if all income the trustee derives is held solely for charitable purposes, and no person associated with the trust can gain any personal profit from it. There are special tax exemptions available to charitable trusts and estates. You'll find more information about charitable trusts and estates in our Charitable organisations (IR255) guide. TRUSTS AND ESTATES 30 Final trust or estate return The trustees of a trust or estate are personally responsible for any tax payable on the trust income. This means that before an estate or trust is wound up and its assets distributed, all income must be returned and enough funds retained to pay any tax due. The trustee must file a tax return to the date of winding up, which must show the final distribution of the income. www.ird.govt.nz 31 Part 6 - Provisional tax The principle of provisional tax The principle of provisional tax is that a trust pays tax as it earns income, instead of having a large tax bill at the end of the year. Provisional tax is charged in instalments during an income year. When the trust files its tax return, it can claim a credit for the provisional tax it's paid during the year. Circumstances when a trust must pay provisional tax One of the important concepts in provisional tax is residual income tax (RIT). This is the amount of tax payable on the trust's income for the year, after deducting any allowable tax credits (but not provisional tax payments). This includes tax payable by the trustee on both beneficiary income and trustee income. • If a trust's RIT is $2,500 or less, the trust doesn't have to pay provisional tax for the following year, but it can choose to make voluntary payments. • If a trust's RIT is more than $2,500, the trust will generally have to pay provisional tax for the following income year. There are three different methods for calculating the amount of provisional tax payable: the standard option, the estimation option or the ratio option. These methods are explained on pages 32 and 33. • If a trust's RIT is more than $2,500, but the trust expects its RIT at the end of the following year to be $2,500 or less, it can estimate its provisional tax at nil. However, before making such an estimate please read the section on use-of-money interest - see page 33. Provisional tax calculation methods Standard option Provisional tax calculations may change from year to year. For current and past rates go to www.ird.govt.nz (keywords: standard options). If a trust uses the standard option, it can change to the estimation option at any time up until the due date of the final instalment of provisional tax. If a trust using the standard option wishes to change to the ratio option it must elect to use the ratio before the tax year in which it wants to use the ratio. TRUSTS AND ESTATES 32 Estimation option A trust can choose to estimate its provisional tax by estimating its income for the year and then calculating the tax on it. This is usually beneficial for trusts that expect the following year's income to be less than the current year's income. If the trust used the standard option in this situation, it would end up paying more tax than it had to during the year, and then receive a refund at the end of the year. However, if a trust chooses the estimation option and the RIT is greater than the provisional tax paid, it can be charged interest from the first instalment date and may be liable for a shortfall penalty of 20% of the underpaid provisional tax for lack of reasonable care. Once a trust chooses the estimation option, it can't switch to the standard or ratio option during that income year. However, it can change the amount of the estimation at any time up until the due date for the final instalment of provisional tax. An estimate must be fair and reasonable at each instalment date. Note Ratio option From the 2008-2009 tax year, trusts are able to pay their provisional tax in line with when income is received. This option is only available to GST-registered trusts. Using the ratio option, six provisional tax instalments are made based on a trust's GST turnover. We'll calculate a percentage based on the prior year's RIT divided by the total GST supplies for the corresponding year. To calculate each provisional tax instalment, a trust multiplies the percentage which is preprinted on their GST103 return, by the total taxable supplies for the two-month period (monthly payers will add the taxable supplies for two return periods). If a trust makes the correct ratio payments by the due dates, it won't be charged interest if the provisional tax falls short of the RIT for the year. To use the ratio option, a trust must apply by phone or in writing before the start of the tax year they want to use this option in. www.ird.govt.nz 33 Use-of-money interest (UOMI) Only tax on trustee income is subject to UOMI. We won't charge or pay interest on tax on the trust's beneficiary income. If the trust's RIT on trustee income is more than $2,500, and the trust has paid too much provisional tax for this income, we may pay interest. However, if the provisional tax paid is less than the RIT, we may charge interest. There are changes to when UOMI is charged for the 2018 income year onwards There are changes in debit and credit use-of-money interest (UOMI) on provisional tax for the 2018 income year onwards when using the standard option, and when changing from the standard option to the estimation option for the final instalment, provided all required payments are made in full and on time. There is no change to debit or credit use-of-money interest when using the estimation option instalment(s) other than at the final instalment. When determining the interest start date, the $50,000 RIT threshold for individuals using the standard option has been increased to $60,000. This threshold will also apply to non-individuals, including trusts. Provisional tax amount End of year residual income tax (RIT) Credit or debit UOMICalculated from More than RIT amount Less than $60,000 Credit UOMI calculated on the difference between the provisional tax amount paid and the RIT Terminal tax due date More than RIT $60,000 or more Credit UOMI calculated on the difference between the provisional tax amount paid and the RIT Final instalment date Less than RIT $60,000 or more Debit UOMI calculated on the difference between the provisional tax amount paid and the RIT Final instalment date Less than RIT Less than $60,000 Debit UOMI calculated on the difference between the provisional tax amount paid and the RIT Terminal tax due date If the trust has paid all but the last instalment in full and on time using the standard option then UOMI will apply from the final instalment due date. This will also apply if the trust has changed to the estimation option at or before the final instalment date due date. TRUSTS AND ESTATES 34 If the trust has paid an instalment late or doesn't pay it at all UOMI will be charged from the due date of the instalment on the lesser of: • the amount of the instalment that was paid less the amount that should have paid, or • your RIT divided by the number of instalments for the tax year less the amount paid. The above changes may not apply if the trust: • is associated to a company and they aren't covered by the above standard option rules or they don't use the GST ratio option, or • has entered a provisional tax interest avoidance arrangement. Interest applies from the day after each provisional tax instalment date, if the RIT on trustee income is more than $2,500 when using the estimation option for the instalments other than the final instalment date. If they have elected to use the ratio option, interest applies from the day after the terminal tax due date. If the trust's RIT on trustee income is $2,500 or less, and it's paid too much provisional tax for trustee income, it can elect to be a provisional tax payer for that year. The trust may then still be paid interest on the overpaid provisional tax. A trust may elect to be a provisional tax payer if: • it expects to have RIT on trustee income of more than $2,500, and • it pays provisional tax on trustee income of more than $2,500 by the last provisional tax instalment date. If you experience problems with the way UOMI for the trust is calculated, call us on 0800 377 774. Any UOMI charged will generally be tax-deductible, while UOMI received is treated as gross income. If a trust is charged UOMI, it should be paid by the due date for paying its end-of-year tax bill (usually 7 February, or 7 April if the trust has a tax agent). However, interest will continue to be charged on a daily basis until the tax is paid. The only way to stop interest from accruing is to pay the unpaid tax on trustee income. Further information For more information on provisional tax and UOMI, read our Provisional tax (IR289) guide. www.ird.govt.nz 35 Late payment penalties If tax isn't paid by the due date, a late payment penalty will be charged. An initial 1% late payment penalty will be charged on the day after the due date. A further 4% penalty will be charged if there's still an amount of unpaid tax (including penalties) at the end of the 7th day from the due date. For income years before 2018 Every month after the due date, a further 1% will be added to any unpaid amount (including penalties). Penalties aren't charged on unpaid amounts less than $100.

In this guide, the term "trust" also applies to estates unless specifically stated otherwise. This information doesn't apply to unit trusts (as these are treated as companies for income tax purposes) or trusts that are superannuation funds (as different rules apply). A glossary of terms is on page 6. Trust returns If your trust won't have any taxable income in any tax year, please call us on 0800 377 774 with the name and IRD number of the trust so we can record that a return isn't required for that year. However, if the trust receives any assessable income, eg, interest, the trustee must file a return, regardless of the amount derived. If the trust subsequently derives assessable income in a future year, the trust must send in a return. This only applies to trust returns. Estates are still required to file a return of income, regardless of whether or not they have derived assessable income. TRUSTS AND ESTATES 6 Glossary Associated persons Associated persons are defined as: • two companies • a company and a person other than a company • two relatives • a person and a trustee for a relative • a trustee and a beneficiary • trustees with a common settlor • a trustee and a settlor • a settlor and a beneficiary • a trustee and a person with the power of appointment or removal of the trustee • a partnership and a partner • two persons who are each associated with the same third person (tripartite test). For full details on associated persons read A guide to associated persons definitions for income tax purposes (IR620). You can download this from www.ird.govt.nz "Forms and guides". Charitable trust A charitable trust is one in which the income can be used only for charitable purposes. For more information on charitable trusts, read our guide Charitable organisations (IR255). Corpus This is the market value of any property settled on a trust, at the date of settlement. Disposition of property Any form of transfer, conveyance, assignment, settlement, delivery, payment or other allocation of property to a trust (or for its benefit) is a disposition of property. This includes dispositions made under a person's will and through intestacy (dying without a will). Inter vivos trust This is a trust settled during the lifetime of the settlor. This term is used when working out whether trustee income from overseas is subject to New Zealand income tax. ird.govt.nz 7 Resident You are a New Zealand tax resident in any of these situations: • you're in New Zealand for more than 183 days in any twelve-month period, or • you have an enduring relationship with New Zealand, or • you have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, or • you're away from New Zealand in the service of the New Zealand Government. Testamentary trust A trust created by a person's will, codicil or intestacy (dying without a will), or by a court order at the time of the person's death. Transitional resident A transitional resident is an individual who has arrived in New Zealand after 1 April 2006 and qualifies for a temporary tax exemption on their foreign income. To qualify as a transitional resident, the individual must not have been resident in New Zealand for the last 10 years, or have been a transitional resident before. For more information see, "Temporary tax exemption on foreign income for new migrants and returning New Zealanders" at www.ird.govt.nz TRUSTS AND ESTATES 8 Part 1 - Explaining the important concepts How a trust starts To create a trust, a person (the settlor) gives money or property to another person (the trustee), to be held in trust for the benefit of either the trust's beneficiaries, or a purpose recognised by law. There should be a signed trust deed (agreement) that acknowledges the settlement, but it's possible to establish a trust verbally. Trustees The trustee holds the trust's property in trust for the beneficiary, and administers or manages the trust. A trustee includes an executor or administrator of an estate, which may be the Public Trustee or the Mäori Trustee. Companies may also act as trustees. Settlors When a trustee of a trust owes an amount to a beneficiary of the trust, the beneficiary does not become a settlor when either: • the trust pays the beneficiary a market interest rate equal to or greater than the prescribed rate of interest, or • the amount retained in the beneficiary’s current account at the end of the income year is not more than $25,000. Note A settlor of the trust can include any person who at any time: • transfers value –to a trust, or –for the benefit of the trust, or –on terms of the trust • provides financial assistance to the trust for its value. These are called settlements. Trusts may also be settled by companies. ird.govt.nz 9 Determining who is a settlor of a trust and whether they're a resident is important for establishing whether the trust's overseas income is taxable in New Zealand. These factors also affect the category of a trust (complying, foreign, or non-complying - explained in Part 2 of this guide) and which distributions to beneficiaries are non- taxable. Settlement A settlement is any action that makes a person a settlor of a trust and includes any of the following: • disposal of any property to the trust for less than market value • property or funds made available to the trust for less than market value • services provided to the trust for less than market value • any property acquired from the trust or any service from the trustee for greater than market value. Settlement also includes any failure to act or enter into any or part of any of the above actions. The courts will only recognise that a valid trust has been created if it's covered in a trust deed. You should seek professional advice about drawing up a trust deed. Note Information a settlor must give us A New Zealand resident settlor must tell us the details within three months of making a settlement on a trust that doesn't have New Zealand resident trustees. The settlor must also give us the names and addresses of the trust's trustees and beneficiaries. For disclosure purposes, a settlement also includes a settlement made as a nominee of another person, or of a nominal amount made at the request of another person. A settlor of a trust who is resident in New Zealand for any part of the income year, may be taxed as an agent of the trustee on trustee income which is derived in that income year, if the trust ceases to have a New Zealand trustee. If all the trustees of the trust cease to be New Zealand residents, the settlor must tell us within three months of the date on which the trust ceased to have a resident trustee. TRUSTS AND ESTATES 10 In each of these situations, the settlor must complete a Settlors of trusts disclosure (IR462) form within three months and send it to us. How the trust earns income Usually, the money or property settled on the trust is used as an investment to earn further revenue, or as capital to fund a trading operation. This revenue becomes the trust's income as it's earned. The initial settlement on the trust isn't income for tax purposes, but the settlor may have to pay gift duty on it if it's received before 1 October 2011, depending on the value of the settlement. Estates The trust tax rules also apply to estates of people who have died, if such an estate continues to earn income after the person's death. When we refer to "trusts" in this guide we also include estates, unless specifically excluded by the context. The trust's income The trust's income is deemed to include certain settlements of property on a trust. • Property settled by a trustee of another trust so long as it would have counted as income if that trust had distributed the property to one of its beneficiaries instead (see page 21). • A settlement of property on a trust, which would, if not for the settlement, have constituted: –gross income of the settlor, or –a dividend for which the settlor would have, if not for settlement, been liable to deduct FDP (foreign dividend payment) if the settlor is a resident or if the settlor had been a resident in New Zealand and subject to our income tax laws at that time. • A settlement of property on a trust for which the settlor claims a deduction from gross income for New Zealand tax purposes. These property settlements are excluded from the definition of corpus. ird.govt.nz 11 The trust's income is separated into two parts for tax purposes: beneficiary income and trustee income. The tax on these two parts is then calculated separately, to arrive at the total tax payable on the trust's income. Here's how the income is allocated: • Beneficiary income is an amount of income derived by a trustee of the trust and allocated to a beneficiary during any income year that either: –vests absolutely in the beneficiary during that income year, or –is paid or applied for the benefit of the beneficiary within six months after the end of that income year. • Trustee income is all income the trust earns in its income year that: –does not vest absolutely in the beneficiary during that income year, or –is not paid or applied for the benefit of the beneficiary within six months after the end of that income year. Trusts can make other types of distributions, some of which will also be taxable. These other distributions are explained in Part 4 of this guide. How the trust's tax is calculated depends on the type of trust, and whether the settlor and/or trustees are New Zealand residents. The different types of trust are explained in Part 2 of this guide. Foreign trusts disclosure and record keeping rules Resident foreign trustees (including complying resident foreign trustees) are required, for each foreign trust they administer, to: • complete and submit to us a Foreign trust disclosure (IR607) form, and • keep financial and other records for New Zealand tax purposes. You can get the IR607 from our website www.ird.govt.nz "Forms and guides", or by emailing competent.authority@ird.govt.nz Disclosures must be completed by resident foreign trustees appointed: • if on or after 1 October 2006, within 30 days after the later of the date of appointment as a trustee, or the date of the trustee's arrival in New Zealand • if before 1 October 2006, within 60 days after the later of 1 October 2006, or the date of the trustee's arrival in New Zealand. More information Full details of the rules are in the Tax Information Bulletin Vol 18, No 5 (June 2006). TRUSTS AND ESTATES 12 Part 2 - Different types of trusts For income tax purposes, there are three types of trust: • complying trusts • foreign trusts • non-complying trusts. The type of trust is important, because it determines whether some distributions from a trust are taxable. Complying trusts A complying trust is one that has been taxed in New Zealand on all its trustee income since the date it began. Complying trusts include: • trusts settled by New Zealand residents with New Zealand trustees • estates of people who were New Zealand residents when they died • other trusts which have elected to become a complying trust. A trust remains a complying trust if, since settlement of the trust, the trustees have satisfied all their obligations for its income tax liabilities. A trust isn't a complying trust if: • the only trustee income is non-resident passive income, or • the trustees earn foreign-sourced income excluded from the meaning of gross income. If a trust ceases to meet the conditions for a complying trust in an income year, it will no longer be a complying trust - it will generally become a non-complying trust (see definition on page 13). A complying trust won't lose its complying status simply because one or more of the following apply: • the trust has no trustee income and there is no tax liability • the only trustee income is tax-exempt • the trust's deductible expenses or losses exceed the trustee income, so there is no tax payable on the net trustee income. ird.govt.nz 13 Foreign trusts A trust will be a foreign trust if none of its settlors have been resident in New Zealand since the later of these dates: • 17 December 1987 • the date the trust was first settled. A trust will cease to be a foreign trust if it makes any distribution after a settlor becomes a New Zealand resident, or if a New Zealand resident makes a settlement on the trust. Non-complying trusts A non-complying trust is any trust that is neither a complying trust nor a foreign trust at the time it makes a distribution. See page 23 for more information on distributions from a non-complying trust. It's generally a trust that has a resident settlor, has been established overseas with non-resident trustees, and hasn't been liable for New Zealand income tax since it was first settled. It also includes a trust where its trustee income has been liable for full New Zealand tax but the trustees haven't paid the tax. New arrivals in New Zealand New residents who arrive in New Zealand may have settled a trust before they arrived in this country. Such a trust would normally be a foreign trust, but it can elect to become a complying trust. The benefits of such an election will become clearer in Part 4 of this guide, because the type of trust affects how some distributions to beneficiaries are taxed. To change types, the trust must elect to pay New Zealand income tax on its trustee income within 12 months of when the settlor first arrives in New Zealand, unless the settlor is a transitional resident\*. If the settlor isn't a transitional resident the trustee income will become taxable in New Zealand, from the date the trust makes the election. If the settlor is a transitional resident, the 12 months to elect to change trust types starts on the date the settlor ceases to be a transitional resident. The trust should use an Election to pay income tax on trustee income (IR463) form to make this election. \* See glossary TRUSTS AND ESTATES 14 If the trust doesn't make an election, it'll be treated as one of the following: • a foreign trust, for any distribution that consists of income, capital profits or capital gains derived before the election expiry date • a non-complying trust, for any distribution that consists of income, capital profits or capital gains derived after the election expiry date. ird.govt.nz 15 Part 3 - How the trust's income is taxed Tax on trustee income The tax on a trust's trustee income (explained on page 11) is calculated at a flat rate of 33 cents in the dollar for all three different types of trust. General rule The trustee is liable for New Zealand income tax on income derived from New Zealand, irrespective of where the trustee lives. The trustee is also liable for New Zealand income tax on income derived from outside New Zealand where: • any settlor is resident in New Zealand at any time during the income year, or • any settlor of an inter vivos or a testamentary trust died while they were resident in New Zealand and a trustee is resident in New Zealand at any time during the income year. Exceptions to the general rule There are two situations in which a trustee isn't liable for income tax on trustee income derived from outside New Zealand. These apply where the trustee is resident outside New Zealand at all times during the income year and either: • no settlement has been made on the trust since 17 December 1987, or • the only settlements made on the trust were by settlors who weren't resident in New Zealand at the time of settlement and who haven't been resident in New Zealand since 17 December 1987. Neither exception applies where an election to pay tax on trustee income has been made by the trustee. These exceptions don't affect the liability to income tax for any settlor of the trust, for example, where the settlor elects to pay tax on trustee income. The trustee income remains liable for income tax for the purpose of determining whether the trust is a complying trust. TRUSTS AND ESTATES 16 Settlor liability If a trust was settled before 17 December 1987, and no settlement has been made on the trust since then, the settlor isn't liable for tax on trustee income unless they elect to pay tax on it. Any settlor of a trust who is a resident in New Zealand at any time during the income year is liable for income tax on trustee income as an agent of the trustee, with certain exceptions. If there's more than one New Zealand resident settlor, these settlors are jointly liable for the tax on trustee income. This means that any or all of the New Zealand resident settlors are liable for this tax. The New Zealand resident settlor won't be liable for the income tax on trustee income if any of these conditions are met. • A trustee is resident in New Zealand at all times during the income year. • The settlor, being a natural person (not a company), wasn't a New Zealand resident at the time they made any settlement on the trust, unless the settlor elects to pay tax on trustee income. • The settlor can show to our satisfaction that their share of the trust's tax liability is excessive, taking into account the settlements on the trust made by all settlors. • The trustee income is derived by the application of the accruals rules of the Income Tax Act to any amounts remitted by the settlor under any financial arrangement. Provisional tax If a trust's residual income tax (RIT) at the end of an income year is more than $2,500, it will generally have to pay provisional tax on the following year's income. RIT is the amount of tax due at the end of the year, after deducting all tax credits the trust can claim (except provisional tax payments). Provisional tax for trusts is explained fully in Part 6 of this guide. ird.govt.nz 17 Tax on beneficiary income New Zealand resident beneficiaries Beneficiaries who are New Zealand residents are liable for New Zealand income tax on all their income, from any source in the world. Beneficiary income they receive from any trust will be taxable in New Zealand, at their normal income tax rates. Beneficiaries under 16 may be subject to special rules. For more information, please see page 18. From the 2004-2005 income year, any amount derived by the trustee of a community trust is exempt from income tax. The distributions from community trusts aren't taxed on beneficiary income, instead they're included in the gross income of the beneficiaries. The trustee must pay tax on behalf of the beneficiary for income allocated to that beneficiary. The beneficiary can then claim a tax credit for the tax paid on their behalf. Beneficiaries are required to return all income received in their own personal tax return. However, the trustee and beneficiary can agree between themselves not to have tax deducted from trust income before the beneficiary receives it. This is called having the income "transferred direct", and it may be useful in cases such as when the beneficiary has other tax losses to offset against the trust income in their tax return. If the income is transferred direct and the beneficiary doesn't pay any tax on it, the trustees can still be held liable for the unpaid tax. Any distributions made from a non-complying trust to the beneficiary is taxed at 45%. If the trust subsequently gains its complying status, that distribution will be reversed. There are also some other trust distributions beneficiaries must declare for income tax purposes. These are explained in Part 4 of this guide. The nature of the trust's income continues when allocated to the beneficiaries. So interest earned by the trust and allocated to a beneficiary is interest income of the beneficiary. TRUSTS AND ESTATES 18 Timing of allocation of beneficiary income From the 2009-2010 income year onwards, the date by which income allocation to beneficiaries must be allocated, is the later of: • six months after balance date, or • the earlier of: –the date on which the trustee files the return of income for the income year, or –the date by which the trustee must file a return for the income year. Olive Family Trust is allocating income to beneficiaries for the year ended 31 March 2012. The trust return is due on 7 July 2012. The income should be allocated by: • 30 September 2012, or • the earlier of: –the date the return is filed, or –7 July 2012. Example If the trust has a tax agent, the extension of time for filing an income tax return still applies. Special rules for beneficiaries who are children (the "minor beneficiary rule") The minor beneficiary rule applies to income derived from 1 April 2001 or the equivalent income year. Certain distributions of beneficiary income to children under 16 (minors) on the balance date of the trust must be taxed at a final tax rate of 33%. The rule doesn't apply to income derived in that income year if the minor turned 16 during that year. Minor beneficiary income is taxed as trustees' income and isn't the minor's gross income. For the purposes of entries in a beneficiary's account with a trust, the tax on beneficiary income, although taxed as trustees' income, is still treated as being paid on behalf of the beneficiary. ird.govt.nz 19 The minor beneficiary rule applies to beneficiary income derived by a minor from property settled on a trust by: • a relative or legal guardian of the minor, or • a person associated with a relative or legal guardian. The rule applies to all beneficiary income distributed to a minor from a trust unless all the settlements on that trust were made: • by a settlor who received the property as an agent for the beneficiary from someone other than a relative, guardian or their associate • by a settlor who's been ordered by a court to pay damages or compensation to the minor • by a settlor against whom a protection order has been made under section 14 of the Domestic Violence Act 1995.\* • under the terms of a will, codicil, intestacy or any variations of these by a court, if the minor or their brother or sister, or half-brother or half-sister, was alive within 12 months after the date of the settlor's death. If a trust includes some settlements that fit within one of these criteria, and some settlements that don't, special rules apply. For more information see your tax agent or call us on 0800 377 774. The rule doesn't apply if: • the minor is a non-resident • the minor receives a child disability allowance under the Social Security Act 2018 • the minor receives beneficiary income from a group investment fund or Ma ̄ori authority • the beneficiary income derived is $1,000 or less in an income year. However, if the beneficiary's income is over $1,000, all the beneficiary income is subject to the rule. \* This exception only applies if the minor is a protected person in relation to the protection order and the settlement on the trust is made before the protection order is made, or during the time the protection order is in force. TRUSTS AND ESTATES 20 Beneficiaries and provisional tax If a beneficiary's residual income tax (RIT) is more than $2,500, they will generally have to pay provisional tax for the following year. RIT is the amount of tax due at the end of the year, after deducting all tax credits the beneficiary can claim, including tax paid by the trustee on the beneficiary's behalf, but excluding provisional tax payments. Our guide Provisional tax (IR289) explains these rules. Non-resident beneficiaries The trust must deduct NRWT (non-resident withholding tax) from any interest, dividends or royalties before the non-resident beneficiary receives them. This withholding tax is the final tax payable on the income. They should be able to claim a credit for their tax paid in their overseas tax return. Other income, such as income from a rental property, will be subject to New Zealand income tax at the normal rates. Beneficiary income retains its nature in the beneficiary's hands - for example, if the trust earned the income from dividends, the beneficiary should return it as dividends in their overseas tax return. Note If a trust has non-resident beneficiaries, our NRWT - payer's guide (IR291) contains information the trust administrators will need to know. If a beneficiary isn't a New Zealand resident, and they receive beneficiary income that didn't come from New Zealand sources, the beneficiary won't have to pay New Zealand income tax on this income. Beneficiaries temporarily ceasing to be resident If a beneficiary ceases to be a New Zealand resident and then becomes a New Zealand resident again within five years, they must pay New Zealand income tax on any beneficiary income or taxable distributions (explained in Part 4) received from a foreign or non-complying trust. In this situation, any beneficiary income or taxable distributions the beneficiary received while they were a non-resident, will be taxable as such in the year in which the beneficiary again becomes a New Zealand resident. ird.govt.nz 21 Part 4 - Other distributions to beneficiaries As well as distributing beneficiary income, as explained in Part 3, a trust can distribute money or assets to its beneficiaries by: • distributing trustee income accumulated in previous years • distributing capital profits or gains made from disposing of some of its assets or property • supplying trust property or services to the beneficiary for less than full value • acquiring property or services from the beneficiary for more than full value • making a distribution from the trust's corpus • settling sums or property for the benefit of another trust to the extent that if distributed to a beneficiary resident in New Zealand, the sum or property would have constituted beneficiary income or a taxable distribution to that beneficiary. A beneficiary who receives such a distribution may have to pay income tax on it. This will depend on the type of trust making the distribution. This is why the difference between complying trusts, foreign trusts and non-complying trusts is significant. Distributions of accumulated trustee income and capital profits or gains that were derived by the trust in the 1988 or earlier income years aren't treated as taxable distributions. Distributions from complying trusts If a complying trust makes a distribution of any of the types listed above, the beneficiary receiving the distribution won't have to pay income tax on it. This is the principal advantage of being a complying trust. TRUSTS AND ESTATES 22 Distributions from foreign trusts When a foreign trust makes a distribution of any of the types listed on page 21, it will be a taxable distribution unless it's from the trust's corpus, or from capital profits or gains from transactions with non-associated persons (an adjustment is made for any capital loss incurred in the year the profit was realised). This means the beneficiary must pay tax on the distribution at their normal tax rate. Order of sources of distributions to beneficiaries When a foreign trust makes a distribution to a beneficiary, for tax purposes the distribution will be considered to have come from different sources in the following order: 1. Income the trust derived that is beneficiary income in the previous income year – see page 18 2. Income the trust derived in the current income year. 3. Income (other than beneficiary income) the trust derived in a previous income year (accumulated trustee income). 4. Any capital profit or gain realised in the current income year. 5. Any accumulated capital profit or gain realised in previous income years. 6. The corpus of the trust. However, there are certain distributions not subject to the order listed above. These are: • any distribution from a non-discretionary trust: –created by will, codicil or court order modifying the will or codicil –created on an intestacy, or –on which no settlement has been made since 17 December 1987 • any distribution from a foreign trust that has elected to become a complying trust • any distribution under which a beneficiary acquired trust property for less than market value • any distribution under which a beneficiary acquired services from the trust for less than market value. Except for the last two items in this list, the distributions are deemed to consist of amounts that reflect the terms of the trust deed, or that the trustee(s) determine(s). If a foreign trust doesn't keep enough records to accurately show the source of a distribution, it will be a taxable distribution. ird.govt.nz 23 Distributions that are taxable to the beneficiary If a New Zealand resident beneficiary receives a taxable distribution from a foreign trust, this distribution must be included in the beneficiary's tax return as part of their assessable income. This is on top of any beneficiary income the beneficiary receives from the trust. The beneficiary will then pay tax on the distribution at their normal income tax rates. If the beneficiary receiving the distribution from a foreign trust isn't a New Zealand resident, then they only have to pay New Zealand income tax on any part of the distribution that came from a source in New Zealand. Distributions from non-complying trusts When a non-complying trust makes a distribution of any of the types listed on page 21, it will be taxable unless it's from the trust's corpus. If the beneficiary receiving the distribution from a non-complying trust is a New Zealand resident, it's included in the person's tax return with their other income for the year. It will be taxed at a flat rate of 45 cents in the dollar. Distributions of beneficiary income are taxed at the beneficiary's normal tax rates. A complying trust which has become a non-complying trust because of the trustee's income tax obligations not being met, will become a complying trust retrospectively if the trustee satisfies their obligations, including penalties and interest. When a non-complying trust makes a distribution to a beneficiary, the same rules of order listed on page 22 apply. If a beneficiary has a tax loss from some other source If a beneficiary receives a taxable distribution from a non-complying trust, and that beneficiary has a loss or a loss to carry forward from some other source, they can claim a deduction against the distribution. Use this formula to calculate the amount of this deduction: a× b c In this formula: a is the amount of loss or loss carried forward b is the rate of tax on trustee income - 33 cents in the dollar (0.33) c is 45 cents in the dollar (0.45). TRUSTS AND ESTATES 24 Foreign tax credits Credits for foreign tax paid on a taxable distribution can only be claimed if the tax deducted by the foreign country is similar to New Zealand NRWT. Electing to become a complying trust There are some situations in which a foreign trust or a non-complying trust can elect to become a complying trust. If they want to do this, either the trustee, the settlor or the beneficiary must elect to pay tax on the trustees' worldwide income. The trustee income will then be taxed in New Zealand (when it otherwise may not have been taxable here), in the same way as a complying trust. This then allows it to make non-taxable distributions to its beneficiaries. The person making this election should fill in an Election to pay income tax on trustee income (IR463) form and send it to us. Once an election has been made the person will need to indicate that the trust continues to qualify as a complying trust in their tax return each year or, if they are a non-active trust, through their myIR account each year. The following three types of trust can elect to become complying trusts if they make the election within the relevant time limits - see the following pages. New residents A trust settled by a non-resident settlor who became a New Zealand resident after 17 December 1987 may elect to become a complying trust. This election must be made within 12 months of the settlor becoming a New Zealand resident. Unless the settlor is a transitional resident\*, the 12 months to change trust type starts on the date the settlor ceases to be a transitional resident. If the trust makes an election it will be treated either as: • a foreign trust, for any distribution of income, capital profits or capital gains the trust derived before it made the election, or • a complying trust, for any distribution of income, capital profits or capital gains the trust derived after it made the election. \* See glossary ird.govt.nz 25 This treatment doesn't apply if the trust fails to pay the tax on the trustees' income. The trust will be treated as a non-complying trust for any distributions made in the income year in which the tax isn't paid and in subsequent income years. Only distributions from amounts derived after the trust made the election will be treated as having been made from a non-complying trust. If the election is made part-way through an income year, the income, profits or capital gains for the year must be allocated to the appropriate period that the trust was a foreign or complying trust, according to the date they were derived on. Settled in 1989 or later income years A non-complying or foreign trust settled during the 1989 or later income years, and not otherwise liable to New Zealand income tax on its trustee income, may elect to become a complying trust. The election must be made within the time for filing the trust’s tax return for the income year of settlement. If New Zealand income tax is paid on all trustee income derived since the date of settlement, the trust will meet the complying trust definition at the date of the distribution. Complying trusts no longer liable for New Zealand tax A trust that was formerly a complying trust, but ceased to be liable for New Zealand income tax on its trustee income (for example, if the settlor becomes a non-resident), ceases to be a complying trust. However, such a trust can elect or re-elect to be a complying trust. The election must be made within the time for filing the tax return for the income year in which the trust ceased to be a complying trust. The income tax liability relating to trustee income for each income years since the trust began must also be satisfied. The trust will again be treated as a complying trust from the date it would otherwise have ceased to be liable for New Zealand tax. If no election is made, the trust will become a non-complying trust. To become a complying trust, it must make its election before the relevant time limit expires. Late elections cannot be accepted. Note TRUSTS AND ESTATES 26 Part 5 - Tax returns for trusts and beneficiaries The trust's tax return The trustee must file an IR6 tax return for the trust each year. This return is separate from the trustee's own personal tax return. In the IR6 return the trustee shows: • all income derived by the trust, including any income from a Mäori authority • the tax credits relating to that income • the allocation of income between beneficiary income and trustee income, and • any taxable distributions made. The trustee then calculates the tax payable on the beneficiary income, trustee income and taxable distributions. Allocation of RWT credits Any associated tax credits are generally also allocated in the same proportion as the income. However, if a trustee is paying income tax on beneficiary income on behalf of the beneficiaries, the trustee has the option of detaching some or all of the RWT credits associated with the resident passive income distributed to beneficiaries and reallocating the credits between beneficiaries and trustee to satisfy the income tax on beneficiary income and trustee income. The option of detaching RWT credits is only available to a trustee who pays income tax on beneficiary income on behalf of the beneficiaries. Note If the trustee detaches RWT credits from resident passive income distributed to a beneficiary (Beneficiary A), the trustee must pay Beneficiary A an RWT substitution payment equal to the amount of the detached RWT credits. The trustee can then either: • Reallocate the detached RWT credits to Beneficiary B by meeting Beneficiary B’s income tax on beneficiary income; • Retain the detached RWT credits to satisfy income tax on trustee income; or • A combination of both. The reallocated or retained RWT credit is not income of either Beneficiary B or the trustee – it is the transfer of RWT credits. ird.govt.nz 27 The RWT credits available to Beneficiary A are then reduced by the amount of the RWT substitution payment. The RWT substitution payment is treated as resident passive income that is beneficiary income of Beneficiary A. However, there is no liability or obligation on the trustee to withhold RWT in relation to the RWT substitution payment. The practical effect of the reallocation exercise is that the RWT credit is transferred from one taxpayer (Beneficiary A) to another (Beneficiary B or trustee) and the transferred RWT credit is used to satisfy the trustee’s obligations for satisfying the income tax liability on trustee income and/or Beneficiary B’s beneficiary income. Reallocating the RWT credits also means that Beneficiary A will not need to seek a refund from the Commissioner for the excess RWT credits and, instead, receives a cash payment from the trustee in substitution for the RWT credits. The trustee of the Olive Family trust derives $100 in interest, from which 33% tax has been deducted, leaving $67 in cash, and the trustee receives an entitlement to $33 in RWT credits. The Olive Family trust distributes all of the interest to Brook as beneficiary income, with Brook receiving $67 in cash and $33 in RWT credits. Brook has a marginal tax rate of 17.5%, which means her tax liability on her beneficiary income is $17.50. Since the trustee is paying income tax on beneficiary income for Brook, the trustee can detach $15.50 from the RWT credits allocated to Brook and pay her cash of $15.50 in substitution for the detached RWT credit. This leaves Brook with $17.50 of RWT tax credit – enough to satisfy her income tax on beneficiary income. Brook is in the same position as if she had obtained a refund of the excess RWT credit from the Commissioner. The trustee can retain the detached RWT credit of $15.50 to satisfy income tax on trustee income. Example Allocation of imputation credits The imputation credits must be allocated in proportion to the total distributions received from the trust. This also applies to Mäori authority credits and FDP (foreign dividend payment) credits attached to dividends distributed as beneficiary income. This means a trust can't choose to allocate credits to beneficiaries who may be better able to use them than other beneficiaries. TRUSTS AND ESTATES 28 Use this formula to allocate the imputation and FDP credits: a× b c In this formula: a is the total imputation and FDP credits attached to all dividends distributed to beneficiaries during the income year b is the total distribution, including capital distributions, to the particular beneficiary during the income year c is the total distributions made to all beneficiaries during the income year. The beneficiaries can then claim a credit for tax paid on their beneficiary income and taxable distributions (and their share of tax credits) in their personal income tax returns. Where a trust has no prospect or intention of deriving any assessable income in a given financial year, please call us on 0800 377 774 with the name and IRD number of the trust so we can record that a return isn't required for that year. However, if the trust receives any assessable income, for example, interest, the trustee must file a return, regardless of the amount derived. If the trust subsequently derives assessable income in a future year, the trust must send in a return. This only applies to trust returns. Estates are still required to file a return of income regardless of whether or not they have derived assessable income. Note The beneficiaries' tax returns A person who receives beneficiary income from any type of trust, or a taxable distribution from a foreign trust, must include this income in their tax return for that year and pay tax on it at their normal rates. If the trust has deducted tax before paying the income to the beneficiary, the beneficiary can claim a credit for this tax deducted. However, if the tax was deducted overseas, the maximum credit a New Zealand beneficiary can claim is the amount of New Zealand income tax payable on their share of the overseas trust income. If the trust's balance date isn't 31 March, the beneficiary must include any income from the trust in their tax return for the year that corresponds with the trust's accounting year. There's no need to make any separate calculations to allow for a difference in balance dates. ird.govt.nz 29 If a person receives beneficiary income or taxable distributions from a foreign or non-complying trust, they should fill in the details of the trust income on a Schedule of beneficiary's estate or trust income (IR307) form, and include this with their tax return. If the trust has a New Zealand tax agent, they will usually fill in an IR307 form for each beneficiary to include with their individual tax return. These forms will then show the beneficiaries how much income to declare, and the amount of any tax credits to claim. Any taxable distributions a beneficiary receives from a non-complying trust are to be included separately in the beneficiary's tax return. These distributions will be taxed separately at a flat rate of 45 cents in the dollar. Note Tax returns for a deceased person's estate The personal representative, executor or administrator of a deceased person's estate must file all tax returns the deceased person would otherwise have had to file and make sure any tax due is paid. The tax return to be used for the period to the date of death is an Individual tax return (IR3). The return must show their IRD number and include all gross income the deceased person derived up until that date. After the date of death, the person's estate will get a new IRD number and any income must be returned in an Income tax return: Estate or Trust (IR6). The first estate return will include all income derived and expenditure incurred from the date of death until the end of the return period. Even after an estate has been wound up, we can audit the deceased person's tax returns for previous years. If more tax becomes payable as a result of such an audit, the estate is still liable to pay this tax. If there are no estate funds available because the final distribution has been made, the executor or administrator is liable for the extra tax assessed. Charitable trusts or estates A trust will be a charitable trust if all income the trustee derives is held solely for charitable purposes, and no person associated with the trust can gain any personal profit from it. There are special tax exemptions available to charitable trusts and estates. You'll find more information about charitable trusts and estates in our Charitable organisations (IR255) guide. TRUSTS AND ESTATES 30 Final trust or estate return The trustees of a trust or estate are personally responsible for any tax payable on the trust income. This means that before an estate or trust is wound up and its assets distributed, all income must be returned and enough funds retained to pay any tax due. The trustee must file a tax return to the date of winding up, which must show the final distribution of the income. ird.govt.nz 31 Part 6 - Provisional tax The principle of provisional tax The principle of provisional tax is that a trust pays tax as it earns income, instead of having a large tax bill at the end of the year. Provisional tax is charged in instalments during an income year. When the trust files its tax return, it can claim a credit for the provisional tax it's paid during the year. Circumstances when a trust must pay provisional tax One of the important concepts in provisional tax is residual income tax (RIT). This is the amount of tax payable on the trust's income for the year, after deducting any allowable tax credits (but not provisional tax payments). This includes tax payable by the trustee on both beneficiary income and trustee income. • If a trust's RIT is $2,500 or less, the trust doesn't have to pay provisional tax for the following year, but it can choose to make voluntary payments. • If a trust's RIT is more than $2,500, the trust will generally have to pay provisional tax for the following income year. There are three different methods for calculating the amount of provisional tax payable: the standard option, the estimation option or the ratio option. These methods are explained on pages 32 and 33. • If a trust's RIT is more than $2,500, but the trust expects its RIT at the end of the following year to be $2,500 or less, it can estimate its provisional tax at nil. However, before making such an estimate please read the section on use-of-money interest - see page 33. Provisional tax calculation methods Standard option Provisional tax calculations may change from year to year. For current and past rates go to www.ird.govt.nz (keywords: standard options). If a trust uses the standard option, it can change to the estimation option at any time up until the due date of the final instalment of provisional tax. If a trust using the standard option wishes to change to the ratio option it must elect to use the ratio before the tax year in which it wants to use the ratio. TRUSTS AND ESTATES 32 Estimation option A trust can choose to estimate its provisional tax by estimating its income for the year and then calculating the tax on it. This is usually beneficial for trusts that expect the following year's income to be less than the current year's income. If the trust used the standard option in this situation, it would end up paying more tax than it had to during the year, and then receive a refund at the end of the year. However, if a trust chooses the estimation option and the RIT is greater than the provisional tax paid, it can be charged interest from the first instalment date and may be liable for a shortfall penalty of 20% of the underpaid provisional tax for lack of reasonable care. Once a trust chooses the estimation option, it can't switch to the standard or ratio option during that income year. However, it can change the amount of the estimation at any time up until the due date for the final instalment of provisional tax. An estimate must be fair and reasonable at each instalment date. Note Ratio option From the 2008-2009 tax year, trusts are able to pay their provisional tax in line with when income is received. This option is only available to GST-registered trusts. Using the ratio option, six provisional tax instalments are made based on a trust's GST turnover. We'll calculate a percentage based on the prior year's RIT divided by the total GST supplies for the corresponding year. To calculate each provisional tax instalment, a trust multiplies the percentage which is preprinted on their GST103 return, by the total taxable supplies for the two-month period (monthly payers will add the taxable supplies for two return periods). If a trust makes the correct ratio payments by the due dates, it won't be charged interest if the provisional tax falls short of the RIT for the year. To use the ratio option, a trust must apply by phone or in writing before the start of the tax year they want to use this option in. ird.govt.nz 33 Use-of-money interest (UOMI) Only tax on trustee income is subject to UOMI. We won't charge or pay interest on tax on the trust's beneficiary income. If the trust's RIT on trustee income is more than $2,500, and the trust has paid too much provisional tax for this income, we may pay interest. However, if the provisional tax paid is less than the RIT, we may charge interest. There are changes to when UOMI is charged for the 2018 income year onwards There are changes in debit and credit use-of-money interest (UOMI) on provisional tax for the 2018 income year onwards when using the standard option, and when changing from the standard option to the estimation option for the final instalment, provided all required payments are made in full and on time. There is no change to debit or credit use-of-money interest when using the estimation option instalment(s) other than at the final instalment. When determining the interest start date, the $50,000 RIT threshold for individuals using the standard option has been increased to $60,000. This threshold will also apply to non-individuals, including trusts. Provisional tax amount End of year residual income tax (RIT) Credit or debit UOMICalculated from More than RIT amount Less than $60,000 Credit UOMI calculated on the difference between the provisional tax amount paid and the RIT Terminal tax due date More than RIT $60,000 or more Credit UOMI calculated on the difference between the provisional tax amount paid and the RIT Final instalment date Less than RIT $60,000 or more Debit UOMI calculated on the difference between the provisional tax amount paid and the RIT Final instalment date Less than RIT Less than $60,000 Debit UOMI calculated on the difference between the provisional tax amount paid and the RIT Terminal tax due date If the trust has paid all but the last instalment in full and on time using the standard option then UOMI will apply from the final instalment due date. This will also apply if the trust has changed to the estimation option at or before the final instalment date due date. TRUSTS AND ESTATES 34 If the trust has paid an instalment late or doesn't pay it at all UOMI will be charged from the due date of the instalment on the lesser of: • the amount of the instalment that was paid less the amount that should have paid, or • your RIT divided by the number of instalments for the tax year less the amount paid. The above changes may not apply if the trust: • is associated to a company and they aren't covered by the above standard option rules or they don't use the GST ratio option, or • has entered a provisional tax interest avoidance arrangement. Interest applies from the day after each provisional tax instalment date, if the RIT on trustee income is more than $2,500 when using the estimation option for the instalments other than the final instalment date. If they have elected to use the ratio option, interest applies from the day after the terminal tax due date. If the trust's RIT on trustee income is $2,500 or less, and it's paid too much provisional tax for trustee income, it can elect to be a provisional tax payer for that year. The trust may then still be paid interest on the overpaid provisional tax. A trust may elect to be a provisional tax payer if: • it expects to have RIT on trustee income of more than $2,500, and • it pays provisional tax on trustee income of more than $2,500 by the last provisional tax instalment date. If you experience problems with the way UOMI for the trust is calculated, call us on 0800 377 774. Any UOMI charged will generally be tax-deductible, while UOMI received is treated as gross income. If a trust is charged UOMI, it should be paid by the due date for paying its end-of-year tax bill (usually 7 February, or 7 April if the trust has a tax agent). However, interest will continue to be charged on a daily basis until the tax is paid. The only way to stop interest from accruing is to pay the unpaid tax on trustee income. Further information For more information on provisional tax and UOMI, read our Provisional tax (IR289) guide. ird.govt.nz 35 Late payment penalties If tax isn't paid by the due date, a late payment penalty will be charged. An initial 1% late payment penalty will be charged on the day after the due date. A further 4% penalty will be charged if there's still an amount of unpaid tax (including penalties) at the end of the 7th day from the due date. For income years before 2018 Every month after the due date, a further 1% will be added to any unpaid amount (including penalties). Penalties aren't charged on unpaid amounts less than $100.

In this guide, the term "trust" also applies to estates unless specifically stated otherwise. This information doesn't apply to unit trusts (as these are treated as companies for income tax purposes) or trusts that are superannuation funds (as different rules apply). A glossary of terms is on page 6. Trust returns If your trust won't have any taxable income in any tax year, please call us on 0800 377 774 with the name and IRD number of the trust so we can record that a return isn't required for that year. However, if the trust receives any assessable income, eg, interest, the trustee must file a return, regardless of the amount derived. If the trust subsequently derives assessable income in a future year, the trust must send in a return. This only applies to trust returns. Estates are still required to file a return of income, regardless of whether or not they have derived assessable income. TRUSTS AND ESTATES 6 Glossary Associated persons Associated persons are defined as: • two companies • a company and a person other than a company • two relatives • a person and a trustee for a relative • a trustee and a beneficiary • trustees with a common settlor • a trustee and a settlor • a settlor and a beneficiary • a trustee and a person with the power of appointment or removal of the trustee • a partnership and a partner • two persons who are each associated with the same third person (tripartite test). For full details on associated persons read A guide to associated persons definitions for income tax purposes (IR620). You can download this from www.ird.govt.nz "Forms and guides". Charitable trust A charitable trust is one in which the income can be used only for charitable purposes. For more information on charitable trusts, read our guide Charitable organisations (IR255). Corpus This is the market value of any property settled on a trust, at the date of settlement. Disposition of property Any form of transfer, conveyance, assignment, settlement, delivery, payment or other allocation of property to a trust (or for its benefit) is a disposition of property. This includes dispositions made under a person's will and through intestacy (dying without a will). Inter vivos trust This is a trust settled during the lifetime of the settlor. This term is used when working out whether trustee income from overseas is subject to New Zealand income tax. ird.govt.nz 7 Resident You are a New Zealand tax resident in any of these situations: • you're in New Zealand for more than 183 days in any twelve-month period, or • you have an enduring relationship with New Zealand, or • you have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, or • you're away from New Zealand in the service of the New Zealand Government. Testamentary trust A trust created by a person's will, codicil or intestacy (dying without a will), or by a court order at the time of the person's death. Transitional resident A transitional resident is an individual who has arrived in New Zealand after 1 April 2006 and qualifies for a temporary tax exemption on their foreign income. To qualify as a transitional resident, the individual must not have been resident in New Zealand for the last 10 years, or have been a transitional resident before. For more information see, "Temporary tax exemption on foreign income for new migrants and returning New Zealanders" at www.ird.govt.nz TRUSTS AND ESTATES 8 Part 1 - Explaining the important concepts How a trust starts To create a trust, a person (the settlor) gives money or property to another person (the trustee), to be held in trust for the benefit of either the trust's beneficiaries, or a purpose recognised by law. There should be a signed trust deed (agreement) that acknowledges the settlement, but it's possible to establish a trust verbally. Trustees The trustee holds the trust's property in trust for the beneficiary, and administers or manages the trust. A trustee includes an executor or administrator of an estate, which may be the Public Trustee or the Mäori Trustee. Companies may also act as trustees. Settlors Note When a trustee of a trust owes an amount to a beneficiary of the trust, the beneficiary does not become a settlor when either: • the trust pays the beneficiary a market interest rate equal to or greater than the prescribed rate of interest, or • the amount retained in the beneficiary’s current account at the end of the income year is not more than $25,000. A settlor of the trust can include any person who at any time: • transfers value –to a trust, or –for the benefit of the trust, or –on terms of the trust • provides financial assistance to the trust for its value. These are called settlements. Trusts may also be settled by companies. ird.govt.nz 9 Determining who is a settlor of a trust and whether they're a resident is important for establishing whether the trust's overseas income is taxable in New Zealand. These factors also affect the category of a trust (complying, foreign, or non-complying - explained in Part 2 of this guide) and which distributions to beneficiaries are non- taxable. Settlement A settlement is any action that makes a person a settlor of a trust and includes any of the following: • disposal of any property to the trust for less than market value • property or funds made available to the trust for less than market value • services provided to the trust for less than market value • any property acquired from the trust or any service from the trustee for greater than market value. Settlement also includes any failure to act or enter into any or part of any of the above actions. Note The courts will only recognise that a valid trust has been created if it’s covered in a trust deed. You should seek professional advice about drawing up a trust deed. Information a settlor must give us A New Zealand resident settlor must tell us the details within three months of making a settlement on a trust that doesn't have New Zealand resident trustees. The settlor must also give us the names and addresses of the trust's trustees and beneficiaries. For disclosure purposes, a settlement also includes a settlement made as a nominee of another person, or of a nominal amount made at the request of another person. A settlor of a trust who is resident in New Zealand for any part of the income year, may be taxed as an agent of the trustee on trustee income which is derived in that income year, if the trust ceases to have a New Zealand trustee. If all the trustees of the trust cease to be New Zealand residents, the settlor must tell us within three months of the date on which the trust ceased to have a resident trustee. TRUSTS AND ESTATES 10 In each of these situations, the settlor must complete a Settlors of trusts disclosure (IR462) form within three months and send it to us. How the trust earns income Usually, the money or property settled on the trust is used as an investment to earn further revenue, or as capital to fund a trading operation. This revenue becomes the trust's income as it's earned. The initial settlement on the trust isn't income for tax purposes, but the settlor may have to pay gift duty on it if it's received before 1 October 2011, depending on the value of the settlement. Estates The trust tax rules also apply to estates of people who have died, if such an estate continues to earn income after the person's death. When we refer to "trusts" in this guide we also include estates, unless specifically excluded by the context. The trust's income The trust's income is deemed to include certain settlements of property on a trust. • Property settled by a trustee of another trust so long as it would have counted as income if that trust had distributed the property to one of its beneficiaries instead (see page 21). • A settlement of property on a trust, which would, if not for the settlement, have constituted: –gross income of the settlor, or –a dividend for which the settlor would have, if not for settlement, been liable to deduct FDP (foreign dividend payment) if the settlor is a resident or if the settlor had been a resident in New Zealand and subject to our income tax laws at that time. • A settlement of property on a trust for which the settlor claims a deduction from gross income for New Zealand tax purposes. These property settlements are excluded from the definition of corpus. ird.govt.nz 11 The trust's income is separated into two parts for tax purposes: beneficiary income and trustee income. The tax on these two parts is then calculated separately, to arrive at the total tax payable on the trust's income. Here's how the income is allocated: • Beneficiary income is an amount of income derived by a trustee of the trust and allocated to a beneficiary during any income year that either: –vests absolutely in the beneficiary during that income year, or –is paid or applied for the benefit of the beneficiary within six months after the end of that income year. • Trustee income is all income the trust earns in its income year that: –does not vest absolutely in the beneficiary during that income year, or –is not paid or applied for the benefit of the beneficiary within six months after the end of that income year. Trusts can make other types of distributions, some of which will also be taxable. These other distributions are explained in Part 4 of this guide. How the trust's tax is calculated depends on the type of trust, and whether the settlor and/or trustees are New Zealand residents. The different types of trust are explained in Part 2 of this guide. Foreign trusts disclosure and record keeping rules Resident foreign trustees (including complying resident foreign trustees) are required, for each foreign trust they administer, to: • complete and submit to us a Foreign trust disclosure (IR607) form, and • keep financial and other records for New Zealand tax purposes. You can get the IR607 from our website www.ird.govt.nz "Forms and guides", or by emailing competent.authority@ird.govt.nz Disclosures must be completed by resident foreign trustees appointed: • if on or after 1 October 2006, within 30 days after the later of the date of appointment as a trustee, or the date of the trustee's arrival in New Zealand • if before 1 October 2006, within 60 days after the later of 1 October 2006, or the date of the trustee's arrival in New Zealand. More information Full details of the rules are in the Tax Information Bulletin Vol 18, No 5 (June 2006). TRUSTS AND ESTATES 12 Part 2 - Different types of trusts For income tax purposes, there are three types of trust: • complying trusts • foreign trusts • non-complying trusts. The type of trust is important, because it determines whether some distributions from a trust are taxable. Complying trusts A complying trust is one that has been taxed in New Zealand on all its trustee income since the date it began. Complying trusts include: • trusts settled by New Zealand residents with New Zealand trustees • estates of people who were New Zealand residents when they died • other trusts which have elected to become a complying trust. A trust remains a complying trust if, since settlement of the trust, the trustees have satisfied all their obligations for its income tax liabilities. A trust isn't a complying trust if: • the only trustee income is non-resident passive income, or • the trustees earn foreign-sourced income excluded from the meaning of gross income. If a trust ceases to meet the conditions for a complying trust in an income year, it will no longer be a complying trust - it will generally become a non-complying trust (see definition on page 13). A complying trust won't lose its complying status simply because one or more of the following apply: • the trust has no trustee income and there is no tax liability • the only trustee income is tax-exempt • the trust's deductible expenses or losses exceed the trustee income, so there is no tax payable on the net trustee income. ird.govt.nz 13 Foreign trusts A trust will be a foreign trust if none of its settlors have been resident in New Zealand since the later of these dates: • 17 December 1987 • the date the trust was first settled. A trust will cease to be a foreign trust if it makes any distribution after a settlor becomes a New Zealand resident, or if a New Zealand resident makes a settlement on the trust. Non-complying trusts A non-complying trust is any trust that is neither a complying trust nor a foreign trust at the time it makes a distribution. See page 23 for more information on distributions from a non-complying trust. It's generally a trust that has a resident settlor, has been established overseas with non-resident trustees, and hasn't been liable for New Zealand income tax since it was first settled. It also includes a trust where its trustee income has been liable for full New Zealand tax but the trustees haven't paid the tax. New arrivals in New Zealand New residents who arrive in New Zealand may have settled a trust before they arrived in this country. Such a trust would normally be a foreign trust, but it can elect to become a complying trust. The benefits of such an election will become clearer in Part 4 of this guide, because the type of trust affects how some distributions to beneficiaries are taxed. To change types, the trust must elect to pay New Zealand income tax on its trustee income within 12 months of when the settlor first arrives in New Zealand, unless the settlor is a transitional resident\*. If the settlor isn't a transitional resident the trustee income will become taxable in New Zealand, from the date the trust makes the election. If the settlor is a transitional resident, the 12 months to elect to change trust types starts on the date the settlor ceases to be a transitional resident. The trust should use an Election to pay income tax on trustee income (IR463) form to make this election. \* See glossary TRUSTS AND ESTATES 14 If the trust doesn't make an election, it'll be treated as one of the following: • a foreign trust, for any distribution that consists of income, capital profits or capital gains derived before the election expiry date • a non-complying trust, for any distribution that consists of income, capital profits or capital gains derived after the election expiry date. ird.govt.nz 15 Part 3 - How the trust's income is taxed Tax on trustee income The tax on a trust's trustee income (explained on page 11) is calculated at a flat rate of 33 cents in the dollar for all three different types of trust. General rule The trustee is liable for New Zealand income tax on income derived from New Zealand, irrespective of where the trustee lives. The trustee is also liable for New Zealand income tax on income derived from outside New Zealand where: • any settlor is resident in New Zealand at any time during the income year, or • any settlor of an inter vivos or a testamentary trust died while they were resident in New Zealand and a trustee is resident in New Zealand at any time during the income year. Exceptions to the general rule There are two situations in which a trustee isn't liable for income tax on trustee income derived from outside New Zealand. These apply where the trustee is resident outside New Zealand at all times during the income year and either: • no settlement has been made on the trust since 17 December 1987, or • the only settlements made on the trust were by settlors who weren't resident in New Zealand at the time of settlement and who haven't been resident in New Zealand since 17 December 1987. Neither exception applies where an election to pay tax on trustee income has been made by the trustee. These exceptions don't affect the liability to income tax for any settlor of the trust, for example, where the settlor elects to pay tax on trustee income. The trustee income remains liable for income tax for the purpose of determining whether the trust is a complying trust. TRUSTS AND ESTATES 16 Settlor liability If a trust was settled before 17 December 1987, and no settlement has been made on the trust since then, the settlor isn't liable for tax on trustee income unless they elect to pay tax on it. Any settlor of a trust who is a resident in New Zealand at any time during the income year is liable for income tax on trustee income as an agent of the trustee, with certain exceptions. If there's more than one New Zealand resident settlor, these settlors are jointly liable for the tax on trustee income. This means that any or all of the New Zealand resident settlors are liable for this tax. The New Zealand resident settlor won't be liable for the income tax on trustee income if any of these conditions are met. • A trustee is resident in New Zealand at all times during the income year. • The settlor, being a natural person (not a company), wasn't a New Zealand resident at the time they made any settlement on the trust, unless the settlor elects to pay tax on trustee income. • The settlor can show to our satisfaction that their share of the trust's tax liability is excessive, taking into account the settlements on the trust made by all settlors. • The trustee income is derived by the application of the accruals rules of the Income Tax Act to any amounts remitted by the settlor under any financial arrangement. Provisional tax If a trust's residual income tax (RIT) at the end of an income year is more than $2,500, it will generally have to pay provisional tax on the following year's income. RIT is the amount of tax due at the end of the year, after deducting all tax credits the trust can claim (except provisional tax payments). Provisional tax for trusts is explained fully in Part 6 of this guide. Tax on beneficiary income New Zealand resident beneficiaries Beneficiaries who are New Zealand residents are liable for New Zealand income tax on all their income, from any source in the world. Beneficiary income they receive from any trust will be taxable in New Zealand, at their normal income tax rates. To calculate normal income tax rates the trustee must first calculate the tax payable on the total taxable income of the beneficiary and then determine the portion referable to just the beneficiary’s income and taxable distributions. ird.govt.nz 17 Example During the income year beneficiary derives beneficiary income of $5,000 and salary $45,000, (not beneficiary income) total taxable income $50,000. Tax payable by the trustee on the beneficiary income is calculated as follows: Tax payable on taxable income at current marginal rates $48,000 × (10.5% to $14,000 then 17.5%) = $7,420 $2,000 × 30% = $600 Total = $8,020 Tax payable on beneficiary income $8,020 × ($5,000 ÷ $50,000) = $802 Beneficiaries under 16 may be subject to special rules. For more information, please see page 18. From the 2004-2005 income year, any amount derived by the trustee of a community trust is exempt from income tax. The distributions from community trusts aren't taxed on beneficiary income, instead they're included in the gross income of the beneficiaries. The trustee must pay tax on behalf of the beneficiary for income allocated to that beneficiary. The beneficiary can then claim a tax credit for the tax paid on their behalf. Beneficiaries are required to return all income received in their own personal tax return. However, the trustee and beneficiary can agree between themselves not to have tax deducted from trust income before the beneficiary receives it. This is called having the income "transferred direct", and it may be useful in cases such as when the beneficiary has other tax losses to offset against the trust income in their tax return. If the income is transferred direct and the beneficiary doesn't pay any tax on it, the trustees can still be held liable for the unpaid tax. Any distributions made from a non-complying trust to the beneficiary is taxed at 45%. If the trust subsequently gains its complying status, that distribution will be reversed. There are also some other trust distributions beneficiaries must declare for income tax purposes. These are explained in Part 4 of this guide. The nature of the trust's income continues when allocated to the beneficiaries. So interest earned by the trust and allocated to a beneficiary is interest income of the beneficiary. TRUSTS AND ESTATES 18 Timing of allocation of beneficiary income From the 2009-2010 income year onwards, the date by which income allocation to beneficiaries must be allocated, is the later of: • six months after balance date, or • the earlier of: –the date on which the trustee files the return of income for the income year, or –the date by which the trustee must file a return for the income year. Example Olive Family Trust is allocating income to beneficiaries for the year ended 31 March 2012. The trust return is due on 7 July 2012. The income should be allocated by: • 30 September 2012, or • the earlier of: –the date the return is filed, or –7 July 2012. If the trust has a tax agent, the extension of time for filing an income tax return still applies. Special rules for beneficiaries who are children (the "minor beneficiary rule") The minor beneficiary rule applies to income derived from 1 April 2001 or the equivalent income year. Certain distributions of beneficiary income to children under 16 (minors) on the balance date of the trust must be taxed at a final tax rate of 33%. The rule doesn't apply to income derived in that income year if the minor turned 16 during that year. Minor beneficiary income is taxed as trustees' income and isn't the minor's gross income. For the purposes of entries in a beneficiary's account with a trust, the tax on beneficiary income, although taxed as trustees' income, is still treated as being paid on behalf of the beneficiary. ird.govt.nz 19 The minor beneficiary rule applies to beneficiary income derived by a minor from property settled on a trust by: • a relative or legal guardian of the minor, or • a person associated with a relative or legal guardian. The rule applies to all beneficiary income distributed to a minor from a trust unless all the settlements on that trust were made: • by a settlor who received the property as an agent for the beneficiary from someone other than a relative, guardian or their associate • by a settlor who's been ordered by a court to pay damages or compensation to the minor • by a settlor against whom a protection order has been made under section 14 of the Domestic Violence Act 1995.\* • under the terms of a will, codicil, intestacy or any variations of these by a court, if the minor or their brother or sister, or half-brother or half-sister, was alive within 12 months after the date of the settlor's death. If a trust includes some settlements that fit within one of these criteria, and some settlements that don't, special rules apply. For more information see your tax agent or call us on 0800 377 774. The rule doesn't apply if: • the minor is a non-resident • the minor receives a child disability allowance under the Social Security Act 2018 • the minor receives beneficiary income from a group investment fund or Ma ̄ori authority • the beneficiary income derived is $1,000 or less in an income year. However, if the beneficiary's income is over $1,000, all the beneficiary income is subject to the rule. \* This exception only applies if the minor is a protected person in relation to the protection order and the settlement on the trust is made before the protection order is made, or during the time the protection order is in force. TRUSTS AND ESTATES 20 Beneficiaries and provisional tax If a beneficiary's residual income tax (RIT) is more than $2,500, they will generally have to pay provisional tax for the following year. RIT is the amount of tax due at the end of the year, after deducting all tax credits the beneficiary can claim, including tax paid by the trustee on the beneficiary's behalf, but excluding provisional tax payments. Our guide Provisional tax (IR289) explains these rules. Non-resident beneficiaries The trust must deduct NRWT (non-resident withholding tax) from any interest, dividends or royalties before the non-resident beneficiary receives them. This withholding tax is the final tax payable on the income. They should be able to claim a credit for their tax paid in their overseas tax return. Other income, such as income from a rental property, will be subject to New Zealand income tax at the normal rates. Note Beneficiary income retains its nature in the beneficiary’s hands - for example, if the trust earned the income from dividends, the beneficiary should return it as dividends in their overseas tax return. If a trust has non-resident beneficiaries, our NRWT - payer's guide (IR291) contains information the trust administrators will need to know. If a beneficiary isn't a New Zealand resident, and they receive beneficiary income that didn't come from New Zealand sources, the beneficiary won't have to pay New Zealand income tax on this income. Beneficiaries temporarily ceasing to be resident If a beneficiary ceases to be a New Zealand resident and then becomes a New Zealand resident again within five years, they must pay New Zealand income tax on any beneficiary income or taxable distributions (explained in Part 4) received from a foreign or non-complying trust. In this situation, any beneficiary income or taxable distributions the beneficiary received while they were a non-resident, will be taxable as such in the year in which the beneficiary again becomes a New Zealand resident. ird.govt.nz 21 Part 4 - Other distributions to beneficiaries As well as distributing beneficiary income, as explained in Part 3, a trust can distribute money or assets to its beneficiaries by: • distributing trustee income accumulated in previous years • distributing capital profits or gains made from disposing of some of its assets or property • supplying trust property or services to the beneficiary for less than full value • acquiring property or services from the beneficiary for more than full value • making a distribution from the trust's corpus • settling sums or property for the benefit of another trust to the extent that if distributed to a beneficiary resident in New Zealand, the sum or property would have constituted beneficiary income or a taxable distribution to that beneficiary. A beneficiary who receives such a distribution may have to pay income tax on it. This will depend on the type of trust making the distribution. This is why the difference between complying trusts, foreign trusts and non-complying trusts is significant. Distributions of accumulated trustee income and capital profits or gains that were derived by the trust in the 1988 or earlier income years aren't treated as taxable distributions. Distributions from complying trusts If a complying trust makes a distribution of any of the types listed above, the beneficiary receiving the distribution won't have to pay income tax on it. This is the principal advantage of being a complying trust. TRUSTS AND ESTATES 22 Distributions from foreign trusts When a foreign trust makes a distribution of any of the types listed on page 21, it will be a taxable distribution unless it's from the trust's corpus, or from capital profits or gains from transactions with non-associated persons (an adjustment is made for any capital loss incurred in the year the profit was realised). This means the beneficiary must pay tax on the distribution at their normal tax rate. Order of sources of distributions to beneficiaries When a foreign trust makes a distribution to a beneficiary, for tax purposes the distribution will be considered to have come from different sources in the following order: 1. Income the trust derived that is beneficiary income in the previous income year – see page 18 2. Income the trust derived in the current income year. 3. Income (other than beneficiary income) the trust derived in a previous income year (accumulated trustee income). 4. Any capital profit or gain realised in the current income year. 5. Any accumulated capital profit or gain realised in previous income years. 6. The corpus of the trust. However, there are certain distributions not subject to the order listed above. These are: • any distribution from a non-discretionary trust: –created by will, codicil or court order modifying the will or codicil –created on an intestacy, or –on which no settlement has been made since 17 December 1987 • any distribution from a foreign trust that has elected to become a complying trust • any distribution under which a beneficiary acquired trust property for less than market value • any distribution under which a beneficiary acquired services from the trust for less than market value. Except for the last two items in this list, the distributions are deemed to consist of amounts that reflect the terms of the trust deed, or that the trustee(s) determine(s). If a foreign trust doesn't keep enough records to accurately show the source of a distribution, it will be a taxable distribution. ird.govt.nz 23 Distributions that are taxable to the beneficiary If a New Zealand resident beneficiary receives a taxable distribution from a foreign trust, this distribution must be included in the beneficiary's tax return as part of their assessable income. This is on top of any beneficiary income the beneficiary receives from the trust. The beneficiary will then pay tax on the distribution at their normal income tax rates. If the beneficiary receiving the distribution from a foreign trust isn't a New Zealand resident, then they only have to pay New Zealand income tax on any part of the distribution that came from a source in New Zealand. Distributions from non-complying trusts When a non-complying trust makes a distribution of any of the types listed on page 21, it will be taxable unless it's from the trust's corpus. If the beneficiary receiving the distribution from a non-complying trust is a New Zealand resident, it's included in the person's tax return with their other income for the year. It will be taxed at a flat rate of 45 cents in the dollar. Distributions of beneficiary income are taxed at the beneficiary's normal tax rates. A complying trust which has become a non-complying trust because of the trustee's income tax obligations not being met, will become a complying trust retrospectively if the trustee satisfies their obligations, including penalties and interest. When a non-complying trust makes a distribution to a beneficiary, the same rules of order listed on page 22 apply. If a beneficiary has a tax loss from some other source If a beneficiary receives a taxable distribution from a non-complying trust, and that beneficiary has a loss or a loss to carry forward from some other source, they can claim a deduction against the distribution. Use this formula to calculate the amount of this deduction: a× b c In this formula: a is the amount of loss or loss carried forward b is the rate of tax on trustee income - 33 cents in the dollar (0.33) c is 45 cents in the dollar (0.45). TRUSTS AND ESTATES 24 Foreign tax credits Credits for foreign tax paid on a taxable distribution can only be claimed if the tax deducted by the foreign country is similar to New Zealand NRWT. Electing to become a complying trust There are some situations in which a foreign trust or a non-complying trust can elect to become a complying trust. If they want to do this, either the trustee, the settlor or the beneficiary must elect to pay tax on the trustees' worldwide income. The trustee income will then be taxed in New Zealand (when it otherwise may not have been taxable here), in the same way as a complying trust. This then allows it to make non-taxable distributions to its beneficiaries. The person making this election should fill in an Election to pay income tax on trustee income (IR463) form and send it to us. Once an election has been made the person will need to indicate that the trust continues to qualify as a complying trust in their tax return each year or, if they are a non-active trust, through their myIR account each year. The following three types of trust can elect to become complying trusts if they make the election within the relevant time limits - see the following pages. New residents A trust settled by a non-resident settlor who became a New Zealand resident after 17 December 1987 may elect to become a complying trust. This election must be made within 12 months of the settlor becoming a New Zealand resident. Unless the settlor is a transitional resident\*, the 12 months to change trust type starts on the date the settlor ceases to be a transitional resident. If the trust makes an election it will be treated either as: • a foreign trust, for any distribution of income, capital profits or capital gains the trust derived before it made the election, or • a complying trust, for any distribution of income, capital profits or capital gains the trust derived after it made the election. \* See glossary ird.govt.nz 25 This treatment doesn't apply if the trust fails to pay the tax on the trustees' income. The trust will be treated as a non-complying trust for any distributions made in the income year in which the tax isn't paid and in subsequent income years. Only distributions from amounts derived after the trust made the election will be treated as having been made from a non-complying trust. If the election is made part-way through an income year, the income, profits or capital gains for the year must be allocated to the appropriate period that the trust was a foreign or complying trust, according to the date they were derived on. Settled in 1989 or later income years A non-complying or foreign trust settled during the 1989 or later income years, and not otherwise liable to New Zealand income tax on its trustee income, may elect to become a complying trust. The election must be made within the time for filing the trust’s tax return for the income year of settlement. If New Zealand income tax is paid on all trustee income derived since the date of settlement, the trust will meet the complying trust definition at the date of the distribution. Complying trusts no longer liable for New Zealand tax A trust that was formerly a complying trust, but ceased to be liable for New Zealand income tax on its trustee income (for example, if the settlor becomes a non-resident), ceases to be a complying trust. However, such a trust can elect or re-elect to be a complying trust. The election must be made within the time for filing the tax return for the income year in which the trust ceased to be a complying trust. The income tax liability relating to trustee income for each income years since the trust began must also be satisfied. The trust will again be treated as a complying trust from the date it would otherwise have ceased to be liable for New Zealand tax. If no election is made, the trust will become a non-complying trust. Note To become a complying trust, it must make its election before the relevant time limit expires. Late elections cannot be accepted. TRUSTS AND ESTATES 26 Part 5 - Tax returns for trusts and beneficiaries The trust's tax return The trustee must file an IR6 tax return for the trust each year. This return is separate from the trustee's own personal tax return. In the IR6 return the trustee shows: • all income derived by the trust, including any income from a Mäori authority • the tax credits relating to that income • the allocation of income between beneficiary income and trustee income, and • any taxable distributions made. The trustee then calculates the tax payable on the beneficiary income, trustee income and taxable distributions. Allocation of RWT credits Any associated tax credits are generally also allocated in the same proportion as the income. However, if a trustee is paying income tax on beneficiary income on behalf of the beneficiaries, the trustee has the option of detaching some or all of the RWT credits associated with the resident passive income distributed to beneficiaries and reallocating the credits between beneficiaries and trustee to satisfy the income tax on beneficiary income and trustee income. Note The option of detaching RWT credits is only available to a trustee who pays income tax on beneficiary income on behalf of the beneficiaries. If the trustee detaches RWT credits from resident passive income distributed to a beneficiary (Beneficiary A), the trustee must pay Beneficiary A an RWT substitution payment equal to the amount of the detached RWT credits. The trustee can then either: • Reallocate the detached RWT credits to Beneficiary B by meeting Beneficiary B’s income tax on beneficiary income; • Retain the detached RWT credits to satisfy income tax on trustee income; or • A combination of both. The reallocated or retained RWT credit is not income of either Beneficiary B or the trustee – it is the transfer of RWT credits. ird.govt.nz 27 The RWT credits available to Beneficiary A are then reduced by the amount of the RWT substitution payment. The RWT substitution payment is treated as resident passive income that is beneficiary income of Beneficiary A. However, there is no liability or obligation on the trustee to withhold RWT in relation to the RWT substitution payment. The practical effect of the reallocation exercise is that the RWT credit is transferred from one taxpayer (Beneficiary A) to another (Beneficiary B or trustee) and the transferred RWT credit is used to satisfy the trustee’s obligations for satisfying the income tax liability on trustee income and/or Beneficiary B’s beneficiary income. Reallocating the RWT credits also means that Beneficiary A will not need to seek a refund from the Commissioner for the excess RWT credits and, instead, receives a cash payment from the trustee in substitution for the RWT credits. Example The trustee of the Olive Family trust derives $100 in interest, from which 33% tax has been deducted, leaving $67 in cash, and the trustee receives an entitlement to $33 in RWT credits. The Olive Family trust distributes all of the interest to Brook as beneficiary income, with Brook receiving $67 in cash and $33 in RWT credits. Brook has a marginal tax rate of 17.5%, which means her tax liability on her beneficiary income is $17.50. Since the trustee is paying income tax on beneficiary income for Brook, the trustee can detach $15.50 from the RWT credits allocated to Brook and pay her cash of $15.50 in substitution for the detached RWT credit. This leaves Brook with $17.50 of RWT tax credit – enough to satisfy her income tax on beneficiary income. Brook is in the same position as if she had obtained a refund of the excess RWT credit from the Commissioner. The trustee can retain the detached RWT credit of $15.50 to satisfy income tax on trustee income. Allocation of imputation credits The imputation credits must be allocated in proportion to the total distributions received from the trust. This also applies to Mäori authority credits and FDP (foreign dividend payment) credits attached to dividends distributed as beneficiary income. This means a trust can't choose to allocate credits to beneficiaries who may be better able to use them than other beneficiaries. TRUSTS AND ESTATES 28 Use this formula to allocate the imputation and FDP credits: a× b c In this formula: a is the total imputation and FDP credits attached to all dividends distributed to beneficiaries during the income year b is the total distribution, including capital distributions, to the particular beneficiary during the income year c is the total distributions made to all beneficiaries during the income year. The beneficiaries can then claim a credit for tax paid on their beneficiary income and taxable distributions (and their share of tax credits) in their personal income tax returns. Note Where a trust has no prospect or intention of deriving any assessable income in a given financial year, please call us on 0800 377 774 with the name and IRD number of the trust so we can record that a return isn’t required for that year. However, if the trust receives any assessable income, for example, interest, the trustee must file a return, regardless of the amount derived. If the trust subsequently derives assessable income in a future year, the trust must send in a return. This only applies to trust returns. Estates are still required to file a return of income regardless of whether or not they have derived assessable income. The beneficiaries' tax returns A person who receives beneficiary income from any type of trust, or a taxable distribution from a foreign trust, must include this income in their tax return for that year and pay tax on it at their normal rates. If the trust has deducted tax before paying the income to the beneficiary, the beneficiary can claim a credit for this tax deducted. However, if the tax was deducted overseas, the maximum credit a New Zealand beneficiary can claim is the amount of New Zealand income tax payable on their share of the overseas trust income. If the trust's balance date isn't 31 March, the beneficiary must include any income from the trust in their tax return for the year that corresponds with the trust's accounting year. There's no need to make any separate calculations to allow for a difference in balance dates. ird.govt.nz 29 If a person receives beneficiary income or taxable distributions from a foreign or non-complying trust, they should fill in the details of the trust income on a Schedule of beneficiary's estate or trust income (IR307) form, and include this with their tax return. If the trust has a New Zealand tax agent, they will usually fill in an IR307 form for each beneficiary to include with their individual tax return. These forms will then show the beneficiaries how much income to declare, and the amount of any tax credits to claim. Note Any taxable distributions a beneficiary receives from a non-complying trust are to be included separately in the beneficiary’s tax return. These distributions will be taxed separately at a flat rate of 45 cents in the dollar. Tax returns for a deceased person's estate The personal representative, executor or administrator of a deceased person's estate must file all tax returns the deceased person would otherwise have had to file and make sure any tax due is paid. The tax return to be used for the period to the date of death is an Individual tax return (IR3). The return must show their IRD number and include all gross income the deceased person derived up until that date. After the date of death, the person's estate will get a new IRD number and any income must be returned in an Income tax return: Estate or Trust (IR6). The first estate return will include all income derived and expenditure incurred from the date of death until the end of the return period. Even after an estate has been wound up, we can audit the deceased person's tax returns for previous years. If more tax becomes payable as a result of such an audit, the estate is still liable to pay this tax. If there are no estate funds available because the final distribution has been made, the executor or administrator is liable for the extra tax assessed. Charitable trusts or estates A trust will be a charitable trust if all income the trustee derives is held solely for charitable purposes, and no person associated with the trust can gain any personal profit from it. There are special tax exemptions available to charitable trusts and estates. You'll find more information about charitable trusts and estates in our Charitable organisations (IR255) guide. TRUSTS AND ESTATES 30 Final trust or estate return The trustees of a trust or estate are personally responsible for any tax payable on the trust income. This means that before an estate or trust is wound up and its assets distributed, all income must be returned and enough funds retained to pay any tax due. The trustee must file a tax return to the date of winding up, which must show the final distribution of the income. ird.govt.nz 31 Part 6 - Provisional tax The principle of provisional tax The principle of provisional tax is that a trust pays tax as it earns income, instead of having a large tax bill at the end of the year. Provisional tax is charged in instalments during an income year. When the trust files its tax return, it can claim a credit for the provisional tax it's paid during the year. Circumstances when a trust must pay provisional tax One of the important concepts in provisional tax is residual income tax (RIT). This is the amount of tax payable on the trust's income for the year, after deducting any allowable tax credits (but not provisional tax payments). This includes tax payable by the trustee on both beneficiary income and trustee income. • If a trust's RIT is $2,500 or less, the trust doesn't have to pay provisional tax for the following year, but it can choose to make voluntary payments. • If a trust's RIT is more than $2,500, the trust will generally have to pay provisional tax for the following income year. There are three different methods for calculating the amount of provisional tax payable: the standard option, the estimation option or the ratio option. These methods are explained on pages 32 and 33. • If a trust's RIT is more than $2,500, but the trust expects its RIT at the end of the following year to be $2,500 or less, it can estimate its provisional tax at nil. However, before making such an estimate please read the section on use-of-money interest - see page 33. Provisional tax calculation methods Standard option Provisional tax calculations may change from year to year. For current and past rates go to www.ird.govt.nz (keywords: standard options). If a trust uses the standard option, it can change to the estimation option at any time up until the due date of the final instalment of provisional tax. If a trust using the standard option wishes to change to the ratio option it must elect to use the ratio before the tax year in which it wants to use the ratio. TRUSTS AND ESTATES 32 Estimation option A trust can choose to estimate its provisional tax by estimating its income for the year and then calculating the tax on it. This is usually beneficial for trusts that expect the following year's income to be less than the current year's income. If the trust used the standard option in this situation, it would end up paying more tax than it had to during the year, and then receive a refund at the end of the year. However, if a trust chooses the estimation option and the RIT is greater than the provisional tax paid, it can be charged interest from the first instalment date and may be liable for a shortfall penalty of 20% of the underpaid provisional tax for lack of reasonable care. Once a trust chooses the estimation option, it can't switch to the standard or ratio option during that income year. However, it can change the amount of the estimation at any time up until the due date for the final instalment of provisional tax. Note An estimate must be fair and reasonable at each instalment date. Ratio option From the 2008-2009 tax year, trusts are able to pay their provisional tax in line with when income is received. This option is only available to GST-registered trusts. Using the ratio option, six provisional tax instalments are made based on a trust's GST turnover. We'll calculate a percentage based on the prior year's RIT divided by the total GST supplies for the corresponding year. To calculate each provisional tax instalment, a trust multiplies the percentage which is preprinted on their GST103 return, by the total taxable supplies for the two-month period (monthly payers will add the taxable supplies for two return periods). If a trust makes the correct ratio payments by the due dates, it won't be charged interest if the provisional tax falls short of the RIT for the year. To use the ratio option, a trust must apply by phone or in writing before the start of the tax year they want to use this option in. ird.govt.nz 33 Use-of-money interest (UOMI) Only tax on trustee income is subject to UOMI. We won't charge or pay interest on tax on the trust's beneficiary income. If the trust's RIT on trustee income is more than $2,500, and the trust has paid too much provisional tax for this income, we may pay interest. However, if the provisional tax paid is less than the RIT, we may charge interest. There are changes to when UOMI is charged for the 2018 income year onwards There are changes in debit and credit use-of-money interest (UOMI) on provisional tax for the 2018 income year onwards when using the standard option, and when changing from the standard option to the estimation option for the final instalment, provided all required payments are made in full and on time. There is no change to debit or credit use-of-money interest when using the estimation option instalment(s) other than at the final instalment. When determining the interest start date, the $50,000 RIT threshold for individuals using the standard option has been increased to $60,000. This threshold will also apply to non-individuals, including trusts. Provisional tax amount End of year residual income tax (RIT) Credit or debit UOMICalculated from More than RIT amount Less than $60,000 Credit UOMI calculated on the difference between the provisional tax amount paid and the RIT Terminal tax due date More than RIT $60,000 or more Credit UOMI calculated on the difference between the provisional tax amount paid and the RIT Final instalment date Less than RIT $60,000 or more Debit UOMI calculated on the difference between the provisional tax amount paid and the RIT Final instalment date Less than RIT Less than $60,000 Debit UOMI calculated on the difference between the provisional tax amount paid and the RIT Terminal tax due date If the trust has paid all but the last instalment in full and on time using the standard option then UOMI will apply from the final instalment due date. This will also apply if the trust has changed to the estimation option at or before the final instalment date due date. TRUSTS AND ESTATES 34 If the trust has paid an instalment late or doesn't pay it at all UOMI will be charged from the due date of the instalment on the lesser of: • the amount of the instalment that was paid less the amount that should have paid, or • your RIT divided by the number of instalments for the tax year less the amount paid. The above changes may not apply if the trust: • is associated to a company and they aren't covered by the above standard option rules or they don't use the GST ratio option, or • has entered a provisional tax interest avoidance arrangement. Interest applies from the day after each provisional tax instalment date, if the RIT on trustee income is more than $2,500 when using the estimation option for the instalments other than the final instalment date. If they have elected to use the ratio option, interest applies from the day after the terminal tax due date. If the trust's RIT on trustee income is $2,500 or less, and it's paid too much provisional tax for trustee income, it can elect to be a provisional tax payer for that year. The trust may then still be paid interest on the overpaid provisional tax. A trust may elect to be a provisional tax payer if: • it expects to have RIT on trustee income of more than $2,500, and • it pays provisional tax on trustee income of more than $2,500 by the last provisional tax instalment date. If you experience problems with the way UOMI for the trust is calculated, call us on 0800 377 774. Any UOMI charged will generally be tax-deductible, while UOMI received is treated as gross income. If a trust is charged UOMI, it should be paid by the due date for paying its end-of-year tax bill (usually 7 February, or 7 April if the trust has a tax agent). However, interest will continue to be charged on a daily basis until the tax is paid. The only way to stop interest from accruing is to pay the unpaid tax on trustee income. Further information For more information on provisional tax and UOMI, read our Provisional tax (IR289) guide. ird.govt.nz 35 Late payment penalties If tax isn't paid by the due date, a late payment penalty will be charged. An initial 1% late payment penalty will be charged on the day after the due date. A further 4% penalty will be charged if there's still an amount of unpaid tax (including penalties) at the end of the 7th day from the due date. For income years before 2018 Every month after the due date, a further 1% will be added to any unpaid amount (including penalties). Note Penalties aren’t charged on unpaid amounts less than $100.

In this guide, the term “trust” also applies to estates unless specifically stated otherwise. This information does not apply to unit trusts (as these are treated as companies for income tax purposes) or trusts that are superannuation funds (as different rules apply). A glossary of terms is on page 6. Trust returns If a trust, estate or testamentary trust (trust created by a person under their will) receives any income the trustee must complete a return and meet certain reporting obligations. However, if the income is below set thresholds (see below) and certain criteria is met, it can be excused from filing returns by completing the Non-active trust declaration - IR633 in myIR. If it subsequently becomes active again eg derives income in a future year, then it must send in a return. Filing thresholds Trust and Estates • Reportable income of $1,000 or less, • No deductions, • Not involved in any transactions that give income to an associated person or entity, • No transactions that give a benefit subject to FBT to a current or former employee. • Reasonable fees for administering the trust. • Bank charges or minimal administrative costs that are $1,500 or less for the year. • Insurance, rates, interest, and other costs related to living in a house owned by the trust and incurred by the beneficiaries of the trust. TRUSTS AND ESTATES 6 Testamentary Trust • Reportable income of $5,000 or less • Non-reportable income of up to $1,000 with deductions that would reduce the net income to below $200. Glossary Associated persons Associated persons are defined as: • two companies • a company and a person other than a company • two relatives • a person and a trustee for a relative • a trustee and a beneficiary • trustees with a common settlor • a trustee and a settlor • a settlor and a beneficiary • a trustee and a person with the power of appointment or removal of the trustee • a partnership and a partner • two persons who are each associated with the same third person (tripartite test). For full details on associated persons read A guide to associated persons definitions for income tax purposes - IR620. You can download this from ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Charitable trust A charitable trust is one in which the income can be used only for charitable purposes. For more information on charitable trusts, read our guide Charitable organisations - IR255. Corpus This is the market value of any property settled on a trust, at the date of settlement. Disposition of property Any form of transfer, conveyance, assignment, settlement, delivery, payment or other allocation of property to a trust (or for its benefit) is a disposition of property. This includes dispositions made under a person's will and through intestacy (dying without a will). ird.govt.nz 7 Foreign Exemption Trust This is a trust that is a foreign trust, with a New Zealand resident trustee but also includes trusts where a trustee makes or has made use of the foreign sourced income exemption. Inter vivos trust This is a trust settled during the lifetime of the settlor. This term is used when working out whether trustee income from overseas is subject to New Zealand income tax. Resident You are a New Zealand tax resident in any of these situations: • you're in New Zealand for more than 183 days in any twelve-month period, or • you have an enduring relationship with New Zealand, or • you have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, or • you're away from New Zealand in the service of the New Zealand Government. Testamentary trust A trust created by a person's will, codicil or intestacy (dying without a will), or by a court order at the time of the person's death. Transitional resident A transitional resident is an individual who has arrived in New Zealand after 1 April 2006 and qualifies for a temporary tax exemption on their foreign income. To qualify as a transitional resident, the individual must not have been resident in New Zealand for the last 10 years, or have been a transitional resident before. For more information see ird.govt.nz/roles/nz-tax-residents/exemption TRUSTS AND ESTATES 8 Part 1 - Explaining the important concepts How a trust starts To create a trust, a person (the settlor) gives money or property to another person (the trustee), to be held in trust for the benefit of either the trust's beneficiaries, or a purpose recognised by law. There should be a signed trust deed (agreement) that acknowledges the settlement, but it's possible to establish a trust verbally. Trustees The trustee holds the trust's property in trust for the beneficiary, and administers or manages the trust. A trustee includes an executor or administrator of an estate, which may be the Public Trustee or the Mäori Trustee. Companies may also act as trustees. Settlors Note When a trustee of a trust owes an amount to a beneficiary of the trust, the beneficiary does not become a settlor when either: • the trust pays the beneficiary a market interest rate equal to or greater than the prescribed rate of interest, or • the amount retained in the beneficiary’s current account at the end of the income year is not more than $25,000. A settlor of the trust can include any person who at any time: • transfers value –to a trust, or –for the benefit of the trust, or –on terms of the trust • provides financial assistance to the trust for its value. These are called settlements. Trusts may also be settled by companies. ird.govt.nz 9 Determining who is a settlor of a trust and whether they're a resident is important for establishing whether the trust's overseas income is taxable in New Zealand. These factors also affect the category of a trust (complying, foreign, or non-complying - explained in Part 2 of this guide) and which distributions to beneficiaries are non- taxable. Settlement A settlement is any action that makes a person a settlor of a trust and includes any of the following: • disposal of any property to the trust for less than market value • property or funds made available to the trust for less than market value • services provided to the trust for less than market value • any property acquired from the trust or any service from the trustee for greater than market value. Settlement also includes any failure to act or enter into any or part of any of the above actions. Note The courts will only recognise that a valid trust has been created if it’s covered in a trust deed. You should seek professional advice about drawing up a trust deed. Information a settlor must give us A New Zealand resident settlor must tell us the details within three months of making a settlement on a trust that does not have New Zealand resident trustees. The settlor must also give us the names and addresses of the trust's trustees and beneficiaries. For disclosure purposes, a settlement also includes a settlement made as a nominee of another person, or of a nominal amount made at the request of another person. A settlor of a trust who is resident in New Zealand for any part of the income year, may be taxed as an agent of the trustee on trustee income which is derived in that income year, if the trust ceases to have a New Zealand trustee. If all the trustees of the trust cease to be New Zealand residents, the settlor must tell us within three months of the date on which the trust ceased to have a resident trustee. TRUSTS AND ESTATES 10 In each of these situations, the settlor must complete a Settlors of trusts disclosure - IR462 form within three months and send it to us. How the trust earns income Usually, the money or property settled on the trust is used as an investment to earn further revenue, or as capital to fund a trading operation. This revenue becomes the trust's income as it's earned. The initial settlement on the trust is not income for tax purposes, but the settlor may have to pay gift duty on it if it's received before 1 October 2011, depending on the value of the settlement. Estates The trust tax rules also apply to estates of people who have died, if such an estate continues to earn income after the person's death. When we refer to "trusts" in this guide we also include estates, unless specifically excluded by the context. The trust's income The trust's income is deemed to include certain settlements of property on a trust. • Property settled by a trustee of another trust so long as it would have counted as income if that trust had distributed the property to one of its beneficiaries instead (see page 21). • A settlement of property on a trust, which would, if not for the settlement, have constituted: –gross income of the settlor, or –a dividend for which the settlor would have, if not for settlement, been liable to deduct FDP (foreign dividend payment) if the settlor is a resident or if the settlor had been a resident in New Zealand and subject to our income tax laws at that time. • A settlement of property on a trust for which the settlor claims a deduction from gross income for New Zealand tax purposes. These property settlements are excluded from the definition of corpus. ird.govt.nz 11 The trust's income is separated into two parts for tax purposes: beneficiary income and trustee income. The tax on these two parts is then calculated separately, to arrive at the total tax payable on the trust's income. Here's how the income is allocated: • Beneficiary income is an amount of income derived by a trustee of the trust and allocated to a beneficiary during any income year that either: –vests absolutely in the beneficiary during that income year, or –is paid or applied for the benefit of the beneficiary within six months after the end of that income year. • Trustee income is all income the trust earns in its income year that: –does not vest absolutely in the beneficiary during that income year, or –is not paid or applied for the benefit of the beneficiary within six months after the end of that income year. Trusts can make other types of distributions, some of which will also be taxable. These other distributions are explained in Part 4 of this guide. How the trust's tax is calculated depends on the type of trust, and whether the settlor and/or trustees are New Zealand residents. The different types of trust are explained in Part 2 of this guide. Foreign exemption trusts disclosure and record keeping rules New Zealand resident trustees are required, for each foreign exemption trust they administer, to: • complete and submit to us a New Zealand foreign trust - IR607 form, • comply with annual return filing requirements, and • keep financial and other records for New Zealand tax purposes. An IR607 can be completed in myIR or you can download the IR607 from ird.govt.nz/forms-guides or by emailing nzforeigntrusts@ird.govt.nz Registration must be completed by New Zealand resident trustees on the later of: • March 2023 or • the due date of an income tax return of the trust relating to the first income year for which the trust meets the requirements to be a foreign exemption trust. More information Full details of the rules are in the Tax Information Bulletin Vol 29, No 4 (May 2017) and TIB Vol 35, No 5 (June 2023). TRUSTS AND ESTATES 12 Part 2 - Different types of trusts For income tax purposes, there are three types of trust: • complying trusts • foreign trusts (including foreign exemption trusts) • non-complying trusts. The type of trust is important, because it determines whether some distributions from a trust are taxable. Complying trusts A complying trust is one that has been taxed in New Zealand on all its trustee income since the date it began. Complying trusts include: • trusts settled by New Zealand residents with New Zealand trustees • estates of people who were New Zealand residents when they died • other trusts which have elected to become a complying trust. A trust remains a complying trust if, since settlement of the trust, the trustees have satisfied all their obligations for its income tax liabilities. A trust is not a complying trust if: • the only trustee income is non-resident passive income, or • the trustees earn foreign-sourced income excluded from the meaning of gross income. If a trust ceases to meet the conditions for a complying trust in an income year, it will no longer be a complying trust - it will generally become a non-complying trust (see definition on page 13). A complying trust will not lose its complying status simply because one or more of the following apply: • the trust has no trustee income and there is no tax liability • the only trustee income is tax-exempt • the trust's deductible expenses or losses exceed the trustee income, so there is no tax payable on the net trustee income. ird.govt.nz 13 Foreign trusts A trust will be a foreign trust if none of its settlors have been resident in New Zealand since the later of these dates: • 17 December 1987 • the date the trust was first settled. A trust will cease to be a foreign trust if it makes any distribution after a settlor becomes a New Zealand resident, or if a New Zealand resident makes a settlement on the trust. Non-complying trusts A non-complying trust is any trust that is neither a complying trust nor a foreign trust at the time it makes a distribution. See page 23 for more information on distributions from a non-complying trust. It's generally a trust that has a resident settlor, has been established overseas with non-resident trustees, and has not been liable for New Zealand income tax since it was first settled. It also includes a trust where its trustee income has been liable for full New Zealand tax but the trustees have not paid the tax. New arrivals in New Zealand New residents who arrive in New Zealand may have settled a trust before they arrived in this country. Such a trust would normally be a foreign trust, but it can elect to become a complying trust. The benefits of such an election will become clearer in Part 4 of this guide, because the type of trust affects how some distributions to beneficiaries are taxed. To change types, the trust must elect to pay New Zealand income tax on its trustee income within 12 months of when the settlor first arrives in New Zealand, unless the settlor is a transitional resident\*. If the settlor is not a transitional resident the trustee income will become taxable in New Zealand, from the date the trust makes the election. If the settlor is a transitional resident, the 12 months to elect to change trust types starts on the date the settlor ceases to be a transitional resident. The trust should use an Election to pay income tax on trustee income - IR463 form to make this election. \* See glossary TRUSTS AND ESTATES 14 If the trust does not make an election, it'll be treated as one of the following: • a foreign trust, for any distribution that consists of income, capital profits or capital gains derived before the election expiry date • a non-complying trust, for any distribution that consists of income, capital profits or capital gains derived after the election expiry date. ird.govt.nz 15 Part 3 - How the trust's income is taxed Tax on trustee income The tax on a trust's trustee income (explained on page 11) is calculated at a flat rate of 33 cents in the dollar for all three different types of trust. General rule The trustee is liable for New Zealand income tax on income derived from New Zealand, irrespective of where the trustee lives. The trustee is also liable for New Zealand income tax on income derived from outside New Zealand where: • any settlor is resident in New Zealand at any time during the income year, or • any settlor of an inter vivos or a testamentary trust died while they were resident in New Zealand and a trustee is resident in New Zealand at any time during the income year. Exceptions to the general rule There are two situations in which a trustee is not liable for income tax on trustee income derived from outside New Zealand. These apply where the trustee is resident outside New Zealand at all times during the income year and either: • no settlement has been made on the trust since 17 December 1987, or • the only settlements made on the trust were by settlors who were not resident in New Zealand at the time of settlement and who have not been resident in New Zealand since 17 December 1987. Neither exception applies where an election to pay tax on trustee income has been made by the trustee. These exceptions do not affect the liability to income tax for any settlor of the trust, for example, where the settlor elects to pay tax on trustee income. The trustee income remains liable for income tax for the purpose of determining whether the trust is a complying trust. TRUSTS AND ESTATES 16 Settlor liability If a trust was settled before 17 December 1987, and no settlement has been made on the trust since then, the settlor is not liable for tax on trustee income unless they elect to pay tax on it. Any settlor of a trust who is a resident in New Zealand at any time during the income year is liable for income tax on trustee income as an agent of the trustee, with certain exceptions. If there's more than one New Zealand resident settlor, these settlors are jointly liable for the tax on trustee income. This means that any or all of the New Zealand resident settlors are liable for this tax. The New Zealand resident settlor will not be liable for the income tax on trustee income if any of these conditions are met. • A trustee is resident in New Zealand at all times during the income year. • The settlor, being a natural person (not a company), was not a New Zealand resident at the time they made any settlement on the trust, unless the settlor elects to pay tax on trustee income. • The settlor can show to our satisfaction that their share of the trust's tax liability is excessive, taking into account the settlements on the trust made by all settlors. • The trustee income is derived by the application of the financial arrangement rules of the Income Tax Act to any amounts remitted by the settlor under any financial arrangement. Provisional tax If a trust's residual income tax (RIT) at the end of an income year is more than $5000, it will generally have to pay provisional tax on the following year's income. RIT is the amount of tax due at the end of the year, after deducting all tax credits the trust can claim (except provisional tax payments). Provisional tax for trusts is explained fully in Part 6 of this guide. Tax on beneficiary income New Zealand resident beneficiaries Beneficiaries who are New Zealand residents are liable for New Zealand income tax on all their income, from any source in the world. Beneficiary income they receive from any trust will be taxable in New Zealand, at their normal income tax rates. To calculate normal income tax rates the trustee must first calculate the tax payable on the total taxable income of the beneficiary and then determine the portion referable to just the beneficiary’s income and taxable distributions. ird.govt.nz 17 Example During the income year beneficiary derives beneficiary income of $5,000 and salary $45,000, (not beneficiary income) total taxable income $50,000. Tax payable by the trustee on the beneficiary income is calculated as follows: Tax payable on taxable income at current marginal rates $48,000 × (10.5% to $14,000 then 17.5%) = $7,420 $2,000 × 30% = $600 Total = $8,020 Tax payable on beneficiary income $8,020 × ($5,000 ÷ $50,000) = $802 Beneficiaries under 16 may be subject to special rules. For more information, please see page 18. From the 2004-2005 income year, any amount derived by the trustee of a community trust is exempt from income tax. The distributions from community trusts are not taxed on beneficiary income, instead they're included in the gross income of the beneficiaries. The trustee must pay tax on behalf of the beneficiary for income allocated to that beneficiary. The beneficiary can then claim a tax credit for the tax paid on their behalf. Beneficiaries are required to return all income received in their own personal tax return. However, the trustee and beneficiary can agree between themselves not to have tax deducted from trust income before the beneficiary receives it. This is called having the income "transferred direct", and it may be useful in cases such as when the beneficiary has other tax losses to offset against the trust income in their tax return. If the income is transferred direct and the beneficiary does not pay any tax on it, the trustees can still be held liable for the unpaid tax. Any distributions made from a non-complying trust to the beneficiary is taxed at 45%. If the trust subsequently gains its complying status, that distribution will be reversed. There are also some other trust distributions beneficiaries must declare for income tax purposes. These are explained in Part 4 of this guide. The nature of the trust's income continues when allocated to the beneficiaries. So interest earned by the trust and allocated to a beneficiary is interest income of the beneficiary. TRUSTS AND ESTATES 18 Timing of allocation of beneficiary income From the 2009-2010 income year onwards, the date by which income allocation to beneficiaries must be allocated, is the later of: • six months after balance date, or • the earlier of: –the date on which the trustee files the return of income for the income year, or –the date by which the trustee must file a return for the income year. Example Olive Family Trust is allocating income to beneficiaries for the year ended 31 March 2012. The trust return is due on 7 July 2012. The income should be allocated by: • 30 September 2012, or • the earlier of: –the date the return is filed, or –7 July 2012. If the trust has a tax agent, the extension of time for filing an income tax return still applies. Special rules for beneficiaries who are children (the "minor beneficiary rule") The minor beneficiary rule applies to income derived from 1 April 2001 or the equivalent income year. Certain distributions of beneficiary income to children under 16 (minors) on the balance date of the trust must be taxed at a final tax rate of 33%. The rule does not apply to income derived in that income year if the minor turned 16 during that year. Minor beneficiary income is taxed as trustees' income and is not the minor's gross income. For the purposes of entries in a beneficiary's account with a trust, the tax on beneficiary income, although taxed as trustees' income, is still treated as being paid on behalf of the beneficiary. ird.govt.nz 19 The minor beneficiary rule applies to beneficiary income derived by a minor from property settled on a trust by: • a relative or legal guardian of the minor, or • a person associated with a relative or legal guardian. The rule applies to all beneficiary income distributed to a minor from a trust unless all the settlements on that trust were made: • by a settlor who received the property as an agent for the beneficiary from someone other than a relative, guardian or their associate • by a settlor who's been ordered by a court to pay damages or compensation to the minor • by a settlor against whom a protection order has been made under section 14 of the Domestic Violence Act 1995.\* • under the terms of a will, codicil, intestacy or any variations of these by a court, if the minor or their brother or sister, or half-brother or half-sister, was alive within 12 months after the date of the settlor's death. If a trust includes some settlements that fit within one of these criteria, and some settlements that do not, special rules apply. For more information see your tax agent or call us on 0800 377 774. The rule does not apply if: • the minor is a non-resident • the minor receives a child disability allowance under the Social Security Act 2018 • the minor receives beneficiary income from a group investment fund or Ma ̄ori authority • the beneficiary income derived is $1,000 or less in an income year. However, if the beneficiary's income is over $1,000, all the beneficiary income is subject to the rule. \* This exception only applies if the minor is a protected person in relation to the protection order and the settlement on the trust is made before the protection order is made, or during the time the protection order is in force. TRUSTS AND ESTATES 20 Beneficiaries and provisional tax If a beneficiary's residual income tax (RIT) is more than $5000, they will generally have to pay provisional tax for the following year. RIT is the amount of tax due at the end of the year, after deducting all tax credits the beneficiary can claim, including tax paid by the trustee on the beneficiary's behalf, but excluding provisional tax payments. Our guide Provisional tax - IR289 explains these rules. Non-resident beneficiaries The trust must deduct NRWT (non-resident withholding tax) from any interest, dividends or royalties before the non-resident beneficiary receives them. This withholding tax is the final tax payable on the income. They should be able to claim a credit for their tax paid in their overseas tax return. Other income, such as income from a rental property, will be subject to New Zealand income tax at the normal rates. Note Beneficiary income retains its nature in the beneficiary’s hands - for example, if the trust earned the income from dividends, the beneficiary should return it as dividends in their overseas tax return. If a trust has non-resident beneficiaries, our NRWT - payer’s guide - IR291 contains information the trust administrators will need to know. If a beneficiary is not a New Zealand resident, and they receive beneficiary income that did not come from New Zealand sources, the beneficiary will not have to pay New Zealand income tax on this income. Beneficiaries temporarily ceasing to be resident If a beneficiary ceases to be a New Zealand resident and then becomes a New Zealand resident again within five years, they must pay New Zealand income tax on any beneficiary income or taxable distributions (explained in Part 4) received from a foreign or non-complying trust. In this situation, any beneficiary income or taxable distributions the beneficiary received while they were a non-resident, will be taxable as such in the year in which the beneficiary again becomes a New Zealand resident. ird.govt.nz 21 Part 4 - Other distributions to beneficiaries As well as distributing beneficiary income, as explained in Part 3, a trust can distribute money or assets to its beneficiaries by: • distributing trustee income accumulated in previous years • distributing capital profits or gains made from disposing of some of its assets or property • supplying trust property or services to the beneficiary for less than full value • acquiring property or services from the beneficiary for more than full value • making a distribution from the trust's corpus • settling sums or property for the benefit of another trust to the extent that if distributed to a beneficiary resident in New Zealand, the sum or property would have constituted beneficiary income or a taxable distribution to that beneficiary. A beneficiary who receives such a distribution may have to pay income tax on it. This will depend on the type of trust making the distribution. This is why the difference between complying trusts, foreign trusts and non-complying trusts is significant. Distributions of accumulated trustee income and capital profits or gains that were derived by the trust in the 1988 or earlier income years are not treated as taxable distributions. Distributions from complying trusts If a complying trust makes a distribution of any of the types listed above, the beneficiary receiving the distribution will not have to pay income tax on it. This is the principal advantage of being a complying trust. TRUSTS AND ESTATES 22 Distributions from foreign trusts When a foreign trust makes a distribution of any of the types listed on page 21, it will be a taxable distribution unless it's from the trust's corpus, or from capital profits or gains from transactions with non-associated persons (an adjustment is made for any capital loss incurred in the year the profit was realised). This means the beneficiary must pay tax on the distribution at their normal tax rate. Order of sources of distributions to beneficiaries When a foreign trust makes a distribution to a beneficiary, for tax purposes the distribution will be considered to have come from different sources in the following order: 1. Income the trust derived that is beneficiary income in the previous income year – see page 18 2. Income the trust derived in the current income year. 3. Income (other than beneficiary income) the trust derived in a previous income year (accumulated trustee income). 4. Any capital profit or gain realised in the current income year. 5. Any accumulated capital profit or gain realised in previous income years. 6. The corpus of the trust. However, there are certain distributions not subject to the order listed above. These are: • any distribution from a non-discretionary trust: –created by will, codicil or court order modifying the will or codicil –created on an intestacy, or –on which no settlement has been made since 17 December 1987 • any distribution from a foreign trust that has elected to become a complying trust • any distribution under which a beneficiary acquired trust property for less than market value • any distribution under which a beneficiary acquired services from the trust for less than market value. Except for the last two items in this list, the distributions are deemed to consist of amounts that reflect the terms of the trust deed, or that the trustee(s) determine(s). If a foreign trust does not keep enough records to accurately show the source of a distribution, it will be a taxable distribution. ird.govt.nz 23 Distributions that are taxable to the beneficiary If a New Zealand resident beneficiary receives a taxable distribution from a foreign trust, this distribution must be included in the beneficiary's tax return as part of their assessable income. This is on top of any beneficiary income the beneficiary receives from the trust. The beneficiary will then pay tax on the distribution at their normal income tax rates. If the beneficiary receiving the distribution from a foreign trust is not a New Zealand resident, then they only have to pay New Zealand income tax on any part of the distribution that came from a source in New Zealand. Distributions from non-complying trusts When a non-complying trust makes a distribution of any of the types listed on page 21, it will be taxable unless it's from the trust's corpus. If the beneficiary receiving the distribution from a non-complying trust is a New Zealand resident, it's included in the person's tax return with their other income for the year. It will be taxed at a flat rate of 45 cents in the dollar. Distributions of beneficiary income are taxed at the beneficiary's normal tax rates. A complying trust which has become a non-complying trust because of the trustee's income tax obligations not being met, will become a complying trust retrospectively if the trustee satisfies their obligations, including penalties and interest. When a non-complying trust makes a distribution to a beneficiary, the same rules of order listed on page 22 apply. If a beneficiary has a tax loss from some other source If a beneficiary receives a taxable distribution from a non-complying trust, and that beneficiary has a loss or a loss to carry forward from some other source, they can claim a deduction against the distribution. Use this formula to calculate the amount of this deduction: a× b c In this formula: a is the amount of loss or loss carried forward b is the rate of tax on trustee income - 33 cents in the dollar (0.33) c is 45 cents in the dollar (0.45). TRUSTS AND ESTATES 24 Foreign tax credits Credits for foreign tax paid on a taxable distribution can only be claimed if the tax deducted by the foreign country is similar to New Zealand NRWT. Electing to become a complying trust There are some situations in which a foreign trust or a non-complying trust can elect to become a complying trust. If they want to do this, either the trustee, the settlor or the beneficiary must elect to pay tax on the trustees' worldwide income. The trustee income will then be taxed in New Zealand (when it otherwise may not have been taxable here), in the same way as a complying trust. This then allows it to make non-taxable distributions to its beneficiaries. The person making this election should fill in an Election to pay income tax on trustee income - IR463 form and send it to us. Once an election has been made the person will need to indicate that the trust continues to qualify as a complying trust in their tax return each year or, if they are a non-active trust, through their myIR account each year. The following three types of trust can elect to become complying trusts if they make the election within the relevant time limits - see the following pages. New residents A trust settled by a non-resident settlor who became a New Zealand resident after 17 December 1987 may elect to become a complying trust. This election must be made within 12 months of the settlor becoming a New Zealand resident. Unless the settlor is a transitional resident\*, the 12 months to change trust type starts on the date the settlor ceases to be a transitional resident. If the trust makes an election it will be treated either as: • a foreign trust, for any distribution of income, capital profits or capital gains the trust derived before it made the election, or • a complying trust, for any distribution of income, capital profits or capital gains the trust derived after it made the election. \* See glossary ird.govt.nz 25 This treatment does not apply if the trust fails to pay the tax on the trustees' income. The trust will be treated as a non-complying trust for any distributions made in the income year in which the tax is not paid and in subsequent income years. Only distributions from amounts derived after the trust made the election will be treated as having been made from a non-complying trust. If the election is made part-way through an income year, the income, profits or capital gains for the year must be allocated to the appropriate period that the trust was a foreign or complying trust, according to the date they were derived on. Settled in 1989 or later income years A non-complying or foreign trust settled during the 1989 or later income years, and not otherwise liable to New Zealand income tax on its trustee income, may elect to become a complying trust. The election must be made within the time for filing the trust’s tax return for the income year of settlement. If New Zealand income tax is paid on all trustee income derived since the date of settlement, the trust will meet the complying trust definition at the date of the distribution. Complying trusts no longer liable for New Zealand tax A trust that was formerly a complying trust, but ceased to be liable for New Zealand income tax on its trustee income (for example, if the settlor becomes a non-resident), ceases to be a complying trust. However, such a trust can elect or re-elect to be a complying trust. The election must be made within the time for filing the tax return for the income year in which the trust ceased to be a complying trust. The income tax liability relating to trustee income for each income years since the trust began must also be satisfied. The trust will again be treated as a complying trust from the date it would otherwise have ceased to be liable for New Zealand tax. If no election is made, the trust will become a non-complying trust. Note To become a complying trust, it must make its election before the relevant time limit expires. Late elections cannot be accepted. TRUSTS AND ESTATES 26 Part 5 - Tax returns for trusts and beneficiaries The trust's tax return The trustee must file an IR6 tax return for the trust each year. This return is separate from the trustee's own personal tax return. In the IR6 return the trustee shows: • all income derived by the trust, including any income from a Mäori authority • the tax credits relating to that income • the allocation of income between beneficiary income and trustee income, and • any taxable distributions made. The trustee then calculates the tax payable on the beneficiary income, trustee income and taxable distributions. Allocation of RWT credits Any associated tax credits are generally also allocated in the same proportion as the income. However, if a trustee is paying income tax on beneficiary income on behalf of the beneficiaries, the trustee has the option of detaching some or all of the RWT credits associated with the resident passive income distributed to beneficiaries and reallocating the credits between beneficiaries and trustee to satisfy the income tax on beneficiary income and trustee income. Note The option of detaching RWT credits is only available to a trustee who pays income tax on beneficiary income on behalf of the beneficiaries. If the trustee detaches RWT credits from resident passive income distributed to a beneficiary (Beneficiary A), the trustee must pay Beneficiary A an RWT substitution payment equal to the amount of the detached RWT credits. The trustee can then either: • Reallocate the detached RWT credits to Beneficiary B by meeting Beneficiary B’s income tax on beneficiary income; • Retain the detached RWT credits to satisfy income tax on trustee income; or • A combination of both. The reallocated or retained RWT credit is not income of either Beneficiary B or the trustee – it is the transfer of RWT credits. ird.govt.nz 27 The RWT credits available to Beneficiary A are then reduced by the amount of the RWT substitution payment. The RWT substitution payment is treated as resident passive income that is beneficiary income of Beneficiary A. However, there is no liability or obligation on the trustee to withhold RWT in relation to the RWT substitution payment. The practical effect of the reallocation exercise is that the RWT credit is transferred from one taxpayer (Beneficiary A) to another (Beneficiary B or trustee) and the transferred RWT credit is used to satisfy the trustee’s obligations for satisfying the income tax liability on trustee income and/or Beneficiary B’s beneficiary income. Reallocating the RWT credits also means that Beneficiary A will not need to seek a refund from the Commissioner for the excess RWT credits and, instead, receives a cash payment from the trustee in substitution for the RWT credits. Example The trustee of the Olive Family trust derives $100 in interest, from which 33% tax has been deducted, leaving $67 in cash, and the trustee receives an entitlement to $33 in RWT credits. The Olive Family trust distributes all of the interest to Brook as beneficiary income, with Brook receiving $67 in cash and $33 in RWT credits. Brook has a marginal tax rate of 17.5%, which means her tax liability on her beneficiary income is $17.50. Since the trustee is paying income tax on beneficiary income for Brook, the trustee can detach $15.50 from the RWT credits allocated to Brook and pay her cash of $15.50 in substitution for the detached RWT credit. This leaves Brook with $17.50 of RWT tax credit – enough to satisfy her income tax on beneficiary income. Brook is in the same position as if she had obtained a refund of the excess RWT credit from the Commissioner. The trustee can retain the detached RWT credit of $15.50 to satisfy income tax on trustee income. Allocation of imputation credits The imputation credits must be allocated in proportion to the total distributions received from the trust. This also applies to Mäori authority credits and FDP (foreign dividend payment) credits attached to dividends distributed as beneficiary income. This means a trust cannot choose to allocate credits to beneficiaries who may be better able to use them than other beneficiaries. TRUSTS AND ESTATES 28 Use this formula to allocate the imputation and FDP credits: a× b c In this formula: a is the total imputation and FDP credits attached to all dividends distributed to beneficiaries during the income year b is the total distribution, including capital distributions, to the particular beneficiary during the income year c is the total distributions made to all beneficiaries during the income year. The beneficiaries can then claim a credit for tax paid on their beneficiary income and taxable distributions (and their share of tax credits) in their personal income tax returns. If a imputation credit adjusted by the formula is allocated to a beneficiary, then the imputation credit included in the gross dividend as part of beneficiary’s assessable income is also adjusted by the corresponding amount in the beneficiary’s income tax return. Note If a trust receives any income the trustee must complete a return and meet certain reporting obligations. However, if the income is below set thresholds (see page 5) and certain criteria is met, it can be excused from filing returns by completing the Non-active trust declaration - IR633 in myIR. If it subsequently becomes active again, for example, derives income in a future year, then it must send in a return. The beneficiaries' tax returns A person who receives beneficiary income from any type of trust, or a taxable distribution from a foreign trust, must include this income in their tax return for that year and pay tax on it at their normal rates. If the trust has deducted tax before paying the income to the beneficiary, the beneficiary can claim a credit for this tax deducted. However, if the tax was deducted overseas, the maximum credit a New Zealand beneficiary can claim is the amount of New Zealand income tax payable on their share of the overseas trust income. ird.govt.nz 29 If the trust's balance date is not 31 March, the beneficiary must include any income from the trust in their tax return for the year that corresponds with the trust's accounting year. There's no need to make any separate calculations to allow for a difference in balance dates. If a person receives beneficiary income or taxable distributions from a foreign or non-complying trust, they should fill in the details of the trust income on a Schedule of beneficiary’s estate or trust income - IR307 form, and include this with their tax return. If the trust has a New Zealand tax agent, they will usually fill in an IR307 form for each beneficiary to include with their individual tax return. These forms will then show the beneficiaries how much income to declare, and the amount of any tax credits to claim. Note Any taxable distributions a beneficiary receives from a non-complying trust are to be included separately in the beneficiary’s tax return. These distributions will be taxed separately at a flat rate of 45 cents in the dollar. Tax returns for a deceased person's estate The personal representative, executor or administrator of a deceased person's estate must file all tax returns the deceased person would otherwise have had to file and make sure any tax due is paid. The tax return to be used for the period to the date of death is an Individual tax return - IR3. The return must show their IRD number and include all gross income the deceased person derived up until that date. After the date of death, the person's estate will get a new IRD number and any income must be returned in an Income tax return: Estate or Trust - IR6 form. The first estate return will include all income derived and expenditure incurred from the date of death until the end of the return period. From the 2022/2023 income year reportable income, for example, salary, pension or interest received up to 28 days following death can be included in either the return to date of death or alternatively in an estate return. Even after an estate has been wound up, we can audit the deceased person's tax returns for previous years. If more tax becomes payable as a result of such an audit, the estate is still liable to pay this tax. If there are no estate funds available because the final distribution has been made, the executor or administrator is liable for the extra tax assessed. TRUSTS AND ESTATES 30 Charitable trusts or estates A trust will be a charitable trust if all income the trustee derives is held solely for charitable purposes, and no person associated with the trust can gain any personal profit from it. There are special tax exemptions available to charitable trusts and estates. You'll find more information about charitable trusts and estates in our Charitable organisations - IR255 guide. Final trust or estate return The trustees of a trust or estate are personally responsible for any tax payable on the trust income. This means that before an estate or trust is wound up and its assets distributed, all income must be returned and enough funds retained to pay any tax due. The trustee must file a tax return to the date of winding up, which must show the final distribution of the income. ird.govt.nz 31 Part 6 - Provisional tax The principle of provisional tax The principle of provisional tax is that a trust pays tax as it earns income, instead of having a large tax bill at the end of the year. Provisional tax is charged in instalments during an income year. When the trust files its tax return, it can claim a credit for the provisional tax it's paid during the year. Circumstances when a trust must pay provisional tax One of the important concepts in provisional tax is residual income tax (RIT). This is the amount of tax payable on the trust's income for the year, after deducting any allowable tax credits (but not provisional tax payments). This includes tax payable by the trustee on both beneficiary income and trustee income. • If a trust's RIT is $5000 or less, the trust does not have to pay provisional tax for the following year, but it can choose to make voluntary payments. • If a trust's RIT is more than $5000, the trust will generally have to pay provisional tax for the following income year. There are three different methods for calculating the amount of provisional tax payable: the standard option, the estimation option or the ratio option. These methods are explained on pages 32 and 33. • If a trust's RIT is more than $5000, but the trust expects its RIT at the end of the following year to be $5000 or less, it can estimate its provisional tax at nil. However, before making such an estimate please read the section on use-of-money interest - see page 33. Provisional tax calculation methods Standard option Provisional tax calculations may change from year to year. For current and past rates go to ird.govt.nz/income-tax/provisional-tax/provisional-tax-options/standard- option. If a trust uses the standard option, it can change to the estimation option at any time up until the due date of the final instalment of provisional tax. If a trust using the standard option wishes to change to the ratio option it must elect to use the ratio before the tax year in which it wants to use the ratio. TRUSTS AND ESTATES 32 Estimation option A trust can choose to estimate its provisional tax by estimating its income for the year and then calculating the tax on it. This is usually beneficial for trusts that expect the following year's income to be less than the current year's income. If the trust used the standard option in this situation, it would end up paying more tax than it had to during the year, and then receive a refund at the end of the year. However, if a trust chooses the estimation option and the RIT is greater than the provisional tax paid, it can be charged interest from the first instalment date and may be liable for a shortfall penalty of 20% of the underpaid provisional tax for lack of reasonable care. Once a trust chooses the estimation option, it cannot switch to the standard or ratio option during that income year. However, it can change the amount of the estimation at any time up until the due date for the final instalment of provisional tax. Note An estimate must be fair and reasonable at each instalment date. Ratio option From the 2008-2009 tax year, trusts are able to pay their provisional tax in line with when income is received. This option is only available to GST-registered trusts. Using the ratio option, six provisional tax instalments are made based on a trust's GST turnover. We'll calculate a percentage based on the prior year's RIT divided by the total GST supplies for the corresponding year. To calculate each provisional tax instalment, a trust multiplies the percentage which is preprinted on their GST103 return, by the total taxable supplies for the two-month period (monthly payers will add the taxable supplies for two return periods). If a trust makes the correct ratio payments by the due dates, it will not be charged interest if the provisional tax falls short of the RIT for the year. To use the ratio option, a trust must apply by phone or in writing before the start of the tax year they want to use this option in. ird.govt.nz 33 Use-of-money interest (UOMI) Only tax on trustee income is subject to UOMI. We will not charge or pay interest on tax on the trust's beneficiary income. If the trust's RIT on trustee income is more than $5000, and the trust has paid too much provisional tax for this income, we may pay interest. However, if the provisional tax paid is less than the RIT, we may charge interest. There are changes to when UOMI is charged for the 2018 income year onwards There are changes in debit and credit use-of-money interest (UOMI) on provisional tax for the 2018 income year onwards when using the standard option, and when changing from the standard option to the estimation option for the final instalment, provided all required payments are made in full and on time. There is no change to debit or credit use-of-money interest when using the estimation option instalment(s) other than at the final instalment. When determining the interest start date, the $50,000 RIT threshold for individuals using the standard option has been increased to $60,000. This threshold will also apply to non-individuals, including trusts. Provisional tax amount End of year residual income tax (RIT) Credit or debit UOMICalculated from More than RIT amount Less than $60,000 Credit UOMI calculated on the difference between the provisional tax amount paid and the RIT Terminal tax due date More than RIT $60,000 or more Credit UOMI calculated on the difference between the provisional tax amount paid and the RIT Final instalment date Less than RIT $60,000 or more Debit UOMI calculated on the difference between the provisional tax amount paid and the RIT Final instalment date Less than RIT Less than $60,000 Debit UOMI calculated on the difference between the provisional tax amount paid and the RIT Terminal tax due date If the trust has paid all but the last instalment in full and on time using the standard option then UOMI will apply from the final instalment due date. This will also apply if the trust has changed to the estimation option at or before the final instalment date due date. TRUSTS AND ESTATES 34 If the trust has paid an instalment late or does not pay it at all UOMI will be charged from the due date of the instalment on the lesser of: • the amount of the instalment that was paid less the amount that should have paid, or • your RIT divided by the number of instalments for the tax year less the amount paid. The above changes may not apply if the trust: • is associated to a company and they are not covered by the above standard option rules or they do not use the GST ratio option, or • has entered a provisional tax interest avoidance arrangement. Interest applies from the day after each provisional tax instalment date, if the RIT on trustee income is more than $5000 when using the estimation option for the instalments other than the final instalment date. If they have elected to use the ratio option, interest applies from the day after the terminal tax due date. If the trust's RIT on trustee income is $5000 or less, and it's paid too much provisional tax for trustee income, it can elect to be a provisional tax payer for that year. The trust may then still be paid interest on the overpaid provisional tax. A trust may elect to be a provisional tax payer if: • it expects to have RIT on trustee income of more than $5000, and • it pays provisional tax on trustee income of more than $5000 by the last provisional tax instalment date. If you experience problems with the way UOMI for the trust is calculated, call us on 0800 377 774. Any UOMI charged will generally be tax-deductible, while UOMI received is treated as gross income. If a trust is charged UOMI, it should be paid by the due date for paying its end-of-year tax bill (usually 7 February, or 7 April if the trust has a tax agent). However, interest will continue to be charged on a daily basis until the tax is paid. The only way to stop interest from accruing is to pay the unpaid tax on trustee income. Further information For more information on provisional tax and UOMI, read our Provisional tax - IR289 guide. ird.govt.nz 35 Late payment penalties If tax is not paid by the due date, a late payment penalty will be charged. An initial 1% late payment penalty will be charged on the day after the due date. A further 4% penalty will be charged if there's still an amount of unpaid tax (including penalties) at the end of the 7th day from the due date. For income years before 2018 Every month after the due date, a further 1% will be added to any unpaid amount (including penalties). Note Penalties are not charged on unpaid amounts less than $100.

In this guide, the term “trust” also applies to estates unless specifically stated otherwise. This information does not apply to unit trusts (as these are treated as companies for income tax purposes) or trusts that are superannuation funds (as different rules apply). A glossary of terms is on page 6. Trust returns If a trust, estate or testamentary trust (trust created by a person under their will) receives any income the trustee must complete a return and meet certain reporting obligations. However, if the income is below set thresholds (see below) and certain criteria is met, it can be excused from filing returns by completing the Non-active trust declaration - IR633 in myIR. If it subsequently becomes active again, eg. derives income in a future year, then it must send in a return. Filing thresholds Trust and Estates • Reportable income of $1,000 or less, • No deductions, • Not involved in any transactions that give income to an associated person or entity, • No transactions that give a benefit subject to FBT to a current or former employee. • Reasonable fees for administering the trust. • Bank charges or minimal administrative costs that are $1,500 or less for the year. • Insurance, rates, interest, and other costs related to living in a house owned by the trust and incurred by the beneficiaries of the trust. Testamentary Trust • Reportable income of $5,000 or less • Non-reportable income of up to $1,000 with deductions that would reduce the net income to below $200. ird.govt.nz 6 Glossary Associated persons Associated persons are defined as: • two companies • a company and a person other than a company • two relatives • a person and a trustee for a relative • a trustee and a beneficiary • trustees with a common settlor • a trustee and a settlor • a settlor and a beneficiary • a trustee and a person with the power of appointment or removal of the trustee • a partnership and a partner • two persons who are each associated with the same third person (tripartite test). For full details on associated persons read A guide to associated persons definitions for income tax purposes - IR620. You can download this from ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Corpus This is the market value of any property settled on a trust, at the date of settlement. Disabled beneficiary trust A trust whose only beneficiaries (ignoring any residual beneficiaries, who can only receive trust property once all the disabled beneficiaries have died) are persons who, for some, or all, of the income year, received the following: • the disability allowance, • the child disability allowance, • the supported living payment on the ground of restricted work capacity, or • the JobSeeker Health Conditions and Disability (if this has been paid for at least 6 months). This also includes persons over 65 who received these payments in the year, or year before they turned 65. There can be more than one disabled beneficiary. TRUSTS AND ESTATES 7 Disposition of property Any form of transfer, conveyance, assignment, settlement, delivery, payment or other allocation of property to a trust (or for its benefit) is a disposition of property. This includes dispositions made under a person's will and through intestacy (dying without a will). Foreign Exemption Trust This is a trust that is a foreign trust, with a New Zealand resident trustee but also includes trusts where a trustee makes or has made use of the foreign sourced income exemption. Inter vivos trust This is a trust settled during the lifetime of the settlor. This term is used when working out whether trustee income from overseas is subject to New Zealand income tax. Resident You are a New Zealand tax resident in any of these situations: • you're in New Zealand for more than 183 days in any twelve-month period, or • you have an enduring relationship with New Zealand, or • you have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, or • you're away from New Zealand in the service of the New Zealand Government. Testamentary trust A trust created by a person's will, codicil or intestacy (dying without a will), or by a court order at the time of the person's death. Transitional resident A transitional resident is an individual who has arrived in New Zealand after 1 April 2006 and qualifies for a temporary tax exemption on their foreign income. To qualify as a transitional resident, the individual must not have been resident in New Zealand for the last 10 years, or have been a transitional resident before. For more information see ird.govt.nz/roles/nz-tax-residents/exemption Trust that is a tax charity A trust that is a tax charity can only use income for charitable purposes. For more information, read our guide Charitable organisations - IR255. ird.govt.nz 8 Part 1 - Explaining the important concepts How a trust starts To create a trust, a person (the settlor) gives money or property to another person (the trustee), to be held in trust for the benefit of either the trust's beneficiaries, or a purpose recognised by law. There should be a signed trust deed (agreement) that acknowledges the settlement, but it's possible to establish a trust verbally. Tr u s t e e s The trustee holds the trust's property in trust for the beneficiary, and administers or manages the trust. A trustee includes an executor or administrator of an estate, which may be the Public Trustee or the Mäori Trustee. Companies may also act as trustees. Settlors Note When a trustee of a trust owes an amount to a beneficiary of the trust, the beneficiary does not become a settlor when either: • the trust pays the beneficiary a market interest rate equal to or greater than the prescribed rate of interest, or • the amount retained in the beneficiary’s current account at the end of the income year is not more than $25,000. A settlor of the trust can include any person who at any time: • transfers value –to a trust, or –for the benefit of the trust, or –on terms of the trust • provides financial assistance to the trust for its value. These are called settlements. Trusts may also be settled by companies. TRUSTS AND ESTATES 9 Determining who is a settlor of a trust and whether they're a resident is important for establishing whether the trust's overseas income is taxable in New Zealand. These factors also affect the category of a trust (complying, foreign, or non-complying - explained in Part 2 of this guide) and which distributions to beneficiaries are non-taxable. Settlement A settlement is any action that makes a person a settlor of a trust and includes any of the following: • disposal of any property to the trust for less than market value • property or funds made available to the trust for less than market value • services provided to the trust for less than market value • any property acquired from the trust or any service from the trustee for greater than market value. Settlement also includes any failure to act or enter into any or part of any of the above actions. Note The courts will only recognise that a valid trust has been created if it’s covered in a trust deed. You should seek professional advice about drawing up a trust deed. Information a settlor must give us A New Zealand resident settlor must tell us the details within three months of making a settlement on a trust that does not have New Zealand resident trustees. The settlor must also give us the names and addresses of the trust's trustees and beneficiaries. For disclosure purposes, a settlement also includes a settlement made as a nominee of another person, or of a nominal amount made at the request of another person. A settlor of a trust who is resident in New Zealand for any part of the income year, may be taxed as an agent of the trustee on trustee income which is derived in that income year, if the trust ceases to have a New Zealand trustee. If all the trustees of the trust cease to be New Zealand residents, the settlor must tell us within three months of the date on which the trust ceased to have a resident trustee. In each of these situations, the settlor must complete a Settlors of trusts disclosure - IR462 form within three months and send it to us. ird.govt.nz 10 How the trust earns income Usually, the money or property settled on the trust is used as an investment to earn further revenue, or as capital to fund a trading operation. This revenue becomes the trust's income as it's earned. The initial settlement on the trust is not income for tax purposes, but the settlor may have to pay gift duty on it if it's received before 1 October 2011, depending on the value of the settlement. Estates The trust tax rules also apply to estates of people who have died, if such an estate continues to earn income after the person's death. When we refer to "trusts" in this guide we also include estates, unless specifically excluded by the context. The trust's income The trust's income is deemed to include certain settlements of property on a trust. • Property settled by a trustee of another trust so long as it would have counted as income if that trust had distributed the property to one of its beneficiaries instead (see page 21). • A settlement of property on a trust, which would, if not for the settlement, have constituted: –gross income of the settlor, or –a dividend for which the settlor would have, if not for settlement, been liable to deduct FDP (foreign dividend payment) if the settlor is a resident or if the settlor had been a resident in New Zealand and subject to our income tax laws at that time. • A settlement of property on a trust for which the settlor claims a deduction from gross income for New Zealand tax purposes. These property settlements are excluded from the definition of corpus. TRUSTS AND ESTATES 11 The trust's income is separated into two parts for tax purposes: beneficiary income and trustee income. The tax on these two parts is then calculated separately, to arrive at the total tax payable on the trust's income. Here's how the income is allocated: • Beneficiary income is an amount of income derived by a trustee of the trust and allocated to a beneficiary during any income year that either: –vests absolutely in the beneficiary during that income year, or –is paid or applied for the benefit of the beneficiary within six months after the end of that income year. • Trustee income is all income the trust earns in its income year that: –does not vest absolutely in the beneficiary during that income year, or –is not paid or applied for the benefit of the beneficiary within six months after the end of that income year. Trusts can make other types of distributions, some of which will also be taxable. These other distributions are explained in Part 4 of this guide. How the trust's tax is calculated depends on the type of trust, and whether the settlor and/or trustees are New Zealand residents. The different types of trust are explained in Part 2 of this guide. Foreign exemption trusts disclosure and record keeping rules New Zealand resident trustees are required, for each foreign exemption trust they administer, to: • complete and submit to us a New Zealand foreign trust - IR607 form, • comply with annual return filing requirements, and • keep financial and other records for New Zealand tax purposes. An IR607 can be completed in myIR or you can download the IR607 from ird.govt.nz/forms-guides or by emailing nzforeigntrusts@ird.govt.nz Registration must be completed by New Zealand resident trustees on the later of: • March 2023 or • the due date of an income tax return of the trust relating to the first income year for which the trust meets the requirements to be a foreign exemption trust. More information Full details of the rules are in the Tax Information Bulletin Vol 29, No 4 (May 2017) and TIB Vol 35, No 5 (June 2023). ird.govt.nz 12 Part 2 - Different types of trusts For income tax purposes, there are three types of trust: • complying trusts • foreign trusts (including foreign exemption trusts) • non-complying trusts. The type of trust is important, because it determines whether some distributions from a trust are taxable. Complying trusts A complying trust is one that has been taxed in New Zealand on all its trustee income since the date it began. Complying trusts include: • trusts settled by New Zealand residents with New Zealand trustees • estates of people who were New Zealand residents when they died • other trusts which have elected to become a complying trust. A trust remains a complying trust if, since settlement of the trust, the trustees have satisfied all their obligations for its income tax liabilities. A trust is not a complying trust if: • the only trustee income is non-resident passive income, or • the trustees earn foreign-sourced income excluded from the meaning of gross income. If a trust ceases to meet the conditions for a complying trust in an income year, it will no longer be a complying trust - it will generally become a non-complying trust (see definition on page 13). A complying trust will not lose its complying status simply because one or more of the following apply: • the trust has no trustee income and there is no tax liability • the only trustee income is tax-exempt • the trust's deductible expenses or losses exceed the trustee income, so there is no tax payable on the net trustee income. TRUSTS AND ESTATES 13 Foreign trusts A trust will be a foreign trust if none of its settlors have been resident in New Zealand since the later of these dates: • 17 December 1987 • the date the trust was first settled. A trust will cease to be a foreign trust if it makes any distribution after a settlor becomes a New Zealand resident, or if a New Zealand resident makes a settlement on the trust. Non-complying trusts A non-complying trust is any trust that is neither a complying trust nor a foreign trust at the time it makes a distribution. See page 23 for more information on distributions from a non- complying trust. It's generally a trust that has a resident settlor, has been established overseas with non-resident trustees, and has not been liable for New Zealand income tax since it was first settled. It also includes a trust where its trustee income has been liable for full New Zealand tax but the trustees have not paid the tax. New arrivals in New Zealand New residents who arrive in New Zealand may have settled a trust before they arrived in this country. Such a trust would normally be a foreign trust, but it can elect to become a complying trust. The benefits of such an election will become clearer in Part 4 of this guide, because the type of trust affects how some distributions to beneficiaries are taxed. To change types, the trust must elect to pay New Zealand income tax on its trustee income within 12 months of when the settlor first arrives in New Zealand, unless the settlor is a transitional resident\*. If the settlor is not a transitional resident the trustee income will become taxable in New Zealand, from the date the trust makes the election. If the settlor is a transitional resident, the 12 months to elect to change trust types starts on the date the settlor ceases to be a transitional resident. The trust should use an Election to pay income tax on trustee income - IR463 form to make this election. \* See glossary ird.govt.nz 14 If the trust does not make an election, it'll be treated as one of the following: • a foreign trust, for any distribution that consists of income, capital profits or capital gains derived before the election expiry date • a non-complying trust, for any distribution that consists of income, capital profits or capital gains derived after the election expiry date. TRUSTS AND ESTATES 15 Part 3 - How the trust's income is taxed Tax on trustee income IncomeTa x R a t e Trusts with more than $10,000 net income (and nothing below applies)39% Trusts with up to $10,000 net income33% Disabled beneficiary trusts33% Deceased estates (for the year of death and 3 subsequent income years)33% Energy consumer trusts33% Widely-held superannuation funds and legacy superannuation fund trusts28% General rule The trustee is liable for New Zealand income tax on income derived from New Zealand, irrespective of where the trustee lives. The trustee is also liable for New Zealand income tax on income derived from outside New Zealand where: • any settlor is resident in New Zealand at any time during the income year, or • any settlor of an inter vivos or a testamentary trust died while they were resident in New Zealand and a trustee is resident in New Zealand at any time during the income year. Exceptions to the general rule There are two situations in which a trustee is not liable for income tax on trustee income derived from outside New Zealand. These apply where the trustee is resident outside New Zealand at all times during the income year and either: • no settlement has been made on the trust since 17 December 1987, or • the only settlements made on the trust were by settlors who were not resident in New Zealand at the time of settlement and who have not been resident in New Zealand since 17 December 1987. Neither exception applies where an election to pay tax on trustee income has been made by the trustee. These exceptions do not affect the liability to income tax for any settlor of the trust, for example, where the settlor elects to pay tax on trustee income. The trustee income remains liable for income tax for the purpose of determining whether the trust is a complying trust. ird.govt.nz 16 Settlor liability If a trust was settled before 17 December 1987, and no settlement has been made on the trust since then, the settlor is not liable for tax on trustee income unless they elect to pay tax on it. Any settlor of a trust who is a resident in New Zealand at any time during the income year is liable for income tax on trustee income as an agent of the trustee, with certain exceptions. If there's more than one New Zealand resident settlor, these settlors are jointly liable for the tax on trustee income. This means that any or all of the New Zealand resident settlors are liable for this tax. The New Zealand resident settlor will not be liable for the income tax on trustee income if any of these conditions are met. • A trustee is resident in New Zealand at all times during the income year. • The settlor, being a natural person (not a company), was not a New Zealand resident at the time they made any settlement on the trust, unless the settlor elects to pay tax on trustee income. • The settlor can show to our satisfaction that their share of the trust's tax liability is excessive, taking into account the settlements on the trust made by all settlors. • The trustee income is derived by the application of the financial arrangement rules of the Income Tax Act to any amounts remitted by the settlor under any financial arrangement. Provisional tax If a trust's residual income tax (RIT) at the end of an income year is more than $5000, it will generally have to pay provisional tax on the following year's income. RIT is the amount of tax due at the end of the year, after deducting all tax credits the trust can claim (except provisional tax payments). Provisional tax for trusts is explained fully in Part 6 of this guide. Tax on beneficiary income New Zealand resident beneficiaries Beneficiaries who are New Zealand residents are liable for New Zealand income tax on all their income, from any source in the world. Beneficiary income they receive from any trust will be taxable in New Zealand, at their normal income tax rates. To calculate normal income tax rates the trustee must first calculate the tax payable on the total taxable income of the beneficiary and then determine the portion referable to just the beneficiary’s income and taxable distributions. TRUSTS AND ESTATES 17 Example During the income year beneficiary derives beneficiary income of $5,000 and salary $45,000, (not beneficiary income) total taxable income $50,000. Tax payable by the trustee on the beneficiary income is calculated as follows: Tax payable on taxable income at current marginal rates $48,000 × (10.5% to $14,000 then 17.5%) = $7,420 $2,000 × 30% = $600 Total = $8,020 Tax payable on beneficiary income $8,020 × ($5,000 ÷ $50,000) = $802 Corporate beneficiaries and beneficiaries under 16 may be subject to special rules. For more information, please see pages 18-20. Any amount derived by the trustee of a community trust is exempt from income tax. The distributions from community trusts are not taxed on beneficiary income, instead they're included in the gross income of the beneficiaries. The trustee must pay tax on behalf of the beneficiary for income allocated to that beneficiary. The beneficiary can then claim a tax credit for the tax paid on their behalf. Beneficiaries are required to return all income received in their own personal tax return. However, the trustee and beneficiary can agree between themselves not to have tax deducted from trust income before the beneficiary receives it. This is called having the income "transferred direct", and it may be useful in cases such as when the beneficiary has other tax losses to offset against the trust income in their tax return. If the income is transferred direct and the beneficiary does not pay any tax on it, the trustees can still be held liable for the unpaid tax. Any distributions made from a non-complying trust to the beneficiary is taxed at 45%. If the trust subsequently gains its complying status, that distribution will be reversed. There are also some other trust distributions beneficiaries must declare for income tax purposes. These are explained in Part 4 of this guide. The nature of the trust's income continues when allocated to the beneficiaries. So interest earned by the trust and allocated to a beneficiary is interest income of the beneficiary. The trustee cannot allocate a loss or a part of a loss to a beneficiary. This includes a negative amount for certain types of income even where the overall allocation of all income types is positive. ird.govt.nz 18 Tax credits such as RWT are attached to the income from which they were withheld, so credits can generally only be allocated in the same proportion as the relevant type of income allocated. For more information see page 26. Timing of allocation of beneficiary income The date by which income allocation to beneficiaries must be allocated, is the later of: • six months after balance date, or • the earlier of: –the date on which the trustee files the return of income for the income year, or –the date by which the trustee must file a return for the income year. Example Olive Family Trust is allocating income to beneficiaries for the year ended 31 March 2024. The trust return is due on 7 July 2024. The income should be allocated by the later of: • 30 September 2024, or • the earlier of: –the date the return is filed, or –7 July 2024. If the trust has a tax agent, the extension of time for filing an income tax return still applies. Special rules for beneficiaries who are children (the "minor beneficiary rule") The minor beneficiary rule applies to income derived from 1 April 2001 or the equivalent income year. Certain distributions of beneficiary income to children under 16 (minors) on the balance date of the trust must be taxed as a final tax at the trustee tax rate of 39%. The rule does not apply to income derived in that income year if the minor turned 16 during that year. Minor beneficiary income is taxed as trustees' income and is not the minor's gross income. For the purposes of entries in a beneficiary's account with a trust, the tax on beneficiary income, although taxed as trustees' income, is still treated as being paid on behalf of the beneficiary. The minor beneficiary rule applies to beneficiary income derived by a minor from property settled on a trust by: • a relative or legal guardian of the minor, or • a person associated with a relative or legal guardian. TRUSTS AND ESTATES 19 The rule applies to all beneficiary income distributed to a minor from a trust unless all the settlements on that trust were made: • by a settlor who received the property as an agent for the beneficiary from someone other than a relative, guardian or their associate • by a settlor who's been ordered by a court to pay damages or compensation to the minor \* by a settlor against whom a protection order has been made under section 14 of the Domestic Violence Act 1995.\* 1 • under the terms of a will, codicil, intestacy or any variations of these by a court, if the minor or their brother or sister, or half-brother or half-sister, was alive within 12 months after the date of the settlor's death. If a trust includes some settlements that fit within one of these criteria, and some settlements that do not, special rules apply. For more information see your tax agent or call us on 0800 377 774. The rule does not apply if: • the minor is a non-resident • the minor receives a child disability allowance under the Social Security Act 2018 • the minor receives beneficiary income from a group investment fund or Ma ̄ ori authority • the beneficiary income derived is $1,000 or less in an income year. However, if the beneficiary's income is over $1,000, all the beneficiary income is subject to the rule. Corporate beneficiaries From the 2025 tax year onwards, specific rules for distributions to beneficiaries that are closely held companies in certain circumstances apply. Any income distributed to a beneficiary that is a closely held company (but not a Māori authority or tax charity) and where the settlor of the trust holds natural love & affection for a shareholder of that company, will be taxed at the trustee tax rate of 39%. It will not be taxed at the corporate tax rate. This rule will not apply where the trust is a securitisation trust. \* This exception only applies if the minor is a protected person in relation to the protection order and the settlement on the trust is made before the protection order is made, or during the time the protection order is in force. ird.govt.nz 20 Beneficiaries and provisional tax If a beneficiary's residual income tax (RIT) is more than $5000, they will generally have to pay provisional tax for the following year. RIT is the amount of tax due at the end of the year, after deducting all tax credits the beneficiary can claim, including tax paid by the trustee on the beneficiary's behalf, but excluding provisional tax payments. Our guide Provisional tax - IR289 explains these rules. Non-resident beneficiaries The trust must deduct NRWT (non-resident withholding tax) from any interest, dividends or royalties before the non-resident beneficiary receives them. This withholding tax is the final tax payable on the income. They should be able to claim a credit for their tax paid in their overseas tax return. Other income, such as income from a rental property, will be subject to New Zealand income tax at the normal rates. Note Beneficiary income retains its nature in the beneficiary’s hands - for example, if the trust earned the income from dividends, the beneficiary should return it as dividends in their overseas tax return. If a trust has non-resident beneficiaries, our NRWT - payer’s guide - IR291 contains information the trust administrators will need to know. If a beneficiary is not a New Zealand resident, and they receive beneficiary income that did not come from New Zealand sources, the beneficiary will not have to pay New Zealand income tax on this income. Beneficiaries temporarily ceasing to be resident If a beneficiary ceases to be a New Zealand resident and then becomes a New Zealand resident again within five years, they must pay New Zealand income tax on any beneficiary income or taxable distributions (explained in Part 4) received from a foreign or non-complying trust. In this situation, any beneficiary income or taxable distributions the beneficiary received while they were a non-resident, will be taxable as such in the year in which the beneficiary again becomes a New Zealand resident. TRUSTS AND ESTATES 21 Part 4 - Other distributions to beneficiaries As well as distributing beneficiary income, as explained in Part 3, a trust can distribute money or assets to its beneficiaries by: • distributing trustee income accumulated in previous years • distributing capital profits or gains made from disposing of some of its assets or property • supplying trust property or services to the beneficiary for less than full value • acquiring property or services from the beneficiary for more than full value • making a distribution from the trust's corpus • settling sums or property for the benefit of another trust to the extent that if distributed to a beneficiary resident in New Zealand, the sum or property would have constituted beneficiary income or a taxable distribution to that beneficiary. A beneficiary who receives such a distribution may have to pay income tax on it. This will depend on the type of trust making the distribution. This is why the difference between complying trusts, foreign trusts and non-complying trusts is significant. Distributions of accumulated trustee income and capital profits or gains that were derived by the trust in the 1988 or earlier income years are not treated as taxable distributions. Distributions from complying trusts If a complying trust makes a distribution of any of the types listed above, the beneficiary receiving the distribution will not have to pay income tax on it. This is the principal advantage of being a complying trust. ird.govt.nz 22 Distributions from foreign trusts When a foreign trust makes a distribution of any of the types listed on page 21, it will be a taxable distribution unless it's from the trust's corpus, or from capital profits or gains from transactions with non-associated persons (an adjustment is made for any capital loss incurred in the year the profit was realised). This means the beneficiary must pay tax on the distribution at their normal tax rate. Order of sources of distributions to beneficiaries When a foreign trust makes a distribution to a beneficiary, for tax purposes the distribution will be considered to have come from different sources in the following order: 1. Income the trust derived that is beneficiary income in the previous income year – see page 18 2. Income the trust derived in the current income year. 3. Income (other than beneficiary income) the trust derived in a previous income year (accumulated trustee income). 4. Any capital profit or gain realised in the current income year. 5. Any accumulated capital profit or gain realised in previous income years. 6. The corpus of the trust. However, there are certain distributions not subject to the order listed above. These are: • any distribution from a non-discretionary trust: –created by will, codicil or court order modifying the will or codicil –created on an intestacy, or –on which no settlement has been made since 17 December 1987 • any distribution from a foreign trust that has elected to become a complying trust • any distribution under which a beneficiary acquired trust property for less than market value • any distribution under which a beneficiary acquired services from the trust for less than market value. Except for the last two items in this list, the distributions are deemed to consist of amounts that reflect the terms of the trust deed, or that the trustee(s) determine(s). If a foreign trust does not keep enough records to accurately show the source of a distribution, it will be a taxable distribution. TRUSTS AND ESTATES 23 Distributions that are taxable to the beneficiary If a New Zealand resident beneficiary receives a taxable distribution from a foreign trust, this distribution must be included in the beneficiary's tax return as part of their assessable income. This is on top of any beneficiary income the beneficiary receives from the trust. The beneficiary will then pay tax on the distribution at their normal income tax rates. If the beneficiary receiving the distribution from a foreign trust is not a New Zealand resident, then they only have to pay New Zealand income tax on any part of the distribution that came from a source in New Zealand. Distributions from non-complying trusts When a non-complying trust makes a distribution of any of the types listed on page 21, it will be taxable unless it's from the trust's corpus. If the beneficiary receiving the distribution from a non-complying trust is a New Zealand resident, it's included in the person's tax return with their other income for the year. It will be taxed at a flat rate of 45 cents in the dollar. Distributions of beneficiary income are taxed at the beneficiary's normal tax rates. A complying trust which has become a non-complying trust because of the trustee's income tax obligations not being met, will become a complying trust retrospectively if the trustee satisfies their obligations, including penalties and interest. When a non-complying trust makes a distribution to a beneficiary, the same rules of order listed on page 22 apply. If a beneficiary has a tax loss from some other source If a beneficiary receives a taxable distribution from a non-complying trust, and that beneficiary has a loss or a loss to carry forward from some other source, they can claim a deduction against the distribution. Use this formula to calculate the amount of this deduction: a× b c In this formula: a is the amount of loss or loss carried forward b is the rate of tax on trustee income - 39 cents in the dollar (0.39), for the 2025 and later tax years c is 45 cents in the dollar (0.45). ird.govt.nz 24 Foreign tax credits Credits for foreign tax paid on a taxable distribution can only be claimed if the tax deducted by the foreign country is similar to New Zealand NRWT. Electing to become a complying trust There are some situations in which a foreign trust or a non-complying trust can elect to become a complying trust. If they want to do this, either the trustee, the settlor or the beneficiary must elect to pay tax on the trustees' worldwide income. The trustee income will then be taxed in New Zealand (when it otherwise may not have been taxable here), in the same way as a complying trust. This then allows it to make non-taxable distributions to its beneficiaries. The person making this election should fill in an Election to pay income tax on trustee income - IR463 form and send it to us. Once an election has been made the person will need to indicate that the trust continues to qualify as a complying trust in their tax return each year or, if they are a non-active trust, through their myIR account each year. The following three types of trust can elect to become complying trusts if they make the election within the relevant time limits - see the following pages. New residents A trust settled by a non-resident settlor who became a New Zealand resident after 17 December 1987 may elect to become a complying trust. This election must be made within 12 months of the settlor becoming a New Zealand resident. Unless the settlor is a transitional resident\*, the 12 months to change trust type starts on the date the settlor ceases to be a transitional resident. If the trust makes an election it will be treated either as: • a foreign trust, for any distribution of income, capital profits or capital gains the trust derived before it made the election, or • a complying trust, for any distribution of income, capital profits or capital gains the trust derived after it made the election. \* See glossary TRUSTS AND ESTATES 25 This treatment does not apply if the trust fails to pay the tax on the trustees' income. The trust will be treated as a non-complying trust for any distributions made in the income year in which the tax is not paid and in subsequent income years. Only distributions from amounts derived after the trust made the election will be treated as having been made from a non-complying trust. If the election is made part-way through an income year, the income, profits or capital gains for the year must be allocated to the appropriate period that the trust was a foreign or complying trust, according to the date they were derived on. Settled in 1989 or later income years A non-complying or foreign trust settled during the 1989 or later income years, and not otherwise liable to New Zealand income tax on its trustee income, may elect to become a complying trust. The election must be made within the time for filing the trust’s tax return for the income year of settlement. If New Zealand income tax is paid on all trustee income derived since the date of settlement, the trust will meet the complying trust definition at the date of the distribution. Complying trusts no longer liable for New Zealand tax A trust that was formerly a complying trust, but ceased to be liable for New Zealand income tax on its trustee income (for example, if the settlor becomes a non-resident), ceases to be a complying trust. However, such a trust can elect or re-elect to be a complying trust. The election must be made within the time for filing the tax return for the income year in which the trust ceased to be a complying trust. The income tax liability relating to trustee income for each income years since the trust began must also be satisfied. The trust will again be treated as a complying trust from the date it would otherwise have ceased to be liable for New Zealand tax. If no election is made, the trust will become a non- complying trust. Note To become a complying trust, it must make its election before the relevant time limit expires. Late elections cannot be accepted. ird.govt.nz 26 Part 5 - Tax returns for trusts and beneficiaries The trust's tax return The trustee must file an IR6 tax return for the trust each year. This return is separate from the trustee's own personal tax return. In the IR6 return the trustee shows: • all income derived by the trust, including any income from a Mäori authority • the tax credits relating to that income • the allocation of income between beneficiary income and trustee income, and • any taxable distributions made. The trustee then calculates the tax payable on the beneficiary income, trustee income and taxable distributions. Allocation of RWT credits Any associated tax credits are generally also allocated in the same proportion as the income. However, if a trustee is paying income tax on beneficiary income on behalf of the beneficiaries, the trustee has the option of detaching some or all of the RWT credits associated with the resident passive income distributed to beneficiaries and reallocating the credits between beneficiaries and trustee to satisfy the income tax on beneficiary income and trustee income. Note The option of detaching RWT credits is only available to a trustee who pays income tax on beneficiary income on behalf of the beneficiaries. If the trustee detaches RWT credits from resident passive income distributed to a beneficiary (Beneficiary A), the trustee must pay Beneficiary A an RWT substitution payment equal to the amount of the detached RWT credits. The trustee can then either: • Reallocate the detached RWT credits to Beneficiary B by meeting Beneficiary B’s income tax on beneficiary income; • Retain the detached RWT credits to satisfy income tax on trustee income; or • A combination of both. The reallocated or retained RWT credit is not income of either Beneficiary B or the trustee – it is the transfer of RWT credits. TRUSTS AND ESTATES 27 The RWT credits available to Beneficiary A are then reduced by the amount of the RWT substitution payment. The RWT substitution payment is treated as resident passive income that is beneficiary income of Beneficiary A. However, there is no liability or obligation on the trustee to withhold RWT in relation to the RWT substitution payment. The practical effect of the reallocation exercise is that the RWT credit is transferred from one taxpayer (Beneficiary A) to another (Beneficiary B or trustee) and the transferred RWT credit is used to satisfy the trustee’s obligations for satisfying the income tax liability on trustee income and/or Beneficiary B’s beneficiary income. Reallocating the RWT credits also means that Beneficiary A will not need to seek a refund from the Commissioner for the excess RWT credits and, instead, receives a cash payment from the trustee in substitution for the RWT credits. Example The trustee of the Olive Family trust derives $100 in interest, from which 33% tax has been deducted, leaving $67 in cash, and the trustee receives an entitlement to $33 in RWT credits. The Olive Family trust distributes all of the interest to Brook as beneficiary income, with Brook receiving $67 in cash and $33 in RWT credits. Brook has a marginal tax rate of 17.5%, which means her tax liability on her beneficiary income is $17.50. Since the trustee is paying income tax on beneficiary income for Brook, the trustee can detach $15.50 from the RWT credits allocated to Brook and pay her cash of $15.50 in substitution for the detached RWT credit. This leaves Brook with $17.50 of RWT tax credit – enough to satisfy her income tax on beneficiary income. Brook is in the same position as if she had obtained a refund of the excess RWT credit from the Commissioner. The trustee can retain the detached RWT credit of $15.50 to satisfy income tax on trustee income. Allocation of imputation credits The imputation credits must be allocated in proportion to the total distributions received from the trust. This also applies to Mäori authority credits and FDP (foreign dividend payment) credits attached to dividends distributed as beneficiary income. This means a trust cannot choose to allocate credits to beneficiaries who may be better able to use them than other beneficiaries. ird.govt.nz 28 Use this formula to allocate the imputation and FDP credits: a× b c In this formula: a is the total imputation and FDP credits attached to all dividends distributed to beneficiaries during the income year b is the total distribution, including capital distributions, to the particular beneficiary during the income year c is the total distributions made to all beneficiaries during the income year. The beneficiaries can then claim a credit for tax paid on their beneficiary income and taxable distributions (and their share of tax credits) in their personal income tax returns. If a imputation credit adjusted by the formula is allocated to a beneficiary, then the imputation credit included in the gross dividend as part of beneficiary’s assessable income is also adjusted by the corresponding amount in the beneficiary’s income tax return. Note If a trust receives any income the trustee must complete a return and meet certain reporting obligations. However, if the income is below set thresholds (see page 5) and certain criteria is met, it can be excused from filing returns by completing the Non-active trust declaration - IR633 in myIR. If it subsequently becomes active again, for example, derives income in a future year, then it must send in a return. The beneficiaries' tax returns A person who receives beneficiary income from any type of trust, or a taxable distribution from a foreign trust, must include this income in their tax return for that year and pay tax on it at their normal rates. If the trust has deducted tax before paying the income to the beneficiary, the beneficiary can claim a credit for this tax deducted. However, if the tax was deducted overseas, the maximum credit a New Zealand beneficiary can claim is the amount of New Zealand income tax payable on their share of the overseas trust income. If the trust's balance date is not 31 March, the beneficiary must include any income from the trust in their tax return for the year that corresponds with the trust's accounting year. There's no need to make any separate calculations to allow for a difference in balance dates. TRUSTS AND ESTATES 29 If a person receives beneficiary income or taxable distributions from a foreign or non-complying trust, they should fill in the details of the trust income on a Schedule of beneficiary’s estate or trust income - IR307 form, and include this with their tax return. If the trust has a New Zealand tax agent, they will usually fill in an IR307 form for each beneficiary to include with their individual tax return. These forms will then show the beneficiaries how much income to declare, and the amount of any tax credits to claim. Note Any taxable distributions a beneficiary receives from a non-complying trust are to be included separately in the beneficiary’s tax return. These distributions will be taxed separately at a flat rate of 45 cents in the dollar. Tax returns for a deceased person's estate The personal representative, executor or administrator of a deceased person's estate must file all tax returns the deceased person would otherwise have had to file and make sure any tax due is paid. The tax return to be used for the period to the date of death is an Individual tax return - IR3. The return must show their IRD number and include all gross income the deceased person derived up until that date. After the date of death, the person's estate will get a new IRD number and any income must be returned in an Income tax return: Estate or Trust - IR6 form. The first estate return will include all income derived and expenditure incurred from the date of death until the end of the return period. From the 2022/2023 income year reportable income, for example, salary, pension or interest received up to 28 days following death can be included in either the return to date of death or alternatively in an estate return. Even after an estate has been wound up, we can audit the deceased person’s tax returns for previous years. If more tax becomes payable as a result of such an audit, the estate is still liable to pay this tax. If there are no estate funds available because the final distribution has been made, the executor or administrator is liable for the extra tax assessed. ird.govt.nz 30 Trusts that are tax charities or estates A trust will be a tax charity if all income the trustee derives is held solely for charitable purposes, and no person associated with the trust can gain any personal profit from it. There are special tax exemptions available to trusts that are tax charities and estates. You'll find more information about trusts that are tax charities and estates in our Charitable organisations - IR255 guide. Final trust or estate return The trustees of a trust or estate are personally responsible for any tax payable on the trust income. This means that before an estate or trust is wound up and its assets distributed, all income must be returned and enough funds retained to pay any tax due. The trustee must file a tax return to the date of winding up, which must show the final distribution of the income. TRUSTS AND ESTATES 31 Part 6 - Provisional tax The principle of provisional tax The principle of provisional tax is that a trust pays tax as it earns income, instead of having a large tax bill at the end of the year. Provisional tax is charged in instalments during an income year. When the trust files its tax return, it can claim a credit for the provisional tax it's paid during the year. Circumstances when a trust must pay provisional tax One of the important concepts in provisional tax is residual income tax (RIT). This is the amount of tax payable on the trust's income for the year, after deducting any allowable tax credits (but not provisional tax payments). This includes tax payable by the trustee on both beneficiary income and trustee income. • If a trust's RIT is $5000 or less, the trust does not have to pay provisional tax for the following year, but it can choose to make voluntary payments. • If a trust's RIT is more than $5000, the trust will generally have to pay provisional tax for the following income year. There are three different methods for calculating the amount of provisional tax payable: the standard option, the estimation option or the ratio option. These methods are explained on pages 31 and 32. • If a trust's RIT is more than $5000, but the trust expects its RIT at the end of the following year to be $5000 or less, it can estimate its provisional tax at nil. However, before making such an estimate please read the section on use-of-money interest - see page 33. Provisional tax calculation methods Standard option Provisional tax calculations may change from year to year. For current and past rates go to ird. govt.nz/income-tax/provisional-tax/provisional-tax-options/standard-option. If a trust uses the standard option, it can change to the estimation option at any time up until the due date of the final instalment of provisional tax. If a trust using the standard option wishes to change to the ratio option it must elect to use the ratio before the tax year in which it wants to use the ratio. ird.govt.nz 32 Estimation option A trust can choose to estimate its provisional tax by estimating its income for the year and then calculating the tax on it. This is usually beneficial for trusts that expect the following year's income to be less than the current year's income. If the trust used the standard option in this situation, it would end up paying more tax than it had to during the year, and then receive a refund at the end of the year. However, if a trust chooses the estimation option and the RIT is greater than the provisional tax paid, it can be charged interest from the first instalment date and may be liable for a shortfall penalty of 20% of the underpaid provisional tax for lack of reasonable care. Once a trust chooses the estimation option, it cannot switch to the standard or ratio option during that income year. However, it can change the amount of the estimation at any time up until the due date for the final instalment of provisional tax. Note An estimate must be fair and reasonable at each instalment date. Ratio option A trust can choose to pay their provisional tax in line with when income is received. This option is only available to GST-registered trusts. Using the ratio option, six provisional tax instalments are made based on a trust's GST turnover. We'll calculate a percentage based on the prior year's RIT divided by the total GST supplies for the corresponding year. To calculate each provisional tax instalment, a trust multiplies the percentage which is preprinted on their GST103 return, by the total taxable supplies for the two- month period (monthly payers will add the taxable supplies for two return periods). If a trust makes the correct ratio payments by the due dates, it will not be charged interest if the provisional tax falls short of the RIT for the year. To use the ratio option, a trust must apply by phone or in writing before the start of the tax year they want to use this option in. TRUSTS AND ESTATES 33 Use-of-money interest (UOMI) Only tax on trustee income is subject to UOMI. We will not charge or pay interest on tax on the trust's beneficiary income. If the trust's RIT on trustee income is more than $5000, and the trust has paid too much provisional tax for this income, we may pay interest. However, if the provisional tax paid is less than the RIT, we may charge interest. There are changes to when UOMI is charged for the 2018 income year onwards There are changes in debit and credit use-of-money interest (UOMI) on provisional tax for the 2018 income year onwards when using the standard option, and when changing from the standard option to the estimation option for the final instalment, provided all required payments are made in full and on time. There is no change to debit or credit use-of-money interest when using the estimation option instalment(s) other than at the final instalment. When determining the interest start date, the $50,000 RIT threshold for individuals using the standard option has been increased to $60,000. This threshold will also apply to non-individuals, including trusts. Provisional tax amount End of year residual income tax (RIT) Credit or debit UOMICalculated from More than RIT amount Less than $60,000Credit UOMI calculated on the difference between the provisional tax amount paid and the RIT Terminal tax due date More than RIT $60,000 or more Credit UOMI calculated on the difference between the provisional tax amount paid and the RIT Final instalment date Less than RIT$60,000 or more Debit UOMI calculated on the difference between the provisional tax amount paid and the RIT Final instalment date Less than RITLess than $60,000Debit UOMI calculated on the difference between the provisional tax amount paid and the RIT Terminal tax due date If the trust has paid all but the last instalment in full and on time using the standard option then UOMI will apply from the final instalment due date. This will also apply if the trust has changed to the estimation option at or before the final instalment date due date. ird.govt.nz 34 If the trust has paid an instalment late or does not pay it at all UOMI will be charged from the due date of the instalment on the lesser of: • the amount of the instalment that was paid less the amount that should have paid, or • your RIT divided by the number of instalments for the tax year less the amount paid. The above changes may not apply if the trust: • is associated to a company and they are not covered by the above standard option rules or they do not use the GST ratio option, or • has entered a provisional tax interest avoidance arrangement. Interest applies from the day after each provisional tax instalment date, if the RIT on trustee income is more than $5000 when using the estimation option for the instalments other than the final instalment date. If they have elected to use the ratio option, interest applies from the day after the terminal tax due date. If the trust's RIT on trustee income is $5000 or less, and it's paid too much provisional tax for trustee income, it can elect to be a provisional tax payer for that year. The trust may then still be paid interest on the overpaid provisional tax. A trust may elect to be a provisional tax payer if: • it expects to have RIT on trustee income of more than $5000, and • it pays provisional tax on trustee income of more than $5000 by the last provisional tax instalment date. If you experience problems with the way UOMI for the trust is calculated, call us on 0800 377 774. Any UOMI charged will generally be tax-deductible, while UOMI received is treated as gross income. If a trust is charged UOMI, it should be paid by the due date for paying its end-of-year tax bill (usually 7 February, or 7 April if the trust has a tax agent). However, interest will continue to be charged on a daily basis until the tax is paid. The only way to stop interest from accruing is to pay the unpaid tax on trustee income. Further information For more information on provisional tax and UOMI, read our Provisional tax - IR289 guide. TRUSTS AND ESTATES 35 Late payment penalties If tax is not paid by the due date, a late payment penalty will be charged. An initial 1% late payment penalty will be charged on the day after the due date. A further 4% penalty will be charged if there's still an amount of unpaid tax (including penalties) at the end of the 7th day from the due date. For income years before 2018 Every month after the due date, a further 1% will be added to any unpaid amount (including penalties). Note Penalties are not charged on unpaid amounts less than $100. ird.govt.nz 36 Summary - tax rates and time limits The chart below summarises the tax rates for trustee income, the time limits that apply to other elections a trust can make and information it must give us.

You pay it in instalments during the year instead of a lump sum at the end of the year. You’ll have to pay provisional tax if you had to pay more than $5,000 tax at the end of the year from your last return. This guide tells you how to manage your provisional tax instalments. This guide covers: how provisional tax works who has to pay it how to calculate it when to pay it what happens if you do not pay budgeting for provisional tax a glossary to help you understand the tax terms we use. We explain all the tax terms we use in this guide on pages 33-35. 4 How provisional tax works Provisional tax is not a separate tax. It's income tax you pay during the year and helps you "spread the load" and avoid a big end-of-year tax bill. You must pay provisional tax if, at the end of the previous year, you're left with tax to pay of more than $5,000. We call this amount your "residual income tax" (RIT). Specifically, RIT is the amount of tax to pay on your taxable income, less any PAYE deducted and any other tax credits you may be entitled to (except Working for Families Tax Credits). Your RIT may exceed $5,000 ($2,500 in 2019-20 and earlier years) if you earn untaxed income, or not enough tax has been deducted to cover your income tax for the year. Examples are: self-employed or rental income schedular payments or salaries and wages with a low PAYE rate income from a partnership or look-through company income from an estate or trust overseas income. In most cases, you pay provisional tax in three instalments during the year, based on what provisional tax option you choose. When you complete your income tax return and calculate your tax for the year, you deduct the provisional tax you paid earlier. Any taxpayer who pays income tax may have to pay provisional tax. This includes individuals, companies and trusts. Provisional tax is income tax you pay during the year. Provisional tax helps you spread the load. RIT is the amount of tax to pay on your taxable income, less any PAYE deducted and any other tax credits you may be entitled to (except Working for Families Tax Credits). Provisional tax 5 When to pay your instalments When you pay your provisional tax instalments depends on your balance date - the last day of your tax year. This guide assumes you have the standard balance date of 31 March. If you do not, you can use our "Tax due date calculator" to print a calendar of all the due dates that apply to you. Go to ird.govt.nz/provpaymentdates Transitional year If you change your balance date, you may need to calculate the provisional tax for your "transitional year" a bit differently. That's because your transitional year - the first year with the new balance date - will be for a period of more or less than 12 months. Anyone wanting to change their balance date must get approval from Inland Revenue first. If we approve your new balance date, we'll tell you when your instalments are due. Example Matt earns a salary and also has self-employed income. Here's his 2022 income tax return: Salary $ 14,800 Plus self-employed income (net profit) $ 47,600 Taxable income $ 62,400 Tax on taxable income $ 11,740 Less PAYE deducted from the salary (not including ACC earners' levy) $ 1,610 Residual income tax (RIT) $ 10,130 Matt's 2022 RIT is more than $5,000 so he'll have to pay provisional tax for the 2023 tax year. When he files his 2023 return, he'll deduct the provisional tax from his RIT, leaving a refund or "end-of-year tax" to pay. 6 Your options for calculating provisional tax The idea behind provisional tax is simple. You're trying to calculate an amount that will closely match the RIT you expect for the year. That way, when you complete your tax return and deduct your provisional tax, you should only have a small amount of end-of-year tax left to pay. You may even receive a refund. There are four ways to calculate provisional tax: the Accounting Income Method (AIM) the standard option the estimation option the ratio option. Because most people do not know how much tax they'll need to pay next year, calculating provisional tax usually involves a certain amount of judgement. You'll need to decide which provisional tax option works best for you. If you do not make a choice, the standard option will apply. You can choose any option (except the Accounting Income Method) by completing a box in your income tax return, sending us a message through myIR, or calling us on 0800 377 774 If you want to use AIM to calculate your provisional tax for the year, you need to send us a statement of activity using your AIM-capable software. The Accounting Income Method (AIM) option The Accounting Income Method (AIM) aligns your provisional tax payments with the periods in which you have income to work out your instalments. You will pay provisional tax under the AIM option while you’re making a profit. If you’re not making a profit, payments will not be required. Choose the option that works best for you. Your provisional tax payments are based on your profits for the period. Provisional tax 7 If you’re currently using the estimation option, you must submit your first statement of activity by your first provisional tax instalment date for the year. If you’re using the standard or ratio option, you can choose to use the AIM option at any time, provided that: you submit your first statement of activity before your final provisional tax instalment date for the year, and you have made all payments due under your current option up to the date you switch. Once you choose to use AIM for the year you can not choose another option until next year. When your provisional tax is due Your dues dates for AIM are generally the same as your GST due dates: monthly (if you're registered for monthly GST filing) or two-monthly (if you're registered for two or six- monthly GST filing) If you're not registered for GST, your dates would be the two-monthly GST due dates that align to your balance date. Qualifying for the AIM option Aim is available to individuals and companies with a turnover under $5m. If your turnover goes over $5m during the year you can request to continue to use AIM. You cannot use AIM in a year that you change your balance date. AIM-capable accounting software To use the AIM option you must have AIM-capable accounting software provided by an approved AIM provider. Calculating your provisional tax At each due date your AIM-capable accounting software will work out your provisional tax payments and let you know how much to pay (if any). You'll need AIM-capable accounting software Payments align with your GST due dates. 8 Statement of activity As well as working out your provisional tax, your software will also collate your income and expense information and send it to us in a Statement of Activity. Overpayments If you have a drop in profit that means you may have overpaid your provisional tax during the year. Under the AIM option you can get a refund straight away. You can include instructions on what you would like done with the overpayment on your statement of activity. If you do not provide any instructions we will refund the overpaid amount. The standard option The standard option assumes your profit will increase from year to year. When your provisional tax is due Generally you'll pay three instalments on 28 August, 15 January and 7 May. But if you're registered for GST and you file six-monthly GST returns, you'll only pay two instalments, on 28 October and 7 May. You can get overpaid provisional tax refunded straight away. The standard option assumes your income will increase from year to year. A Statement of Activity is not an income tax return. Provisional tax 9 Example Nicole earns schedular payments that have tax deducted at a flat rate of 20%. Because 20% is less than her average tax rate, Nicole has end-of-year tax to pay. In May 2022, Nicole completes her 2022 income tax return. These are her provisional tax calculations: 2022 RIT (over $5,000, so Nicole must pay provisional tax) $ 7,600 Plus 5% $ 380 Nicole's 2023 provisional tax $ 7,980 Her due dates are: 28 August 2022 $ 2,660 15 January 2023 $ 2,660 7 May 2023 $ 2,660 $ 7,980 Nicole will pay the first two instalments of her 2022 provisional tax at the same time as she's earning her 2023 income. She's "spreading the load". The final instalment is due after the end of her 2023 tax year. Filing your tax returns When you use the standard option, your provisional tax is calculated from your previous year's RIT. You need to file your tax return on time, so you'll know your RIT before your instalments are due. If you do not have an extension of time to file your return, you'll need to file it by 7 July every year. That gives you time to work out how much provisional tax you need to pay, and prepare for your first instalment on 28 August. If you file your returns late, you still need to pay your provisional tax instalments on time. Complete your return so you can work out how much you need to pay. Penalties and charges can apply if you pay an instalment after the due date. Remember to file your returns on time. 10 Filing your return if you have an extension-of- time arrangement If you have an extension of time to file your tax return, you could have to pay an instalment of provisional tax before you know what your RIT is. In this situation, you'll calculate your provisional tax instalments using the RIT from two years ago, plus 10%. When you file your return, you'll do a special "catch- up" calculation to take into account any earlier under or overpayments. The tables show how you'd do the calculation for the 2022-23 tax year. Instalment 1 (called "P1" in the other two tables) 2022 return filedInstalment 1 (P1) due 28 August 2022 Between 28 August 2022 and 15 January 2023 (2021 RIT + 10%) ÷ 3 = amount to pay After 15 January 2023(2021 RIT + 10%) ÷ 3 = amount to pay Instalment 2 (called "P2" in the table below) 2022 return filedInstalment 2 (P2) due 15 January 2023 Between 28 August 2022 and 15 January 2023 (2022 RIT + 5%) × 2 ÷ 3 − (P1) = amount to pay After 15 January 2023(2021 RIT + 10%) × 2 ÷ 3 − (P1) = amount to pay Instalment 3 2022 return filedInstalment 3 due 7 May 2023 Between 28 August 2022 and 15 January 2023 (2022 RIT + 5%) - (P1) − (P2) = amount to pay After 15 January 2023(2022 RIT + 5%) - (P1) − (P2) = amount to pay Even if you filed your return after 7 May, your provisional tax will still be based on your 2021 RIT. If you're using a tax agent, they'll usually have an extension of time. Provisional tax 11 Example Ned’s company, EJ Auto Services, has an extension-of time arrangement. Its 2020 return does not have to be filed until 23 January 2021, so Ned will have to pay the company’s first two instalments of 2021 provisional tax (due 28 August 2020 and 15 January 2021) before he knows how much the RIT will be. He goes back two years and looks at the company’s 2019 RIT: EJ Auto Services 2019 RIT $ 24,000 Add 10% $ 2,400 $ 26,400 Using the “catch-up” method, Ned pays the following instalments of provisional tax: 28 August 2020 $8,800 ($24,000 + $2,400) ÷ 3 15 January 2020 $8,800 (($24,000 + $2,400) ÷ 3 × 2) − $8,800 The company files its 2020 return on 23 January 2021 showing an RIT of $23,740. The final catch-up instalment is: 7 May 2021 $7,327 ($23,740 + 5% \[$1,187\] − $8,800 − $8,800) If your return for the previous year is assessed/ amended within 30 days of an instalment date If the return for the previous year is either assessed (Inland Revenue changes the assessment amount) or amended within 30 days of a provisional tax instalment date, that provisional instalment will not change. But if you file your return within 30 days before an instalment date then that instalment amount will be as calculated in the return you filed. 12 Example John has filed his 2019 IR3 return on 7 July 2019. His provisional instalments for 2020 are: 28 August 2019:$3,000 15 January 2020:$3,000 7 May 2020:$3,000 His return is then reassessed on 20 December 2019, creating an increase in his 2019 RIT. As there are less than 30 days between the reassessment his second provisional tax instalment date, the increase in the amount of provisional tax payable will be included in the third instalment as follows: 28 August 2019:$3,000 15 January 2020:$3,000 7 May 2020:$5,500 If the RIT from two years prior was $5,000 or under, provisional tax will only need to be paid in one or two instalments, depending on when the tax return is filed. In this case, the provisional tax will be evenly split between the required number of instalments. If your income changes When you are on the standard option, expect your RIT to be $60,000 or more and have paid all but your final instalment in full and on time you can make a payment for your final instalment that better reflects your income situation and remain on the standard option. You can change from the standard option to the estimation option at any time up until the date your final instalment is due. After you've made the change, you cannot then change back to the standard option for the same tax year. Provisional tax 13 The estimation option The estimation option could be right for you when your income is dropping. Using the standard option might mean you overpay your provisional tax. Your provisional tax equals your estimated RIT for the year. It works like this. Add up all the taxable income you expect to receive next year. Calculate the tax on this figure. Deduct any PAYE and other tax credits (except Working for Families Tax Credits) you'll be entitled to. The result is your estimated RIT, and this is your provisional tax for the year. When your provisional tax is due Generally you'll pay three instalments, due 28 August, 15 January, and 7 May. But if you're registered for GST and you file six-monthly GST returns, you'll only pay two instalments, due 28 October and 7 May. The estimation option may be a good choice if your income is dropping. 14 Example Hiwi is a property developer and a polytech lecturer. The property market is in a slump and Hiwi expects his net profit to decrease in the coming year. His tax agent advises him to switch to the estimation option to work out his 2020 provisional tax. Hiwi’s calculations: Net profit from property sales $ 170,600 Plus polytech salary $ 78,000 Expected taxable income $ 248,600 Tax on taxable income $ 72,958 Less PAYE deducted from the salary (not including ACC earners’ levy) $ 16,660 Estimated RIT for 2020 $ 56,298 Hiwi’s 2020 provisional tax is $56,298 to be paid in three instalments on: 28 August 2019 $ 18,766 15 January 2020 $ 18,766 7 May 2020 $ 18,766 $ 56,298 Underestimating your provisional tax It pays to keep a close watch on your profits because you could be charged a penalty if your provisional tax estimation is unreasonably low, compared with your actual RIT once you file your return. You’ll need to tell us how much residual income tax you expect to pay. You can estimate: using the Estimate provisional tax service in myIR sending us a message in myIR by calling us by writing to us. You may have to pay a penalty if you underestimate your provisional tax. Provisional tax 15 You can estimate your residual income tax as many times as you like up until your final instalment due date. If you do re-estimate, you'll need to adjust later instalments to take into account any earlier under or overpayments. Example In February 2022, Hiwi realises his year is going better than he first thought. He re-estimates his 2022 provisional tax to $65,000. So far, he’s paid two instalments: 28 August 2021 $18,766 15 January 2022 $18,766 His new estimate means these instalments are now too low. Hiwi’s final instalment must cover this underpayment. His new calculation is: Re-estimated provisional tax $65,000 Less instalments already paid $18,766 $18,766 $37,532 $27,468 Hiwi’s final instalment, due 7 May 2022, is $27,468. The ratio option This option can suit people whose income tends to go up and down during the year. You calculate your provisional tax by applying a ratio percentage to the taxable supplies in your GST returns so your provisional tax instalments align with your business cashflow. We calculate your ratio percentage by dividing your RIT for the last tax year by your total GST taxable supplies for the same year. If your last year's figures are not available, we base the ratio on the RIT and total GST taxable figures from the previous year. Changing options Once you've selected the estimation option, you cannot change to the standard option during the same year. The ratio option may be helpful if you have seasonal income. 16 When your provisional tax is due Using the ratio option, you pay six instalments of provisional tax a year. If you have a 31 March balance date, your due dates are 28 June, 28 August, 28 O c to b er, 15 January, 28 February, and 7 May. Qualifying for the ratio option The ratio option is useful if your income varies or you have seasonal income. You must meet all these criteria to use it: You’ve been in business and registered for GST, for the whole of the previous tax year, and part of the tax year before that. Your residual income tax (RIT) for the previous year is greater than $5,000 You file your GST returns monthly or 2-monthly. You’re not a partnership. Your ratio percentage that we calculate for you is between 0 and 100% (we’ll let you know if it’s not). The ratio percentage You must let us know before the start of the tax year if you decide to use the ratio option. We'll calculate the ratio percentage for you, using information from your income tax and GST returns. GST ratio percentage = RIT from your latest income tax return × 100 total GST taxable supplies from the same tax year (less ratio percentage adjustments - see page 19) 1 The ratio percentage will only work if your returns are up to date. We cannot calculate a ratio percentage using returns from a tax year more than two years earlier than the provisional tax year. Only provisional tax payers registered for GST who file one-monthly or two- monthly returns can use the ratio option. Provisional tax 17 Example Leonie is a kiwifruit grower in Te Puke. She files two monthly GST returns. On 20 February 2019, she applies to use the ratio option to work out her 2020 provisional tax. We approve this and review her latest returns, which are for the 2018 year. Her 2018 RIT is $51,000, and her taxable supplies are $2,114,723, broken down as follows: GST return periodTaxable supplies ($) April - May 2017690,025 June - July 2017580,121 August - September 2017145,859 October - November 201790,412 December 2017 - January 2018152,681 February - March 2018455,625 Total taxable supplies$2,114,723 Leonie's ratio percentage is: $51,000 × 100 =2.4%\* $2,114,7231 \*Your ratio percentage is rounded down to one decimal place. Calculating your provisional tax We'll tell you your ratio percentage. Calculate your provisional tax instalments, following the steps on the back of your GST return. You work out each instalment by applying the ratio percentage to the taxable supplies in each GST return (two-monthly filers) or every second GST return (one- monthly filers). 18 Leonie has approval to work out her 2019 provisional tax using a ratio percentage of 2.4%.

You can start using your new ratio percentage 30 days from the date of our letter. Adjusting your ratio percentage If you sell a fixed asset, you can ask us to adjust your ratio percentage. Enter your details under "Provisional tax" on the back of your GST return. Because we treat sales of fixed assets differently in income tax and GST returns, you may pay too much provisional tax if your ratio percentage is not adjusted. The value of the fixed asset you're selling must be the same or more than: $1,000, or 5% of your total taxable supplies for the previous 12 months. We'll use the larger amount. A fixed asset is an item owned by the business that will generally be used in the business for more than a year, and is not for sale to customers, eg, buildings, vans, equipment. Provisional tax 19 Ceasing the ratio option You can stop using the ratio option at any time. You just need to let us know by phone or email. If you stop using it before the first payment due date, you can choose to use the standard or estimation option to calculate. The usual use of money interest rules will apply from this time. If you stop using it after the first payment date, you must use the estimation option to calculate for the rest of the year. You must stop using the ratio option if: you cease your GST registration any of your GST returns are overdue by 60 days or more your ratio percentage change is no longer between 0% and 100% (we’ll let you know if it’s not) you change your GST filing frequency to 6-monthly a return of income is filed or amended where the residual income tax is calculated at below $5,000 or above $150,000. 20 Penalties We charge penalties on late or underpaid instalments of provisional tax. When you make a payment, it will be applied to the earliest unpaid provisional tax instalments. Provisional tax amounts include any late payment penalties charged. Late payment penalties We charge late payment penalties (LPPs) on all overdue payments. We charge the penalties in two stages. This means that the longer a payment remains overdue, the more penalties we’ll add. The stages are: 1% the day after the due date, and 4% seven days later. We can stop some late payment penalties being added to your account if you set up a plan with us to pay your tax. Example Anthony had to pay provisional tax of $7,600 on 7 May for the 2022 income year. He paid it on 10 July, over two months late. LPPs were added as follows: DateAmount owing ($) LPPLPP added ($)New amount owing ($) 8 May 20227,600.001%76.007,676.00 14 May 20227,676.004%307.047,983.04 Total383.04 We charge penalties on late payments. Provisional tax 21 Shortfall penalties We may charge a shortfall penalty if you use the AIM or estimation options to calculate your provisional tax and your provisional tax is unreasonably low. We compare the provisional tax you paid to the RIT you calculate when you file your tax return, and apply the penalty to the underpaid amount. The amount of the shortfall penalty depends on the seriousness of the mistake. MistakeShortfall penalty Not taking reasonable care20% Unacceptable tax position20% Gross carelessness40% Abusive tax position100% Evasion150% When you need to pay your penalties You must pay any penalties as soon as you get them. You must also pay any overdue provisional tax at the same time. You cannot claim a deduction in your income tax or GST returns for any penalties you pay Inland Revenue. 22 Interest on provisional tax We may charge interest for end-of-year tax paid late or unpaid end-of-year tax and provisional tax (see "Paying and receiving interest" below). Interest is a charge for the use of money and is sometimes referred to as UOMI. This means we may pay you interest if you overpay your provisional tax. We calculate interest when you file your income tax return. We compare your RIT to the provisional tax you've paid. You may have to pay interest even if you've paid your instalments in full and on time, or if you did not have to pay provisional tax. Paying and receiving interest Not everyone will pay interest on underpaid provisional tax. And not everyone will receive interest if they've overpaid their provisional tax. We'll calculate interest for: individuals and non-individuals who used the standard option, with RIT: –$60,000 or more (see explanation below). –less than $60,000, if payment not made by the terminal tax due date for the 2022-23 year or later. Prior to 2023 UOMI was charged if provisional tax payments were paid late/not paid in full. anyone who used the estimation option, with RIT over $5,000 anyone who chooses to use the AIM option but does not pay the provisional tax instalments their AIM- capable accounting software tells them to pay by the instalment date anyone whose RIT is $5,000 or less who chose to be a provisional tax payer (individuals also need to have used the estimation option) - see “Choosing to be a provisional tax payer” on page 27.) IRD number on the online RWT exemption register. Interest is not a penalty - it's a charge for the use of money. Provisional tax 23 Anyone choosing to be a provisional taxpayer has to use the estimation option. We will not charge interest if the underpaid or overpaid tax is $100 or less. When using the standard option the start date of UOMI depends on your RIT (when all required payments are made in full and on time). Provisional tax amount End of year residual income tax (RIT) Credit or debit UOMI Calculated from More/less than RIT amount Less than $60,000Debit/Credit UOMI calculated on the difference between the provisional tax amount paid and the RIT Terminal tax due date More than RIT $60,000 or moreCredit UOMI calculated on the difference between the provisional tax amount paid and the RIT Last instalment date Less than RIT $60,000 or moreDebit UOMI calculated on the difference between the provisional tax amount paid and the RIT Last instalment date, or earlier if underpaid/paid late RIT under $60,000 (standard option) from the 2022-23 year You will have UOMI applied from the Terminal tax due date even if the provisional tax payments are not made in full and/or on time. Late payment penalties will still be charged on late payments. RIT $60,000 or more (standard option) If you’ve paid all but your final instalment in full and on time then UOMI will apply from the last instalment due date. NOTE: Even if your final instalment is paid in full and on time, we will calculate UOMI from the final instalment date based on the difference between your RIT and the total provisional tax paid. 24 If you pay an instalment (other than the last one) late or do not pay in full, UOMI will be charged from the due date of that and subsequent instalments (other than the last one) on the lesser of: the amount of the instalment that you should have paid less the amount that was paid, or your RIT divided by the number of instalments for the tax year less the amount paid. If the previous year’s return was not filed on or before a provisional tax due date, and you have an extension of time, the amount that should have been paid for that instalment will be the lesser of the 10% uplift amount (based on two years prior) or the 5% uplift amount (based on the previous year). This does not apply to the final instalment. The above changes may not apply if: you're associated to specific persons or entities with one of you being a company and they are not covered by the above standard option rules or they do not use the GST ratio option, or you've entered an avoidance arrangement. For interest under the AIM option refer to page 27. How we calculate interest We use this formula to calculate interest on provisional tax: t × r ×d 365 Where: t = the underpaid or overpaid tax (including LPPs) r = the current interest rate d = the number of days where interest applies. Different rates of interest apply to underpaid and overpaid tax. Interest rates change frequently. See our website for the current and previous interest rates ird.govt.nz/penalties Provisional tax 25 We count both the first day that interest starts and the last day interest is payable when we calculate the number of days interest applies. When you need to pay your interest If we charge interest, you need to pay it by 7 February (or 7 April if you have a tax agent with an extension of time). Because interest is charged daily, you may want to pay before the due date. The longer you leave it, the more you'll pay. You can claim a deduction in your income tax return for the amount you paid. If we pay you interest, you need to include it as income. Interest is GST exempt, so you do not include interest (paid or received) in your GST returns. Example ABC Ltd is a construction firm. Karen, the finance manager, used the standard option to calculate provisional tax of $24,000 for the 2023 tax year. Instalments were due on: 28 August 2022 $8,000 15 January 2023 $8,000 7 May 2023 $8,000 $24,000 The company only paid the first instalment on time. When Karen filed the company’s 2023 tax return on 7 July 2023, she calculated RIT of $66,000. The company had a total of $58,000 still to pay. Because the RIT was more than $60,000 and the company did not pay all provisional tax instalments in full and on time, the company had to pay interest. To find the amount that we charge interest on all instalments except the final one, we firstly identify the shortfall which is the lesser of: the amount of the instalment that was payable ($8,000) less the amount that was paid, or your RIT divided by the number of instalments for the tax year ($66,000 ÷3 =$22,000) less the amount paid. The longer you leave it, the more you'll pay. 26 Instalment No.Amount paidProv tax payableRIT instalmentShortfall (lesser of) 1st$8,000$8,000$12,800$0 2nd$0$8,000$12,800$8,000 For the final instalment we calculate UOMI on the difference between the RIT and total provisional tax paid up until the final provisional due date.

Provisional tax 27 Karen had until 7 February 2024 to pay the end-of-year tax, but she wanted to pay it early to avoid further interest. We charged late payment penalties, because Karen did not pay the second and third provisional tax instalments in full and on time. We charged interest because ABC Ltd had the use of the difference between the provisional tax due and the amount paid over the period 16 January 2023 - 9 September 2023. Interest and the AIM option You will not pay (or receive) interest on any of your provisional tax instalments if you use the AIM option as long as your make your payments in full and on time. If the amount of a provisional tax instalment calculated by your AIM-capable accounting software is not paid on time, penalties and interest will apply to the underpayment. These will continue to apply until you make a payment. Interest and the ratio option You will not pay (or receive) interest on any of your provisional tax instalments if you use the ratio option for the full year. But, we'll charge interest if you owe more than $100 after your end-of-year tax due date (7 February, or 7 April if you have a tax agent with an extension of time). Late payment penalties will apply to instalments paid late or not paid in full. Choosing to be a provisional tax payer You can choose to be a provisional tax payer if you're in this situation: your RIT works out to be $5,000 or less ($2,500 for 2019-20 and earlier years) you've made provisional payments of more than $5,000 you had a reasonable expectation, on the day you made your first payment, that you would have to pay provisional tax. 28 Talk to your tax agent first. Then let us know when you file your tax return if you want to be treated as a provisional tax payer for the year. We may calculate interest on your voluntary payments. Individuals will need to estimate their provisional tax on or before their third instalment date to have interest calculated. We can help if you're finding it hard to pay Penalty and interest charges can increase your provisional tax payments quite quickly, so you'll save money if you pay your instalments in full and on time. If you cannot pay, call us as soon as you can - before the due date, if possible. We'll work with you to develop a solution that takes into account your personal circumstances. Do not let your debt get out of hand. Talk to us straight away. You can pay your instalments electronically, by credit or debit card. Find all the details of our payment options at ird.govt.nz/pay Provisional tax 29 Your first year in business Your first year in business is not tax-free. You'll need to file an income tax return at the end of your first year and pay tax on your net profit. You will not have to pay provisional tax during your first year in business unless your previous year's RIT was $5,000 ($2,500 for 2020 and earlier income years). But, you can make voluntary payments of provisional tax. In your second year you may have to pay end-of-year tax for your first year, on top of provisional tax instalments for your second year. Your end-of-year tax could be a significant amount if you do not have any voluntary payments to deduct. Voluntary payments will help if you need to pay interest, and may entitle you to an early payment discount. ird.govt.nz/early-payment-discount Example Isobel started her own business in October 2018. In June 2019, she sent in her first income tax return, for the year ended 31 March 2019. Her RIT (which is also her end-of- year tax) was $75,000. Isobel used the standard option to work out her 2020 provisional tax of $78,750. RIT $ 75,000 Plus 5% $ 3,750 2020 provisional tax $ 78,750 Isobel's due dates and payments are: Due dateTax to payAmount 28 August 20192020 provisional tax$26,250 15 January 20202020 provisional tax$26,250 7 February 20202019 end-of-year tax$75,000 7 May 20202020 provisional tax$26,250 Because she made no voluntary payments for 2019 income tax, Isobel must pay her $75,000 end-of-year tax as well as her $78,750 2020 provisional tax during her second year in business. Voluntary payments can help your cash flow. You can opt into the Accounting Income Method (AIM) in your first year of business by sending us your first Statement of activity with your AIM capable software. By using AIM, you’ll only pay provisional tax when you make a profit and your end-of year-tax will be closer aligned. Find out more about AIM on page 6. 30 Early payment discount In your first year in business, you could qualify for a discount, if you make voluntary tax payments during the tax year before you need to pay provisional tax. Individuals and partners in a partnership can claim the discount, but companies, trusts and other forms of business organisations do not qualify. You can get the discount if you meet these conditions: Your income comes mainly from a business (not interest, dividends, royalties, rents or beneficiary income). You're not required to pay provisional tax during the year you make the voluntary payments, or for any of the prior four years. You make the voluntary payments on or before the end of your tax year. You apply for the discount on or before the date your tax return must be filed (tick the box in the return). The discount is a percentage of either: the total amount of your voluntary payments 105% of your RIT for that year. We'll use the smaller amount. The early payment discount is treated as a payment towards your RIT. Further early payment discounts You can receive another early payment discount in another year if: you have not had to pay provisional tax in any of the previous four tax years, and you have not had any business income in the four-year period since you last paid provisional tax or claimed the discount. You may get a discount if you make voluntary payments. Provisional tax 31 New provisional tax payers The rules may apply differently if you’re a “new provisional tax payer”. We may charge interest on a reduced number of instalments. If you’re an individual, we consider you’re a new provisional tax payer if: your RIT for the current tax year is $60,000 or more your RIT was $5,000 or less in each of the four previous years, and during the current year, you stopped receiving income from employment and you then started to receive income from a taxable activity. If you’re a non-individual (eg, a company or a trust), the conditions are as follows: your RIT for the current tax year is $60,000 or more you did not receive income from a taxable activity in any of the four previous years, and you started receiving income from a taxable activity during the current year. Number of instalments As a new provisional tax payer, you'll pay or receive interest on one to three provisional tax instalments, based on the date you started your taxable activity. Taxable activity startsNumber of instalments Before 29 July3 On or after 29 July but before 16 December2 On 16 December, or any time after that1 You'll have different dates if you have a balance date other than 31 March, or you file six-monthly GST returns. Talk to us or your tax agent if you need more information. 32 Budgeting for your provisional tax You need to know how much your provisional tax instalments are, and when you need to pay them. A basic budgeting principle is to put aside some money each month so you can be ready when the due date rolls around. It's important to budget for your provisional tax when you first start out in business because you may have to pay your first year's end-of-year tax bill during your second year, when you'll also have provisional instalments to pay. See page 29 for more information. Budgeting will help you meet your deadlines - especially when you start out in business. Provisional tax 33 Terms we use AIM capable accounting tax software.

You pay it in instalments during the year instead of a lump sum at the end of the year. You’ll have to pay provisional tax if you had to pay more than $5,000 tax at the end of the year from your last return. This guide tells you how to manage your provisional tax instalments. This guide covers: how provisional tax works who has to pay it how to calculate it when to pay it what happens if you do not pay budgeting for provisional tax a glossary to help you understand the tax terms we use. We explain all the tax terms we use in this guide on pages 33-35. Provisional tax 4 How provisional tax works Provisional tax is not a separate tax. It's income tax you pay during the year and helps you ‘spread the load’ and avoid a big end-of-year tax bill. You must pay provisional tax if, at the end of the previous year, you're left with tax to pay of more than $5,000. We call this amount your ‘residual income tax’ (RIT). Specifically, RIT is the amount of tax to pay on your taxable income, less any PAYE deducted and any other tax credits you may be entitled to (except Working for Families). Your RIT may exceed $5,000 if you earn untaxed income, or not enough tax has been deducted to cover your income tax for the year. Examples are: self-employed or rental income schedular payments or salaries and wages with a low PAYE rate income from a partnership or look-through company income from an estate or trust overseas income. In most cases, you pay provisional tax in three instalments during the year, based on what provisional tax option you choose. When you complete your income tax return and calculate your tax for the year, you deduct the provisional tax you paid earlier. Any taxpayer who pays income tax may have to pay provisional tax. This includes individuals, companies and trusts. Provisional tax is income tax you pay during the year. Provisional tax helps you spread the load. RIT is the amount of tax to pay on your taxable income, less any PAYE deducted and any other tax credits you may be entitled to (except Working for Families). 5 When to pay your instalments When you pay your provisional tax instalments depends on your balance date - the last day of your tax year. This guide assumes you have the standard balance date of 31 March. For further information go to ird.govt.nz/provpaymentdates Note – Where the instalment date is a weekend or public holiday, payments made on the next working day will be treated as being paid on the instalment day. Transitional year If you change your balance date, you may need to calculate the provisional tax for your ‘transitional year’ a bit differently. That's because your transitional year - the first year with the new balance date - will be for a period of more or less than 12 months. You must get approval from us to change your balance date. If we approve your new balance date, we'll tell you when your instalments are due. Example Last year Matt earned a salary and had self-employed income. Salary $ 14,800 Plus self-employed income (net profit) $ 47,600 Taxable income $ 62,400 Tax on taxable income $ 11,740 Less tax deducted from the salary $ 1,610 Residual income tax (RIT) $ 10,130 Matt’s RIT is more than $5,000 so they will have to pay provisional tax for the following income year. Provisional tax 6 Your options for calculating provisional tax The idea behind provisional tax is simple. You're trying to calculate an amount that will closely match the RIT you expect for the year. That way, when you complete your tax return and deduct your provisional tax, you should only have a small amount of end-of-year tax left to pay. You may even receive a refund. There are 4 ways to calculate provisional tax: the Accounting Income Method (AIM) the standard option the estimation option the ratio option. Because most people do not know how much tax they'll need to pay next year, calculating provisional tax usually involves a certain amount of judgement. You'll need to decide which provisional tax option works best for you. If you do not make a choice, the standard option will apply. You can choose any option for the year ahead (except the Accounting Income Method) by completing a box in your current income tax return, sending us a message in myIR, or calling us on 0800 377 774 If you want to use AIM to calculate your provisional tax for the year, you need to send us a statement of activity using your AIM-capable software. The Accounting Income Method (AIM) option The Accounting Income Method (AIM) aligns your provisional tax payments with the periods in which you have income to work out your instalments. You will pay provisional tax under the AIM option while you’re making a profit. If you’re not making a profit, payments will not be required. Choose the option that works best for you. Your provisional tax payments are based on your profits for the period. 7 If you’re currently using the estimation option, you must submit your first statement of activity by your first provisional tax instalment date for the year. If you’re using the standard or ratio option, you can choose to use the AIM option at any time, provided that: you submit your first statement of activity before your final provisional tax instalment date for the year, and you have made all payments due under your current option up to the date you switch. Once you choose to use AIM for the year you cannot choose another option until next year. When your provisional tax is due Your due dates for AIM are generally the same as your GST due dates: monthly (if you're registered for monthly GST filing) or 2-monthly (if you're registered for 2 or 6-monthly GST filing) If you're not registered for GST, your dates would be the 2-monthly GST due dates that align to your balance date. Qualifying for the AIM option Aim is available to individuals and companies with a turnover under $5m. If your turnover goes over $5m during the year you can request to continue to use AIM. You cannot use AIM in a year that you change your balance date. AIM-capable accounting software To use the AIM option, you must have AIM-capable accounting software provided by an approved AIM provider. Calculating your provisional tax At each due date your AIM-capable accounting software will work out your provisional tax payments and let you know how much to pay (if any). Payments align with your GST due dates. You'll need AIM-capable accounting software Provisional tax 8 Statement of activity As well as working out your provisional tax, your software will also collate your income and expense information and send it to us in a Statement of Activity. Overpayments If you have a drop in profit that means you may have overpaid your provisional tax during the year. Under the AIM option you can get a refund straight away. You can include instructions on what you would like done with the overpayment on your statement of activity. If you do not provide any instructions we will refund the overpaid amount. A Statement of Activity is not an income tax return. The standard option The standard option assumes your income will increase from year to year. When your provisional tax is due Generally, you’ll pay 3 instalments on: 28 August 15 January 7 May If you’re registered for GST and you file 6-monthly GST returns, you’ll only pay 2 instalments on: 28 October 7 May You can get overpaid provisional tax refunded straight away. The standard option assumes your income will increase from year to year. 9 Filing your tax returns When you use the standard option, your provisional tax is calculated from your previous year's RIT. You need to file your tax return on time, so you'll know your RIT before your instalments are due. If you do not have an extension of time to file your return, you'll need to file it by 7 July every year. That gives you time to work out how much provisional tax you need to pay, and prepare for your first instalment on 28 August. If you file your returns late, you still need to pay your provisional tax instalments on time. Complete your return so you can work out how much you need to pay. Penalties and charges can apply if you pay an instalment after the due date. Filing your return if you have an extension-of- time arrangement If you have an extension of time to file your tax return, you could have to pay an instalment of provisional tax before you know what your RIT is. In this situation, you'll calculate your provisional tax instalments using the RIT from 2 years ago, plus 10%. When you file your return, you'll do a special ‘catch- up’ calculation to take into account any earlier under or overpayments. Remember to file your returns on time. If you're using a tax agent, they'll usually have an extension of time. Provisional tax 10 The standard option Your provisional tax equals your previous year’s RIT plus 5%. For example, if your RIT was $10,130, your next year’s provisional tax will be $10,636. If you have an extension of time to file your income tax return and have not filed on or before your first or second instalment date, your provisional tax will be based on your RIT from 2 years ago. If your RIT from 2 years ago was: over $5,000, add 10% to the total under $5,000, you do not have to pay provisional tax. Once you file your tax return for the previous year, your provisional tax will be recalculated based on that year’s RIT plus 5% less provisional payments made. The following table shows how you would do the calculation for provisional tax instalments. if return filedInstalment 1 (P1)Instalment 2 (P2)Instalment 3 (P3) Due date 28 AugustDue Date 15 January Due Date 7 May On or before 28 AugustPrevious year’s RIT plus 5% ÷ by 3 = amount to pay for each instalment. After 28 August and on or before 15 January the next year (RIT 2 years ago + 10%) ÷ 3 = amount to pay (Previous year’s RIT + 5%) × 2 ÷ 3 less P1 = amount to pay (Previous year’s RIT + 5%) less (P1 + P2) = amount to pay After 15 January the next year but on or before 7 May (RIT 2 years ago + 10%) ÷ 3 = amount to pay (RIT 2 years ago + 10%) × 2 ÷ 3 less P1 = amount to pay (Previous year’s RIT + 5%) less (P1 + P2) = amount to pay Next year after 7 May(RIT 2 years ago + 10%) ÷ 3 = amount to pay (RIT 2 years ago + 10%) × 2 ÷ 3 less P1 = amount to pay Expected RIT from previous year + 5% less P1 + P2 Even if you filed your return after 7 May, your provisional tax will still be based on your previous year’s RIT. 11 Example Ned’s company, EJ Auto Services, has an extension-of time arrangement. Its 2023 return does not have to be filed until 23 January 2024, so Ned will have to pay the company’s first 2 instalments of 2024 provisional tax (due 28 August 2023 and 15 January 2024) before he knows how much the RIT will be. He goes back 2 years and looks at the company’s 2021 RIT: EJ Auto Services 2021 RIT $ 24,000 Add 10% $ 2,400 $ 26,400 Using the ‘catch-up’ method, Ned pays the following instalments of provisional tax: 28 August 2023 $8,800 ($24,000 + $2,400) ÷ 3 15 January 2024 $8,800 (($24,000 + $2,400) ÷ 3 × 2) − $8,800 The company files its 2023 return on 23 January 2024 showing an RIT of $23,740. The final catch-up instalment is: 7 May 2024 $7,327 ($23,740 + 5% \[$1,187\] − $8,800 − $8,800) Note – Where the instalment date is a weekend or public holiday, payments or returns filed on the next working day will be treated as being filed on the instalment day. This will have implications for the uplift that should be used. If your return for the previous year is assessed/ amended within 30 days of an instalment date If the return for the previous year is either assessed (Inland Revenue changes the assessment amount) or amended within 30 days of a provisional tax instalment date, that provisional instalment will not change. But if you file your return within 30 days before an instalment date then that instalment amount will be as calculated in the return you filed. Provisional tax 12 Example John has filed his 2023 IR3 return on 7 July 2023. His provisional instalments for 2024 are: 28 August:$3,000 15 January:$3,000 7 May:$3,000 His return is then reassessed on 20 December 2023, creating an increase in his 2023 RIT. As there are less than 30 days between the reassessment his second provisional tax instalment date, the increase in the amount of provisional tax payable will be included in the third instalment as follows: 28 August:$3,000 15 January:$3,000 7 May:$5,500 If the RIT from 2 years prior was $5,000 or under, provisional tax will only need to be paid in 1 or 2 instalments, depending on when the tax return is filed. In this case, the provisional tax will be evenly split between the required number of instalments. If your income changes When you are on the standard option, expect your RIT to be $60,000 or more and have paid all but your final instalment in full and on time you can make a payment for your final instalment that better reflects your income situation and remain on the standard option. You can change from the standard option to the estimation option at any time up until the date your final instalment is due. After you've made the change, you cannot then change back to the standard option for the same tax year. 13 The estimation option The estimation option could be right for you when your income is dropping. Using the standard option might mean you overpay your provisional tax. Your provisional tax equals your estimated RIT for the year. It works like this. Add up all the taxable income you expect to receive next year. Calculate the tax on this figure. Deduct any PAYE and other tax credits (except Working for Families) you'll be entitled to. The result is your estimated RIT, and this is your provisional tax for the year. When your provisional tax is due Generally, you'll pay 3 instalments, due 28 August, 15 January, and 7 May. But if you're registered for GST and you file 6-monthly GST returns, you'll only pay 2 instalments, due 28 October and 7 May. The estimation option may be a good choice if your income is dropping. Provisional tax 14 Example Hiwi is a property developer and a polytech lecturer. The property market is in a slump and Hiwi expects his net profit to decrease in the coming year. His tax agent advises him to switch to the estimation option to work out his provisional tax. Hiwi’s calculations: Net profit from property sales $ 170,600 Plus polytech salary $ 78,000 Expected taxable income $ 248,600 Tax on taxable income $ 72,958 Less PAYE deducted from the salary (not including ACC earners’ levy) $ 16,660 Estimated RIT $ 56,298 Hiwi’s provisional tax is $56,298 to be paid in 3 instalments on: 28 August $ 18,766 15 January $ 18,766 7 May $ 18,766 $ 56,298 Underestimating your provisional tax It pays to keep a close watch on your profits because you could be charged a penalty if your provisional tax estimation is unreasonably low, compared with your actual RIT once you file your return. You’ll need to tell us how much residual income tax you expect to pay. You can estimate: using the Estimate provisional tax service in myIR sending us a message in myIR by calling us by writing to us. You may have to pay a penalty if you underestimate your provisional tax. 15 You can estimate your residual income tax as many times as you like up until your final instalment due date. If you do re-estimate, you'll need to adjust later instalments to take into account any earlier under or overpayments. Example In February, Hiwi realises his year is going better than he first thought. He re-estimates his provisional tax to $65,000. So far, he’s paid 2 instalments: 28 August $18,766 15 January $18,766 His new estimate means these instalments are now too low. Hiwi’s final instalment must cover this underpayment. His new calculation is: Re-estimated provisional tax $65,000 Less instalments already paid $18,766 $18,766 $37,532 $27,468 Hiwi’s final instalment, due 7 May, is $27,468. The ratio option This option can suit people whose income tends to go up and down during the year. You calculate your provisional tax by applying a ratio percentage to the taxable supplies in your GST returns so your provisional tax instalments align with your business cashflow. We calculate your ratio percentage by dividing your RIT for the last tax year by your total GST taxable supplies for the same year. If your last year's figures are not available, we base the ratio on the RIT and total GST taxable figures from the previous year. Changing options Once you've selected the estimation option, you cannot change to the standard option during the same year. The ratio option may be helpful if you have seasonal income. Provisional tax 16 When your provisional tax is due Using the ratio option, you pay 6 instalments of provisional tax a year. If you have a 31 March balance date, your due dates are 28 June, 28 August, 28 October, 15 January, 28 February, and 7 May. Qualifying for the ratio option The ratio option is useful if your income varies or you have seasonal income. You must meet all these criteria to use it: You’ve been in business and registered for GST, for the whole of the previous tax year, and part of the tax year before that. Your residual income tax (RIT) for the previous year is greater than $5,000 You file your GST returns monthly or 2-monthly. You’re not a partnership. Your ratio percentage that we calculate for you is between 0 and 100% (we’ll let you know if it’s not). The ratio percentage You must let us know before the start of the tax year if you decide to use the ratio option. We'll calculate the ratio percentage for you, using information from your income tax and GST returns. GST ratio percentage = RIT from your latest income tax return × 100 total GST taxable supplies from the same tax year (less ratio percentage adjustments - see page 18) 1 Only provisional tax payers registered for GST who file one- monthly or 2-monthly returns can use the ratio option. The ratio percentage will only work if your returns are up to date. We cannot calculate a ratio percentage using returns from a tax year more than 2 years earlier than the provisional tax year. 17 Example Leonie is a kiwifruit grower in Te Puke. She files 2 monthly GST returns. On 20 February, she applies to use the ratio option to work out her provisional tax. We approve this and review her latest returns. Her RIT is $51,000, and her taxable supplies are $2,114,723, broken down as follows: GST return periodTaxable supplies ($) April - May690,025 June - July580,121 August - September145,859 October - November90,412 December - January152,681 February - March455,625 Total taxable supplies$2,114,723 Leonie's ratio percentage is: $51,000 × 100 =2.4%\* $2,114,7231 \*Your ratio percentage is rounded down to 1 decimal place. Calculating your provisional tax We'll tell you your ratio percentage. Calculate your provisional tax instalments, following the steps on the back of your GST return. You work out each instalment by applying the ratio percentage to the taxable supplies in each GST return (2-monthly filers) or every second GST return (one- monthly filers). Provisional tax 18 Leonie has approval to work out her 2019 provisional tax using a ratio percentage of 2.4%. She can now do the calculations.

You can start using your new ratio percentage 30 days from the date of our letter. Adjusting your ratio percentage If you sell a fixed asset, you can ask us to adjust your ratio percentage. Enter your details under ‘Provisional tax’ on the back of your GST return. Because we treat sales of fixed assets differently in income tax and GST returns, you may pay too much provisional tax if your ratio percentage is not adjusted. The value of the fixed asset you're selling must be the same or more than: $1,000, or 5% of your total taxable supplies for the previous 12 months. We'll use the larger amount. A fixed asset is an item owned by the business that will generally be used in the business for more than a year, and is not for sale to customers, eg, buildings, vans, equipment. 19 Ceasing the ratio option You can stop using the ratio option at any time. You just need to let us know by phone or email. If you stop using it before the first payment due date, you can choose to use the standard or estimation option to calculate. The usual use of money interest rules will apply from this time. If you stop using it after the first payment date, you must use the estimation option to calculate for the rest of the year. You must stop using the ratio option if: you cease your GST registration any of your GST returns are overdue by 60 days or more your ratio percentage change is no longer between 0% and 100% (we’ll let you know if it’s not) you change your GST filing frequency to 6-monthly a return of income is filed or amended where the residual income tax is calculated at below $5,000 or above $150,000. Provisional tax 20 Penalties We charge penalties on late or underpaid instalments of provisional tax. When you make a payment, it will be applied to the earliest unpaid provisional tax instalments. Provisional tax amounts include any late payment penalties charged. Late payment penalties We charge late payment penalties (LPPs) on all overdue payments. We charge the penalties in 2 stages. This means that the longer a payment remains overdue, the more penalties we’ll add. The stages are: 1% the day after the due date, and 4% 7 days later. We can stop some late payment penalties being added to your account if you set up a plan with us to pay your tax. Example Anthony had to pay provisional tax of $7,600 on 7 May for the 2022 income year. He paid it on 10 July, over 2 months late. LPPs were added as follows: DateAmount owing ($) LPPLPP added ($)New amount owing ($) 8 May 20227,600.001%76.007,676.00 14 May 20227,676.004%307.047,983.04 Total383.04 We charge penalties on late payments. 21 Shortfall penalties We may charge a shortfall penalty if you use the AIM or estimation options to calculate your provisional tax and your provisional tax is unreasonably low. We compare the provisional tax you paid to the RIT you calculate when you file your tax return, and apply the penalty to the underpaid amount. The amount of the shortfall penalty depends on the seriousness of the mistake. MistakeShortfall penalty Not taking reasonable care20% Unacceptable tax position20% Gross carelessness40% Abusive tax position100% Evasion150% When you need to pay your penalties You must pay any penalties as soon as you get them. You must also pay any overdue provisional tax at the same time. You cannot claim a deduction in your income tax or GST returns for any penalties you pay Inland Revenue. Provisional tax 22 Interest on provisional tax We may charge interest for end-of-year tax paid late or unpaid end-of-year tax and provisional tax (see ‘Paying and receiving interest’ below). Interest is a charge for the use of money and is sometimes referred to as UOMI. This means we may pay you interest if you overpay your provisional tax. We calculate interest when you file your income tax return. We compare your RIT to the provisional tax you've paid. You may have to pay interest even if you've paid your instalments in full and on time, or if you did not have to pay provisional tax. Paying and receiving interest Not everyone will pay interest on underpaid provisional tax. And not everyone will receive interest if they've overpaid their provisional tax. We'll calculate interest for: individuals and non-individuals who used the standard option, with RIT: –$60,000 or more (see explanation below). –less than $60,000, if payment not made by the terminal tax due date for the 2022-23 year or later. Prior to 2023 UOMI was charged if provisional tax payments were paid late/not paid in full. anyone who used the estimation option, with RIT over $5,000 anyone who chooses to use the AIM option but does not pay the provisional tax instalments their AIM- capable accounting software tells them to pay by the instalment date anyone whose RIT is $5,000 or less who chose to be a provisional taxpayer (individuals also need to have used the estimation option) - see ‘Choosing to be a provisional taxpayer’ on page 28. IRD number on the online RWT exemption register. Interest is not a penalty - it's a charge for the use of money. 23 Anyone choosing to be a provisional taxpayer has to use the estimation option. We will not charge interest if the underpaid or overpaid tax is $100 or less. When using the standard option the start date of UOMI depends on your RIT (when all required payments are made in full and on time). Provisional tax amount End of year residual income tax (RIT) Credit or debit UOMI Calculated from More/less than RIT amount Less than $60,000Debit/Credit UOMI calculated on the difference between the provisional tax amount paid and the RIT Terminal tax due date More than RIT $60,000 or moreCredit UOMI calculated on the difference between the provisional tax amount paid and the RIT Last instalment date Less than RIT $60,000 or moreDebit UOMI calculated on the difference between the provisional tax amount paid and the RIT Last instalment date, or earlier if underpaid/paid late RIT under $60,000 (standard option) from the 2022-23 year You will have UOMI applied from the Terminal tax due date even if the provisional tax payments are not made in full and/or on time. Late payment penalties will still be charged on late payments. RIT $60,000 or more (standard option) If you’ve paid all but your final instalment in full and on time then UOMI will apply from the last instalment due date. Note: Even if your final instalment is paid in full and on time, we will calculate UOMI from the final instalment date based on the difference between your RIT and the total provisional tax paid. Provisional tax 24 If you pay an instalment (other than the last 1) late or do not pay in full, UOMI will be charged from the due date of that and subsequent instalments (other than the last 1) on the lesser of: the amount of the instalment that you should have paid less the amount that was paid, or your RIT divided by the number of instalments for the tax year less the amount paid. If the previous year’s return was not filed on or before a provisional tax due date, and you have an extension of time, the amount that should have been paid for that instalment will be the lesser of the 10% uplift amount (based on 2 years prior) or the 5% uplift amount (based on the previous year). This does not apply to the final instalment. The above changes may not apply if: you're associated to specific persons or entities with 1 of you being a company and they are not covered by the above standard option rules or they do not use the GST ratio option, or you've entered an avoidance arrangement. For interest under the AIM option refer to page 27. How we calculate interest We use this formula to calculate interest on provisional tax: t × r ×d 365 Where: t = the underpaid or overpaid tax (including LPPs) r = the current interest rate d = the number of days where interest applies. Different rates of interest apply to underpaid and overpaid tax. Interest rates change frequently. See our website for the current and previous interest rates ird.govt.nz/penalties 25 We count both the first day that interest starts and the last day interest is payable when we calculate the number of days interest applies. When you need to pay your interest If we charge interest, you need to pay it by 7 February (or 7 April if you have a tax agent with an extension of time). Because interest is charged daily, you may want to pay it before the due date. The longer you leave it, the more you'll pay. You can claim a deduction in your income tax return for the interest you paid. If we pay you interest, you need to include it as income. Interest is GST exempt, so you do not include interest (paid or received) in your GST returns. Example ABC Ltd is a construction firm. Karen, the finance manager, used the standard option to calculate provisional tax of $24,000. Instalments were due on: 28 August $8,000 15 January $8,000 7 May $8,000 $24,000 The company only paid the first instalment on time. When Karen filed the company’s tax return on 7 July, she calculated RIT of $66,000. The company had a total of $58,000 still to pay. Because the RIT was more than $60,000 and the company did not pay all the provisional tax instalments in full and on time, the company had to pay interest. To find the amount that we charge interest on for all instalments except the final 1, we firstly identify the shortfall, which is the lesser of: the amount of the instalment that was payable ($8,000) less the amount that was paid, or your RIT divided by the number of instalments for the tax year ($66,000 ÷3 = $22,000) less the amount paid. The longer you leave it, the more you’ll pay. The longer you leave it, the more you'll pay.

Interest and the AIM option You will not pay (or receive) interest on any of your provisional tax instalments if you use the AIM option as long as your make your payments in full and on time. If the amount of a provisional tax instalment calculated by your AIM-capable accounting software is not paid on time, penalties and interest will apply to the underpayment. These will continue to apply until you make a payment. Interest and the ratio option You will not pay (or receive) interest on any of your provisional tax instalments if you use the ratio option for the full year. But, we'll charge interest if you owe more than $100 after your end-of-year tax due date (7 February, or 7 April if you have a tax agent with an extension of time). Late payment penalties will apply to instalments paid late or not paid in full. Provisional tax 28 Choosing to be a provisional taxpayer You can choose to be a provisional taxpayer if you're in this situation: your RIT works out to be $5,000 or less you've made provisional payments of more than $5,000 you had a reasonable expectation, on the day you made your first payment, that you would have to pay provisional tax. Talk to your tax agent first. Then let us know when you file your tax return if you want to be treated as a provisional taxpayer for the year. We may calculate interest on your voluntary payments. Individuals will need to estimate their provisional tax on or before their third instalment date to have interest calculated. We can help if you're finding it hard to pay Penalty and interest charges can increase your provisional tax payments quite quickly, so you'll save money if you pay your instalments in full and on time. If you cannot pay, call us as soon as you can - before the due date, if possible. We'll work with you to develop a solution that takes into account your personal circumstances. Do not let your debt get out of hand. Talk to us straight away. You can pay your instalments electronically, by credit or debit card. Find all the details of our payment options at ird.govt.nz/pay 29 Your first year in business Your first year in business is not tax-free. You'll need to file an income tax return at the end of your first year and pay tax on your net profit. You will not have to pay provisional tax during your first year in business unless your previous year's RIT was $5,000. But, you can make voluntary payments of provisional tax. In your second year you may have to pay end-of-year tax for your first year, on top of provisional tax instalments for your second year. Your end-of-year tax could be a significant amount if you do not have any voluntary payments to deduct. Voluntary payments will help if you need to pay interest, and may entitle you to an early payment discount. ird.govt.nz/early-payment-discount Example Isobel started her own business in October 2018. In June 2019, she sent in her first income tax return, for the year ended 31 March 2019. Her RIT (which is also her end-of- year tax) was $75,000. Isobel used the standard option to work out her 2020 provisional tax of $78,750. RIT $ 75,000 Plus 5% $ 3,750 2020 provisional tax $ 78,750 Isobel's due dates and payments are: Due dateTax to payAmount 28 August 20192020 provisional tax$26,250 15 January 20202020 provisional tax$26,250 7 February 20202019 end-of-year tax$75,000 7 May 20202020 provisional tax$26,250 Because she made no voluntary payments for 2019 income tax, Isobel must pay her $75,000 end-of-year tax as well as her $78,750 2020 provisional tax during her second year in business. Voluntary payments can help your cash flow. You can opt into the Accounting Income Method (AIM) in your first year of business by sending us your first Statement of activity with your AIM capable software. By using AIM, you’ll only pay provisional tax when you make a profit and your end-of year-tax will be closer aligned. Find out more about AIM on page 6. Provisional tax 30 Early payment discount In your first year in business you can qualify for the early payment discount, if you make voluntary tax payments during the tax year before you need to pay provisional tax. Individuals, partners in a partnership or owners of a look- through company can claim the early payment discount, but companies, trusts and other forms of business organisations do not qualify. You can get the early payment discount if you meet the following criteria: Your income comes mainly from a business (not interest, dividends, royalties, rents or beneficiary income). You're not required to pay provisional tax during the year you make the voluntary payments, or for any of the prior four years. You make the voluntary payments on or before the end of your tax year. You apply for the discount on or before the date your tax return must be filed (tick the box in the return). The discount is a percentage of either: the total amount of your voluntary payments 105% of your RIT for that year. We'll use the lesser amount. The early payment discount is treated as a payment towards your RIT. Further early payment discounts You can receive another early payment discount in another year if: you have not had to pay provisional tax in any of the previous 4 tax years, and you have not had any business income in the 4-year period since you last paid provisional tax or claimed the discount. You may get a discount if you make voluntary payments. 31 For more information on the early payment discount, please refer to ird.govt.nz/first-year-tax New provisional taxpayers The rules may apply differently if you’re a ‘new provisional taxpayer’. We may charge interest on a reduced number of instalments. If you’re an individual, we consider you’re a new provisional taxpayer if: your RIT for the current tax year is $60,000 or more your RIT was $5,000 or less in each of the 4 previous years, and during the current year, you stopped receiving income from employment and you then started to receive income from a taxable activity. If you’re a non-individual (eg, a company or a trust), the conditions are as follows: your RIT for the current tax year is $60,000 or more you did not receive income from a taxable activity in any of the 4 previous years, and you started receiving income from a taxable activity during the current year. Number of instalments As a new provisional taxpayer, you'll pay or receive interest on 1 to 3 provisional tax instalments, based on the date you started your taxable activity. Taxable activity startsNumber of instalments Before 29 July3 On or after 29 July but before 16 December2 On 16 December, or any time after that1 You'll have different dates if you have a balance date other than 31 March, or you file six-monthly GST returns. Talk to us or your tax agent if you need more information. Provisional tax 32 Budgeting for your provisional tax You need to know how much your provisional tax instalments are, and when you need to pay them. A basic budgeting principle is to put aside some money each month so you can be ready when the due date rolls around. It's important to budget for your provisional tax when you first start out in business because you may have to pay your first year's end-of-year tax bill during your second year, when you'll also have provisional instalments to pay. See page 29 for more information. Budgeting will help you meet your deadlines - especially when you start out in business. 33 Terms we use AIM capable accounting tax software.

NRWT - payer's guide IR291 April 2024 2 Introduction If you pay non-resident passive income (NRPI), this guide tells you: • when you're required to deduct NRWT (non-resident withholding tax) • when to pay the deductions to us • what information you're required to give to the people you pay the NRPI to. The glossary explains the terms used in this guide. Not all words and phrases have their everyday meaning so you may find it useful to read the glossary first. The information in this guide is based on current tax laws at the time of printing.

This covers where a shareholder has not satisfied the holding period requirement when a dividend is paid but may satisfy the requirement in the future. The full statement is available at taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/commissioner-s-statements/cs-20-03 From 1 April 2020 1. Details about investment income paid to each customer will need to be provided more often and electronically, including any joint account holder information. 2. You need to report only for the months in which you pay interest and withhold tax. 3. Some administrative changes have also been made: • removing the requirement to provide some end of year withholding tax certificates • improved error correction processes Find out more at ird.govt.nz/investment-income-reporting If you’re paying interest, dividends or royalties to people who are not New Zealand residents, you need to deduct NRWT from the gross amount of non-resident passive income (NRPI) you pay. For more information on tax residency see our guide New Zealand tax residence - IR292. If you pay NRPI, you need to register as an NRWT payer. You must pay the NRWT to us by the 20th of the month following the payment of NRPI. There is more about this in Part 2. Related party transaction rules are covered in Part 4. Registering as an NRWT payer You can register online in myIR or send us a completed NRWT - payer registration - IR380. Manage all your Inland Revenue matters securely online with a myIR account. Go to ird.govt.nz/myIR to find out more. Country codes We publish a list of two-letter codes that are used to identify countries. You must show these codes when filing your NRWT information. Make sure you use the correct two-letter code. It's important because we gather statistics from these country codes and use them to exchange information with double tax agreement countries. The country codes are available on our website ird.govt.nz/nrwt 6 Record keeping You need to keep full records of all the NRPI you pay, the NRWT you deduct and details of the recipients. With any NRWT deductions you make, you must keep records of the: • total NRPI you pay • total amount of NRWT and date it was deducted • full name and last known address of the recipient • recipient’s IRD number if they hold one • details of each type and amount of NRPI paid to each recipient • the amount of tax withheld. You must also keep details of all other financial arrangements that you’ve paid interest on at any time during the year. You must keep your records for seven years and they must be in English or Māori unless you get approval from us to use another language. We may ask you to keep your records for an additional three years if auditing or investigating you. Failure to keep adequate records is a very serious matter and can result in a fine. If you want to know more about audit procedures, read our guide Inland Revenue audits - IR297. NRWT PAYER’S GUIDE7 Non-residents not subject to NRWT Some special categories of non-residents are not subject to NRWT on the New Zealand income they derive. They may be subject to another tax instead. These categories are shown below. CategoryTa x Non-resident contractors are subject to non-resident contractors tax (NRCT) unless the contractor has an exemption from tax in New Zealand. For more information go to ird.govt.nz/non-resident-contractors Generally a NRCT rate of 15% applies Non-resident entertainers, sportspeople and speakers who are in New Zealand to perform activities publicly, such as actors, musicians and dancers, etc. For more information go to ird.govt.nz/nr-entertainers Withholding tax rate of 20% Non-resident insurers are subject to tax on income from premium payments. For more information go to ird.govt.nz/insurance-premiums-nr- insurers Annual tax rates Dividends paid to non-resident persons that are non-portfolio shareholders (direct voting interest above 10%) from 1 February 2010 that are also fully imputed or under a double tax agreement are exempt from tax. For more information go to ird.govt.nz/nrwt-and-exemptions Dividend exempt NRWT 8 Part 2 - Filing and payments Deducting NRWT If you’re a payer of NRPI, you’re required to deduct NRWT from the gross amount you pay to the non-resident. Interest payable under the approved issuer levy scheme and dividends to non-portfolio shareholders are excluded. The rates at which NRPI is taxed are: Interest 15% Royalties 15% Dividends\* 30% \* The exception is investment society dividends, which are treated as interest and taxed at 15%. NRWT rates are reduced when the non-resident is a taxpayer of a country that New Zealand has a double tax agreement (DTA) with. For lists these countries and the rate of NRWT to deduct go to ird.govt.nz/nrwt Example Interest due to an Australian resident on 10 March $ 1,000 NRWT to deduct on 10 March at 10% $ 100 Interest (net) payable to Australian resident $ 900 NRWT payable to Inland Revenue by 20 April $ 100 If the NRWT deducted is a minimum tax, the non-resident may have to file a tax return. The income is liable for tax at annual rates. When to deduct NRWT You need to deduct NRWT when you pay NRPI to a non-resident. For this purpose, "pay" includes: • distribute to • credit to an account • deal with in a person's interest or on their behalf. More information is available for certain related party transactions in Part 4. Monthly information You must provide us with your NRPI (royalties excluded) information electronically by the 20th of the following month it was paid. NRWT PAYER’S GUIDE9 You will need to provide: • your name, IRD number and contact address • the total amount of interest paid and tax withheld for the period. This is not a cumulative total. For each of the people who received interest: • their name and contact details, such as email, street address and mobile phone number • the amount and type of income paid to them • the tax withheld from it • the date the tax was withheld • their IRD number • their date of birth if you have it • the tax rate used • the name, IRD number, date of birth and contact details of any joint owners if you have it. The information needs to be provided to us electronically, unless we grant an exemption. You are no longer required to file a nil return. There are a number of electronic channels for filing to choose from, including: • Gateway web service (suitable for large volume filers) • file upload through myIR, and • online form via myIR (this may suit if you are filing for a few accounts). Penalty for not filing electronically There is a penalty of $250 for each time investment income information is not supplied to us electronically and you do not have an exemption. If you are unable to supply your investment income information electronically, you can apply for an exemption. In considering your request we will assess: • your capabilities • the digital services available to you • the compliance costs to you. 10 Paying the deductions to us All withheld tax must be paid by the 20th of the month following the month in which the interest income was paid to the investor. NRWT of $500 or more per year If you deduct $500 or more NRWT each year, the deductions made in each month are due to be paid to us by the 20th of the following month. NRWT of less than $500 per year If you expect to deduct less than $500 NRWT in any one income year, you may file and pay on a six- monthly basis: • 1 April to 30 September payment due on 20 October • 1 October to 31 March payment due 20 April. If your NRWT deductions accumulate to more than $500 during the year, you need to send them in by the 20th of the month after they reach $500. After that you need to file and pay monthly for the rest of the year. Manage all your Inland Revenue matters securely online with a myIR account. Go to ird.govt.nz/myIR to find out more. How to make payments You can make payments by: • direct debit in myIR • credit or debit card at ird.govt.nz/pay • internet banking - most New Zealand banks have a pay tax option. When making a payment, include: • your IRD number • the account type you are paying • the period the payment relates to. Find all the details of our payment options at ird.govt.nz/pay Late payment If you do not pay a bill on time, you may have to pay penalties and interest. Contact us if you are not able to pay on time. We’ll look at your payment options, which may include an instalment arrangement. Find out more at ird.govt.nz/penalties NRWT PAYER’S GUIDE11 Certificate of payment of tax In some cases a non-resident may need to get a certificate during the income tax year to show the tax paid on their behalf. If a recipient asks you for this information, complete a New Zealand non- resident withholding tax (NRWT) - IR386 form - you can get this from ird.govt.nz You may have to send the form to us for certification if the recipient asks you to. We do not have this information for a particular non-resident until the end of the tax year, so if a recipient asks us for certification we'll have to contact you for details. It's important to keep a record of the income and NRWT for each recipient throughout the year. Correcting or amending an NRWT deduction Note From 1 April 2020, correcting mistakes or making amendments is easier. NRWT under-deducted or not deducted If you discover you have not deducted enough NRWT, you can: 1. deduct it from later payments made to the person 2. ask the person to pay the amount that wasn’t deducted 3. adjust the amount of taxable income (only for non-cash dividends). Whichever option is chosen, the change must be made before the next due date for reporting investment income to us, provided it’s reasonably practicable to do so. Any recovery of an amount from the person must be made in the same tax year as the under deduction. There are also changes that make correcting under deductions, that are within certain thresholds, from a previous tax year easier. The timeframe to correct over deductions has also been extended. Correcting or amending deductions from earlier years How they are corrected depends on whether they result in too much or too little tax being deducted, and the type of income. These processes only apply to changes made by payers of investment income. 12 NRWT under deducted or not deducted Under deductions discovered can be corrected on the next reporting date if they relate to deductions made in the previous tax year, if the total value of all adjustments in the current tax year which relate to the previous tax year do not exceed the larger of: • $2,000, or • 5% of your NRWT withholding liability for NRWT for the year in which the first payment is made. You’ll need to let us know: • your name, IRD number and contact address • the name, contact address (email or street address) and country code of the person who received the income • the IRD number and date of birth of the person who received the income (if you have it) • the adjustments made to the investment income information originally provided. NRWT over-deducted If you discover you have withheld too much RWT, you can refund it any time before the 20th of April following the end of the tax year in which the over-deduction occurred, provided you have not provided the person who received the income with: • an end-of-year withholding tax certificate for NRWT, or • a shareholder dividend statement, or • a notice to a member who received a taxable Maori authority distribution. You must let us know the amount of the refund at the time you pay it so that we do not also provide a refund. If you do not refund the amount by the 20th of April following the end of the tax year in which the over-deduction occurred, you must tell us and the recipient how much needs to be refunded. If the over-deduction has already been paid to us, we will: • pay the refund to the payer if future payments to the person have been adjusted, or • pay the refund to the person who received the income if future payments have not been adjusted. If the recipient is a resident If you deduct NRWT from a payment to a recipient, and then find out they are actually a resident, you’ll need to let us know. RWT (resident withholding tax) must be deducted at the appropriate rate from interest (10.5%, 17.5%, 30% or 33%) and dividends (33%) paid to New Zealand residents. If you do not have the recipient’s IRD number you must deduct RWT from interest at 45%. As the NRWT rates are lower than the RWT rates, you’ll have under-deducted tax overall. In your covering letter, explain that the recipient is a resident and tell us how much of the NRWT should be RWT. We’ll transfer the payment to your RWT account. Make sure you give us the recipient’s details, so we can amend any certificates and make sure they get the correct tax credits. NRWT PAYER’S GUIDE13 Note After you find out that a recipient is a resident, you must start deducting RWT from any payments made. Our IR292 guide gives a full explanation of the residency rules. If you’d like more information about RWT, see our guides RWT on interest - payers guide - IR283 and Resident withholding tax (RWT) on dividends - IR284. Deducting NRWT instead of paying approved issuer levy (AIL) Before interest is paid, borrowers, payers and non-residents should decide whether NRWT or AIL will apply. This agreement cannot be retrospective. If you deduct NRWT from a payment when you should have paid AIL, you need to let us know. Generally AIL is paid on interest at the rate of 2%, but in certain cases a zero rate applies. As the NRWT rates are higher than the AIL rate, you’ll have over deducted tax. In your covering letter, explain that the recipient is subject to AIL, tell us how much of the NRWT should be AIL and give us the recipient’s details so we can correct any certificate. We’ll transfer the credit. Note Generally, where AIL is to apply the parties will not be associated. 14 Part 3 - Interest and dividends Interest and dividends are the most common forms of NRPI. Interest Our website shows the rates of NRWT to deduct from interest paid to non-residents in the countries listed. Go to ird.govt.nz/nrwt Note that the rate for interest paid to associated persons may be different. If the country is not shown on the table, the NRWT rate is 15%. The exception is for non-resident businesses operating from or through a fixed establishment - see glossary. In this case the interest income is taxed at annual rates because interest on such income does not meet the definition of NRPI. A payer of NRPI to a non-resident may assume that the non- resident does not have a fixed establishment. Redemption payments NRWT must be deducted from the interest portion of the redemption sum in cases where the redemption payment of commercial bills and similar debt instruments exceeds the initial acquisition price, including interest. Dividends NRWT is calculated on the gross dividend. This excludes imputation credits. Find the rates of NRWT to deduct from dividends paid to non-residents in the countries listed at ird.govt.nz/nrwt If the country is not shown on the table, the NRWT rate is 30%. Read the following sections on non-cash dividends and non-resident investors, as they may affect the way you calculate NRWT. Non-cash dividends See the glossary for a definition of a non-cash dividend. You're required to deduct NRWT at the time the benefit of the non-cash dividend is provided to the shareholder. Use one of the formulas below to calculate the NRWT. Where a non-cash dividend is fully imputed there's no obligation to either deduct or pay NRWT for that dividend. For non-cash dividends that are not fully imputed and not taxable bonus issues, use the formula: a ×b 1 − a In this formula: a is the applicable NRWT rate b is the amount of the dividend paid. NRWT PAYER’S GUIDE15 Example Dollar Corp forgives a loan of $750 to a shareholder, so this is a non-cash dividend. The NRWT is calculated as follows: a = 0.30 b = $750 NRWT= 0.30 ×$750 1 − 0.30 =0.428571×$750=$321.42 For taxable bonus issues, use the formula: a × c In this formula: a is the applicable NRWT rate c is either: - the amount of money or money's worth offered as an alternative to the bonus issue, before the deduction of NRWT, or - the non-cash dividend. Example a = 0.30 c = $750 NRWT=0.30×$750 =$225 Non-resident investors The total New Zealand tax on most distributed company income (dividends) paid to non-resident investors is limited to 30%. Non-resident investors in certain cases are liable for NRWT on dividends, including supplementary dividends, which they derive from New Zealand companies. Where a non-resident investor is subject to double taxation (a combination of company income tax and NRWT) they could get a reduction in company tax by a credit on the tax for the company. The credit is passed by the company to its non-resident shareholders as a supplementary dividend. Where a non-resident investor has a non-portfolio interest (voting interest in the company of 10% or greater) any fully imputed distribution (dividend) is not liable for NRWT. Alternatively relief may be available under a double tax agreement. If full imputation credits are attached to a company's dividends, the tax credit is set so that the total New Zealand tax is 28% on distributed company income. This applies to investors who are resident in countries that New Zealand has a double tax agreement with. Non-residents cannot use imputation credits to meet their NRWT liabilities. 16 Part 4 - Special cases This part covers in general details you may need to know as a payer of NRPI. Related party transactions Deferral calculation A "deferral calculation" is required for a transaction with a related party if the financial arrangement expenditure exceeds a $40,000 threshold for the previous year. The deferral calculation is the accumulated payments divided by the accumulated accruals if they are equal to or greater than 90%. Accumulated payments are the total interest paid from when the financial arrangement became a related party debt until the 20th of the third month after the end of the income year. For example if the income year ends 31 March, the accumulated payments are up to 20 June. Accumulated accruals are the total expenditure the borrower incurs while the arrangement is a related party debt until the end of the year preceding the income year. If the calculation is less than 90% If the calculation is less than 90% then the financial arrangement rules are used to calculate the accrued interest, ie non-resident financial arrangement income, (NRFAI). NRWT is payable on that accrued interest - the NRFAI. Where the related party debt does not exceed the $40,000 threshold or the calculation is satisfied (90% or greater) then NRWT is payable on interest using the payments basis. Example Three years ago, Sub Ltd. borrowed money from a non-resident associate. Sub’s financial arrangement expenditure on this arrangement is $42,000 a year. In the following years Sub paid interest of $19,000, $20,000 and $21,000. At the end of the second year, the deferral calculation is ($19,000 + $20,000) ÷ $42,000 = 92.9%, so no NRFAI arises. In the third year the calculation is ($19,000 + $20,000 + $21,000) ÷ ($42,000 + $42,000) = 71%. As this is below 90% NRFAI arises for the first time in the third year. You do not need to repeat the calculation once the 90% threshold has been breached. NRWT continues to apply on an accrual basis as long as the financial arrangement is related party debt. NRWT PAYER’S GUIDE17 When you do the calculation You do the deferral calculation in the second month after the borrower’s balance date. The accrued interest (NRFAI) is deemed to be paid on the final day of that second month after balance date. Then the NRWT payable on the interest (NRFAI) is included in the return due on the 20th of the third month after balance date. Example NZ Sub income year ends 31 March. They must complete the deferred calculation at the end of May. The result of the calculation is 65.2% and financial arrangement income is $30,000, NZ Sub must pay NRWT by 20th June on their NRFAI. Foreign currency If NRPI is paid in a foreign currency, the NRWT may be deducted in that currency, but the deductions must be paid to us in New Zealand currency. Use the exchange rate that applied on the day the NRWT was deducted. Agents Some non-residents have agents acting on their behalf in New Zealand. If you pay NRPI to an agent you must send written advice to the agent stating that you've deducted NRWT. You're required to do this each time you make a payment for that recipient. If an agent receives a payment and NRWT has not been deducted, or has been under-deducted, the agent is responsible for deducting the shortfall and paying it to us. Custodians withholding and investment information reporting requirements Generally, custodians that are exempt from RWT and receive investment income on behalf of their clients are required to withhold tax and pay this to the Commissioner along with providing investor investment income information for on-payments or transfers of the income to their clients. Only where a third party agrees to take on and completes these requirements, or another custodian above you in the chain takes on these requirements will you be relieved from them. If sufficient tax has already been withheld and paid by the investment income payer, then a custodian or third party who has taken on the requirements need only provide the investor information. There are certain variations to the reporting requirements that can apply. Refer to the technical specifications for your channel of filing the information for the details. For more information read our Tax Information Bulletin vol 32 No. 4. 18 Emigrating companies Companies that emigrate from New Zealand are considered to have liquidated on the date of emigration and the normal tax rules for a liquidation apply. The company will be required to withhold tax from any deemed dividend distribution immediately before it ceased to be a New Zealand resident company, under the NRWT rules. An extension of time of up to three months from the original due date has been granted for emigrating companies to file their final NRWT (IR67P) returns. For further information refer to Section 49 of Tax Administration Act 1994. Note Where a company that is resident in New Zealand becomes non- resident under a Double Tax Agreement, it may be treated as migrating from New Zealand in certain situations. Expenses Expenses such as commission and agent's fees cannot be deducted from NRPI before NRWT is calculated. NRWT is a tax on the gross amount of NRPI. Gross means without any deductions at all. Joint accounts Note You need to provide the details of all joint account holders, so we can identify investments held in joint ownership. You also need to provide us with information such as an account number and how many holders are on the account. Where the interest is earned by two or more people jointly and at least one of these persons is a New Zealand resident, RWT should be deducted at the appropriate rate from the total amount. Exemption from NRWT Some non-resident persons or organisations are entitled to be paid NRPI in full without having NRWT deducted. When we grant an exemption from NRWT, we provide the payer with a letter confirming the exemption. The Non-resident Centre processes requests from overseas organisations to exempt their NRPI (derived from New Zealand sources) from tax. The main reason these organisations request an exemption is because they have tax-exempt status in their countries of residence, and they believe it should extend to other countries from which they derive income. NRWT PAYER’S GUIDE19 New Zealand tax laws do not automatically exempt organisations or their income from New Zealand tax simply because an exemption exists in their own countries of residence. However, overseas organisations can be considered for exemption from NRWT if any of these conditions are met: • income is specifically exempted from income tax, including NRWT, under New Zealand tax law • income is exempted from income tax by any other New Zealand legislation • double tax agreements expressly provide for an exemption from tax on certain types of income. Applications for exemption from NRWT If you wish to have an organisation considered for a tax exemption, apply, in myIR and include the following information with your application: • the particular provisions under which you seek exemption • a copy of the constituting documents of the organisation such as the trust deed or memorandum and articles of association • evidence of the organisation's tax exemption in its country of residence such as a letter from the appropriate revenue authority. Grossing up Some contracts and agreements with non-residents provide for domestic taxes to be borne by the payer. In these circumstances, the income must be "grossed up" to arrive at the true NRPI. Here is the formula for grossing-up net income: a× 100 100 − b In this formula: a is the net income b is the NRWT rate. Example Here’s how to grossup a net interest payment of $170,000 with an NRWT rate of 15%: $170,000× 100 =$200,000 85 In this example the gross amount is $200,000. The correct NRWT is the difference between the gross amount ($200,000) and the amount paid to the non-resident ($170,000), that is, $30,000. Foreign embassies and diplomatic missions Diplomats who are neither residents (for tax purposes) nor citizens of New Zealand are not liable for income tax on their salaries or any income from outside New Zealand. Any interest or dividend they earn from New Zealand is liable for NRWT. 20 Many diplomats are New Zealand residents for tax purposes as they're usually here for more than 183 days in any 12-month period. In these cases, any interest or dividend earned is subject to RWT, n o t N RW T. Any New Zealand residents (for tax purposes) who work for foreign embassies, consulates or diplomatic missions in New Zealand are liable for the usual New Zealand income tax on their income. Foreign pension funds NRWT is deductible from the NRPI paid to foreign non-resident pension funds. Final or minimum tax NRWT is a final tax in some cases and a minimum tax in other cases, depending on the type of income that has been paid to the non-resident. Final liability NRWT is the final tax liability when it is deducted from: • dividends • cultural royalties • interest (or investment society dividends) paid to persons who are not "associated persons" with the payer • interest payments zero-rated for NRWT (liable for approved issuer levy). Minimum tax NRWT is only a minimum tax when it's deducted from: • interest (or investment society dividends) paid to associated persons • industrial and commercial royalties. This includes payments for specialist knowledge or information, but does not include cultural royalties. Exemptions from minimum tax Double tax agreements The double tax agreement treaties may limit the amount of tax chargeable to the amount of NRWT. Companies If the total New Zealand income of a non-resident company from all sources (excluding dividends and cultural royalties) is $1,000 or less, the NRWT deducted is the final liability. In most cases, payers are not affected by whether NRWT is a final or minimum tax. However, the above information becomes important if the payer is also acting as the agent for the recipient. In this case the payer must file a tax return on behalf of the recipient. NRWT PAYER’S GUIDE21 Part 5 - Approved issuer levy (AIL) An approved issuer is anyone who has been granted approval by us to pay interest to non-residents at a zero rate of NRWT. Approved issuers are required to pay a levy on the securities that are registered with us. The levy is calculated generally at a rate of 2 cents in every $1 of interest paid on a registered security or any redemption payment on a bond issued at a discount. In certain circumstances the AIL levy rate may be a zero rate. All government stock qualifies for the AIL. Our Approved issuer levy (AIL) - IR395 guide answers questions about the AIL scheme and explains how to get approval for zero-rated NRWT. To get AIL status complete an Approved issuer levy payer registration - IR396. However, if you already have approved issuer status, use an Application to register security or securities for approved issuer levy (AIL) - IR397. Use the Approved issuer levy (AIL) - IR67A form to pay AIL. Part 6 - Reporting royalty payment The new investment income reporting requirements have not changed when you need to report royalty payments to non-residents. These can be provided by 31 May after the end of the year. 22 Glossary Approved issuer An approved issuer is a borrower who has approval from us to use the approved issuer levy (AIL) scheme, which allows them or a person on their behalf to pay interest to a non-resident without having to deduct NRWT. Approved issuer levy Approved issuer levy (AIL) is a payment calculated generally at the rate of 2 cents in every $1 of the interest paid on a registered security or any redemption payment on a bond issued at a discount. Associated persons The following are associated persons: • a group of persons whose total voting interests in each company are 50% or more • a company and non-company (generally individual) if the individual’s voting interest in the company is 25% or more. For these purposes, the individual is treated as holding anything held by a person associated with them, eg, if two sisters own 15% of the shares in a company, both sisters would be associated with the company • relatives related to the second degree of blood relationship • two persons who are married, in a civil union or in a de facto relationship • two persons if one person is within two degrees of blood relationship to the other person’s spouse, civil union or de facto partner (ie, a person is associated with their parents-in-law and step-children) • a child by adoption is treated as a natural child • a person and a trust where the person is a beneficiary of the trust or is a relative of a beneficiary of the trust • the trustees of two trusts if they have a settlor in common • a trustee and a settlor of the trust • a beneficiary of a trust is associated with a settlor of the trust • a trustee and a person with power of appointment or removal • a partnership and its partners • two persons if they are each associated with the same third person by different tests (tripartite test). Refer also to "Indirect associated funding", "Non-resident lending body" and "Related party debt" below. There is more information about associated persons at taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications or in A guide to associated persons definitions for income tax purposes - IR620. NRWT PAYER’S GUIDE23 Cultural royalties These are royalties paid for the use, production or reproduction (or the right to do any of these things) of any literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work on which there is a copyright. Fixed establishment A place of business from which a substantial business is carried out, such as a retail shop, hotel, factory or farm. A property let for rent is generally regarded as an investment rather than a business. Gross interest Interest with no deduction made from it. Indirect associated funding A non-resident person (indirect lender) provides funds directly or indirectly to another person (direct lender) who provides funds to the borrower. Or the indirect lender reimburses the direct lender or compensates them for providing the funds to the borrower. Interest Interest is any amount paid or credited in relation to money lent. For the purpose of NRWT it also includes: • redemption payments • investment society dividends • payment(s) that give rise to expenditure under the financial arrangement rules. Non-cash dividends Companies may provide other benefits to shareholders rather than paying a cash dividend. These benefits are also treated as dividends and NRWT must be deducted. Some examples are interest-free or low-interest loans to shareholders, and payment of private expenses. The formula for calculating NRWT on non-cash dividends is on page 20. Non-resident A person is a non-resident if they: • are away from New Zealand for more than 325 days in any 12-month period, and do not have an "enduring relationship" with New Zealand, or • are in New Zealand for less than 183 days in any 12-month period, and do not have an enduring relationship with New Zealand. Non-resident owning bodies For a company - A group consisting of 2 or more members who are each a non-resident and who each holds ownership interests in the company or have a linked trustee holding ownership interests in the company. 24 Non-resident passive income (NRPI) This is interest, dividends and royalties that a non-resident derives or is deemed to have derived from New Zealand. Non-resident financial arrangement income (NRFAI) This is a sub category of NRPI. It is for transactions over $40,000 with a related party (parties) where there is a timing mismatch between income and expenditure. The financial arrangement rules are used to calculate income subject to NRWT. Paid For the purposes of NRPI, paid means distributed, credited or dealt with in the interest of, or on behalf of, a person. Pay and payment have similar meanings in this context. If a payer compounds interest to capital on behalf of a person, the payer has "dealt with it in the interest of" that person. Person Person can refer to an individual, a company and to other entities. Related party debt All financial arrangements where a non-resident provides funds to an associated NZ resident (or NZ branch of an associated non-resident) and the borrower is allowed a deduction under the financial arrangement rules. Royalties A royalty is defined in the income tax laws as any payment for using (or having the right to use) anything such as copyrights, patents, designs, films, audio or videotapes, specialist knowledge or information, and mining or cutting rights. It also covers payments to authors, editors or composers for each copy of a work sold, performed or broadcast. It does not matter what such payments are called for accounting purposes (for example, management fees, technical fees, administration charges, head office charges), if they fit the definition of a royalty, NRWT must be deducted. Tax resident A person is a New Zealand tax resident if they: • are in New Zealand for more than 183 days in any 12-month period, or • have an enduring relationship with New Zealand, or • are away from New Zealand in the service of the New Zealand Government.

New Zealand tax residence Who is a New Zealand resident for tax purposes? IR292 August 2019 The information in this guide is based on current tax laws at the time of printing. www.ird.govt.nz 1 Introduction The tax residence rules determine whether a person is a New Zealand tax resident. The worldwide income of a New Zealand tax resident is subject to New Zealand tax laws. People who are not New Zealand tax residents (non-residents) are liable for New Zealand tax only on their New Zealand-sourced income. Read on for information about: • tax residence rules for individuals: – who is a resident and who is a non-resident, for tax purposes only – temporary tax exemption on foreign income – what income you’re taxed on as a resident or a non-resident – paying tax as a resident or a non-resident • tax residence rules for non-individuals • where to go for further help. Please read all sections so you can establish whether you’re a tax resident or a non-resident. This guide deals with tax residence rules. These are different from the normal New Zealand immigration residency rules. We have used the words “resident” and “non-resident” in this guide for New Zealand tax purposes only. Note You may need to provide information about your financial accounts in New Zealand and overseas to comply with international obligations.

You’re a New Zealand tax resident if: • you’ve been in New Zealand for more than 183 days in any 12-month period and haven’t become a non-resident - see page 7, or • you have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand - see below, or • you’re away from New Zealand in the service of the New Zealand government. The 183-day rule If you’ve been in New Zealand for more than 183 days in any 12-month period, you’re considered to be a New Zealand tax resident from the first of the 183 days. The 183 days don’t have to be consecutive. For example, if you come to New Zealand for 10 days in April and then return for 20 days in September of the same year, it will be counted as 30 days. If you’re in New Zealand for part of a day, it’s counted as being a whole day. This means that the days you arrive or depart are treated as “days present” in New Zealand. If you’ve ever been resident in New Zealand under the 183-day rule you remain resident until you become a non- resident - see page 7. A permanent place of abode in New Zealand The Income Tax Act 2007 says that a person, other than a company, who has a “permanent place of abode” in New Zealand is a New Zealand tax resident. To have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand there must be somewhere in New Zealand (ie, a house or other dwelling), where you habitually reside from time to time. Determining this requires an overall assessment of your circumstances and the nature and quality of the use you habitually make of the place of abode. www.ird.govt.nz 5 If you have strong ties to New Zealand it’s likely that you have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. The permanent place of abode test overrides any rules about the number of days you’re out of New Zealand. So you’ll still be tax resident in New Zealand as long as you have a permanent place of abode here, even if you’re gone for more than 325 days. If there’s somewhere in New Zealand you could live, we need to decide whether it’s your permanent place of abode. To do this, we look at all of your circumstances, including the following: Do you have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand? CircumstanceLook at Presence in New Zealand how much time you spend in New Zealand, and whether you’re here continuously or from time to time Accommodationhow you’ve previously used the accomodation you have in New Zealand, and your connection with it, ie, whether you own it, lease it or control it Family and social ties where your family live (especially immediate family) and if you belong to any New Zealand clubs, associations or organisations Economic tiesif you have bank accounts, credit cards, investments, life insurance or superannuation funds here Employment or business if you run a business here, or if you’re employed here, if you have (or may have) employment to return to, the terms of any employment contract Personal propertyif you have vehicles, clothing, furniture and other property or possessions kept here NEW ZEALAND TAX RESIDENCE 6 Intentionswhether you intend to come back to New Zealand to live and if you do, when Benefits, pensions and other payments whether you receive any welfare benefits, pensions or other payments from New Zealand agencies or organisations. This list is a guide only - you’ll need to consider your overall situation when working out whether you’re a New Zealand tax resident. Please note that even if you maintain ties (or even a physical home) in other countries you can still be a New Zealand tax resident. As long as you have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand you’ll always be a resident. Government service If you’re sent away from New Zealand in the service of the government in any capacity, you’re considered to be a tax resident of New Zealand and liable for New Zealand tax on your worldwide income. The length of your absence and whether you have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand doesn’t matter. This rule doesn’t apply to a spouse, partner or children who may be accompanying you. The normal tax residency rules still apply to them. www.ird.govt.nz 7 Double tax agreements (DTAs) You may be a tax resident in both New Zealand and another country. This means that you’re resident in two countries under the tax laws of each of those countries. If both countries tax their residents on worldwide income you could be taxed twice on the same income. Double tax agreements have been negotiated between New Zealand and many other countries to determine what taxing rights each country has. Go to www.ird.govt.nz to look at the latest list of countries that have DTAs with New Zealand. Becoming a non-resident Remember, if you have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand you’ll be a resident for tax purposes. However, if the ties and links described on pages 4-6 suggest you don’t have a permanent place of abode here, you can become a non-resident under the “325-day rule”. The 325-day rule You become a non-resident for tax purposes if: • you don’t have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, and • you’re away from New Zealand for more than 325 days in any 12-month period. The 325 days do not have to be consecutive. If you’re here for only part of a day it’s counted as a whole day. NEW ZEALAND TAX RESIDENCE 8 Paying tax as a resident Your worldwide income is taxed If you’re a New Zealand tax resident you’re taxed on your worldwide income. You must state your income from all sources, including that from overseas, in an Individual tax return (IR3). You’re normally allowed a tax credit for any tax paid overseas so you’ll need to be able to produce records which show the overseas tax you’ve paid. The New Zealand tax year is from 1 April to 31 March of the following year. Unless you get consent from us to use a non-standard balance date you may need to apportion your overseas income to fit the New Zealand tax year. The year you become a tax resident Any person, individual or business required to pay tax in New Zealand will need to apply for an IRD number. Some contractors and entertainers don’t require IRD numbers - see pages 16 and 17. If you haven’t had a personal New Zealand IRD number before, you can apply for one by filling in an IRD number application – individual (IR 595) form. When applying for a personal IRD number you’ll have to go to an Inland Revenue appointed verifier with two specified identification documents. Just follow the instructions on the front of the application form. To apply for an IRD number for a business, trust or other non-individual entity, fill in an IRD number application - non- individual (IR596) form. If you’ve had a New Zealand IRD number before, call us on 0800 227 774 to check it’s still valid. Once you have your IRD number, please have it with you whenever you call us. We calculate tax on any overseas income in accordance with New Zealand tax laws. Our tax laws may be different from the laws of other countries. Note www.ird.govt.nz 9 Temporary tax exemption on foreign income Most types of individual income derived from overseas may be temporarily exempt from tax in New Zealand. This temporary tax exemption is available to people who: • have qualified as a tax resident in New Zealand on or after 1 April 2006, and • are new migrants or returning New Zealanders, who haven’t been resident for tax purposes in New Zealand for at least 10 years before their arrival in New Zealand. The temporary tax exemption for foreign income starts on the first day that you are a tax resident here. It ends 48 months after the month you qualify as a tax resident in New Zealand. This means that the period between your arrival in New Zealand and the date you qualify as a tax resident is also treated as an exempt period. Qualifying for the exemption To be eligible for a temporary tax exemption on foreign income you must: • have qualified as a tax resident in New Zealand on or after 1 April 2006, and • not have been a New Zealand tax resident at any time in the past 10 years before the date you qualified again as a tax resident in New Zealand - see page 4, and • not have been eligible for this tax exemption before (including if you were eligible but chose to waive the exemption), and • not be receiving Working for Families Tax Credits (your spouse or partner must not be receiving them either). Sarah was in New Zealand from 10–14 March 2013. She then moved here on 22 April 2013, and qualified as a tax resident on 16 October 2013. She met the criteria for her foreign income to be temporarily exempt from tax in New Zealand. Her exemption applies from 10 March 2013 until 31 October 2017. Example NEW ZEALAND TAX RESIDENCE 10 This exemption is a one-off, you can’t extend your tax exemption or renew it after its expiry date. There are some types of foreign income that don’t qualify for a temporary tax exemption. The exemption and Working for Families Tax Credits (WfFTC) You can’t receive WfFTC while being tax exempt from foreign income. If you’re eligible for the temporary tax exemption on foreign income and you (or your spouse or partner) are also eligible for WfFTC, you need to decide which option is the best for your situation. If you decide to waive the temporary tax exemption so you can claim WfFTC, you’ll need to show in your Individual tax return (IR3) all the foreign income you received from the date of your arrival in New Zealand. Go to www.ird.govt.nz/wff-tax-credits/ to: • see if you’re eligible • work out how much you may be entitled to • register for WfFTC. For further information about WfFTC you can call us within New Zealand on 0800 227 773 or on +64 4 978 0779 if you’re calling from overseas. How to claim the exemption The tax exemption is automatically granted if you’re eligible. If you qualify for the exemption, you’re not required to tell us about foreign income you receive (except for foreign income that doesn’t qualify for the temporary tax exemption) for the period of your exemption. www.ird.govt.nz 11 Foreign income exempt from tax in New Zealand Types of foreign income which are temporarily exempt from tax in New Zealand: • controlled foreign company (CFC) income that is attributed under New Zealand’s CFC rules • foreign investment fund (FIF) income that is attributed under New Zealand’s FIF rules (including foreign superannuation) • non-resident withholding tax (eg, on foreign mortgages) • income arising from the exercise of foreign employee share options • accrual income (from foreign financial arrangements) • income from foreign trusts • rental income derived offshore • foreign dividends • foreign interest • royalties derived offshore • income from employment performed overseas before coming to New Zealand, such as bonus payments • gains on the sale of property derived offshore (held on revenue account) • offshore business income (that is not related to the performance of services). Foreign income taxed in New Zealand The foreign income that will continue to be taxed in New Zealand is: • employment income from overseas employment performed while living in New Zealand, and • business income relating to services performed offshore. If you receive any non-exempt types of foreign income from the date of your arrival back in New Zealand, you’ll need to show this income in your Individual tax return (IR3), even if you qualify for a temporary tax exemption on other types of foreign income. NEW ZEALAND TAX RESIDENCE 12 After the exemption has ended When your temporary tax exemption ends, you need to include all your foreign income (received since your exemption ended) in your IR3, along with your New Zealand income. You’re required to file an IR3 after the end of your exemption and every tax year after that, as long as you have foreign income (regardless of whether or not you told us of your foreign income when you arrived in New Zealand). New Zealand’s tax year runs from 1 April to 31 March. If your exemption ends at any time in a tax year other than on the standard balance day of 31 March, you’ll need to apportion your foreign income received for that year in your IR3. For more information Go to www.ird.govt.nz for more about: • the temporary tax exemption on foreign income • filing an Individual tax return (IR3). You can also call us within New Zealand on 0800 227 774 or on +64 4 978 0779 if you’re calling from overseas. Sam qualified as a tax resident in New Zealand on 10 September 2007 and met the criteria for his foreign income to be temporarily exempt from tax in New Zealand from 10 September 2007 until 30 September 2011. Sam’s exemption ends in the middle of a standard New Zealand tax year and he will continue to receive foreign income after his exemption ends (on 30 September 2011). On his tax return for the year ending 31 March 2012 (the tax year that his exemption ended in), Sam has to show the foreign income he received from 1 October 2011 to 31 March 2012. Example www.ird.govt.nz 13 The year you cease to be a tax resident If you’re leaving New Zealand, or have left New Zealand, you can use the information on our website or speak with your tax agent to determine if you’re a New Zealand tax resident. Or, if you would like our view, you can fill in a New Zealand tax residence questionnaire (IR886). We’ll then advise you about your tax residence status and if you have any future New Zealand tax responsibilities. If you’ll no longer be a tax resident and won’t be receiving income from New Zealand from the date you leave, you may need to complete an Individual tax return (IR3) up to the date of your departure. You can file your IR3 before the end of the tax year. Include any income you received from all sources up to the date you leave New Zealand. Send your IR3 to the appropriate Inland Revenue address below before you leave. Inland Revenue PO Box 39090 Wellington Mail Centre Lower Hutt 5045 For returns with payments Inland Revenue PO Box 39050 Wellington Mail Centre Lower Hutt 5045 If you qualify for a refund or want a statement of account, we’ll send it as soon as possible. Please make sure we have your overseas address. If you’ll be receiving income from New Zealand after you’re no longer a tax resident, you’ll have to pay tax as a non- resident - see page 15. Please provide us with full details of: – your overseas address – the date you left or intend to leave New Zealand – the length of time you intend to be away. NEW ZEALAND TAX RESIDENCE 14 You can authorise another person in New Zealand to help with your tax affairs. See page 19 for more information on setting up a nominated person. If you’ll be receiving income from New Zealand after you’re no longer a tax resident, you must file an Individual tax return (IR3) to the end of the tax year (31 March) following your departure. Include your worldwide income received until the date you left and your New Zealand income received after that date. Please clearly show the breakdown of income received before and after your departure. www.ird.govt.nz 15 Paying tax as a non-resident If you’re a non-resident you’re taxed only on income you receive from a New Zealand source. If your only income from New Zealand is interest, dividends or royalties, and the correct amount of NRWT (non-resident withholding tax) is deducted, you won’t need to file a non-resident return. Please give your bank or other financial institution your overseas address and tell them you’re a non-resident for tax purposes to ensure the correct amount of NRWT is deducted. There’s a limited exception to paying NRWT on interest. If the payer of your interest pays approved issuer levy, NRWT isn’t deducted from your interest. For further information please read our NRWT (Non-resident withholding tax) – payer’s guide (IR 291) and Approved issuer levy (IR395) guide. If you receive any other income such as rental, business or farming income, it is subject to New Zealand tax at the normal rates and you’ll be required to file a Non-resident individual taxpayers (IR3NR) return. Complete an IR3NR if you’re a non-resident for the full year and you have continuing income from New Zealand. We’ll send you an IR3NR taxpack each year, so make sure we have your current address while you’re away. Please file only one return for any income year. Also note, we can’t accept non-resident returns in any sort of electronic format such as email.

The Recognised Seasonal Employer (RSE) scheme facilitates the temporary entry of additional workers from overseas to plant, maintain, harvest and pack crops for a limited period. The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment administers the RSE scheme. If you’re a recognised seasonal worker under the RSE scheme you’re a non-resident for New Zealand tax purposes but will have to pay New Zealand tax on your New Zealand income. Your employer will deduct tax, including ACC levies, at a flat PAYE rate. You won’t have to pay any further tax or have a refund to claim, and in most cases, you won’t have to file an end-of-year tax return. You need to use the NSW (non-resident seasonal worker) tax code on your Tax code declarations (IR330). Non-resident contractors and entertainers There are special rules for non-resident contractors and non-resident entertainers who earn income from New Zealand. Please contact one of our specialist teams for more information.

You should include the period from 1 April before your arrival up to the end of the tax year, the following 31 March. To find out if you need to do this call 0800 227 774. If you do need to complete an IR 3, include your New Zealand income earned while overseas and your worldwide income received after the date of your arrival for the income year. Please clearly show the breakdown of income you received before and after you arrived. NEW ZEALAND TAX RESIDENCE 18 Student loan borrowers going overseas If you’re away from New Zealand six months or more (184 or more consecutive days), you’ll need to contact us and let us know.

You’ll need to apply for a repayment holiday before you leave New Zealand or within six months (183 days) of leaving and provide an alternative contact person who is resident in New Zealand. You may still qualify for an interest-free loan if one of the following applies. You: • are studying overseas • are living in Niue, Cook Islands, Tokelau or Ross Dependency • are working overseas for the New Zealand Government • are working overseas because your New Zealand employer requires this • are working as a volunteer overseas • are accompanying your partner overseas • have an unexpected delay returning to New Zealand • have an unplanned absence.

Your nominated person will be able to check your records including your tax status and make any other enquiries on your behalf. They can also receive your statements, refunds and other correspondence. But remember, you’ll still have overall responsibility for meeting your obligations, including filing returns and making payments by the due date.

NEW ZEALAND TAX RESIDENCE 20 Tax residence rules for non-individuals There are different tax residence rules for non-individual taxpayers. Companies A company is a resident in New Zealand if it meets any one of the following criteria: • It is incorporated in New Zealand. A company which is incorporated under the New Zealand Companies Act 1993 is resident in New Zealand. • Its directors exercise control in New Zealand. Those acting in their capacity as directors control the company here, whether decision-making by directors is confined to New Zealand or not. • It has its centre of management in New Zealand. This is the place from where the company as a whole is managed. To determine where a company’s centre of management is, acts of management at various levels may be relevant. • It has its head office in New Zealand. The head office of a company is the office from which the business of the company is conducted. The focus of this test is the physical place where the administration and management of the overall business is directed from and carried out. A company often satisfies more than one, or even all of these tests. Such a company is clearly resident in New Zealand. However, a company need only satisfy one of the four tests to be resident. Tr u s t s The rules of residence for trusts are set out in our Trusts and estates – income tax rules (IR288) guide. www.ird.govt.nz 21 Services you may need Self-service numbers (overseas callers) This service is available to overseas callers seven days a week (but please note we’re closed between 5am and 6am each day, New Zealand local time).

New Zealand tax residence Who is a New Zealand resident for tax purposes? IR292 January 2024 The information in this guide is based on current tax laws at the time of printing. www.ird.govt.nz 1 Introduction The tax residence rules determine whether a person is a New Zealand tax resident. The worldwide income of a New Zealand tax resident is subject to New Zealand tax laws. People who are not New Zealand tax residents (non-residents) are liable for New Zealand tax only on their New Zealand-sourced income. Read on for information about: • tax residence rules for individuals: – who is a resident and who is a non-resident, for tax purposes only – temporary tax exemption on foreign income – what income you’re taxed on as a resident or a non-resident – paying tax as a resident or a non-resident • tax residence rules for non-individuals • where to go for further help. Please read all sections so you can establish whether you’re a tax resident or a non-resident. This guide deals with tax residence rules. These are different from the normal New Zealand immigration residency rules. We have used the words “resident” and “non-resident” in this guide for New Zealand tax purposes only. Note You may need to provide information about your financial accounts in New Zealand and overseas to comply with international obligations. Find out more about: • CRS (Common Reporting Standard) obligations - go to www.ird.govt.nz/crs • FATCA (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act) obligations - go to www.ird.govt.nz/fatca Note NEW ZEALAND TAX RESIDENCE 2 www.ird.govt.nz Go to our website for information and to use our services and tools. • Log in or register for myIR - manage your tax and entitlements online. • Demonstrations - learn about our services by watching short videos. • Get it done online - complete forms and returns, make payments, give us feedback. • Work it out - use our calculators, worksheets and tools, for example, to check your tax code, find filing and payment dates, calculate your student loan repayment. • Forms and guides - download our forms and guides.

You’re a New Zealand tax resident if: • you’ve been in New Zealand for more than 183 days in any 12-month period and haven’t become a non-resident - see page 7, or • you have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand - see below, or • you’re away from New Zealand in the service of the New Zealand government. The 183-day rule If you’ve been in New Zealand for more than 183 days in any 12-month period, you’re considered to be a New Zealand tax resident from the first of the 183 days. The 183 days don’t have to be consecutive. For example, if you come to New Zealand for 10 days in April and then return for 20 days in September of the same year, it will be counted as 30 days. If you’re in New Zealand for part of a day, it’s counted as being a whole day. This means that the days you arrive or depart are treated as “days present” in New Zealand. If you’ve ever been resident in New Zealand under the 183-day rule you remain resident until you become a non- resident - see page 7. A permanent place of abode in New Zealand The Income Tax Act 2007 says that a person, other than a company, who has a “permanent place of abode” in New Zealand is a New Zealand tax resident. To have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand there must be somewhere in New Zealand (ie, a house or other dwelling), where you habitually reside from time to time. Determining this requires an overall assessment of your circumstances and the nature and quality of the use you habitually make of the place of abode. www.ird.govt.nz 5 If you have strong ties to New Zealand it’s likely that you have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. The permanent place of abode test overrides any rules about the number of days you’re out of New Zealand. So you’ll still be tax resident in New Zealand as long as you have a permanent place of abode here, even if you’re gone for more than 325 days. If there’s somewhere in New Zealand you could live, we need to decide whether it’s your permanent place of abode. To do this, we look at all of your circumstances, including the following: Do you have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand? CircumstanceLook at Presence in New Zealand how much time you spend in New Zealand, and whether you’re here continuously or from time to time Accommodationhow you’ve previously used the accomodation you have in New Zealand, and your connection with it, ie, whether you own it, lease it or control it Family and social ties where your family live (especially immediate family) and if you belong to any New Zealand clubs, associations or organisations Economic tiesif you have bank accounts, credit cards, investments, life insurance or superannuation funds here Employment or business if you run a business here, or if you’re employed here, if you have (or may have) employment to return to, the terms of any employment contract Personal propertyif you have vehicles, clothing, furniture and other property or possessions kept here NEW ZEALAND TAX RESIDENCE 6 Intentionswhether you intend to come back to New Zealand to live and if you do, when Benefits, pensions and other payments whether you receive any welfare benefits, pensions or other payments from New Zealand agencies or organisations. This list is a guide only - you’ll need to consider your overall situation when working out whether you’re a New Zealand tax resident. Please note that even if you maintain ties (or even a physical home) in other countries you can still be a New Zealand tax resident. As long as you have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand you’ll always be a resident. Government service If you’re sent away from New Zealand in the service of the government in any capacity, you’re considered to be a tax resident of New Zealand and liable for New Zealand tax on your worldwide income. The length of your absence and whether you have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand doesn’t matter. This rule doesn’t apply to a spouse, partner or children who may be accompanying you. The normal tax residency rules still apply to them. www.ird.govt.nz 7 Double tax agreements (DTAs) You may be a tax resident in both New Zealand and another country. This means that you’re resident in two countries under the tax laws of each of those countries. If both countries tax their residents on worldwide income you could be taxed twice on the same income. Double tax agreements have been negotiated between New Zealand and many other countries to determine what taxing rights each country has. Go to www.ird.govt.nz to look at the latest list of countries that have DTAs with New Zealand. Becoming a non-resident Remember, if you have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand you’ll be a resident for tax purposes. However, if the ties and links described on pages 4-6 suggest you don’t have a permanent place of abode here, you can become a non-resident under the “325-day rule”. The 325-day rule You become a non-resident for tax purposes if: • you don’t have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, and • you’re away from New Zealand for more than 325 days in any 12-month period. The 325 days do not have to be consecutive. If you’re here for only part of a day it’s counted as a whole day. NEW ZEALAND TAX RESIDENCE 8 Paying tax as a resident Your worldwide income is taxed If you’re a New Zealand tax resident you’re taxed on your worldwide income. You must state your income from all sources, including that from overseas, in an Individual tax return (IR3). You’re normally allowed a tax credit for any tax paid overseas so you’ll need to be able to produce records which show the overseas tax you’ve paid. The New Zealand tax year is from 1 April to 31 March of the following year. Unless you get consent from us to use a non-standard balance date you may need to apportion your overseas income to fit the New Zealand tax year. The year you become a tax resident Any person, individual or business required to pay tax in New Zealand will need to apply for an IRD number. Some contractors and entertainers don’t require IRD numbers - see pages 16 and 17. If you haven’t had a personal New Zealand IRD number before, you can apply for one by filling in an IRD number application – individual (IR 595) form. When applying for a personal IRD number you’ll have to go to an Inland Revenue appointed verifier with two specified identification documents. Just follow the instructions on the front of the application form. To apply for an IRD number for a business, trust or other non-individual entity, fill in an IRD number application - non- individual (IR596) form. If you’ve had a New Zealand IRD number before, call us on 0800 227 774 to check it’s still valid. Once you have your IRD number, please have it with you whenever you call us. We calculate tax on any overseas income in accordance with New Zealand tax laws. Our tax laws may be different from the laws of other countries. Note www.ird.govt.nz 9 Temporary tax exemption on foreign income Most types of individual income derived from overseas may be temporarily exempt from tax in New Zealand. This temporary tax exemption is available to people who: • have qualified as a tax resident in New Zealand on or after 1 April 2006, and • are new migrants or returning New Zealanders, who haven’t been resident for tax purposes in New Zealand for at least 10 years before their arrival in New Zealand. The temporary tax exemption for foreign income starts on the first day that you are a tax resident here. It ends 48 months after the month you qualify as a tax resident in New Zealand. This means that the period between your arrival in New Zealand and the date you qualify as a tax resident is also treated as an exempt period. Qualifying for the exemption To be eligible for a temporary tax exemption on foreign income you must: • have qualified as a tax resident in New Zealand on or after 1 April 2006, and • not have been a New Zealand tax resident at any time in the past 10 years before the date you qualified again as a tax resident in New Zealand - see page 4, and • not have been eligible for this tax exemption before (including if you were eligible but chose to waive the exemption), and • not be receiving Working for Families Tax Credits (your spouse or partner must not be receiving them either). Sarah was in New Zealand from 10–14 March 2013. She then moved here on 22 April 2013, and qualified as a tax resident on 16 October 2013. She met the criteria for her foreign income to be temporarily exempt from tax in New Zealand. Her exemption applies from 10 March 2013 until 31 October 2017. Example NEW ZEALAND TAX RESIDENCE 10 This exemption is a one-off, you can’t extend your tax exemption or renew it after its expiry date. There are some types of foreign income that don’t qualify for a temporary tax exemption. The exemption and Working for Families Tax Credits (WfFTC) You can’t receive WfFTC while being tax exempt from foreign income. If you’re eligible for the temporary tax exemption on foreign income and you (or your spouse or partner) are also eligible for WfFTC, you need to decide which option is the best for your situation. If you decide to waive the temporary tax exemption so you can claim WfFTC, you’ll need to show in your Individual tax return (IR3) all the foreign income you received from the date of your arrival in New Zealand. Go to www.ird.govt.nz/wff-tax-credits/ to: • see if you’re eligible • work out how much you may be entitled to • register for WfFTC. For further information about WfFTC you can call us within New Zealand on 0800 227 773 or on +64 4 978 0779 if you’re calling from overseas. How to claim the exemption The tax exemption is automatically granted if you’re eligible. If you qualify for the exemption, you’re not required to tell us about foreign income you receive (except for foreign income that doesn’t qualify for the temporary tax exemption) for the period of your exemption. www.ird.govt.nz 11 Foreign income exempt from tax in New Zealand Types of foreign income which are temporarily exempt from tax in New Zealand: • controlled foreign company (CFC) income that is attributed under New Zealand’s CFC rules • foreign investment fund (FIF) income that is attributed under New Zealand’s FIF rules (including foreign superannuation) • non-resident withholding tax (eg, on foreign mortgages) • income arising from the exercise of foreign employee share options • accrual income (from foreign financial arrangements) • income from foreign trusts • rental income derived offshore • foreign dividends • foreign interest • royalties derived offshore • income from employment performed overseas before coming to New Zealand, such as bonus payments • gains on the sale of property derived offshore (held on revenue account) • offshore business income (that is not related to the performance of services). Foreign income taxed in New Zealand The foreign income that will continue to be taxed in New Zealand is: • employment income from overseas employment performed while living in New Zealand, and • business income relating to services performed offshore. If you receive any non-exempt types of foreign income from the date of your arrival back in New Zealand, you’ll need to show this income in your Individual tax return (IR3), even if you qualify for a temporary tax exemption on other types of foreign income. NEW ZEALAND TAX RESIDENCE 12 After the exemption has ended When your temporary tax exemption ends, you need to include all your foreign income (received since your exemption ended) in your IR3, along with your New Zealand income. You’re required to file an IR3 after the end of your exemption and every tax year after that, as long as you have foreign income (regardless of whether or not you told us of your foreign income when you arrived in New Zealand). New Zealand’s tax year runs from 1 April to 31 March. If your exemption ends at any time in a tax year other than on the standard balance day of 31 March, you’ll need to apportion your foreign income received for that year in your IR3. For more information Go to www.ird.govt.nz for more about: • the temporary tax exemption on foreign income • filing an Individual tax return (IR3). You can also call us within New Zealand on 0800 227 774 or on +64 4 978 0779 if you’re calling from overseas. Sam qualified as a tax resident in New Zealand on 10 September 2007 and met the criteria for his foreign income to be temporarily exempt from tax in New Zealand from 10 September 2007 until 30 September 2011. Sam’s exemption ends in the middle of a standard New Zealand tax year and he will continue to receive foreign income after his exemption ends (on 30 September 2011). On his tax return for the year ending 31 March 2012 (the tax year that his exemption ended in), Sam has to show the foreign income he received from 1 October 2011 to 31 March 2012. Example www.ird.govt.nz 13 The year you cease to be a tax resident If you’re leaving New Zealand, or have left New Zealand, you can use the information on our website or speak with your tax agent to determine if you’re a New Zealand tax resident. Or, if you would like our view, you can fill in a New Zealand tax residence questionnaire (IR886). We’ll then advise you about your tax residence status and if you have any future New Zealand tax responsibilities. If you’ll no longer be a tax resident and won’t be receiving income from New Zealand from the date you leave, you may need to complete an Individual tax return (IR3) up to the date of your departure. You can file your IR3 before the end of the tax year. Include any income you received from all sources up to the date you leave New Zealand. Send your IR3 to the appropriate Inland Revenue address below before you leave. Inland Revenue PO Box 39090 Wellington Mail Centre Lower Hutt 5045 For returns with payments Inland Revenue PO Box 39050 Wellington Mail Centre Lower Hutt 5045 If you qualify for a refund or want a statement of account, we’ll send it as soon as possible. Please make sure we have your overseas address. If you’ll be receiving income from New Zealand after you’re no longer a tax resident, you’ll have to pay tax as a non- resident - see page 15. Please provide us with full details of: – your overseas address – the date you left or intend to leave New Zealand – the length of time you intend to be away. NEW ZEALAND TAX RESIDENCE 14 You can authorise another person in New Zealand to help with your tax affairs. See page 19 for more information on setting up a nominated person. If you’ll be receiving income from New Zealand after you’re no longer a tax resident, you must file an Individual tax return (IR3) to the end of the tax year (31 March) following your departure. Include your worldwide income received until the date you left and your New Zealand income received after that date. Please clearly show the breakdown of income received before and after your departure. www.ird.govt.nz 15 Paying tax as a non-resident If you’re a non-resident you’re taxed only on income you receive from a New Zealand source. If your only income from New Zealand is interest, dividends or royalties, and the correct amount of NRWT (non-resident withholding tax) is deducted, you won’t need to file a non-resident return. Please give your bank or other financial institution your overseas address and tell them you’re a non-resident for tax purposes to ensure the correct amount of NRWT is deducted. There’s a limited exception to paying NRWT on interest. If the payer of your interest pays approved issuer levy, NRWT isn’t deducted from your interest. For further information please read our NRWT (Non-resident withholding tax) – payer’s guide (IR 291) and Approved issuer levy (IR395) guide. If you receive any other income such as rental, business or farming income, it is subject to New Zealand tax at the normal rates and you’ll be required to file a Non-resident individual taxpayers (IR3NR) return. Complete an IR3NR if you’re a non-resident for the full year and you have continuing income from New Zealand. We’ll send you an IR3NR taxpack each year, so make sure we have your current address while you’re away. Please file only one return for any income year. Also note, we can’t accept non-resident returns in any sort of electronic format such as email.

The Recognised Seasonal Employer (RSE) scheme facilitates the temporary entry of additional workers from overseas to plant, maintain, harvest and pack crops for a limited period. The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment administers the RSE scheme. If you’re a recognised seasonal worker under the RSE scheme you’re a non-resident for New Zealand tax purposes but will have to pay New Zealand tax on your New Zealand income. Your employer will deduct tax, including ACC levies, at a flat PAYE rate. You won’t have to pay any further tax or have a refund to claim, and in most cases, you won’t have to file an end-of-year tax return. You need to use the NSW (non-resident seasonal worker) tax code on your Tax code declarations (IR330). Non-resident contractors and entertainers There are special rules for non-resident contractors and non-resident entertainers who earn income from New Zealand. Please contact one of our specialist teams for more information.

If you do need to complete an IR 3, include your New Zealand income earned while overseas and your worldwide income received after the date of your arrival for the income year.

NEW ZEALAND TAX RESIDENCE 18 Student loan borrowers going overseas If you’re away from New Zealand six months or more (184 or more consecutive days), you’ll need to contact us and let us know.

If you qualify, you won’t have to make any repayments in that time. But we’ll continue to charge interest. You’ll need to apply for a repayment holiday before you leave New Zealand or within six months (183 days) of leaving and provide an alternative contact person who is resident in New Zealand. You may still qualify for an interest-free loan if one of the following applies. You: • are studying overseas • are living in Niue, Cook Islands, Tokelau or Ross Dependency • are working overseas for the New Zealand Government • are working overseas because your New Zealand employer requires this • are working as a volunteer overseas • are accompanying your partner overseas • have an unexpected delay returning to New Zealand • have an unplanned absence.

Your nominated person will be able to check your records including your tax status and make any other enquiries on your behalf. They can also receive your statements, refunds and other correspondence. But remember, you’ll still have overall responsibility for meeting your obligations, including filing returns and making payments by the due date. For more information or to nominate someone to act on your behalf: • complete an Elect someone to act on your behalf (IR597) form, or • call us on 0800 227 774. Remember to have your IRD number with you. To nominate someone to act on your behalf, you’ll need to know: • the full name of the nominated person and their IRD number (if possible) • the tax types the nominated person is to have authority to act on • the length of time you want the nominated person to act for you. NEW ZEALAND TAX RESIDENCE 20 Tax residence rules for non-individuals There are different tax residence rules for non-individual taxpayers. Companies A company is a resident in New Zealand if it meets any one of the following criteria: • It is incorporated in New Zealand. A company which is incorporated under the New Zealand Companies Act 1993 is resident in New Zealand. • Its directors exercise control in New Zealand. Those acting in their capacity as directors control the company here, whether decision-making by directors is confined to New Zealand or not. • It has its centre of management in New Zealand. This is the place from where the company as a whole is managed. To determine where a company’s centre of management is, acts of management at various levels may be relevant. • It has its head office in New Zealand. The head office of a company is the office from which the business of the company is conducted. The focus of this test is the physical place where the administration and management of the overall business is directed from and carried out. A company often satisfies more than one, or even all of these tests. Such a company is clearly resident in New Zealand. However, a company need only satisfy one of the four tests to be resident. Tr u s t s The rules of residence for trusts are set out in our Trusts and estates – income tax rules (IR288) guide. www.ird.govt.nz 21 Services you may need Self-service numbers (overseas callers) This service is available to overseas callers seven days a week (but please note we’re closed between 5am and 6am each day, New Zealand local time).

How to get our forms and guides You can get copies of our forms and guides at ird.govt.nz/forms-guides ird.govt.nz3 Introduction If you are visiting New Zealand, read this guide to learn about your tax responsibilities. The tax residence rules are different from the New Zealand immigration and residency rules. We've used the words "visitor", "resident" and "non-resident" in this guide for New Zealand tax purposes only. Part 1 summarises New Zealand's major taxes and explains how they apply to New Zealand residents and visitors. Part 2 is about different types of visitors to New Zealand and explains the taxes and exemptions that apply to them. This guide is not for people who are living overseas and earning income from New Zealand, or people who are considering emigrating to New Zealand. For more information on these subjects, see either of the following publications: • New Zealand tax residence - IR292 • Taxes and duties - IR295. If New Zealand has a double tax agreement (DTA) with your country (see page 10), that agreement may override some of the rules explained in this guide. If you plan to earn income while you are in New Zealand you may want to check the terms of the DTA with your country. Note The information in this guide is based on tax laws current at the time of printing. VISITOR’S TAX GUIDE4 myIR You can manage your tax and entitlements online with a myIR account.

Income tax The following information on income tax applies to people who are New Zealand tax residents and visitors. Some visitors may qualify for exemptions - see Part 2 of this guide. If you do not qualify for an exemption, you’ll have to pay New Zealand income tax on your New Zealand income. Who is a New Zealand tax resident? If you're a visitor to New Zealand, you'll be tax resident here if: • you've been in New Zealand for more than 183 days in any 12-month period and have not become a non-resident again, or • you have a "permanent place of abode" in New Zealand. You can read more about tax residency rules in our guide New Zealand tax residence - IR292. What is taxable income? In New Zealand, these types of income are all subject to income tax: • salary and wages • business and self-employed income • most social security benefits • income from investments • rental income • profit from selling capital assets in some circumstances (this does not usually apply to personal assets sold), and • income a New Zealand tax resident earns from overseas. There is no tax on cash or personal assets you bring into New Zealand. If your only income is from your salary or wages (and you do not have any allowable expenses, for example, income protection insurance) your net income will be your annual salary or wages before tax. ird.govt.nz7 If you invest capital in New Zealand, the income (usually interest, dividends or rent) from the investment will be taxable. Profits from selling assets can be taxable in some circumstances. For example, if you buy a property with the intention of selling it, the profit is likely to be taxable. Under the bright-line test, any profit on the sale of a residential property may be taxable if it is sold within a set period of time (the bright-line period). This applies no matter what your intention was at the time you bought it. For residential property sold on or after 1 July 2024, the bright-line test looks at whether your bright-line end date (usually the date you entered into a binding sale and purchase agreement to sell) is within 2 years of your bright-line start date (usually the date the property’s title is transferred to you). For residential property sold before 1 July 2024, your profit may be taxable if it was acquired on or after 29 March 2018 and is sold within 5 years. Generally, a property will not be taxable under the bright-line test if it has been your main home and your use meets certain criteria, it is an inherited property, or it is being transferred as part of a relationship property agreement. Rollover relief also applies to certain types of other ownership transfers. For more detailed information about the bright-line test, go to ird.govt.nz/bright- line or read our Bright-line property tax – IR1229 guide. If you’re an offshore residential land withholding tax (RLWT) person and sell a residential property located in New Zealand within the bright-line period, then you may have RLWT deducted. For more information go to ird.govt.nz/rlwt New Zealand residents must pay income tax on their worldwide income, even if they do not bring it into New Zealand. However, if their overseas income has already had tax deducted from it overseas, they will generally be able to claim a credit for this overseas tax against the New Zealand income tax on the overseas income. The amount of credit they can claim is limited to the lesser of the overseas tax paid or the New Zealand income tax payable on the overseas income. The amount of tax you pay depends on how much you earn in a year. To find out the income tax rates go to ird.govt.nz/tax-rates VISITOR’S TAX GUIDE8 If your income is between $24,000 and $48,000 you may be able to reduce the amount of tax you pay if you’re entitled to the independent earner tax credit (IETC). You will not qualify if you receive certain types of income or payments, such as a main benefit, NZ Superannuation or Working for Families payments. If you are eligible for the IETC you can let your employer know by selecting either the ME or ME SL tax code on the Tax code declaration - IR330 form. Find out more about the IETC at ird.govt.nz/ietc If you're a tax resident you can claim a tax credit for donations using a Tax credit claim form - IR526. You'll need to attach receipts to claim a tax credit. IRD numbers Any person, individual or business required to pay tax in New Zealand needs an IRD number. Some contractors and entertainers do not require IRD numbers. For information about applying for a certificate of exemption see page 14 and non- resident entertainers see page 18. Before applying for an IRD number If you do not have a New Zealand IRD number and you: • are not a New Zealand citizen • do not have a New Zealand residence class visa granted by Immigration New Zealand (whether you're in New Zealand or not when applying for your IRD number) • are a New Zealand citizen who has been out of New Zealand for the last three years or more continuously and you're still not in New Zealand • have a New Zealand residence class visa and have been out of New Zealand for the last 12 months or more continuously and you're still not in New Zealand, you'll need proof that you have either: • a fully functional New Zealand bank account, • had customer due diligence completed by a New Zealand reporting entity before applying for your IRD number, or • otherwise satisfies the Commissioner of their identity and background. When you are ready to apply for an IRD number, complete the IRD number application - non-resident/offshore individual (IR742) form. The form explains what additional documents you need to provide with your application. ird.govt.nz9 If you have an Australian passport and are in New Zealand at the time you're applying for your IRD number, you'll be considered a New Zealand resident and will need to complete the IRD number application - resident individual - IR595 form. For more information on applying for an individual IRD number go to ird.govt.nz/new-ird-number Note To apply for an IRD number for a business, trust or other non-individual, complete an IRD number application - non-resident/offshore non-individual - IR744 form or an IRD number application - resident non-individual - IR596 form. The information on the forms will help you decide which 1 to use. If you've had a New Zealand IRD number before, call us on 0800 227 774 to check it's still valid. When you've received your IRD number, have it handy whenever you call us. KiwiSaver KiwiSaver is a voluntary savings initiative designed to make it easier for New Zealanders to save for their future. For most people, KiwiSaver is work-based. This means they receive information about KiwiSaver from their employer, and their KiwiSaver contributions come straight out of their pay. Eligibility KiwiSaver is open to all New Zealand citizens and people entitled to be in New Zealand indefinitely who are under the age of eligibility for New Zealand superannuation (currently 65). A person needs to be living (or normally living) in New Zealand to join. Visitors to New Zealand and non-residents are not eligible to join. If you’re working and your employer starts deducting KiwiSaver contributions from your salary or wages, you should inform your employer that you’re not eligible to join. Your employer will then advise us they have made an error in deducting contributions and we’ll arrange to refund any contributions already sent to us. VISITOR’S TAX GUIDE10 Tax returns If you're a visitor to New Zealand, in most cases, the tax you pay is a final tax. The amount deducted from your salary or wages is called PAYE (pay as you earn). Your employer pays PAYE to us on your behalf. It includes an Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) earners' levy. This means if you have an accident and injure yourself while you're in New Zealand, you'll get medical and hospital treatment without having to pay all the costs. You will receive an Income tax assessment or be required to complete an Individual tax return - IR3 at the end of the tax year, depending on your situation. New Zealand's tax year is from 1 April to 31 March. Double tax agreements (DTAs) You may be a tax resident in both New Zealand and another country. This means you're resident in 2 countries under the tax laws of each of those countries. If both countries tax their residents on worldwide income you could be taxed twice on the same income. For more information about DTAs contact our Non-resident Contractors Team if you're a contractor and for all other enquiries see page 22 for contact details. Note Double tax agreements have been negotiated between New Zealand and many other countries to decide which country has the first or sole right to tax specific types of income. You can go to taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/international/tax-treaties to look at the latest list of countries that have DTAs with New Zealand. Accident compensation New Zealand has an accident insurance scheme designed to cover the costs of all work and non-work accidents. The Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) administers this scheme. Levies for cover are paid by employers and self-employed people direct to ACC. We collect employees' levies on behalf of ACC as part of the PAYE system. ird.govt.nz11 GST (goods and services tax) GST is New Zealand's main type of tax apart from income tax. It's an indirect tax, which businesses (including retailers) charge as part of the cost of goods and services they supply. The current rate is 15%. When a business buys goods or services from its suppliers, it can claim a credit for the GST the suppliers charge on these purchases. However, consumers cannot claim a deduction for GST in this way. The result of this is the final consumer of any product or service pays 15% GST on its cost. GST is charged on almost all goods and services supplied in New Zealand. The GST exceptions include rental of residential property, financial services such as mortgages, loans and investments and the sale of a business that is capable of being carried on by the purchaser as a taxable activity (going concern). A visitor to New Zealand must pay GST on any goods or services bought here in the same way as a New Zealand resident pays GST. There is no exemption because the person is a visitor. Goods exported from New Zealand When goods are exported from New Zealand by a supplier, the supply can be zero-rated (for example, GST is charged at 0%). For example, if a person in New Zealand pays for goods and arranges for the supplier to export them, the supply can be zero-rated, provided the goods are exported without the purchaser taking possession of them in New Zealand. If the purchaser receives the goods while they are still in New Zealand, then leaves the country with the goods, GST must be charged at the normal 15%. Suppliers who are licensed exporters (for example, some duty-free shops) can arrange to export goods for a purchaser and zero-rate the supply. The supplier can also arrange to deliver the goods to the purchaser at the departure airport, after the purchaser has passed through Customs on the way out of New Zealand. If the goods are delivered to the Customs-controlled area of an airport and given to a purchaser who has already been through Customs, this counts as an export, and the supply is zero-rated. Goods imported into New Zealand When goods are imported into New Zealand for sale they're liable for GST. New Zealand Customs collects GST on these goods. For more information about GST on imported goods, call New Zealand Customs on 0800 428 786. VISITOR’S TAX GUIDE12 Running a business in New Zealand If you're running a business in New Zealand you may have to register for GST, and charge GST on your sales or supplies. For more information, see our factsheet GST - do you need to register? - IR365. NRWT (non-resident withholding tax) If you're a non-resident for income tax purposes, make sure you give your overseas address to all the organisations in New Zealand you receive interest, dividends and royalties from. NRWT may be deducted from this New Zealand income before you receive it. The rate of NRWT deducted depends on whether New Zealand has a double tax agreement (DTA) with your country of residence (see page 10), and the terms of that DTA. Normally, your overseas country of residence will let you claim a credit for the tax deducted from your New Zealand income. The rate of NRWT can vary according to the country you live in. The types of income and the rates of NRWT are: • dividends 0-30% • interest 10-15% • royalties 10-15%. For information on NRWT rates applying to countries we have a DTA with, go to ird.govt.nz/nrwt If you have a joint account with a New Zealand resident for income tax, RWT will be deducted from the interest at the standard rate. You will need to file an IR3NR return to claim a refund. If you have any further questions about NRWT, see page 22 for contact details. Other taxes and duties There are a number of other types of taxes and duties in New Zealand. These do not usually affect visitors who will either not pay them or pay them as part of the cost of buying some goods. New Zealand does not have any separate social security deductions. These types of benefits are funded through normal income tax and other taxes collected by the government. ird.govt.nz13 Part 2 - Different types of visitors This part explains how income tax applies to different visitors to New Zealand. If you're a New Zealand resident for tax purposes, income tax will apply to you - see pages 6 to 8 for details. If none of the following types apply to you, you'll have to pay New Zealand income tax on your New Zealand income, even if you're not a New Zealand tax resident. You'll also be liable for accident compensation levies - see page 10. If New Zealand has a double tax agreement (DTA) with your country (see page 10) that agreement may override some of the following rules. If you earn income while you're in New Zealand you may want to check the terms of the DTA with your country. GST applies to visitors and New Zealand residents in the same way - see page 11. Tourists A tourist will only become a New Zealand tax resident by being here for more than 183 days in any 12-month period. If you're not a New Zealand tax resident, any New Zealand interest, dividends or royalties you earn while you're here will only have NRWT deducted - see page 12. Tourists have to pay GST on their New Zealand purchases. If tourists work here, salary and wages earned are subject to New Zealand income tax. See the following section on non-resident employees. Non-resident employees If you're not a New Zealand tax resident but you are employed here, your wages or salary will be taxable in New Zealand, unless the following exemptions apply. If your country has a double tax agreement (DTA) with New Zealand Your employment income may be exempt from New Zealand income tax if all these conditions are met: • You're in New Zealand for 183 days or less in any 12-month period. • Your employer is not resident in New Zealand and does not have a permanent establishment or fixed base here. • Your employer cannot claim a tax deduction in New Zealand for the cost of your salary or wages. VISITOR’S TAX GUIDE14 Conditions vary between DTAs. Check your country's DTA for more information - see page 10. If your country has no DTA with New Zealand The income you receive from performing personal or professional services in New Zealand will be exempt from New Zealand income tax if all these conditions are met: • You're in New Zealand for 92 days or less in any 12-month period. The date of arrival and departure is treated as being in New Zealand for the whole day. • Your New Zealand income is taxable in your own country. • The services you perform are on behalf of a person who is not resident in New Zealand. For visits starting before 1 April 2017 you could be in New Zealand for 92 days or less in the tax year. Note Non-resident contractors This section applies to any non-resident individual who performs services in New Zealand as a self-employed person. This also includes non-resident companies receiving contract payments in New Zealand. It does not apply to employees (see above) or to sportspeople or entertainers - see page 16. Some individuals who come to New Zealand are shareholder-employees of non- resident companies. Contract payments to the company will be subject to tax unless they have a certificate of exemption. Certificate of exemption If you come from a country that has a DTA with New Zealand you may be entitled to a reduction of tax if you have a current certificate of exemption or a zero-rated tailored tax rate certificate. To apply for an exemption you need to complete a Non-resident contractors' tax (NRCT) certificate of exemption application form - IR197. Download the IR197 at ird.govt.nz/forms-guides For information on exemptions, contact our Non-resident Contractors Team - see page 22. ird.govt.nz15 Non-resident contractors tax If you're under contract to complete an activity or service in New Zealand, the contract payer must deduct non-resident contractors' tax (NRCT) from the payments made to you under the terms of the contract. NRCT is deducted at the rate of 15% if you have an IRD number and have completed a Tax rate notification for contractors - IR330C form. If you do not supply an IRD number or an IR330C, the rate increases to 20% for companies or 45% for individuals. 92-day rule You do not have to apply for a certificate of exemption from NRCT if either of the following conditions applies to you: • You come from a country that has a DTA with New Zealand, and you're eligible for total New Zealand tax relief under that agreement, and you're present in New Zealand for a total of 92 days or less in any 12-month period. • The total contract payments you receive as a non-resident contractor from all your payers is $15,000 or less in a 12-month period. This measure does not remove any New Zealand tax the non-resident contractor may have to pay, just the obligation on the payer to deduct tax at the time of payment. If you get a certificate of exemption from NRCT or the 92-day rule applies, you will not have to file a tax return in New Zealand, but you'll still have to declare this New Zealand income in your country of residence. Your tax obligations NRCT is tax paid during the year to offset the total tax payable on your annual income, which will be determined when you complete a return at the end of the New Zealand tax year (31 March) or when you leave New Zealand. Tailored tax rate certificate Non-resident contractors with tax to pay in New Zealand can apply for a tailored tax rate certificate if their profit is higher or lower than allowed for under the tax rate for schedular payments. Schedular payments are made to contractors involved in specified types of work. A list of the activities and tax rates for schedular payments is on the back of the Tax rate notification of contractors - IR330C form. For information about tailored tax rate certificates and how to apply for one, contact our Non-resident Contractors Team - see page 22. VISITOR’S TAX GUIDE16 Tax credits You're entitled to claim any income tax paid in New Zealand as a tax credit in your home country, subject to any legislative restrictions in your home country. For further information about your tax obligations as a non-resident contractor please contact our Non-resident Contractors Team. Accident compensation levies As a self-employed person you're liable for accident compensation levies on your New Zealand income. For details - see page 10. Non-resident entertainers and sportspeople Non-resident entertainers are those who perform in public or in front of a camera. For example: • actors, entertainers, musicians, singers, dancers, comperes or other artists, whether alone or in a group • lecturers and speakers, whether on a casual or regular basis. A non-resident entertainer can be an individual, company, partnership, trust or any other entity. An example of a non-resident sportsperson is an athlete competing in any sporting event or game. If you're a person who works behind the scenes, for example, crew or directors, you'd be a contractor, not an entertainer. Tax If you're an entertainer or sportsperson performing in New Zealand you must pay tax of 20 cents in each dollar paid to you or any person on your behalf. This is a full and final tax. You do not have to complete a tax return, although you can if you want to claim expenses. Tax is payable even when payment to you is made outside New Zealand. If you're an entertainer, the person paying you will deduct tax from your fees. If the tax is not deducted, you become liable for paying this. ird.govt.nz17 IRD numbers You only need an IRD number if you: • choose to complete and send in a tax return • are liable for deducting tax for other entertainers you employ. Exemptions There are some situations where visitors can apply for a tax exemption. The table below shows some examples. EntertainersIf you're an entertainer and you perform: • in an event under a cultural programme of, or wholly or partially sponsored by, any overseas government or the Government of New Zealand; or • in New Zealand under a programme of a foreign non-profit organisation that promotes a cultural activity. SportspeopleIf you're a sportsperson and represent the national body that administers the game or sport in your home country. United States residents If you're a US resident and you perform in New Zealand and receive fees of not more than US$10,000 in our tax year. If the fees paid, including reimbursements or expenses incurred on your behalf, are more than US$10,000 the entire payment will be considered a schedular payment which is subject to tax. For more information on exemptions, contact our Non-resident Entertainers Team - see page 22. GST (goods and services tax) Generally, non-resident entertainers will not need to register for GST. There are some exceptions. For example, you must register for GST if: • you make supplies in New Zealand as a sole trader or on an ad hoc basis, and receive income in New Zealand over NZ$60,000 in any 12-month period • you supply services to a non-GST registered person and your fees for services in New Zealand are over NZ$60,000 • you stay in New Zealand for more than 183 days in any 12-month period, become a resident, and your income is over NZ$60,000. VISITOR’S TAX GUIDE18 Non-resident Entertainers Team The Non-resident Entertainers Team oversees tax compliance for large events such as the Rugby World Cup and other international sports tournaments. They have: • general information for non-resident entertainers, promoters and agents • information to help visiting participants, officials, media, or those providing services such as sponsorship, entertainment, marketing or equipment. For more help contact our Non-resident Entertainers Team - see page 22. Experts and students visiting under an arrangement with the New Zealand Government This exemption applies to people who are performing any of the following activities in New Zealand, under an arrangement with the New Zealand Government: • providing professional or expert advice or assistance • teaching or lecturing • making investigations • receiving education, training or experience. These people are exempt from paying New Zealand income tax if they have the following income: • payment for personal or professional services carried out in New Zealand on behalf of an overseas employer, and/or • any maintenance, allowance, scholarship or bursary received while in New Zealand. If you qualify for the exemption, you must still pay New Zealand income tax on any other New Zealand-sourced income, such as interest from a bank account. ird.govt.nz19 Teachers and students Many of New Zealand's double tax agreements (DTAs) exempt visiting teachers and students from income tax on their New Zealand income. The exact conditions depend on whether or not there is an exemption in the DTA. Check your country's DTA for more information - see page 10. If there is no exemption in the DTA, the rules under "Non-resident employees" on page 13 will apply. Fijian teacher in New Zealand A teacher who is a Fijian resident visits New Zealand for less than 2 years to teach here. The teacher is taxed in Fiji on the New Zealand teaching income, so that income is not taxable in New Zealand. However, the teacher must still pay tax in New Zealand on any other New Zealand-earned income. Example 1 Australian student in New Zealand An Australian student visiting New Zealand receives payments from Australia to help with their maintenance and education. The student does not have to pay New Zealand income tax on these payments, but the student is taxed here on any other New Zealand income which they earn. Example 2 Although a visiting teacher or student may be exempt from New Zealand income tax, if that person is paid by a New Zealand employer (such as the New Zealand Ministry of Education), tax will often still be deducted on a pay as you earn (PAYE) basis. This is because the New Zealand employer cannot be certain at the start of the visit how long the person will be here. When the teacher or student leaves New Zealand, and they were here for less than the allowable time (which makes them exempt from New Zealand income tax), they can file a tax return here to get a refund of the PAYE deducted. VISITOR’S TAX GUIDE20 Foreign consular and diplomatic staff Overseas diplomats aren't liable for income tax on their diplomatic salaries or any other income from outside New Zealand. But, any interest or dividends earned from New Zealand are liable for tax in these situations: • If a diplomat is in New Zealand for 183 days or less in any 12-month period, they're not a New Zealand resident for tax purposes. Any interest or dividends earned are subject to NRWT (non-resident withholding tax). • If the diplomat is here for more than 183 days in any 12 months, they're a New Zealand resident for tax purposes. Any interest or dividends earned are subject to RWT. However, DTA provisions may come into effect. For any enquiries see page 22 for contact details. Recognised seasonal employer scheme The horticulture and viticulture industries often have a shortage of local workers. The Recognised Seasonal Employer (RSE) scheme facilitates the temporary entry of additional workers from overseas to plant, maintain, harvest and pack crops for a limited period. The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) administers the RSE scheme. If you're a recognised seasonal worker under the RSE scheme you're a non-resident for New Zealand tax purposes but will have to pay New Zealand tax on your New Zealand income. Your employer will deduct tax, including ACC levies, at a flat PAYE rate. You will not have to pay any further tax or have a refund to claim, and in most cases, you will not have to file an end-of-year tax return. Non-resident GST business claimants Non-resident businesses that do not carry out a taxable activity in New Zealand, but receive goods or services here, may be able to register for and claim GST.

We've written it mainly for new residents and potential immigrants to New Zealand. We also explain the following social assistance programmes that we administer: •Child support - money paid by a parent not living with their children to help support their children financially. •Working for Families Tax Credits - an entitlement for families with dependent children aged 18 and under. This guide deals with tax residence rules only. The tax residence rules are different from the usual New Zealand immigration and residency rules. When we refer to a "New Zealand resident" or a "non-resident", we mean a New Zealand resident or non-resident for tax purposes. Note On page 22 you'll find a list of other publications for more detailed information about the topics covered in this guide. The information in this guide is based on current tax laws at the time of printing. TAXES AND DUTIES 5 Part 1 - General information New Zealand's tax system Everyone in New Zealand must pay their share of tax. This is how the government funds public services such as education, healthcare, roads and welfare. Almost all New Zealanders contribute to these services through the taxes they are required to pay by law. New Zealand residents pay income tax in New Zealand on their worldwide income. If you're a New Zealand resident, most of the income you receive will be subject to tax. This includes income from personal effort, investments, benefits, pensions and overseas. New Zealand also has a goods and services tax (GST), which is included in the price you pay for most goods and services. New Zealand doesn't have a capital gains tax, but profits from selling some assets can be taxable in some circumstances. There's no tax on cash or personal assets you bring into New Zealand. Inland Revenue is the main government department that administers tax laws and collects tax payments. New Zealand Customs also collects some taxes and duties on imported goods. New Zealand's tax system relies on people's honesty in complying with the tax laws. It's important you understand your tax responsibilities, to avoid being penalised. Tax residence The residence rules set out in tax law is different from the normal citizenship rules. Having New Zealand citizenship or permanent residence doesn't necessarily mean you're a resident for tax purposes. On the other hand, you could be a resident for tax purposes, but not hold citizenship here. As an individual, you're a New Zealand resident for tax purposes if you meet any of these conditions: •You've been in New Zealand for more than 183 days in any 12-month period and haven't become a non-resident (refer to page 11). •You have a "permanent place of abode" in New Zealand. •You're away from New Zealand in the service of the New Zealand government. 6 www.ird.govt.nz The 183-day rule If you've been in New Zealand for more than 183 days in any 12-month period, you're considered to be a New Zealand tax resident from the first of those 183 days. The 183 days don't have to be consecutive. For example, if you come to New Zealand for 10 days in April and then return for 20 days in September of the same year, that's counted as 30 days. If you're in New Zealand for part of a day, it's counted as being a whole day. This means that the days you arrive or depart are treated as days present in New Zealand. If you've ever been resident in New Zealand under the 183-day rule you remain resident until you become a non-resident (refer to page 11). A permanent place of abode in New Zealand The Income Tax Act 2007 says that a person, other than a company, who has a "permanent place of abode" in New Zealand is a New Zealand tax resident. To have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand there must be somewhere in New Zealand you could live (ie, a house or other dwelling). If there is somewhere in New Zealand you could live, all of your ties and links with New Zealand need to be considered. If you have strong ties to New Zealand it's likely that you have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. A number of ties need to be considered - the table on the following page has more information. If there is somewhere in New Zealand you could live, it's necessary to decide whether it's your permanent place of abode. TAXES AND DUTIES 7 To decide you need to consider all of your circumstances. Do you have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand? CircumstanceLook at Presence in New Zealand how much time you spend in New Zealand, and whether you're here continuously or from time to time Accommodation how you've previously used the accommodation you have in New Zealand, and your connection with it, ie, whether you own it, lease it or control it Family and social ties where your family live (especially immediate family) and if you belong to any New Zealand clubs, associations or organisations Economic ties if you have bank accounts, credit cards, investments, life insurance or superannuation funds here Employment or business if you run a business or you're employed here, if you have (or may have) employment to return to, the terms of any employment contract Personal property if you have vehicles, clothing, furniture or other property or possessions kept here Intentions whether you intend to come back to New Zealand to live, and if you do, when Benefits, pensions and other payments whether you receive any welfare benefits, pensions or other payments from a New Zealand agency or organisation This list is a guide only - you’ll need to consider your overall situation when working out whether you’re a New Zealand tax resident. Please note that even if you maintain ties (or even a physical home) in other countries, you can still be a New Zealand tax resident. As long as you have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand you'll always be a resident. This test overrides any rules about the number of days you're here. If you're a New Zealand tax resident and also a tax resident of another country under that country's tax laws, it's possible that you could be taxed twice on the same income. To avoid this, New Zealand has double tax agreements with many other countries. These agreements are explained on page 12. 8 www.ird.govt.nz Paying tax as a resident If you're a New Zealand resident you're taxed on your worldwide income. In your first New Zealand tax return you must include your worldwide income from all sources from the date you arrived in New Zealand. You're normally allowed a credit for any tax paid overseas, up to the amount of New Zealand income tax payable on that overseas income. To claim a credit you'll need to be able to produce records that show the overseas tax you've paid. In New Zealand the tax on each person’s income is calculated separately. For example, there are no joint assessments for a husband, wife or partner. Note Temporary tax exemption on foreign income Most types of individual income derived from overseas may be temporarily exempt from tax in New Zealand. This temporary tax exemption is available to people who: •qualify as a tax resident in New Zealand on or after 1 April 2006, and •are new migrants or returning New Zealanders who have not been resident for tax purposes in New Zealand for at least 10 years prior to their arrival in New Zealand. The temporary tax exemption for foreign income starts on the first day that you are a tax resident here. It ends 48 months after the month you qualify as a tax resident in New Zealand. Sarah was in New Zealand from 10 to 14 March 2016. She then moved here on 22 April 2016, and qualified as a tax resident on 16 October 2016. She met the criteria for her foreign income to be temporarily exempt from tax in New Zealand. Sarah’s exemption applies from 10 March 2016 until 31 October 2020. Example Qualifying for the exemption To be eligible for a temporary tax exemption on foreign income you must: •have qualified as a tax resident in New Zealand on or after 1 April 2006 •not have been a New Zealand tax resident at any time in the past 10 years before you qualified again as a tax resident in New Zealand (page 5 has information about New Zealand tax residence) •not have been eligible for this tax exemption before (including if you were eligible but chose to waive the exemption), and •not be receiving Working for Families Tax Credits (your spouse or partner must not be receiving them either). TAXES AND DUTIES 9 The exemption can only be granted once in a lifetime - you can't extend your tax exemption or renew it after its expiry date. There are some types of foreign income that don't qualify for a temporary tax exemption (refer to page 10). The exemption and Working for Families Tax Credits You can't receive Working for Families Tax Credits while being tax exempt from foreign income. If you're eligible for the temporary tax exemption on foreign income and you (or your spouse or partner) are also eligible for Working for Families Tax Credits, you need to decide which option is the best for your situation. If you decide to waive the temporary tax exemption so you can claim Working for Families Tax Credits, you'll need to show, in your Individual tax return (IR3), all the foreign income you received from the date of your arrival in New Zealand. Go to page 19 for information about Working for Families Tax Credits. How to claim the exemption The tax exemption is automatically granted if you're eligible. If you qualify for the exemption, you're not required to tell us about foreign income you receive (except for foreign income that doesn't qualify for the temporary tax exemption) for the period that your exemption applies. To contact us, call us within New Zealand on 0800 227 774, or on +64 4 978 0779 if you're calling from overseas. The types of foreign income temporarily exempt from tax in New Zealand are, for example: •controlled foreign company (CFC) income that is attributed under New Zealand's CFC rules •foreign investment fund (FIF) income that is attributed under New Zealand's FIF rules (including foreign superannuation) •non-resident withholding tax (eg, on foreign mortgages) •approved issuer levy (eg, on foreign mortgages) •income arising from the exercise of foreign employee share options •accrual income (from foreign financial arrangements) •income from foreign trusts •rental income derived offshore •foreign dividends •foreign interest •royalties derived offshore •income from employment performed overseas before coming to New Zealand, such as bonus payments 10 www.ird.govt.nz •gains on the sale of property derived offshore (held on revenue account) •offshore business income (that is unrelated to the performance of services). The foreign income that will continue to be taxed in New Zealand is: •employment income from overseas employment performed while living in New Zealand, and •business income relating to services performed offshore. If you receive non-exempt types of foreign income from the date of your arrival back in New Zealand, you'll need to show this income in your Individual tax return (IR3), even if you qualify for a temporary tax exemption on other types of foreign income. After the exemption has ended When your temporary tax exemption ends, you need to include all your foreign income, (received since your exemption ended) in your tax return along with your New Zealand income. You need to file a tax return after the end of your exemption and every tax year after that, as long as you have foreign income, regardless of whether or not you told us of your foreign income when you arrived in New Zealand. New Zealand's tax year runs from 1 April to 31 March. If your exemption ends at any time in a tax year other than on the standard balance date of 31 March, you'll need to apportion your foreign income received for that year in your tax return. Sam qualified as a tax resident in New Zealand on 10 September 2015 and met the criteria for his foreign income to be temporarily exempt from tax in New Zealand from 10 September 2015 until 30 September 2019. Sam’s exemption ends in the middle of a standard New Zealand tax year and he will continue to receive foreign income after his exemption ends (30 September 2019). In his IR3 for the year ending 31 March 2020 (the tax year that his exemption ended), Sam has to show the foreign income he received from 1 October 2019 to 31 March 2020.

You can also call us within New Zealand on 0800 227 774, or on +64 4 978 0779 if you're calling from overseas. TAXES AND DUTIES 11 Becoming a non-resident Remember that if you have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand you'll be a resident for tax purposes. However, if the ties and links described on page 7 suggest you don't have a permanent place of abode here, you can become a non-resident under the "325-day rule". The 325-day rule If you're away from New Zealand for more than 325 days in any 12-month period, and you don't have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, you'll become a non-resident for tax purposes. The 325 days don't have to be consecutive. Remember, if you're here for part of a day it's counted as a whole day. Recognised seasonal employers scheme Under the recognised seasonal employers scheme, workers from overseas are employed in the horticulture and viticulture industries. This is to help out with the shortage of local workers. If you're a recognised seasonal worker you're non-resident for New Zealand tax purposes, but you have to pay New Zealand tax on your New Zealand income. Your employer will deduct tax at a flat rate under the PAYE scheme. You need to use the NSW (non-resident seasonal worker) tax code on your Tax code declaration (IR330). Paying tax as a non-resident If you're a non-resident you're taxed here only on your income from New Zealand sources. Non-residents fill in a Non-resident individual tax return (IR3NR), which is different from a resident's tax return. If you're a non-resident with income from New Zealand, please make sure you let us know. This is so we can send you the right return form and tax you correctly. Normally, overseas countries will let you claim a credit for the tax that you pay on your income from New Zealand, limited to the overseas tax payable on the New Zealand income. 12 www.ird.govt.nz Double tax agreements To avoid double taxation if a person is a tax resident of two different countries, New Zealand has negotiated double tax agreements (DTAs) and Tax information exchange agreements (TIEAs) with many other countries. These DTAs and TIEAs establish rules to determine what taxing rights each country has. Most DTAs and TIEAs contain a "tie-breaker" clause to establish which country has prior claim when settling competing tax claims. These countries or territories have a DTA or TIEA with New Zealand AustraliaIndiaRussian Federation AustriaIndonesiaSamoa BelgiumIrelandSingapore CanadaIsle of ManSouth Africa Cayman IslandsItalySpain ChileJapanSweden ChinaJerseySwitzerland Cook IslandsKorea, Republic ofTa i w a n Czech RepublicMalaysiaThailand DenmarkMexicoTu r k e y FijiNetherlandsUnited Arab Emirates FinlandNorwayUnited Kingdom FrancePapua New GuineaUnited States of America GermanyPhilippinesVietnam Hong KongPoland To get more details about any of these, call us on 0800 227 774 if you're a salary or wage earner, or 0800 377 774 if you're in business. TAXES AND DUTIES 13 IRD numbers If you don't already have a New Zealand IRD number, you can apply for one by filling in an IRD number application - resident individual (IR595) form or complete the IRD number application form online at www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: IRD number apply). If you're going to claim Working for Families Tax Credits (page 19) you'll also need to complete an IRD number application for all the children you're applying for. When applying for an IRD number you'll need some form of identification, eg, a birth certificate or current passport. Take the form with your identification documents to an Inland Revenue appointed verifier. Further details can be found on the form. For more information on applying for an IRD number go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: ird number). If you've had a New Zealand IRD number before, call us on 0800 227 774 to check that it's still valid. Once you have your IRD number, please have it handy whenever you call us. Balance dates New Zealand's tax year runs from 1 April to 31 March. Some individuals, all self-employed people and businesses have to fill in a tax return after 31 March each year to declare all their income and tax paid. Some self-employed people and businesses have a balance date other than 31 March, eg, some farmers have a 30 June balance date. Depending on the circumstances, we may give approval for other self-employed people and businesses to have a different balance date. 14 www.ird.govt.nz Part 2 - Types of taxes and duties Income tax In New Zealand, income tax is paid on these types of income: •salary and wages •business and self-employed income •most social security benefits •income from investments •rental income •in some circumstances profit from selling capital assets (this doesn't usually apply to personal assets sold) •income that a New Zealand resident earns from overseas. The level of your total gross income (before tax and allowable deductions) will determine what tax rates are applied. For tax rate details go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: income tax rates). Tax credits Independent Earner Tax Credit There is a tax credit that can reduce the overall amount of tax you may have to pay if you're a New Zealand tax resident and your annual net income\* is between $24,000 and $48,000 and you: •aren't eligible for Working for Families Tax Credits (either you or your partner), •don't receive an income-tested benefit, NZ superannuation or veteran's pension, or an overseas equivalent of any of these. If your only income is from salary or wages (and you don't have any allowable expenses, eg, income protection insurance) your net income will be your annual salary or wages before tax. To find out about this tax credit, if you're eligible and how to claim it go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: tax credits) or phone 0800 227 774. Remember to have your IRD number handy. \* Net income means your total income from all sources less any allowable deductions or current year losses (not including any losses brought forward). TAXES AND DUTIES 15 Donations tax credits If you earn a taxable income (eg, salary, wages, benefit or self-employed income) there are also tax credits for making donations to charitable organisations. These tax credits can be claimed using a Tax credit claim form (IR526). You need to provide receipts with your claim. Paying tax on salary or wages If your income is from salary, wages or a social security benefit, your tax will be deducted under the PAYE (pay as you earn) system. This means the pay you get in your hand has already had tax deducted. If your employer provides non-cash benefits as part of your employment package, they'll pay fringe benefit tax on them. You won't be taxed on these benefits. When you receive income from employment (salary or wages): •give your employer your IRD number so that the correct amount of tax is deducted from your pay. If you don't have an IRD number, go to page 13 to find out how to get one. •fill in a Tax code declaration (IR330) to ensure that you're taxed at the correct rate. Without a tax code declaration, tax is deducted at the higher no-notification rate of 45 cents in the dollar. For information on what tax code to use for your job refer to the Tax code declaration (IR330) or www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: tax code). Most salary and wage earners and those who receive benefits and pensions pay the correct amount of tax during the year. You will receive an Income tax assessment or be required to file an Individual tax return (IR3) at the end of the tax year, depending on your situation. To check if you need to file an IR3 log in to myIR at www.ird.govt.nz and use the online service. Paying tax on rental or business income You may earn income that doesn't have tax deducted before you receive it, eg, income from running your own business. In this situation (other than your first year in business) you'll generally have to pay your tax in instalments during the year. This is called provisional tax. When you file your tax return at the end of the financial year, the provisional tax you've already paid will be offset against the end-of-year tax amount you owe. 16 www.ird.govt.nz When you receive rental or business income, you need to: •apply for an IRD number for your business unless you are operating as a sole trader •keep accurate records •fill out an Individual tax return (IR3) each year and send it to us by the due date. When completing your IR3 you'll need to include income from all sources and work out the tax on your total taxable income. There are different requirements for getting an IRD number for a business, depending on what type of business you have. If you are operating as a sole trader you can use your own individual IRD number. Note Visit www.ird.govt.nz for more information on: •the requirements for getting an IRD number for your business •paying tax •expenses or deductions you can claim •GST (goods and service tax) and employer responsibilities •good business practices when running a business in New Zealand. Our Smart business (IR320) guide is for new and existing businesses. This guide includes information on basic income tax responsibilities, record and book keeping, claiming expenses, and information on GST and employer responsibilities. If you receive rental income, check our Rental income (IR264) guide for information on your tax responsibilities. A list of other useful publications is on page 22. GST (goods and services tax) GST is New Zealand's main type of tax apart from income tax. It is an indirect tax, which businesses (including retailers) charge as part of the cost of goods and services that they supply. The current rate is 15%. When a GST-registered business buys goods or services from its suppliers, it can claim a credit for the GST the suppliers charge on these purchases. However, end-user consumers can't claim a deduction for GST in this way. The effect of this is that the final consumer of any product or service pays 15% GST on its cost. GST is charged on virtually all goods and services supplied in New Zealand, except for rental of residential property, financial services such as mortgages, loans and investments, and the sale of a business that is capable of being carried on by the purchaser as a taxable activity (going concern). TAXES AND DUTIES 17 For more information on GST read our GST guide (IR375), or go to www.ird.govt.nz/gst Accident compensation New Zealand has a comprehensive accident insurance scheme which covers the costs of all work and non-work-related accidents. The Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) administers this scheme. Levies for cover are paid by employers and self-employed people directly to ACC. Inland Revenue collects employees' levies on behalf of ACC as part of the PAYE tax system. RWT (Resident withholding tax) If you receive interest from any person or organisation, RWT is deducted before the interest is credited to you. This might include interest from financial institutions such as banks, finance companies, building societies or credit unions. RWT rates The rate at which RWT is deducted from your interest depends on: •the rate you have elected •the date the interest is paid or credited •whether or not you've given your IRD number to the person or organisation who is paying you interest •whether or not you have elected an RWT rate with your interest payer •your income level. Which rate should I elect? If you've given your financial institution your IRD number, but not elected an RWT rate to be used, they'll deduct RWT at the no-notification rate. This may result in your RWT being deducted at too high a rate. The rate you choose needs to take into account all the income you expect to earn in the tax year, not just the income from your investment. For current RWT rates go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: rwt rate). You can elect to have your interest deducted at a higher rate to avoid an end-of-year tax bill. If a financial institution doesn’t have a client’s IRD number it will deduct RWT at the no-notification rate. Note 18 www.ird.govt.nz How do I make an election? To make an RWT rate election you can either: •contact your bank or financial institution and tell them which rate you prefer to be on, or •complete a Choose your RWT deduction rate (IR456) form and give one to each bank or financial institution you deal with. The rate you choose will apply once your bank or financial institution has processed this information. International tax rules New Zealand residents must pay income tax in New Zealand on their worldwide income. In addition, a New Zealand resident who has significant investments overseas must calculate the income from those investments according to New Zealand tax rules. These calculation rules don't apply to ordinary overseas bank accounts that you hold. To declare the income from these bank accounts, you simply convert the interest to New Zealand dollars (using the exchange rate for the date on which the interest was credited) and include it in your tax return. For more involved or substantial overseas investments (including interests in superannuation schemes), the calculations can be quite complicated. To find out more about them contact your tax advisor or agent. Tr u s t s If you're a settlor, trustee or beneficiary of a trust outside New Zealand, there are some trust tax rules you may need to know about. Refer to our Trusts and estates income tax rules (IR288) guide for more information. TAXES AND DUTIES 19 Part 3 - Social assistance Child support Child support is money paid by parents not living with their children to help financially support those children, when: •a couple who have children split up, or •two people have children and are not living together, or •dependent children are no longer living with either parent. Child support is not a tax, it's a payment administered by Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue Child Support assesses the amount the paying parent needs to pay and collects this money. It's then passed on to the person looking after the children to help with the costs of bringing them up, or to the government where the receiving carer is receiving a sole parent benefit to help offset the cost of the benefit. Some parents pay financial support direct to the other parent without the money passing through Inland Revenue Child Support. This can happen when the person caring for the children isn't receiving a sole parent benefit. For more information about child support please go to www.ird.govt.nz/childsupport or call 0800 221 221. Working for Families Tax Credits Working for Families Tax Credits are for families with children aged 18 or under. There are different types of payments and you may qualify for one or more, depending on your family situation. How much you can get depends on: •how many dependent children you have who are 18 or younger •your children's ages •any shared care arrangements •how much you and your spouse or partner earn (your family income) •where your family income comes from, eg, salary or wages, business, student allowance or a benefit, and •the number of hours you work each week. You also have to meet residency requirements to be eligible for Working for Families Tax Credits. 20 www.ird.govt.nz Partner means your civil union or de facto partner. Note The Working for Families Tax Credits payment types are: Family tax credit (FTC) This payment depends on how much you earn, the number of dependent children you have, and any shared care arrangements. We pay FTC if you're a working family, when you receive a student allowance or NZ Super. Work and Income often pays FTC to families receiving a benefit. In-work tax credit (IWTC) This payment is for families who normally work a minimum number of hours each week, as follows: •a two-parent family where one or both parents between them work at least 30 hours a week •a single parent works at least 20 hours a week. As long as families receive income from working the required hours, or receive certain compensation payments, IWTC is available to parents who are: •self-employed •receiving NZ Super •receiving a Veteran's Pension, or veteran's weekly compensation payments. It isn't available to families receiving an income-tested benefit or student allowance. You can get IWTC if you and/or your spouse or partner would normally work the required hours, but are receiving accident compensation for an injury that happened on or after 1 January 2006. Minimum family tax credit (MFTC) MFTC is payable to families working for salary or wages who earn an annual family income up to $26,572 after tax from 1 April 2019. This is to ensure those families have a minimum income of $511 a week after tax. A single parent must be working at least 20 hours a week, and in a two-parent family, one or both parents between them must be working at least 30 hours a week. If you and/or your spouse or partner would normally work the required weekly hours but are injured and receive accident compensation instead, you can still qualify for MFTC. TAXES AND DUTIES 21 Best Start tax credit (BSTC) BSTC is available for children due or born on or after 1 July 2018. BSTC was introduced to assist families with the costs in a child's early years. You can get this payment for up to three years after a new child arrives. You can receive up to $3,120 per year, or $60 a week. BSTC is not adjusted for income levels in your child's first year but is adjusted in the second and third year. Parental tax credit (PTC) PTC has been replaced by BSTC and is only available for children born before 1 July 2018. PTC helps with the costs of a new baby for the first ten weeks after the baby arrives. You can receive up to $2,200 depending on your family income. How much you get also depends on the type of income you received in the first ten weeks after your baby arrived.

We've written it mainly for new residents and potential immigrants to New Zealand. We also explain the following social assistance programmes that we administer: •Child support - money paid by a parent not living with their children to help support their children financially. •Working for Families Tax Credits - an entitlement for families with dependent children aged 18 and under. This guide deals with tax residence rules only. The tax residence rules are different from the usual New Zealand immigration and residency rules. When we refer to a "New Zealand resident" or a "non-resident", we mean a New Zealand resident or non-resident for tax purposes. Note On page 22 you'll find a list of other publications for more detailed information about the topics covered in this guide. The information in this guide is based on current tax laws at the time of printing. TAXES AND DUTIES 5 Part 1 - General information New Zealand's tax system Everyone in New Zealand must pay their share of tax. This is how the government funds public services such as education, healthcare, roads and welfare. Almost all New Zealanders contribute to these services through the taxes they are required to pay by law. New Zealand residents pay income tax in New Zealand on their worldwide income. If you're a New Zealand resident, most of the income you receive will be subject to tax. This includes income from personal effort, investments, benefits, pensions and overseas. New Zealand also has a goods and services tax (GST), which is included in the price you pay for most goods and services. New Zealand doesn't have a capital gains tax, but profits from selling some assets can be taxable in some circumstances. There's no tax on cash or personal assets you bring into New Zealand. Inland Revenue is the main government department that administers tax laws and collects tax payments. New Zealand Customs also collects some taxes and duties on imported goods. New Zealand's tax system relies on people's honesty in complying with the tax laws. It's important you understand your tax responsibilities, to avoid being penalised. Tax residence The residence rules set out in tax law is different from the normal citizenship rules. Having New Zealand citizenship or permanent residence doesn't necessarily mean you're a resident for tax purposes. On the other hand, you could be a resident for tax purposes, but not hold citizenship here. As an individual, you're a New Zealand resident for tax purposes if you meet any of these conditions: •You've been in New Zealand for more than 183 days in any 12-month period and haven't become a non-resident (refer to page 11). •You have a "permanent place of abode" in New Zealand. •You're away from New Zealand in the service of the New Zealand government. 6 ird.govt.nz The 183-day rule If you've been in New Zealand for more than 183 days in any 12-month period, you're considered to be a New Zealand tax resident from the first of those 183 days. The 183 days don't have to be consecutive. For example, if you come to New Zealand for 10 days in April and then return for 20 days in September of the same year, that's counted as 30 days. If you're in New Zealand for part of a day, it's counted as being a whole day. This means that the days you arrive or depart are treated as days present in New Zealand. If you've ever been resident in New Zealand under the 183-day rule you remain resident until you become a non-resident (refer to page 11). A permanent place of abode in New Zealand The Income Tax Act 2007 says that a person, other than a company, who has a "permanent place of abode" in New Zealand is a New Zealand tax resident. To have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand there must be somewhere in New Zealand you could live (ie, a house or other dwelling). If there is somewhere in New Zealand you could live, all of your ties and links with New Zealand need to be considered. If you have strong ties to New Zealand it's likely that you have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. A number of ties need to be considered - the table on the following page has more information. If there is somewhere in New Zealand you could live, it's necessary to decide whether it's your permanent place of abode. TAXES AND DUTIES 7 To decide you need to consider all of your circumstances. Do you have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand? CircumstanceLook at Presence in New Zealand how much time you spend in New Zealand, and whether you're here continuously or from time to time Accommodation how you've previously used the accommodation you have in New Zealand, and your connection with it, ie, whether you own it, lease it or control it Family and social ties where your family live (especially immediate family) and if you belong to any New Zealand clubs, associations or organisations Economic ties if you have bank accounts, credit cards, investments, life insurance or superannuation funds here Employment or business if you run a business or you're employed here, if you have (or may have) employment to return to, the terms of any employment contract Personal property if you have vehicles, clothing, furniture or other property or possessions kept here Intentions whether you intend to come back to New Zealand to live, and if you do, when Benefits, pensions and other payments whether you receive any welfare benefits, pensions or other payments from a New Zealand agency or organisation This list is a guide only - you’ll need to consider your overall situation when working out whether you’re a New Zealand tax resident. Please note that even if you maintain ties (or even a physical home) in other countries, you can still be a New Zealand tax resident. As long as you have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand you'll always be a resident. This test overrides any rules about the number of days you're here. If you're a New Zealand tax resident and also a tax resident of another country under that country's tax laws, it's possible that you could be taxed twice on the same income. To avoid this, New Zealand has double tax agreements with many other countries. These agreements are explained on page 12. 8 ird.govt.nz Paying tax as a resident If you're a New Zealand resident you're taxed on your worldwide income. In your first New Zealand tax return you must include your worldwide income from all sources from the date you arrived in New Zealand. You're normally allowed a credit for any tax paid overseas, up to the amount of New Zealand income tax payable on that overseas income. To claim a credit you'll need to be able to produce records that show the overseas tax you've paid. In New Zealand the tax on each person’s income is calculated separately. For example, there are no joint assessments for a husband, wife or partner. Note Temporary tax exemption on foreign income Most types of individual income derived from overseas may be temporarily exempt from tax in New Zealand. This temporary tax exemption is available to people who: •qualify as a tax resident in New Zealand on or after 1 April 2006, and •are new migrants or returning New Zealanders who have not been resident for tax purposes in New Zealand for at least 10 years prior to their arrival in New Zealand. The temporary tax exemption for foreign income starts on the first day that you are a tax resident here. It ends 48 months after the month you qualify as a tax resident in New Zealand. Sarah was in New Zealand from 10 to 14 March 2016. She then moved here on 22 April 2016, and qualified as a tax resident on 16 October 2016. She met the criteria for her foreign income to be temporarily exempt from tax in New Zealand. Sarah’s exemption applies from 10 March 2016 until 31 October 2020. Example Qualifying for the exemption To be eligible for a temporary tax exemption on foreign income you must: •have qualified as a tax resident in New Zealand on or after 1 April 2006 •not have been a New Zealand tax resident at any time in the past 10 years before you qualified again as a tax resident in New Zealand (page 5 has information about New Zealand tax residence) •not have been eligible for this tax exemption before (including if you were eligible but chose to waive the exemption), and •not be receiving Working for Families Tax Credits (your spouse or partner must not be receiving them either). TAXES AND DUTIES 9 The exemption can only be granted once in a lifetime - you can't extend your tax exemption or renew it after its expiry date. There are some types of foreign income that don't qualify for a temporary tax exemption (refer to page 10). The exemption and Working for Families Tax Credits You can't receive Working for Families Tax Credits while being tax exempt from foreign income. If you're eligible for the temporary tax exemption on foreign income and you (or your spouse or partner) are also eligible for Working for Families Tax Credits, you need to decide which option is the best for your situation. If you decide to waive the temporary tax exemption so you can claim Working for Families Tax Credits, you'll need to show, in your Individual tax return - IR3, all the foreign income you received from the date of your arrival in New Zealand. Go to page 19 for information about Working for Families Tax Credits. How to claim the exemption The tax exemption is automatically granted if you're eligible. If you qualify for the exemption, you're not required to tell us about foreign income you receive (except for foreign income that doesn't qualify for the temporary tax exemption) for the period that your exemption applies. To contact us, call us within New Zealand on 0800 227 774, or on +64 4 978 0779 if you're calling from overseas. The types of foreign income temporarily exempt from tax in New Zealand are, for example: •controlled foreign company (CFC) income that is attributed under New Zealand's CFC rules •foreign investment fund (FIF) income that is attributed under New Zealand's FIF rules (including foreign superannuation) •non-resident withholding tax (eg, on foreign mortgages) •approved issuer levy (eg, on foreign mortgages) •income arising from the exercise of foreign employee share options •accrual income (from foreign financial arrangements) •income from foreign trusts •rental income derived offshore •foreign dividends •foreign interest •royalties derived offshore •income from employment performed overseas before coming to New Zealand, such as bonus payments 10 ird.govt.nz •gains on the sale of property derived offshore (held on revenue account) •offshore business income (that is unrelated to the performance of services). The foreign income that will continue to be taxed in New Zealand is: •employment income from overseas employment performed while living in New Zealand, and •business income relating to services performed offshore. If you receive non-exempt types of foreign income from the date of your arrival back in New Zealand, you'll need to show this income in your Individual tax return - IR3, even if you qualify for a temporary tax exemption on other types of foreign income. After the exemption has ended When your temporary tax exemption ends, you need to include all your foreign income, (received since your exemption ended) in your tax return along with your New Zealand income. You need to file a tax return after the end of your exemption and every tax year after that, as long as you have foreign income, regardless of whether or not you told us of your foreign income when you arrived in New Zealand. New Zealand's tax year runs from 1 April to 31 March. If your exemption ends at any time in a tax year other than on the standard balance date of 31 March, you'll need to apportion your foreign income received for that year in your tax return. Sam qualified as a tax resident in New Zealand on 10 September 2015 and met the criteria for his foreign income to be temporarily exempt from tax in New Zealand from 10 September 2015 until 30 September 2019. Sam’s exemption ends in the middle of a standard New Zealand tax year and he will continue to receive foreign income after his exemption ends (30 September 2019). In his IR3 for the year ending 31 March 2020 (the tax year that his exemption ended), Sam has to show the foreign income he received from 1 October 2019 to 31 March 2020.

TAXES AND DUTIES 11 Becoming a non-resident Remember that if you have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand you'll be a resident for tax purposes. However, if the ties and links described on page 7 suggest you don't have a permanent place of abode here, you can become a non-resident under the "325-day rule". The 325-day rule If you're away from New Zealand for more than 325 days in any 12-month period, and you don't have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, you'll become a non-resident for tax purposes. The 325 days don't have to be consecutive. Remember, if you're here for part of a day it's counted as a whole day. Recognised seasonal employers scheme Under the recognised seasonal employers scheme, workers from overseas are employed in the horticulture and viticulture industries. This is to help out with the shortage of local workers. If you're a recognised seasonal worker you're non-resident for New Zealand tax purposes, but you have to pay New Zealand tax on your New Zealand income. Your employer will deduct tax at a flat rate under the PAYE scheme. You need to use the NSW (non-resident seasonal worker) tax code on your Tax code declaration - IR330. Paying tax as a non-resident If you're a non-resident you're taxed here only on your income from New Zealand sources. Non-residents fill in a Non-resident individual tax return - IR3NR, which is different from a resident's tax return. If you're a non-resident with income from New Zealand, please make sure you let us know. This is so we can send you the right return form and tax you correctly. Normally, overseas countries will let you claim a credit for the tax that you pay on your income from New Zealand, limited to the overseas tax payable on the New Zealand income. 12 ird.govt.nz Double tax agreements To avoid double taxation if a person is a tax resident of two different countries, New Zealand has negotiated double tax agreements (DTAs) and Tax information exchange agreements (TIEAs) with many other countries. These DTAs and TIEAs establish rules to determine what taxing rights each country has. Most DTAs and TIEAs contain a "tie-breaker" clause to establish which country has prior claim when settling competing tax claims. These countries or territories have a DTA or TIEA with New Zealand AustraliaIndiaRussian Federation AustriaIndonesiaSamoa BelgiumIrelandSingapore CanadaIsle of ManSouth Africa Cayman IslandsItalySpain ChileJapanSweden ChinaJerseySwitzerland Cook IslandsKorea, Republic ofTa i w a n Czech RepublicMalaysiaThailand DenmarkMexicoTu r k e y FijiNetherlandsUnited Arab Emirates FinlandNorwayUnited Kingdom FrancePapua New GuineaUnited States of America GermanyPhilippinesVietnam Hong KongPoland To get more details about any of these, call us on 0800 227 774 if you're a salary or wage earner, or 0800 377 774 if you're in business. TAXES AND DUTIES 13 IRD numbers If you don't already have a New Zealand IRD number, you can apply for one by filling in an IRD number application - resident individual - IR595 form or complete the IRD number application form online at ird.govt.nz/IRDnumber If you're going to claim Working for Families Tax Credits (page 19) you'll also need to complete an IRD number application for all the children you're applying for. When applying for an IRD number you'll need some form of identification, eg, a birth certificate or current passport. Take the form with your identification documents to an Inland Revenue appointed verifier. Further details can be found on the form. For more information on applying for an IRD number go to ird.govt.nz/IRDnumber If you've had a New Zealand IRD number before, call us on 0800 227 774 to check that it's still valid. Once you have your IRD number, please have it handy whenever you call us. Balance dates New Zealand's tax year runs from 1 April to 31 March. Some individuals, all self-employed people and businesses have to fill in a tax return after 31 March each year to declare all their income and tax paid. Some self-employed people and businesses have a balance date other than 31 March, eg, some farmers have a 30 June balance date. Depending on the circumstances, we may give approval for other self-employed people and businesses to have a different balance date. 14 ird.govt.nz Part 2 - Types of taxes and duties Income tax In New Zealand, income tax is paid on these types of income: •salary and wages •business and self-employed income •most social security benefits •income from investments •rental income •in some circumstances profit from selling capital assets (this doesn't usually apply to personal assets sold) •income that a New Zealand resident earns from overseas. The level of your total gross income (before tax and allowable deductions) will determine what tax rates are applied. For tax rate details go to ird.govt.nz/tax-rates Tax credits Independent Earner Tax Credit There is a tax credit that can reduce the overall amount of tax you may have to pay if you're a New Zealand tax resident and your annual net income\* is between $24,000 and $48,000 and you: •aren't eligible for Working for Families Tax Credits (either you or your partner), •don't receive an income-tested benefit, NZ superannuation or veteran's pension, or an overseas equivalent of any of these. If your only income is from salary or wages (and you don't have any allowable expenses, eg, income protection insurance) your net income will be your annual salary or wages before tax. To find out about this tax credit, if you're eligible and how to claim it go to iird.govt.nz/ietc or phone 0800 227 774. Remember to have your IRD number handy. \* Net income means your total income from all sources less any allowable deductions or current year losses (not including any losses brought forward). TAXES AND DUTIES 15 Donations tax credits If you earn a taxable income (eg, salary, wages, benefit or self-employed income) there are also tax credits for making donations to charitable organisations. These tax credits can be claimed using a Tax credit claim form - IR526. You need to provide receipts with your claim. Paying tax on salary or wages If your income is from salary, wages or a social security benefit, your tax will be deducted under the PAYE (pay as you earn) system. This means the pay you get in your hand has already had tax deducted. If your employer provides non-cash benefits as part of your employment package, they'll pay fringe benefit tax on them. You won't be taxed on these benefits. When you receive income from employment (salary or wages): •give your employer your IRD number so that the correct amount of tax is deducted from your pay. If you don't have an IRD number, go to page 13 to find out how to get one. •fill in a Tax code declaration - IR330 to ensure that you're taxed at the correct rate. Without a tax code declaration, tax is deducted at the higher no-notification rate of 45 cents in the dollar. For information on what tax code to use for your job refer to the Tax code declaration - IR330 or ird.govt.nz/tax-codes Most salary and wage earners and those who receive benefits and pensions pay the correct amount of tax during the year. You will receive an Income tax assessment or be required to file an Individual tax return - IR3 at the end of the tax year, depending on your situation. To check if you need to file an IR3 log in to myIR at ird.govt.nz and use the online service. Paying tax on rental or business income You may earn income that doesn't have tax deducted before you receive it, eg, income from running your own business. In this situation (other than your first year in business) you'll generally have to pay your tax in instalments during the year. This is called provisional tax. When you file your tax return at the end of the financial year, the provisional tax you've already paid will be offset against the end-of-year tax amount you owe. 16 ird.govt.nz When you receive rental or business income, you need to: •apply for an IRD number for your business unless you are operating as a sole trader •keep accurate records •fill out an Individual tax return - IR3 each year and send it to us by the due date. When completing your IR3 you'll need to include income from all sources and work out the tax on your total taxable income. There are different requirements for getting an IRD number for a business, depending on what type of business you have. If you are operating as a sole trader you can use your own individual IRD number. Note Visit ird.govt.nz for more information on: •the requirements for getting an IRD number for your business •paying tax •expenses or deductions you can claim •GST (goods and service tax) and employer responsibilities •good business practices when running a business in New Zealand. Our Smart business - IR320 guide is for new and existing businesses. This guide includes information on basic income tax responsibilities, record and book keeping, claiming expenses, and information on GST and employer responsibilities. If you receive rental income, check our Rental income - IR264 guide for information on your tax responsibilities. A list of other useful publications is on page 22. GST (goods and services tax) GST is New Zealand's main type of tax apart from income tax. It is an indirect tax, which businesses (including retailers) charge as part of the cost of goods and services that they supply. The current rate is 15%. When a GST-registered business buys goods or services from its suppliers, it can claim a credit for the GST the suppliers charge on these purchases. However, end-user consumers can't claim a deduction for GST in this way. The effect of this is that the final consumer of any product or service pays 15% GST on its cost. GST is charged on virtually all goods and services supplied in New Zealand, except for rental of residential property, financial services such as mortgages, loans and investments, and the sale of a business that is capable of being carried on by the purchaser as a taxable activity (going concern). TAXES AND DUTIES 17 For more information on GST read our GST guide - IR375, or go to ird.govt.nz/gst Accident compensation New Zealand has a comprehensive accident insurance scheme which covers the costs of all work and non-work-related accidents. The Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) administers this scheme. Levies for cover are paid by employers and self-employed people directly to ACC. Inland Revenue collects employees' levies on behalf of ACC as part of the PAYE tax system. RWT (Resident withholding tax) If you receive interest from any person or organisation, RWT is deducted before the interest is credited to you. This might include interest from financial institutions such as banks, finance companies, building societies or credit unions. RWT rates The rate at which RWT is deducted from your interest depends on: •the rate you have elected •the date the interest is paid or credited •whether or not you've given your IRD number to the person or organisation who is paying you interest •whether or not you have elected an RWT rate with your interest payer •your income level. Which rate should I elect? If you've given your financial institution your IRD number, but not elected an RWT rate to be used, they'll deduct RWT at the no-notification rate. This may result in your RWT being deducted at too high a rate. The rate you choose needs to take into account all the income you expect to earn in the tax year, not just the income from your investment. For current RWT rates go to ird.govt.nz/rwt You can elect to have your interest deducted at a higher rate to avoid an end-of-year tax bill. If a financial institution doesn’t have a client’s IRD number it will deduct RWT at the no-notification rate. Note 18 ird.govt.nz How do I make an election? To make an RWT rate election you can either: •contact your bank or financial institution and tell them which rate you prefer to be on, or •complete a Choose your RWT deduction rate - IR456 form and give one to each bank or financial institution you deal with. The rate you choose will apply once your bank or financial institution has processed this information. International tax rules New Zealand residents must pay income tax in New Zealand on their worldwide income. In addition, a New Zealand resident who has significant investments overseas must calculate the income from those investments according to New Zealand tax rules. These calculation rules don't apply to ordinary overseas bank accounts that you hold. To declare the income from these bank accounts, you simply convert the interest to New Zealand dollars (using the exchange rate for the date on which the interest was credited) and include it in your tax return. For more involved or substantial overseas investments (including interests in superannuation schemes), the calculations can be quite complicated. To find out more about them contact your tax advisor or agent. Tr u s t s If you're a settlor, trustee or beneficiary of a trust outside New Zealand, there are some trust tax rules you may need to know about. Refer to our Trusts and estates income tax rules - IR288 guide for more information. TAXES AND DUTIES 19 Part 3 - Social assistance Child support Child support is money paid by parents not living with their children to help financially support those children, when: •a couple who have children split up, or •two people have children and are not living together, or •dependent children are no longer living with either parent. Child support is not a tax, it's a payment administered by Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue Child Support assesses the amount the paying parent needs to pay and collects this money. It's then passed on to the person looking after the children to help with the costs of bringing them up, or to the government where the receiving carer is receiving a sole parent benefit to help offset the cost of the benefit. Some parents pay financial support direct to the other parent without the money passing through Inland Revenue Child Support. This can happen when the person caring for the children isn't receiving a sole parent benefit. For more information about child support please go to ird.govt.nz/childsupport or call 0800 221 221. Working for Families Tax Credits Working for Families Tax Credits are for families with children aged 18 or under. There are different types of payments and you may qualify for one or more, depending on your family situation. How much you can get depends on: •how many dependent children you have who are 18 or younger •your children's ages •any shared care arrangements •how much you and your spouse or partner earn (your family income) •where your family income comes from, eg, salary or wages, business, student allowance or a benefit, and •the number of hours you work each week. You also have to meet residency requirements to be eligible for Working for Families Tax Credits. 20 ird.govt.nz Partner means your civil union or de facto partner. Note The Working for Families Tax Credits payment types are: Family tax credit (FTC) This payment depends on how much you earn, the number of dependent children you have, and any shared care arrangements. We pay FTC if you're a working family, when you receive a student allowance or NZ Super. Work and Income often pays FTC to families receiving a benefit. In-work tax credit (IWTC) This payment is for families who are normally in paid work: As long as families receive income from paid work or receive certain compensation payments, IWTC is available to parents who are: •self-employed •receiving NZ Super •receiving a Veteran's Pension, or veteran's weekly compensation payments. It isn't available to families receiving an income-tested benefit or student allowance. You can get IWTC if you and/or your spouse or partner are normally in paid work, but are receiving accident compensation for an injury that happened on or after 1 January 2006. Minimum family tax credit (MFTC) MFTC is payable to families working for salary or wages who earn an annual family income up to $29,432 after tax from 1 April 2020. This is to ensure those families have a minimum income of $566 a week after tax. A single parent must be working at least 20 hours a week, and in a two-parent family, one or both parents between them must be working at least 30 hours a week. If you and/or your spouse or partner would normally work the required weekly hours but are injured and receive accident compensation instead, you can still qualify for MFTC. TAXES AND DUTIES 21 Best Start tax credit (BSTC) BSTC is available for children due or born on or after 1 July 2018. BSTC was introduced to assist families with the costs in a child's early years. You can get this payment for up to three years after a new child arrives. You can receive up to $3,120 per year, or $60 a week. BSTC is not adjusted for income levels in your child's first year but is adjusted in the second and third year.

We've written it mainly for new residents and potential immigrants to New Zealand. We also explain the following social assistance programmes that we administer: •Child support - money paid by a parent not living with their children to help support their children financially. •Working for Families Tax Credits - an entitlement for families with dependent children aged 18 and under. This guide deals with tax residence rules only. The tax residence rules are different from the usual New Zealand immigration and residency rules. When we refer to a "New Zealand resident" or a "non-resident", we mean a New Zealand resident or non-resident for tax purposes. Note On page 22 you'll find a list of other publications for more detailed information about the topics covered in this guide. The information in this guide is based on current tax laws at the time of printing. TAXES AND DUTIES 5 Part 1 - General information New Zealand's tax system Everyone in New Zealand must pay their share of tax. This is how the government funds public services such as education, healthcare, roads and welfare. Almost all New Zealanders contribute to these services through the taxes they are required to pay by law. New Zealand residents pay income tax in New Zealand on their worldwide income. If you're a New Zealand resident, most of the income you receive will be subject to tax. This includes income from personal effort, investments, benefits, pensions and overseas. New Zealand also has a goods and services tax (GST), which is included in the price you pay for most goods and services. New Zealand doesn't have a capital gains tax, but profits from selling some assets can be taxable in some circumstances. There's no tax on cash or personal assets you bring into New Zealand. Inland Revenue is the main government department that administers tax laws and collects tax payments. New Zealand Customs also collects some taxes and duties on imported goods. New Zealand's tax system relies on people's honesty in complying with the tax laws. It's important you understand your tax responsibilities, to avoid being penalised. Tax residence The residence rules set out in tax law is different from the normal citizenship rules. Having New Zealand citizenship or permanent residence doesn't necessarily mean you're a resident for tax purposes. On the other hand, you could be a resident for tax purposes, but not hold citizenship here. As an individual, you're a New Zealand resident for tax purposes if you meet any of these conditions: •You've been in New Zealand for more than 183 days in any 12-month period and haven't become a non-resident (refer to page 11). •You have a "permanent place of abode" in New Zealand. •You're away from New Zealand in the service of the New Zealand government. 6 ird.govt.nz The 183-day rule If you've been in New Zealand for more than 183 days in any 12-month period, you're considered to be a New Zealand tax resident from the first of those 183 days. The 183 days don't have to be consecutive. For example, if you come to New Zealand for 10 days in April and then return for 20 days in September of the same year, that's counted as 30 days. If you're in New Zealand for part of a day, it's counted as being a whole day. This means that the days you arrive or depart are treated as days present in New Zealand. If you've ever been resident in New Zealand under the 183-day rule you remain resident until you become a non-resident (refer to page 11). A permanent place of abode in New Zealand The Income Tax Act 2007 says that a person, other than a company, who has a "permanent place of abode" in New Zealand is a New Zealand tax resident. To have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand there must be somewhere in New Zealand you could live (ie, a house or other dwelling). If there is somewhere in New Zealand you could live, all of your ties and links with New Zealand need to be considered. If you have strong ties to New Zealand it's likely that you have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. A number of ties need to be considered - the table on the following page has more information. If there is somewhere in New Zealand you could live, it's necessary to decide whether it's your permanent place of abode. TAXES AND DUTIES 7 To decide you need to consider all of your circumstances. Do you have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand? CircumstanceLook at Presence in New Zealand how much time you spend in New Zealand, and whether you're here continuously or from time to time Accommodation how you've previously used the accommodation you have in New Zealand, and your connection with it, ie, whether you own it, lease it or control it Family and social ties where your family live (especially immediate family) and if you belong to any New Zealand clubs, associations or organisations Economic ties if you have bank accounts, credit cards, investments, life insurance or superannuation funds here Employment or business if you run a business or you're employed here, if you have (or may have) employment to return to, the terms of any employment contract Personal property if you have vehicles, clothing, furniture or other property or possessions kept here Intentions whether you intend to come back to New Zealand to live, and if you do, when Benefits, pensions and other payments whether you receive any welfare benefits, pensions or other payments from a New Zealand agency or organisation This list is a guide only - you’ll need to consider your overall situation when working out whether you’re a New Zealand tax resident. Please note that even if you maintain ties (or even a physical home) in other countries, you can still be a New Zealand tax resident. As long as you have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand you'll always be a resident. This test overrides any rules about the number of days you're here. If you're a New Zealand tax resident and also a tax resident of another country under that country's tax laws, it's possible that you could be taxed twice on the same income. To avoid this, New Zealand has double tax agreements with many other countries. These agreements are explained on page 12. 8 ird.govt.nz Paying tax as a resident If you're a New Zealand resident you're taxed on your worldwide income. In your first New Zealand tax return you must include your worldwide income from all sources from the date you arrived in New Zealand. You're normally allowed a credit for any tax paid overseas, up to the amount of New Zealand income tax payable on that overseas income. To claim a credit you'll need to be able to produce records that show the overseas tax you've paid. In New Zealand the tax on each person’s income is calculated separately. For example, there are no joint assessments for a husband, wife or partner. Note Temporary tax exemption on foreign income Most types of individual income derived from overseas may be temporarily exempt from tax in New Zealand. This temporary tax exemption is available to people who: •qualify as a tax resident in New Zealand on or after 1 April 2006, and •are new migrants or returning New Zealanders who have not been resident for tax purposes in New Zealand for at least 10 years prior to their arrival in New Zealand. The temporary tax exemption for foreign income starts on the first day that you are a tax resident here. It ends 48 months after the month you qualify as a tax resident in New Zealand. Sarah was in New Zealand from 10 to 14 March 2016. She then moved here on 22 April 2016, and qualified as a tax resident on 16 October 2016. She met the criteria for her foreign income to be temporarily exempt from tax in New Zealand. Sarah’s exemption applies from 10 March 2016 until 31 October 2020. Example Qualifying for the exemption To be eligible for a temporary tax exemption on foreign income you must: •have qualified as a tax resident in New Zealand on or after 1 April 2006 •not have been a New Zealand tax resident at any time in the past 10 years before you qualified again as a tax resident in New Zealand (page 5 has information about New Zealand tax residence) •not have been eligible for this tax exemption before (including if you were eligible but chose to waive the exemption), and •not be receiving Working for Families Tax Credits (your spouse or partner must not be receiving them either). TAXES AND DUTIES 9 The exemption can only be granted once in a lifetime - you can't extend your tax exemption or renew it after its expiry date. There are some types of foreign income that don't qualify for a temporary tax exemption (refer to page 10). The exemption and Working for Families Tax Credits You can't receive Working for Families Tax Credits while being tax exempt from foreign income. If you're eligible for the temporary tax exemption on foreign income and you (or your spouse or partner) are also eligible for Working for Families Tax Credits, you need to decide which option is the best for your situation. If you decide to waive the temporary tax exemption so you can claim Working for Families Tax Credits, you'll need to show, in your Individual tax return - IR3, all the foreign income you received from the date of your arrival in New Zealand. Go to page 19 for information about Working for Families Tax Credits. How to claim the exemption The tax exemption is automatically granted if you're eligible. If you qualify for the exemption, you're not required to tell us about foreign income you receive (except for foreign income that doesn't qualify for the temporary tax exemption) for the period that your exemption applies. To contact us, call us within New Zealand on 0800 227 774, or on +64 4 978 0779 if you're calling from overseas. The types of foreign income temporarily exempt from tax in New Zealand are, for example: •controlled foreign company (CFC) income that is attributed under New Zealand's CFC rules •foreign investment fund (FIF) income that is attributed under New Zealand's FIF rules (including foreign superannuation) •non-resident withholding tax (eg, on foreign mortgages) •approved issuer levy (eg, on foreign mortgages) •income arising from the exercise of foreign employee share options •accrual income (from foreign financial arrangements) •income from foreign trusts •rental income derived offshore •foreign dividends •foreign interest •royalties derived offshore •income from employment performed overseas before coming to New Zealand, such as bonus payments 10 ird.govt.nz •gains on the sale of property derived offshore (held on revenue account) •offshore business income (that is unrelated to the performance of services). The foreign income that will continue to be taxed in New Zealand is: •employment income from overseas employment performed while living in New Zealand, and •business income relating to services performed offshore. If you receive non-exempt types of foreign income from the date of your arrival back in New Zealand, you'll need to show this income in your Individual tax return - IR3, even if you qualify for a temporary tax exemption on other types of foreign income. After the exemption has ended When your temporary tax exemption ends, you need to include all your foreign income, (received since your exemption ended) in your tax return along with your New Zealand income. You need to file a tax return after the end of your exemption and every tax year after that, as long as you have foreign income, regardless of whether or not you told us of your foreign income when you arrived in New Zealand. New Zealand's tax year runs from 1 April to 31 March. If your exemption ends at any time in a tax year other than on the standard balance date of 31 March, you'll need to apportion your foreign income received for that year in your tax return. Sam qualified as a tax resident in New Zealand on 10 September 2015 and met the criteria for his foreign income to be temporarily exempt from tax in New Zealand from 10 September 2015 until 30 September 2019. Sam’s exemption ends in the middle of a standard New Zealand tax year and he will continue to receive foreign income after his exemption ends (30 September 2019). In his IR3 for the year ending 31 March 2020 (the tax year that his exemption ended), Sam has to show the foreign income he received from 1 October 2019 to 31 March 2020.

TAXES AND DUTIES 11 Becoming a non-resident Remember that if you have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand you'll be a resident for tax purposes. However, if the ties and links described on page 7 suggest you don't have a permanent place of abode here, you can become a non-resident under the "325-day rule". The 325-day rule If you're away from New Zealand for more than 325 days in any 12-month period, and you don't have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, you'll become a non-resident for tax purposes. The 325 days don't have to be consecutive. Remember, if you're here for part of a day it's counted as a whole day. Recognised seasonal employers scheme Under the recognised seasonal employers scheme, workers from overseas are employed in the horticulture and viticulture industries. This is to help out with the shortage of local workers. If you're a recognised seasonal worker you're non-resident for New Zealand tax purposes, but you have to pay New Zealand tax on your New Zealand income. Your employer will deduct tax at a flat rate under the PAYE scheme. You need to use the NSW (non-resident seasonal worker) tax code on your Tax code declaration - IR330. Paying tax as a non-resident If you're a non-resident you're taxed here only on your income from New Zealand sources. Non-residents fill in a Non-resident individual tax return - IR3NR, which is different from a resident's tax return. If you're a non-resident with income from New Zealand, please make sure you let us know. This is so we can send you the right return form and tax you correctly. Normally, overseas countries will let you claim a credit for the tax that you pay on your income from New Zealand, limited to the overseas tax payable on the New Zealand income. 12 ird.govt.nz Double tax agreements To avoid double taxation if a person is a tax resident of two different countries, New Zealand has negotiated double tax agreements (DTAs) and Tax information exchange agreements (TIEAs) with many other countries. These DTAs and TIEAs establish rules to determine what taxing rights each country has. Most DTAs and TIEAs contain a "tie-breaker" clause to establish which country has prior claim when settling competing tax claims. These countries or territories have a DTA or TIEA with New Zealand AustraliaIndiaRussian Federation AustriaIndonesiaSamoa BelgiumIrelandSingapore CanadaIsle of ManSouth Africa Cayman IslandsItalySpain ChileJapanSweden ChinaJerseySwitzerland Cook IslandsKorea, Republic ofTa i w a n Czech RepublicMalaysiaThailand DenmarkMexicoTu r k e y FijiNetherlandsUnited Arab Emirates FinlandNorwayUnited Kingdom FrancePapua New GuineaUnited States of America GermanyPhilippinesVietnam Hong KongPoland To get more details about any of these, call us on 0800 227 774 if you're a salary or wage earner, or 0800 377 774 if you're in business. TAXES AND DUTIES 13 IRD numbers If you don't already have a New Zealand IRD number, you can apply for one by filling in an IRD number application - resident individual - IR595 form or complete the IRD number application form online at ird.govt.nz/IRDnumber If you're going to claim Working for Families Tax Credits (page 19) you'll also need to complete an IRD number application for all the children you're applying for. When applying for an IRD number you'll need some form of identification, eg, a birth certificate or current passport. Take the form with your identification documents to an Inland Revenue appointed verifier. Further details can be found on the form. For more information on applying for an IRD number go to ird.govt.nz/IRDnumber If you've had a New Zealand IRD number before, call us on 0800 227 774 to check that it's still valid. Once you have your IRD number, please have it handy whenever you call us. Balance dates New Zealand's tax year runs from 1 April to 31 March. Some individuals, all self-employed people and businesses have to fill in a tax return after 31 March each year to declare all their income and tax paid. Some self-employed people and businesses have a balance date other than 31 March, eg, some farmers have a 30 June balance date. Depending on the circumstances, we may give approval for other self-employed people and businesses to have a different balance date. 14 ird.govt.nz Part 2 - Types of taxes and duties Income tax In New Zealand, income tax is paid on these types of income: •salary and wages •business and self-employed income •most social security benefits •income from investments •rental income •in some circumstances profit from selling capital assets (this doesn't usually apply to personal assets sold) •income that a New Zealand resident earns from overseas. The level of your total gross income (before tax and allowable deductions) will determine what tax rates are applied. For tax rate details go to ird.govt.nz/tax-rates Tax credits Independent Earner Tax Credit There is a tax credit that can reduce the overall amount of tax you may have to pay if you're a New Zealand tax resident and your annual net income\* is between $24,000 and $48,000 and you: •aren't eligible for Working for Families Tax Credits (either you or your partner), •don't receive an income-tested benefit, NZ superannuation or veteran's pension, or an overseas equivalent of any of these. If your only income is from salary or wages (and you don't have any allowable expenses, eg, income protection insurance) your net income will be your annual salary or wages before tax. To find out about this tax credit, if you're eligible and how to claim it go to iird.govt.nz/ietc or phone 0800 227 774. Remember to have your IRD number handy. \* Net income means your total income from all sources less any allowable deductions or current year losses (not including any losses brought forward). TAXES AND DUTIES 15 Donations tax credits If you earn a taxable income (eg, salary, wages, benefit or self-employed income) there are also tax credits for making donations to charitable organisations. These tax credits can be claimed using a Tax credit claim form - IR526. You need to provide receipts with your claim. Paying tax on salary or wages If your income is from salary, wages or a social security benefit, your tax will be deducted under the PAYE (pay as you earn) system. This means the pay you get in your hand has already had tax deducted. If your employer provides non-cash benefits as part of your employment package, they'll pay fringe benefit tax on them. You won't be taxed on these benefits. When you receive income from employment (salary or wages): •give your employer your IRD number so that the correct amount of tax is deducted from your pay. If you don't have an IRD number, go to page 13 to find out how to get one. •fill in a Tax code declaration - IR330 to ensure that you're taxed at the correct rate. Without a tax code declaration, tax is deducted at the higher no-notification rate of 45 cents in the dollar. For information on what tax code to use for your job refer to the Tax code declaration - IR330 or ird.govt.nz/tax-codes Most salary and wage earners and those who receive benefits and pensions pay the correct amount of tax during the year. You will receive an Income tax assessment or be required to file an Individual tax return - IR3 at the end of the tax year, depending on your situation. To check if you need to file an IR3 log in to myIR at ird.govt.nz and use the online service. Paying tax on rental or business income You may earn income that doesn't have tax deducted before you receive it, eg, income from running your own business. In this situation (other than your first year in business) you'll generally have to pay your tax in instalments during the year. This is called provisional tax. When you file your tax return at the end of the financial year, the provisional tax you've already paid will be offset against the end-of-year tax amount you owe. 16 ird.govt.nz When you receive rental or business income, you need to: •apply for an IRD number for your business unless you are operating as a sole trader •keep accurate records •fill out an Individual tax return - IR3 each year and send it to us by the due date. When completing your IR3 you'll need to include income from all sources and work out the tax on your total taxable income. There are different requirements for getting an IRD number for a business, depending on what type of business you have. If you are operating as a sole trader you can use your own individual IRD number. Note Visit ird.govt.nz for more information on: •the requirements for getting an IRD number for your business •paying tax •expenses or deductions you can claim •GST (goods and service tax) and employer responsibilities •good business practices when running a business in New Zealand. Our Smart business - IR320 guide is for new and existing businesses. This guide includes information on basic income tax responsibilities, record and book keeping, claiming expenses, and information on GST and employer responsibilities. If you receive rental income, check our Rental income - IR264 guide for information on your tax responsibilities. A list of other useful publications is on page 22. GST (goods and services tax) GST is New Zealand's main type of tax apart from income tax. It is an indirect tax, which businesses (including retailers) charge as part of the cost of goods and services that they supply. The current rate is 15%. When a GST-registered business buys goods or services from its suppliers, it can claim a credit for the GST the suppliers charge on these purchases. However, end-user consumers can't claim a deduction for GST in this way. The effect of this is that the final consumer of any product or service pays 15% GST on its cost. GST is charged on virtually all goods and services supplied in New Zealand, except for rental of residential property, financial services such as mortgages, loans and investments, and the sale of a business that is capable of being carried on by the purchaser as a taxable activity (going concern). TAXES AND DUTIES 17 For more information on GST read our GST guide - IR375, or go to ird.govt.nz/gst Accident compensation New Zealand has a comprehensive accident insurance scheme which covers the costs of all work and non-work-related accidents. The Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) administers this scheme. Levies for cover are paid by employers and self-employed people directly to ACC. Inland Revenue collects employees' levies on behalf of ACC as part of the PAYE tax system. RWT (Resident withholding tax) If you receive interest from any person or organisation, RWT is deducted before the interest is credited to you. This might include interest from financial institutions such as banks, finance companies, building societies or credit unions. RWT rates The rate at which RWT is deducted from your interest depends on: •the rate you have elected •the date the interest is paid or credited •whether or not you've given your IRD number to the person or organisation who is paying you interest •whether or not you have elected an RWT rate with your interest payer •your income level. Which rate should I elect? If you've given your financial institution your IRD number, but not elected an RWT rate to be used, they'll deduct RWT at the no-notification rate. This may result in your RWT being deducted at too high a rate. The rate you choose needs to take into account all the income you expect to earn in the tax year, not just the income from your investment. For current RWT rates go to ird.govt.nz/rwt You can elect to have your interest deducted at a higher rate to avoid an end-of-year tax bill. If a financial institution doesn’t have a client’s IRD number it will deduct RWT at the no-notification rate. Note 18 ird.govt.nz How do I make an election? To make an RWT rate election you can either: •contact your bank or financial institution and tell them which rate you prefer to be on, or •complete a Choose your RWT deduction rate - IR456 form and give one to each bank or financial institution you deal with. The rate you choose will apply once your bank or financial institution has processed this information. International tax rules New Zealand residents must pay income tax in New Zealand on their worldwide income. In addition, a New Zealand resident who has significant investments overseas must calculate the income from those investments according to New Zealand tax rules. These calculation rules don't apply to ordinary overseas bank accounts that you hold. To declare the income from these bank accounts, you simply convert the interest to New Zealand dollars (using the exchange rate for the date on which the interest was credited) and include it in your tax return. For more involved or substantial overseas investments (including interests in superannuation schemes), the calculations can be quite complicated. To find out more about them contact your tax advisor or agent. Tr u s t s If you're a settlor, trustee or beneficiary of a trust outside New Zealand, there are some trust tax rules you may need to know about. Refer to our Trusts and estates income tax rules - IR288 guide for more information. TAXES AND DUTIES 19 Part 3 - Social assistance Child support Child support is money paid by parents not living with their children to help financially support those children, when: •a couple who have children split up, or •two people have children and are not living together, or •dependent children are no longer living with either parent. Child support is not a tax, it's a payment administered by Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue Child Support assesses the amount the paying parent needs to pay and collects this money. It's then passed on to the person looking after the children to help with the costs of bringing them up, or to the government where the receiving carer is receiving a sole parent benefit to help offset the cost of the benefit. Some parents pay financial support direct to the other parent without the money passing through Inland Revenue Child Support. This can happen when the person caring for the children isn't receiving a sole parent benefit. For more information about child support please go to ird.govt.nz/childsupport or call 0800 221 221. Working for Families Tax Credits Working for Families Tax Credits are for families with children aged 18 or under. There are different types of payments and you may qualify for one or more, depending on your family situation. How much you can get depends on: •how many dependent children you have who are 18 or younger •your children's ages •any shared care arrangements •how much you and your spouse or partner earn (your family income) •where your family income comes from, eg, salary or wages, business, student allowance or a benefit, and •the number of hours you work each week. You also have to meet residency requirements to be eligible for Working for Families Tax Credits. 20 ird.govt.nz Partner means your civil union or de facto partner. Note The Working for Families Tax Credits payment types are: Family tax credit (FTC) This payment depends on how much you earn, the number of dependent children you have, and any shared care arrangements. We pay FTC if you're a working family, when you receive a student allowance or NZ Super. Work and Income often pays FTC to families receiving a benefit. In-work tax credit (IWTC) This payment is for families who are normally in paid work: As long as families receive income from paid work or receive certain compensation payments, IWTC is available to parents who are: •self-employed •receiving NZ Super •receiving a Veteran's Pension, or veteran's weekly compensation payments. It isn't available to families receiving an income-tested benefit or student allowance. You can get IWTC if you and/or your spouse or partner are normally in paid work, but are receiving accident compensation for an injury that happened on or after 1 January 2006. Minimum family tax credit (MFTC) MFTC is payable to families working for salary or wages who earn an annual family income up to $27,768 after tax from 1 April 2019. This is to ensure those families have a minimum income of $534 a week after tax. A single parent must be working at least 20 hours a week, and in a two-parent family, one or both parents between them must be working at least 30 hours a week. If you and/or your spouse or partner would normally work the required weekly hours but are injured and receive accident compensation instead, you can still qualify for MFTC. TAXES AND DUTIES 21 Best Start tax credit (BSTC) BSTC is available for children due or born on or after 1 July 2018. BSTC was introduced to assist families with the costs in a child's early years. You can get this payment for up to three years after a new child arrives. You can receive up to $3,120 per year, or $60 a week. BSTC is not adjusted for income levels in your child's first year but is adjusted in the second and third year.

We also explain the following social assistance programmes that we administer: •Child support - money paid by a parent not living with their children to help support their children financially. •Working for Families Tax Credits - an entitlement for families with dependent children aged 18 and under. This guide deals with tax residence rules only. The tax residence rules are different from the usual New Zealand immigration and residency rules. When we refer to a "New Zealand resident" or a "non-resident", we mean a New Zealand resident or non- resident for tax purposes. Note On page 22 you'll find a list of other publications for more detailed information about the topics covered in this guide. The information in this guide is based on current tax laws at the time of printing. TAXES AND DUTIES 5 Part 1 - General information New Zealand's tax system Everyone in New Zealand must pay their share of tax by law. This is how the government funds public services such as education, healthcare, roads and welfare. Almost all New Zealanders contribute to these services through the taxes they pay. New Zealand residents pay income tax in New Zealand on their worldwide income. If you are a New Zealand resident, most of the income you receive will be subject to tax. This includes income from personal effort, investments, benefits, pensions and overseas. New Zealand also has a goods and services tax (GST), which is included in the price you pay for most goods and services. New Zealand does not have a capital gains tax, but profits from selling some assets can be taxed in some circumstances. There's no tax on cash or personal assets you bring into New Zealand. Inland Revenue is the main government department that administers tax laws and collects tax payments. New Zealand Customs also collects some taxes and duties on imported goods. New Zealand's tax system relies on people's honesty in complying with the tax laws. It's important you understand your tax responsibilities, to avoid being penalised. Tax residence The residence rules set out in tax law is different from the normal citizenship rules. Having New Zealand citizenship or permanent residence does not necessarily mean you are a resident for tax purposes. On the other hand, you could be a resident for tax purposes, but not hold citizenship here. As an individual, you are a New Zealand resident for tax purposes if you meet any of these conditions: •You've been in New Zealand for more than 183 days in any 12-month period and have not become a non-resident (refer to page 11). •You have a "permanent place of abode" in New Zealand. •You are away from New Zealand in the service of the New Zealand government. 6 ird.govt.nz The 183-day rule If you've been in New Zealand for more than 183 days in any 12-month period, you are considered to be a New Zealand tax resident from the first of those 183 days. The 183 days do not have to be consecutive. For example, if you come to New Zealand for 10 days in April and then return for 20 days in September of the same year, that's counted as 30 days. If you are in New Zealand for part of a day, it's counted as being a whole day. This means that the days you arrive or depart are treated as days present in New Zealand. If you've ever been resident in New Zealand under the 183-day rule you remain resident until you become a non-resident (refer to page 11). A permanent place of abode in New Zealand The Income Tax Act 2007 says that a person, other than a company, who has a "permanent place of abode" in New Zealand is a New Zealand tax resident. This means there must be somewhere in New Zealand you could live (such as a house or other dwelling).All your ties and links with New Zealand also need to be considered. If you have strong ties to New Zealand it's likely that you have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. If there is somewhere in New Zealand you could live, it's necessary to decide whether it's your permanent place of abode - the following table has more information. TAXES AND DUTIES 7 To decide you need to consider all your circumstances. Do you have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand? CircumstanceLook at Presence in New Zealand how much time you spend in New Zealand, and whether you are here continuously or from time to time Accommodation how you've previously used the accommodation you have in New Zealand, and your connection with it. Do you own it, lease it or control it? Family and social ties where your family live (especially immediate family) and if you belong to any New Zealand clubs, associations, or organisations Economic ties if you have bank accounts, credit cards, investments, life insurance or superannuation funds here Employment or business if you run a business or you are employed here. If you have (or may have) employment to return to, the terms of any employment contract Personal property if you have vehicles, clothing, furniture or other property or possessions kept here Intentions whether you intend to come back to New Zealand to live, and if you do, when Benefits, pensions and other payments whether you receive any welfare benefits, pensions or other payments from a New Zealand agency or organisation This list is a guide only - you’ll need to consider your overall situation when working out whether you are a New Zealand tax resident. Even if you maintain ties or even a physical home in other countries, you can still be a New Zealand tax resident. As long as you have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, you'll always be a resident. This test overrides any rules about the number of days you are here. If you are a New Zealand tax resident and also a tax resident of another country under that country's tax laws, it's possible you could be taxed twice on the same income. To avoid this, New Zealand has double tax agreements with many other countries. These agreements are explained on page 12. 8 ird.govt.nz Paying tax as a resident If you are a New Zealand resident you are taxed on your worldwide income. In your first New Zealand tax return you must include your worldwide income from all sources from the date you arrived in New Zealand. You are normally allowed a credit for any tax paid overseas, up to the amount of New Zealand income tax payable on that overseas income. To claim a credit, you'll need to be able to produce records that show the overseas tax you've paid. In New Zealand the tax on each person’s income is calculated separately. For example, there are no joint assessments for a spouse or partner. Note Temporary tax exemption on foreign income Most types of individual income from overseas may be temporarily exempt from tax in New Zealand. This temporary tax exemption is available to people who: •qualify as a tax resident in New Zealand on or after 1 April 2006, and •are new migrants or returning New Zealanders who have not been resident for tax purposes in New Zealand for at least 10 years prior to their arrival in New Zealand. The temporary tax exemption for foreign income starts on the first day that you are a tax resident here. It ends 48 months after the month you qualify as a tax resident in New Zealand. Sarah was in New Zealand from 10 to 14 March 2016. She then moved here on 22 April 2016 and qualified as a tax resident on 16 October 2016. She met the criteria for her foreign income to be temporarily exempt from tax in New Zealand. Sarah’s exemption applies from 10 March 2016 until 31 October 2020. Example Qualifying for the exemption To be eligible for a temporary tax exemption on foreign income you must: •have qualified as a tax resident in New Zealand on or after 1 April 2006 •not have been a New Zealand tax resident at any time in the past 10 years before you qualified again as a tax resident in New Zealand (page 5 has information about New Zealand tax residence) •not have been eligible for this tax exemption before (including if you were eligible but chose to waive the exemption), and •not be receiving Working for Families Tax Credits (partner must not be receiving them either). TAXES AND DUTIES 9 The exemption can only be granted once in a lifetime - you cannot extend your tax exemption or renew it after its expiry date. There are some types of foreign income that do not qualify for a temporary tax exemption (refer to page 10). The exemption and Working for Families Tax Credits You cannot receive Working for Families Tax Credits while being tax exempt from foreign income. If you are eligible for the temporary tax exemption on foreign income and you (or your partner) are also eligible for Working for Families Tax Credits, you need to decide which option is the best for your situation. If you decide to waive the temporary tax exemption so you can claim Working for Families Tax Credits, you'll need to show, in your Individual tax return - IR3, all the foreign income you received from the date of your arrival in New Zealand. Go to page 19 for information about Working for Families Tax Credits. How to claim the exemption If you are eligible, the tax exemption is automatically granted. If you qualify you do not need to tell us about foreign income you receive for the period that your exemption applies. However, you must tell us about any foreign income that does not qualify for the temporary tax exemption. You can contact us within New Zealand on 0800 227 774, or if you are calling from overseas, +64 4 978 0779. The types of foreign income temporarily exempt from tax in New Zealand are, for example: •controlled foreign company (CFC) income that is attributed under New Zealand's CFC rules •foreign investment fund (FIF) income that is attributed under New Zealand's FIF rules (including foreign superannuation) •non-resident withholding tax (for example, on foreign mortgages) •approved issuer levy (for example, on foreign mortgages) •income arising from the exercise of foreign employee share options •accrual income (from foreign financial arrangements) •income from foreign trusts •rental income derived offshore •foreign dividends •foreign interest •royalties derived offshore •income from employment performed overseas before coming to New Zealand, such as bonus payments 10 ird.govt.nz •gains on the sale of property derived offshore (held on revenue account) •offshore business income (that is unrelated to the performance of services). The foreign income that will continue to be taxed in New Zealand is: •employment income from overseas employment performed while living in New Zealand, and •business income relating to services performed offshore. If you receive non-exempt types of foreign income from the date of your arrival back in New Zealand, you'll need to show this income in your Individual tax return - IR3, even if you qualify for a temporary tax exemption on other types of foreign income. After the exemption has ended When your temporary tax exemption ends you need to include all foreign income received since your exemption ended in your tax return along with your New Zealand income. You need to file a tax return after the end of your exemption and every tax year after that, as long as you have foreign income, regardless of whether or not you told us of your foreign income when you arrived in New Zealand. New Zealand's tax year runs from 1 April to 31 March. If your exemption ends at any time in a tax year other than on the standard balance date of 31 March, you'll need to apportion your foreign income received for that year in your tax return. Sam qualified as a tax resident in New Zealand on 10 September 2015 and met the criteria for his foreign income to be temporarily exempt from tax in New Zealand from 10 September 2015 until 30 September 2019. Sam’s exemption ends in the middle of a standard New Zealand tax year and he will continue to receive foreign income after his exemption ends (30 September 2019). In his IR3 for the year ending 31 March 2020 (the tax year that his exemption ended), Sam has to show the foreign income he received from 1 October 2019 to 31 March 2020.

TAXES AND DUTIES 11 Becoming a non-resident Remember that if you have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand you'll be a resident for tax purposes. However, if the ties and links described on page 7 suggest you do not have a permanent place of abode here, you can become a non-resident under the "325-day rule". The 325-day rule If you are away from New Zealand for more than 325 days in any 12-month period, and you do not have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, you'll become a non-resident for tax purposes. The 325 days do not have to be consecutive. Remember, if you are here for part of a day it's counted as a whole day. Recognised seasonal employer scheme Under the recognised seasonal employer scheme, workers from overseas are employed in the horticulture and viticulture industries. This is to help with the shortage of local workers. If you are a recognised seasonal worker you are non-resident for New Zealand tax purposes, but you must pay New Zealand tax on your New Zealand income. Your employer will deduct tax at a flat rate under the PAYE scheme. You need to use the NSW (non-resident seasonal worker) tax code on your Tax code declaration - IR330. Paying tax as a non-resident If you are a non-resident you are taxed here only on your income from New Zealand sources. Non-residents file a Non-resident individual tax return - IR3NR, which is different from a resident's tax return. If you are a non-resident with income from New Zealand, please make sure you let us know. This is so we can send you the right return form and tax you correctly. Normally, overseas countries will let you claim a credit for the tax that you pay on your income from New Zealand, limited to the overseas tax payable on the New Zealand income. 12 ird.govt.nz Double tax agreements To avoid double taxation of a person who is a tax resident of two different countries, New Zealand has negotiated double tax agreements (DTAs) and Tax information exchange agreements (TIEAs) with many other countries. These DTAs and TIEAs establish rules to determine what taxing rights each country has. Most DTAs and TIEAs contain a "tie- breaker" clause to establish which country has prior claim when settling competing tax claims. These countries or territories have a DTA or TIEA with New Zealand AustraliaIndiaRussian Federation AustriaIndonesiaSamoa BelgiumIrelandSingapore CanadaIsle of ManSouth Africa Cayman IslandsItalySpain ChileJapanSweden ChinaJerseySwitzerland Cook IslandsKorea, Republic ofTa i w a n Czech RepublicMalaysiaThailand DenmarkMexicoTu r k e y FijiNetherlandsUnited Arab Emirates FinlandNorwayUnited Kingdom FrancePapua New GuineaUnited States of America GermanyPhilippinesVietnam Hong KongPoland To get more details about any of these, call us on 0800 227 774 if you are a salary or wage earner, or 0800 377 774 if you are in business. TAXES AND DUTIES 13 IRD numbers If you do not already have a New Zealand IRD number, you can apply for one by filling in an IRD number application - resident individual - IR595 form or complete the IRD number application form online at ird.govt.nz/IRDnumber. If you are going to claim Working for Families Tax Credits (page 19) you'll also need to complete an IRD number application for all the children you are applying for. When applying for an IRD number you'll need some identification, such as a birth certificate or current passport. Take the IR595 form with your identification documents to an Inland Revenue appointed verifier. Further details can be found on the form. For more information on applying for an IRD number go to ird.govt.nz/IRDnumber If you've had a New Zealand IRD number before, call us on 0800 227 774 to check it's still valid. Once you have your IRD number, please have it handy whenever you call us. Balance dates New Zealand's tax year runs from 1 April to 31 March. All self-employed people, businesses and some individuals must complete a tax return after 31 March each year to declare all their income and tax paid. Some self-employed people and businesses have a balance date other than 31 March, for example, some farmers have a 30 June balance date. Depending on the circumstances, we may give approval for other self-employed people and businesses to have a different balance date. 14 ird.govt.nz Part 2 - Types of taxes and duties Income tax In New Zealand, income tax is paid on these types of income: •salary and wages •business and self-employed income •most social security benefits •income from investments •rental income •in some circumstances profit from selling capital assets (this does not usually apply to personal assets sold) •income that a New Zealand resident earns from overseas. The level of your total gross income (before tax and allowable deductions) will determine what tax rates are applied. For tax rate details go to ird.govt.nz/tax-rates Tax credits Independent Earner Tax Credit There is a tax credit that can reduce the overall amount of tax you may have to pay if you are a New Zealand tax resident and your annual net income\* is between $24,000 and $48,000 and you: •are not eligible for Working for Families Tax Credits (either you or your partner), •do not receive an income-tested benefit, NZ superannuation or veteran's pension, or an overseas equivalent of any of these. •Net income means your total income from all sources less any allowable deductions or current year losses, not including any losses brought forward. If your only income is from salary or wages and you do not have any allowable expenses, for example, income protection insurance your net income will be your annual salary or wages before tax. To find out about this tax credit, go to ird.govt.nz/ietc or phone 0800 227 774. Remember to have your IRD number handy. Donations tax credits If you earn a taxable income (for example, salary, wages, benefit or self-employed income) there are also tax credits for making donations to charitable organisations. TAXES AND DUTIES 15 These tax credits can be claimed using a Tax credit claim form - IR526. You need to provide receipts with your claim. Paying tax on salary or wages If your income is from salary, wages or a social security benefit, your tax will be deducted under the PAYE (pay as you earn) system. This means the pay you get in your hand has already had tax deducted. If your employer provides non-cash benefits as part of your employment package, they'll pay fringe benefit tax on them. You will not be taxed on these benefits. When you receive income from employment (salary or wages): •give your employer your IRD number so that the correct amount of tax is deducted from your pay. If you do not have an IRD number, go to page 13 to find out how to get one. •complete a Tax code declaration - IR330 to ensure that you are taxed at the correct rate. Without a tax code declaration, tax is deducted at the higher no-notification rate of 45 cents in the dollar. For information on what tax code to use for your job refer to the Tax code declaration - IR330 or ird.govt.nz/tax-codes Most salary and wage earners and those who receive benefits and pensions pay the correct amount of tax during the year. You will receive an Income tax assessment or be required to file an Individual tax return - IR3 at the end of the tax year, depending on your situation. To check if you need to file an IR3 log in to myIR at ird.govt.nz and use the online service. Paying tax on rental or business income You may earn income that does not have tax deducted before you receive it, such as income from running your own business. In this situation other than your first year in business you'll generally have to pay your tax in instalments during the year. This is called provisional tax. When you file your tax return at the end of the financial year, the provisional tax you've already paid will be offset against the end-of-year tax amount you owe. When you receive rental or business income, you need to: •apply for an IRD number for your business unless you are operating as a sole trader •keep accurate records •fill out an Individual tax return - IR3 each year and send it to us by the due date. When completing your IR3 you'll need to include income from all sources and work out the tax on your total taxable income. 16 ird.govt.nz There are different requirements for getting an IRD number for a business, depending on what type of business you have. If you are operating as a sole trader, you can use your own individual IRD number. Note Visit ird.govt.nz for more information on: •the requirements for getting an IRD number for your business •paying tax •expenses or deductions you can claim •GST (goods and service tax) and employer responsibilities •good business practices when running a business in New Zealand. Our Smart business - IR320 guide is for new and existing businesses. This guide includes information on basic income tax responsibilities, bookkeeping, claiming expenses, GST and employer responsibilities. If you receive rental income, check our Rental income - IR264 guide for information on your tax responsibilities. A list of other useful publications is on page 22. GST (goods and services tax) GST is New Zealand's main type of tax after income tax. It is an indirect tax business (including retailers) charge as part of the cost of goods and services that they supply. The current rate is 15%. When a GST-registered business buys goods or services from its suppliers, it can claim a credit for the GST the suppliers charge on these purchases. However, end-user consumers cannot claim a deduction for GST in this way. This means the final consumer of any product or service pays 15% GST on its cost. GST is charged on almost all goods and services supplied in New Zealand, except for rental of residential property, financial services such as mortgages, loans and investments, and the sale of a business that is capable of being carried on by the purchaser as a taxable activity (going concern). For more information on GST read our GST guide - IR375, or go to ird.govt.nz/gst TAXES AND DUTIES 17 Accident compensation New Zealand has a comprehensive accident insurance scheme which covers the costs of all work and non-work-related accidents. The Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) administers this scheme. Levies for cover are paid by employers and self-employed people directly to ACC. Inland Revenue collects employees levies on behalf of ACC as part of the PAYE tax system. RWT (Resident withholding tax) If you receive interest from any person or organisation, RWT is deducted before the interest is credited to you. This might include interest from financial institutions such as banks, finance companies, building societies or credit unions. RWT rates The rate at which RWT is deducted from your interest depends on: •the rate you have elected •the date the interest is paid or credited •whether or not you've given your IRD number to the person or organisation who is paying you interest •whether or not you have elected an RWT rate with your interest payer •your income level. Which rate should I elect? If you've given your financial institution your IRD number, but not elected an RWT rate to be used, they'll deduct RWT at the no-notification rate. This may result in your RWT being deducted at too high a rate. The rate you choose needs to account for the income you expect to earn in the tax year, not just the income from your investment. For current RWT rates go to ird.govt.nz/rwt You can elect to have your interest deducted at a higher rate to avoid an end-of-year tax bill. If a financial institution does not have a client’s IRD number, it will deduct RWT at the no-notification rate. Note 18 ird.govt.nz How do I make an election? To make an RWT rate election you can either: •contact your bank or financial institution and tell them which rate you prefer to be on, or •complete a Choose your RWT deduction rate - IR456 form and give one to each bank or financial institution you deal with. The rate you choose will apply once your bank or financial institution has processed this information. International tax rules New Zealand residents must pay income tax in New Zealand on their worldwide income. In addition, a New Zealand resident who has significant investments overseas must calculate the income from those investments according to New Zealand tax rules. These calculation rules do not apply to ordinary overseas bank accounts that you hold. To declare the income from these bank accounts, you simply convert the interest to New Zealand dollars (using the exchange rate for the date on which the interest was credited) and include it in your tax return. For more involved or substantial overseas investments (including interests in superannuation schemes), the calculations can be quite complicated. To find out more about them contact your tax advisor or agent. Tr u s t s If you are a settlor, trustee, or beneficiary of a trust outside New Zealand, there are some trust tax rules you may need to know about. Refer to our guide Trusts and estates income tax rules - IR288 for more information. TAXES AND DUTIES 19 Part 3 - Support for families Child support Child support is money paid by parents not living with their children to help financially support those children, when: •a couple who have children split up, or •two people have children and are not living together, or •dependent children are no longer living with either parent. Child support is not a tax, it's a payment administered by Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue Child Support assesses the amount the paying parent needs to pay and collects this money. It's then passed on to the person looking after the children to help with the costs of bringing them up, or to the government where the receiving carer is receiving a sole parent benefit to help offset the cost of the benefit. Some parents pay financial support direct to the other parent without the money passing through Inland Revenue Child Support. This can only happen when the person caring for the children is not receiving a sole parent benefit. For more information about child support please go to ird.govt.nz/childsupport or call 0800 221 221. Working for Families Tax Credits Working for Families Tax Credits are for families with children aged 18 or under. There are different types of payments and you may qualify for one or more, depending on your family situation. How much you can get depends on: •how many dependent children you have who are 18 or younger •your children's ages •any shared care arrangements •how much you and your partner earn (your family income) •where your family income comes from, eg, salary or wages, business, student allowance or a benefit, and •the number of hours you work each week. You also have to meet residency requirements to be eligible for Working for Families Tax Credits. 20 ird.govt.nz Partner means your civil union or de facto partner. Note The Working for Families Tax Credits payment types are: Family tax credit (FTC) This payment depends on how much you earn, the number of dependent children you have, and any shared care arrangements. We pay FTC if you are a working family, if you receive a student allowance or receive NZ Super. Work and Income often pays FTC to families receiving a benefit. In-work tax credit (IWTC) This payment is for families who are normally in paid work: As long as families receive income from paid work or receive certain compensation payments, IWTC is available to parents who are: •self-employed •receiving NZ Super •receiving a Veteran's Pension, or veteran's weekly compensation payments. You can get IWTC if you and/or your partner are normally in paid work but are receiving accident compensation for an injury that happened on or after 1 January 2006. It is not available to families receiving an income-tested benefit or student allowance. From 1 April 2021, you will keep receiving the in-work tax credit payments for up to two weeks during an unpaid break from work. For example, changing jobs, leaving employment or unpaid time such as school holidays. Payments will stop if you/your partner start receiving an income-tested benefit or student allowance during this two week period. Minimum family tax credit (MFTC) MFTC is payable to families working for salary or wages who earn an annual family income up to$30,576 after tax from 1 April 2021. This increases to $31,096 from 1 July 2021. MFTC ensures families can have a minimum weekly income after tax of $588 from 1 April to 30 June 2021 and $598 from 1 July 2021 to 31 March 2022. A single parent must be working at least 20 hours a week, and in a two-parent family, one or both parents between them must be working at least 30 hours a week. If you and/or your partner would normally work the required weekly hours but are injured and receive accident compensation instead, you can still qualify for MFTC. TAXES AND DUTIES 21 Best Start tax credit (BSTC) BSTC is available for children due or born on or after 1 July 2018. BSTC was introduced to assist families with the costs in a child's early years. You can get this payment for up to three years after a new child arrives. You can receive up to $3,120 per year, or $60 a week. BSTC is not adjusted for income levels in your child's first year but is adjusted in the second and third year.

We also explain the following social assistance programmes that we administer: •Child support - money paid by a parent not living with their children to help support their children financially. •Working for Families - an entitlement for families with dependent children aged 18 and und er. This guide deals with tax residence rules only. The tax residence rules are different from the usual New Zealand immigration and residency rules. When we refer to a "New Zealand resident" or a "non-resident", we mean a New Zealand resident or non- resident for tax purposes. Note On page 22 you'll find a list of other publications for more detailed information about the topics covered in this guide. The information in this guide is based on current tax laws at the time of printing. TAXES AND DUTIES 5 Part 1 - General information New Zealand's tax system Everyone in New Zealand must pay their share of tax by law. This is how the government funds public services such as education, healthcare, roads and welfare. Almost all New Zealanders contribute to these services through the taxes they pay. New Zealand residents pay income tax in New Zealand on their worldwide income. If you are a New Zealand resident, most of the income you receive will be subject to tax. This includes income from personal effort, investments, benefits, pensions and overseas. New Zealand also has a goods and services tax (GST), which is included in the price you pay for most goods and services. New Zealand does not have a capital gains tax, but profits from selling some assets can be taxed in some circumstances. There's no tax on cash or personal assets you bring into New Zealand. Inland Revenue is the main government department that administers tax laws and collects tax payments. New Zealand Customs also collects some taxes and duties on imported goods. New Zealand's tax system relies on people's honesty in complying with the tax laws. It's important you understand your tax responsibilities, to avoid being penalised. Tax residence The residence rules set out in tax law is different from the normal citizenship rules. Having New Zealand citizenship or permanent residence does not necessarily mean you are a resident for tax purposes. On the other hand, you could be a resident for tax purposes, but not hold citizenship here. As an individual, you are a New Zealand resident for tax purposes if you meet any of these conditions: •You've been in New Zealand for more than 183 days in any 12-month period and have not become a non-resident (refer to page 11). •You have a "permanent place of abode" in New Zealand. •You are away from New Zealand in the service of the New Zealand government. 6 ird.govt.nz The 183-day rule If you've been in New Zealand for more than 183 days in any 12-month period, you are considered to be a New Zealand tax resident from the first of those 183 days. The 183 days do not have to be consecutive. For example, if you come to New Zealand for 10 days in April and then return for 20 days in September of the same year, that's counted as 30 days. If you are in New Zealand for part of a day, it's counted as being a whole day. This means that the days you arrive or depart are treated as days present in New Zealand. If you've ever been resident in New Zealand under the 183-day rule you remain resident until you become a non-resident (refer to page 11). A permanent place of abode in New Zealand The Income Tax Act 2007 says that a person, other than a company, who has a "permanent place of abode" in New Zealand is a New Zealand tax resident. This means there must be somewhere in New Zealand you could live (such as a house or other dwelling).All your ties and links with New Zealand also need to be considered. If you have strong ties to New Zealand it's likely that you have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. If there is somewhere in New Zealand you could live, it's necessary to decide whether it's your permanent place of abode - the following table has more information. TAXES AND DUTIES 7 To decide you need to consider all your circumstances. Do you have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand? CircumstanceLook at Presence in New Zealand how much time you spend in New Zealand, and whether you are here continuously or from time to time Accommodation how you've previously used the accommodation you have in New Zealand, and your connection with it. Do you own it, lease it or control it? Family and social ties where your family live (especially immediate family) and if you belong to any New Zealand clubs, associations, or organisations Economic ties if you have bank accounts, credit cards, investments, life insurance or superannuation funds here Employment or business if you run a business or you are employed here. If you have (or may have) employment to return to, the terms of any employment contract Personal property if you have vehicles, clothing, furniture or other property or possessions kept here Intentions whether you intend to come back to New Zealand to live, and if you do, when Benefits, pensions and other payments whether you receive any welfare benefits, pensions or other payments from a New Zealand agency or organisation This list is a guide only - you’ll need to consider your overall situation when working out whether you are a New Zealand tax resident. Even if you maintain ties or even a physical home in other countries, you can still be a New Zealand tax resident. As long as you have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, you'll always be a resident. This test overrides any rules about the number of days you are here. If you are a New Zealand tax resident and also a tax resident of another country under that country's tax laws, it's possible you could be taxed twice on the same income. To avoid this, New Zealand has double tax agreements with many other countries. These agreements are explained on page 12. 8 ird.govt.nz Paying tax as a resident If you are a New Zealand resident you are taxed on your worldwide income. In your first New Zealand tax return you must include your worldwide income from all sources from the date you arrived in New Zealand. You are normally allowed a credit for any tax paid overseas, up to the amount of New Zealand income tax payable on that overseas income. To claim a credit, you'll need to be able to produce records that show the overseas tax you've paid. In New Zealand the tax on each person’s income is calculated separately. For example, there are no joint assessments for a spouse or partner. Note Temporary tax exemption on foreign income Most types of individual income from overseas may be temporarily exempt from tax in New Zealand. This temporary tax exemption is available to people who: •qualify as a tax resident in New Zealand on or after 1 April 2006, and •are new migrants or returning New Zealanders who have not been resident for tax purposes in New Zealand for at least 10 years prior to their arrival in New Zealand. The temporary tax exemption for foreign income starts on the first day that you are a tax resident here. It ends 48 months after the month you qualify as a tax resident in New Zealand. Sarah was in New Zealand from 10 to 14 March 2016. She then moved here on 22 April 2016 and qualified as a tax resident on 16 October 2016. She met the criteria for her foreign income to be temporarily exempt from tax in New Zealand. Sarah’s exemption applies from 10 March 2016 until 31 October 2020. Example Qualifying for the exemption To be eligible for a temporary tax exemption on foreign income you must: •have qualified as a tax resident in New Zealand on or after 1 April 2006 •not have been a New Zealand tax resident at any time in the past 10 years before you qualified again as a tax resident in New Zealand (page 5 has information about New Zealand tax residence) •not have been eligible for this tax exemption before (including if you were eligible but chose to waive the exemption), and •not be receiving Working for Families (partner must not be receiving them either). TAXES AND DUTIES 9 The exemption can only be granted once in a lifetime - you cannot extend your tax exemption or renew it after its expiry date. There are some types of foreign income that do not qualify for a temporary tax exemption (refer to page 10). The exemption and Working for Families You cannot receive Working for Families while being tax exempt from foreign income. If you are eligible for the temporary tax exemption on foreign income and you (or your partner) are also eligible for Working for Families, you need to decide which option is the best for your situation. If you decide to waive the temporary tax exemption so you can claim Working for Families, you’ll need to show, in your Individual tax return - IR3, all the foreign income you received from the date of your arrival in New Zealand. Go to page 19 for information about Working for Families. How to claim the exemption If you are eligible, the tax exemption is automatically granted. If you qualify you do not need to tell us about foreign income you receive for the period that your exemption applies. However, you must tell us about any foreign income that does not qualify for the temporary tax exemption. You can contact us within New Zealand on 0800 227 774, or if you are calling from overseas, +64 4 978 0779. The types of foreign income temporarily exempt from tax in New Zealand are, for example: •controlled foreign company (CFC) income that is attributed under New Zealand's CFC rules •foreign investment fund (FIF) income that is attributed under New Zealand's FIF rules (including foreign superannuation) •non-resident withholding tax (for example, on foreign mortgages) •approved issuer levy (for example, on foreign mortgages) •income arising from the exercise of foreign employee share options •accrual income (from foreign financial arrangements) •income from foreign trusts •rental income derived offshore •foreign dividends •foreign interest •royalties derived offshore •income from employment performed overseas before coming to New Zealand, such as bonus payments 10 ird.govt.nz •gains on the sale of property derived offshore (held on revenue account) •offshore business income (that is unrelated to the performance of services). The foreign income that will continue to be taxed in New Zealand is: •employment income from overseas employment performed while living in New Zealand, and •business income relating to services performed offshore. If you receive non-exempt types of foreign income from the date of your arrival back in New Zealand, you'll need to show this income in your Individual tax return - IR3, even if you qualify for a temporary tax exemption on other types of foreign income. After the exemption has ended When your temporary tax exemption ends you need to include all foreign income received since your exemption ended in your tax return along with your New Zealand income. You need to file a tax return after the end of your exemption and every tax year after that, as long as you have foreign income, regardless of whether or not you told us of your foreign income when you arrived in New Zealand. New Zealand's tax year runs from 1 April to 31 March. If your exemption ends at any time in a tax year other than on the standard balance date of 31 March, you'll need to apportion your foreign income received for that year in your tax return. Sam qualified as a tax resident in New Zealand on 10 September 2015 and met the criteria for his foreign income to be temporarily exempt from tax in New Zealand from 10 September 2015 until 30 September 2019. Sam’s exemption ends in the middle of a standard New Zealand tax year and he will continue to receive foreign income after his exemption ends (30 September 2019). In his IR3 for the year ending 31 March 2020 (the tax year that his exemption ended), Sam has to show the foreign income he received from 1 October 2019 to 31 March 2020.

TAXES AND DUTIES 11 Becoming a non-resident Remember that if you have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand you'll be a resident for tax purposes. However, if the ties and links described on page 7 suggest you do not have a permanent place of abode here, you can become a non-resident under the "325-day rule". The 325-day rule If you are away from New Zealand for more than 325 days in any 12-month period, and you do not have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, you'll become a non-resident for tax purposes. The 325 days do not have to be consecutive. Remember, if you are here for part of a day it's counted as a whole day. Recognised seasonal employer scheme Under the recognised seasonal employer scheme, workers from overseas are employed in the horticulture and viticulture industries. This is to help with the shortage of local workers. If you are a recognised seasonal worker you are non-resident for New Zealand tax purposes, but you must pay New Zealand tax on your New Zealand income. Your employer will deduct tax at a flat rate under the PAYE scheme. You need to use the NSW (non-resident seasonal worker) tax code on your Tax code declaration - IR330. Paying tax as a non-resident If you are a non-resident you are taxed here only on your income from New Zealand sources. Non-residents file a Non-resident individual tax return - IR3NR, which is different from a resident's tax return. If you are a non-resident with income from New Zealand, please make sure you let us know. This is so we can send you the right return form and tax you correctly. Normally, overseas countries will let you claim a credit for the tax that you pay on your income from New Zealand, limited to the overseas tax payable on the New Zealand income. 12 ird.govt.nz Double tax agreements To avoid double taxation of a person who is a tax resident of two different countries, New Zealand has negotiated double tax agreements (DTAs) and Tax information exchange agreements (TIEAs) with many other countries. These DTAs and TIEAs establish rules to determine what taxing rights each country has. Most DTAs and TIEAs contain a "tie- breaker" clause to establish which country has prior claim when settling competing tax claims. These countries or territories have a DTA or TIEA with New Zealand AustraliaIndiaRussian Federation AustriaIndonesiaSamoa BelgiumIrelandSingapore CanadaIsle of ManSouth Africa Cayman IslandsItalySpain ChileJapanSweden ChinaJerseySwitzerland Cook IslandsKorea, Republic ofTa i w a n Czech RepublicMalaysiaThailand DenmarkMexicoTu r k e y FijiNetherlandsUnited Arab Emirates FinlandNorwayUnited Kingdom FrancePapua New GuineaUnited States of America GermanyPhilippinesVietnam Hong KongPoland To get more details about any of these, call us on 0800 227 774 if you are a salary or wage earner, or 0800 377 774 if you are in business. TAXES AND DUTIES 13 IRD numbers If you do not already have a New Zealand IRD number, you can apply for one by filling in an IRD number application - resident individual - IR595 form or complete the IRD number application form online at ird.govt.nz/IRDnumber. If you are going to claim Working for Families Tax Credits (page 19) you'll also need to complete an IRD number application for all the children you are applying for. When applying for an IRD number you'll need some identification, such as a birth certificate or current passport. Take the IR595 form with your identification documents to an Inland Revenue appointed verifier. Further details can be found on the form. For more information on applying for an IRD number go to ird.govt.nz/IRDnumber If you've had a New Zealand IRD number before, call us on 0800 227 774 to check it's still valid. Once you have your IRD number, please have it handy whenever you call us. Balance dates New Zealand's tax year runs from 1 April to 31 March. All self-employed people, businesses and some individuals must complete a tax return after 31 March each year to declare all their income and tax paid. Some self-employed people and businesses have a balance date other than 31 March, for example, some farmers have a 30 June balance date. Depending on the circumstances, we may give approval for other self-employed people and businesses to have a different balance date. 14 ird.govt.nz Part 2 - Types of taxes and duties Income tax In New Zealand, income tax is paid on these types of income: •salary and wages •business and self-employed income •most social security benefits •income from investments •rental income •in some circumstances profit from selling capital assets (this does not usually apply to personal assets sold) •income that a New Zealand resident earns from overseas. The level of your total gross income (before tax and allowable deductions) will determine what tax rates are applied. For tax rate details go to ird.govt.nz/tax-rates Tax credits Independent Earner Tax Credit There is a tax credit that can reduce the overall amount of tax you may have to pay if you are a New Zealand tax resident and your annual net income\* is between $24,000 and $48,000 and you: •are not eligible for Working for Families (either you or your partner), •do not receive an income-tested benefit, NZ superannuation or veteran's pension, or an overseas equivalent of any of these. •Net income means your total income from all sources less any allowable deductions or current year losses, not including any losses brought forward. If your only income is from salary or wages and you do not have any allowable expenses, for example, income protection insurance your net income will be your annual salary or wages before tax. To find out about this tax credit, go to ird.govt.nz/ietc or phone 0800 227 774. Remember to have your IRD number handy. Donations tax credits If you earn a taxable income (for example, salary, wages, benefit or self-employed income) there are also tax credits for making donations to charitable organisations. TAXES AND DUTIES 15 These tax credits can be claimed using a Tax credit claim form - IR526. You need to provide receipts with your claim. Paying tax on salary or wages If your income is from salary, wages or a social security benefit, your tax will be deducted under the PAYE (pay as you earn) system. This means the pay you get in your hand has already had tax deducted. If your employer provides non-cash benefits as part of your employment package, they'll pay fringe benefit tax on them. You will not be taxed on these benefits. When you receive income from employment (salary or wages): •give your employer your IRD number so that the correct amount of tax is deducted from your pay. If you do not have an IRD number, go to page 13 to find out how to get one. •complete a Tax code declaration - IR330 to ensure that you are taxed at the correct rate. Without a tax code declaration, tax is deducted at the higher no-notification rate of 45 cents in the dollar. For information on what tax code to use for your job refer to the Tax code declaration - IR330 or ird.govt.nz/tax-codes Most salary and wage earners and those who receive benefits and pensions pay the correct amount of tax during the year. You will receive an Income tax assessment or be required to file an Individual tax return - IR3 at the end of the tax year, depending on your situation. To check if you need to file an IR3 log in to myIR at ird.govt.nz and use the online service. Paying tax on rental or business income You may earn income that does not have tax deducted before you receive it, such as income from running your own business. In this situation other than your first year in business you'll generally have to pay your tax in instalments during the year. This is called provisional tax. When you file your tax return at the end of the financial year, the provisional tax you've already paid will be offset against the end-of-year tax amount you owe. When you receive rental or business income, you need to: •apply for an IRD number for your business unless you are operating as a sole trader •keep accurate records •fill out an Individual tax return - IR3 each year and send it to us by the due date. When completing your IR3 you'll need to include income from all sources and work out the tax on your total taxable income. 16 ird.govt.nz There are different requirements for getting an IRD number for a business, depending on what type of business you have. If you are operating as a sole trader, you can use your own individual IRD number. Note Visit ird.govt.nz for more information on: •the requirements for getting an IRD number for your business •paying tax •expenses or deductions you can claim •GST (goods and service tax) and employer responsibilities •good business practices when running a business in New Zealand. Our Smart business - IR320 guide is for new and existing businesses. This guide includes information on basic income tax responsibilities, bookkeeping, claiming expenses, GST and employer responsibilities. If you receive rental income, check our Rental income - IR264 guide for information on your tax responsibilities. A list of other useful publications is on page 22. GST (goods and services tax) GST is New Zealand's main type of tax after income tax. It is an indirect tax business (including retailers) charge as part of the cost of goods and services that they supply. The current rate is 15%. When a GST-registered business buys goods or services from its suppliers, it can claim a credit for the GST the suppliers charge on these purchases. However, end-user consumers cannot claim a deduction for GST in this way. This means the final consumer of any product or service pays 15% GST on its cost. GST is charged on almost all goods and services supplied in New Zealand, except for rental of residential property, financial services such as mortgages, loans and investments, and the sale of a business that is capable of being carried on by the purchaser as a taxable activity (going concern). For more information on GST read our GST guide - IR375, or go to ird.govt.nz/gst TAXES AND DUTIES 17 Accident compensation New Zealand has a comprehensive accident insurance scheme which covers the costs of all work and non-work-related accidents. The Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) administers this scheme. Levies for cover are paid by employers and self-employed people directly to ACC. Inland Revenue collects employees levies on behalf of ACC as part of the PAYE tax system. RWT (Resident withholding tax) If you receive interest from any person or organisation, RWT is deducted before the interest is credited to you. This might include interest from financial institutions such as banks, finance companies, building societies or credit unions. RWT rates The rate at which RWT is deducted from your interest depends on: •the rate you have elected •the date the interest is paid or credited •whether or not you've given your IRD number to the person or organisation who is paying you interest •whether or not you have elected an RWT rate with your interest payer •your income level. Which rate should I elect? If you've given your financial institution your IRD number, but not elected an RWT rate to be used, they'll deduct RWT at the no-notification rate. This may result in your RWT being deducted at too high a rate. The rate you choose needs to account for the income you expect to earn in the tax year, not just the income from your investment. For current RWT rates go to ird.govt.nz/rwt You can elect to have your interest deducted at a higher rate to avoid an end-of-year tax bill. If a financial institution does not have a client’s IRD number, it will deduct RWT at the no-notification rate. Note 18 ird.govt.nz How do I make an election? To make an RWT rate election you can either: •contact your bank or financial institution and tell them which rate you prefer to be on, or •complete a Choose your RWT deduction rate - IR456 form and give one to each bank or financial institution you deal with. The rate you choose will apply once your bank or financial institution has processed this information. International tax rules New Zealand residents must pay income tax in New Zealand on their worldwide income. In addition, a New Zealand resident who has significant investments overseas must calculate the income from those investments according to New Zealand tax rules. These calculation rules do not apply to ordinary overseas bank accounts that you hold. To declare the income from these bank accounts, you simply convert the interest to New Zealand dollars (using the exchange rate for the date on which the interest was credited) and include it in your tax return. For more involved or substantial overseas investments (including interests in superannuation schemes), the calculations can be quite complicated. To find out more about them contact your tax advisor or agent. Tr u s t s If you are a settlor, trustee, or beneficiary of a trust outside New Zealand, there are some trust tax rules you may need to know about. Refer to our guide Trusts and estates income tax rules - IR288 for more information. TAXES AND DUTIES 19 Part 3 - Support for families Child support Child support is money paid by parents not living with their children to help financially support those children, when: •a couple who have children split up, or •two people have children and are not living together, or •dependent children are no longer living with either parent. Child support is not a tax, it's a payment administered by Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue Child Support assesses the amount the paying parent needs to pay and collects this money. It's then passed on to the person looking after the children to help with the costs of bringing them up, or to the government where the receiving carer is receiving a sole parent benefit to help offset the cost of the benefit. Some parents pay financial support direct to the other parent without the money passing through Inland Revenue Child Support. This can only happen when the person caring for the children is not receiving a sole parent benefit. For more information about child support please go to ird.govt.nz/childsupport or call 0800 221 221. Working for Families Working for Families are for families with children aged 18 or under. There are different types of payments and you may qualify for one or more, depending on your family situation. How much you can get depends on: •how many dependent children you have who are 18 or younger •your children's ages •any shared care arrangements •how much you and your partner earn (your family income) •where your family income comes from, eg, salary or wages, business, student allowance or a benefit, and •the number of hours you work each week. You also have to meet residency requirements to be eligible for Working for Families. 20 ird.govt.nz Partner means your civil union or de facto partner. Note The Working for Families payment types are: Family tax credit (FTC) This payment depends on how much you earn, the number of dependent children you have, and any shared care arrangements. We pay FTC if you are a working family, if you receive a student allowance or receive NZ Super. Work and Income often pays FTC to families receiving a benefit. In-work tax credit (IWTC) This payment is for families who are normally in paid work: As long as families receive income from paid work or receive certain compensation payments, IWTC is available to parents who are: •self-employed •receiving NZ Super •receiving a Veteran's Pension, or veteran's weekly compensation payments. You can get IWTC if you and/or your partner are normally in paid work but are receiving accident compensation for an injury that happened on or after 1 January 2006. It is not available to families receiving an income-tested benefit or student allowance. From 1 April 2021, you will keep receiving the in-work tax credit payments for up to two weeks during an unpaid break from work. For example, changing jobs, leaving employment or unpaid time such as school holidays. Payments will stop if you/your partner start receiving an income-tested benefit or student allowance during this two week period. Minimum family tax credit (MFTC) MFTC is payable to families working for salary or wages who earn an annual family income up to $32,864 after tax from 1 April 2022. MFTC ensures families can have a minimum weekly income after tax of $632 from 1 April 2022. A single parent must be working at least 20 hours a week, and in a two-parent family, one or both parents between them must be working at least 30 hours a week. If you and/or your partner would normally work the required weekly hours but are injured and receive accident compensation instead, you can still qualify for MFTC. TAXES AND DUTIES 21 Best Start tax credit (BSTC) BSTC was introduced to assist families with the costs in a child's early years. You can get this payment for up to three years after a new child arrives. You can receive up to $3,388 per year, or $65 per week. BSTC is not adjusted for income levels in your child's first year but is adjusted in the second and third year.

We also explain the following social assistance programmes that we administer: •Child support - money paid by a parent not living with their children to help support their children financially. •Working for Families - an entitlement for families with dependent children aged 18 and und er. This guide deals with tax residence rules only. The tax residence rules are different from the usual New Zealand immigration and residency rules. When we refer to a "New Zealand resident" or a "non-resident", we mean a New Zealand resident or non- resident for tax purposes. Note On page 22 you'll find a list of other publications for more detailed information about the topics covered in this guide. The information in this guide is based on current tax laws at the time of printing. TAXES AND DUTIES 5 Part 1 - General information New Zealand's tax system Everyone in New Zealand must pay their share of tax by law. This is how the government funds public services such as education, healthcare, roads and welfare. Almost all New Zealanders contribute to these services through the taxes they pay. New Zealand residents pay income tax in New Zealand on their worldwide income. If you are a New Zealand resident, most of the income you receive will be subject to tax. This includes income from personal effort, investments, benefits, pensions and overseas. New Zealand also has a goods and services tax (GST), which is included in the price you pay for most goods and services. New Zealand does not have a capital gains tax, but profits from selling some assets can be taxed in some circumstances. There's no tax on cash or personal assets you bring into New Zealand. Inland Revenue is the main government department that administers tax laws and collects tax payments. New Zealand Customs also collects some taxes and duties on imported goods. New Zealand's tax system relies on people's honesty in complying with the tax laws. It's important you understand your tax responsibilities, to avoid being penalised. Tax residence The residence rules set out in tax law is different from the normal citizenship rules. Having New Zealand citizenship or permanent residence does not necessarily mean you are a resident for tax purposes. On the other hand, you could be a resident for tax purposes, but not hold citizenship here. As an individual, you are a New Zealand resident for tax purposes if you meet any of these conditions: •You've been in New Zealand for more than 183 days in any 12-month period and have not become a non-resident (refer to page 11). •You have a "permanent place of abode" in New Zealand. •You are away from New Zealand in the service of the New Zealand government. 6 ird.govt.nz The 183-day rule If you've been in New Zealand for more than 183 days in any 12-month period, you are considered to be a New Zealand tax resident from the first of those 183 days. The 183 days do not have to be consecutive. For example, if you come to New Zealand for 10 days in April and then return for 20 days in September of the same year, that's counted as 30 days. If you are in New Zealand for part of a day, it's counted as being a whole day. This means that the days you arrive or depart are treated as days present in New Zealand. If you've ever been resident in New Zealand under the 183-day rule you remain resident until you become a non-resident (refer to page 11). A permanent place of abode in New Zealand The Income Tax Act 2007 says that a person, other than a company, who has a "permanent place of abode" in New Zealand is a New Zealand tax resident. This means there must be somewhere in New Zealand you could live (such as a house or other dwelling).All your ties and links with New Zealand also need to be considered. If you have strong ties to New Zealand it's likely that you have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. If there is somewhere in New Zealand you could live, it's necessary to decide whether it's your permanent place of abode - the following table has more information. TAXES AND DUTIES 7 To decide you need to consider all your circumstances. Do you have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand? CircumstanceLook at Presence in New Zealand how much time you spend in New Zealand, and whether you are here continuously or from time to time Accommodation how you've previously used the accommodation you have in New Zealand, and your connection with it. Do you own it, lease it or control it? Family and social ties where your family live (especially immediate family) and if you belong to any New Zealand clubs, associations, or organisations Economic ties if you have bank accounts, credit cards, investments, life insurance or superannuation funds here Employment or business if you run a business or you are employed here. If you have (or may have) employment to return to, the terms of any employment contract Personal property if you have vehicles, clothing, furniture or other property or possessions kept here Intentions whether you intend to come back to New Zealand to live, and if you do, when Benefits, pensions and other payments whether you receive any welfare benefits, pensions or other payments from a New Zealand agency or organisation This list is a guide only - you’ll need to consider your overall situation when working out whether you are a New Zealand tax resident. Even if you maintain ties or even a physical home in other countries, you can still be a New Zealand tax resident. As long as you have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, you'll always be a resident. This test overrides any rules about the number of days you are here. If you are a New Zealand tax resident and also a tax resident of another country under that country's tax laws, it's possible you could be taxed twice on the same income. To avoid this, New Zealand has double tax agreements with many other countries. These agreements are explained on page 12. 8 ird.govt.nz Paying tax as a resident If you are a New Zealand resident you are taxed on your worldwide income. In your first New Zealand tax return you must include your worldwide income from all sources from the date you arrived in New Zealand. You are normally allowed a credit for any tax paid overseas, up to the amount of New Zealand income tax payable on that overseas income. To claim a credit, you'll need to be able to produce records that show the overseas tax you've paid. In New Zealand the tax on each person’s income is calculated separately. For example, there are no joint assessments for a spouse or partner. Note Temporary tax exemption on foreign income Most types of individual income from overseas may be temporarily exempt from tax in New Zealand. This temporary tax exemption is available to people who: •qualify as a tax resident in New Zealand on or after 1 April 2006, and •are new migrants or returning New Zealanders who have not been resident for tax purposes in New Zealand for at least 10 years prior to their arrival in New Zealand. The temporary tax exemption for foreign income starts on the first day that you are a tax resident here. It ends 48 months after the month you qualify as a tax resident in New Zealand. Sarah was in New Zealand from 10 to 14 March 2016. She then moved here on 22 April 2016 and qualified as a tax resident on 16 October 2016. She met the criteria for her foreign income to be temporarily exempt from tax in New Zealand. Sarah’s exemption applies from 10 March 2016 until 31 October 2020. Example Qualifying for the exemption To be eligible for a temporary tax exemption on foreign income you must: •have qualified as a tax resident in New Zealand on or after 1 April 2006 •not have been a New Zealand tax resident at any time in the past 10 years before you qualified again as a tax resident in New Zealand (page 5 has information about New Zealand tax residence) •not have been eligible for this tax exemption before (including if you were eligible but chose to waive the exemption), and •not be receiving Working for Families (partner must not be receiving them either). TAXES AND DUTIES 9 The exemption can only be granted once in a lifetime - you cannot extend your tax exemption or renew it after its expiry date. There are some types of foreign income that do not qualify for a temporary tax exemption (refer to page 10). The exemption and Working for Families You cannot receive Working for Families while being tax exempt from foreign income. If you are eligible for the temporary tax exemption on foreign income and you (or your partner) are also eligible for Working for Families, you need to decide which option is the best for your situation. If you decide to waive the temporary tax exemption so you can claim Working for Families, you’ll need to show, in your Individual tax return - IR3, all the foreign income you received from the date of your arrival in New Zealand. Go to page 19 for information about Working for Families. How to claim the exemption If you are eligible, the tax exemption is automatically granted. If you qualify you do not need to tell us about foreign income you receive for the period that your exemption applies. However, you must tell us about any foreign income that does not qualify for the temporary tax exemption. You can contact us within New Zealand on 0800 227 774, or if you are calling from overseas, +64 4 978 0779. The types of foreign income temporarily exempt from tax in New Zealand are, for example: •controlled foreign company (CFC) income that is attributed under New Zealand's CFC rules •foreign investment fund (FIF) income that is attributed under New Zealand's FIF rules (including foreign superannuation) •non-resident withholding tax (for example, on foreign mortgages) •approved issuer levy (for example, on foreign mortgages) •income arising from the exercise of foreign employee share options •accrual income (from foreign financial arrangements) •income from foreign trusts •rental income derived offshore •foreign dividends •foreign interest •royalties derived offshore •income from employment performed overseas before coming to New Zealand, such as bonus payments 10 ird.govt.nz •gains on the sale of property derived offshore (held on revenue account) •offshore business income (that is unrelated to the performance of services). The foreign income that will continue to be taxed in New Zealand is: •employment income from overseas employment performed while living in New Zealand, and •business income relating to services performed offshore. If you receive non-exempt types of foreign income from the date of your arrival back in New Zealand, you'll need to show this income in your Individual tax return - IR3, even if you qualify for a temporary tax exemption on other types of foreign income. After the exemption has ended When your temporary tax exemption ends you need to include all foreign income received since your exemption ended in your tax return along with your New Zealand income. You need to file a tax return after the end of your exemption and every tax year after that, as long as you have foreign income, regardless of whether or not you told us of your foreign income when you arrived in New Zealand. New Zealand's tax year runs from 1 April to 31 March. If your exemption ends at any time in a tax year other than on the standard balance date of 31 March, you'll need to apportion your foreign income received for that year in your tax return. Sam qualified as a tax resident in New Zealand on 10 September 2015 and met the criteria for his foreign income to be temporarily exempt from tax in New Zealand from 10 September 2015 until 30 September 2019. Sam’s exemption ends in the middle of a standard New Zealand tax year and he will continue to receive foreign income after his exemption ends (30 September 2019). In his IR3 for the year ending 31 March 2020 (the tax year that his exemption ended), Sam has to show the foreign income he received from 1 October 2019 to 31 March 2020.

TAXES AND DUTIES 11 Becoming a non-resident Remember that if you have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand you'll be a resident for tax purposes. However, if the ties and links described on page 7 suggest you do not have a permanent place of abode here, you can become a non-resident under the "325-day rule". The 325-day rule If you are away from New Zealand for more than 325 days in any 12-month period, and you do not have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, you'll become a non-resident for tax purposes. The 325 days do not have to be consecutive. Remember, if you are here for part of a day it's counted as a whole day. Recognised seasonal employer scheme Under the recognised seasonal employer scheme, workers from overseas are employed in the horticulture and viticulture industries. This is to help with the shortage of local workers. If you are a recognised seasonal worker you are non-resident for New Zealand tax purposes, but you must pay New Zealand tax on your New Zealand income. Your employer will deduct tax at a flat rate under the PAYE scheme. You need to use the NSW (non-resident seasonal worker) tax code on your Tax code declaration - IR330. Paying tax as a non-resident If you are a non-resident you are taxed here only on your income from New Zealand sources. Non-residents file a Non-resident individual tax return - IR3NR, which is different from a resident's tax return. If you are a non-resident with income from New Zealand, please make sure you let us know. This is so we can send you the right return form and tax you correctly. Normally, overseas countries will let you claim a credit for the tax that you pay on your income from New Zealand, limited to the overseas tax payable on the New Zealand income. 12 ird.govt.nz Double tax agreements To avoid double taxation of a person who is a tax resident of two different countries, New Zealand has negotiated double tax agreements (DTAs) and Tax information exchange agreements (TIEAs) with many other countries. These DTAs and TIEAs establish rules to determine what taxing rights each country has. Most DTAs and TIEAs contain a "tie- breaker" clause to establish which country has prior claim when settling competing tax claims. These countries or territories have a DTA or TIEA with New Zealand AustraliaIndiaRussian Federation AustriaIndonesiaSamoa BelgiumIrelandSingapore CanadaIsle of ManSouth Africa Cayman IslandsItalySpain ChileJapanSweden ChinaJerseySwitzerland Cook IslandsKorea, Republic ofTa i w a n Czech RepublicMalaysiaThailand DenmarkMexicoTu r k e y FijiNetherlandsUnited Arab Emirates FinlandNorwayUnited Kingdom FrancePapua New GuineaUnited States of America GermanyPhilippinesVietnam Hong KongPoland To get more details about any of these, call us on 0800 227 774 if you are a salary or wage earner, or 0800 377 774 if you are in business. TAXES AND DUTIES 13 IRD numbers If you do not already have a New Zealand IRD number, you can apply for one by filling in an IRD number application - resident individual - IR595 form or complete the IRD number application form online at ird.govt.nz/IRDnumber. If you are going to claim Working for Families Tax Credits (page 19) you'll also need to complete an IRD number application for all the children you are applying for. When applying for an IRD number you'll need some identification, such as a birth certificate or current passport. Take the IR595 form with your identification documents to an Inland Revenue appointed verifier. Further details can be found on the form. For more information on applying for an IRD number go to ird.govt.nz/IRDnumber If you've had a New Zealand IRD number before, call us on 0800 227 774 to check it's still valid. Once you have your IRD number, please have it handy whenever you call us. Balance dates New Zealand's tax year runs from 1 April to 31 March. All self-employed people, businesses and some individuals must complete a tax return after 31 March each year to declare all their income and tax paid. Some self-employed people and businesses have a balance date other than 31 March, for example, some farmers have a 30 June balance date. Depending on the circumstances, we may give approval for other self-employed people and businesses to have a different balance date. 14 ird.govt.nz Part 2 - Types of taxes and duties Income tax In New Zealand, income tax is paid on these types of income: •salary and wages •business and self-employed income •most social security benefits •income from investments •rental income •in some circumstances profit from selling capital assets (this does not usually apply to personal assets sold) •income that a New Zealand resident earns from overseas. The level of your total gross income (before tax and allowable deductions) will determine what tax rates are applied. For tax rate details go to ird.govt.nz/tax-rates Tax credits Independent Earner Tax Credit There is a tax credit that can reduce the overall amount of tax you may have to pay if you are a New Zealand tax resident and your annual net income\* is between $24,000 and $48,000 and you: •are not eligible for Working for Families (either you or your partner), •do not receive an income-tested benefit, NZ superannuation or veteran's pension, or an overseas equivalent of any of these. •Net income means your total income from all sources less any allowable deductions or current year losses, not including any losses brought forward. If your only income is from salary or wages and you do not have any allowable expenses, for example, income protection insurance your net income will be your annual salary or wages before tax. To find out about this tax credit, go to ird.govt.nz/ietc or phone 0800 227 774. Remember to have your IRD number handy. Donations tax credits If you earn a taxable income (for example, salary, wages, benefit or self-employed income) there are also tax credits for making donations to charitable organisations. TAXES AND DUTIES 15 These tax credits can be claimed using a Tax credit claim form - IR526. You need to provide receipts with your claim. Paying tax on salary or wages If your income is from salary, wages or a social security benefit, your tax will be deducted under the PAYE (pay as you earn) system. This means the pay you get in your hand has already had tax deducted. If your employer provides non-cash benefits as part of your employment package, they'll pay fringe benefit tax on them. You will not be taxed on these benefits. When you receive income from employment (salary or wages): •give your employer your IRD number so that the correct amount of tax is deducted from your pay. If you do not have an IRD number, go to page 13 to find out how to get one. •complete a Tax code declaration - IR330 to ensure that you are taxed at the correct rate. Without a tax code declaration, tax is deducted at the higher no-notification rate of 45 cents in the dollar. For information on what tax code to use for your job refer to the Tax code declaration - IR330 or ird.govt.nz/tax-codes Most salary and wage earners and those who receive benefits and pensions pay the correct amount of tax during the year. You will receive an Income tax assessment or be required to file an Individual tax return - IR3 at the end of the tax year, depending on your situation. To check if you need to file an IR3 log in to myIR at ird.govt.nz and use the online service. Paying tax on rental or business income You may earn income that does not have tax deducted before you receive it, such as income from running your own business. In this situation other than your first year in business you'll generally have to pay your tax in instalments during the year. This is called provisional tax. When you file your tax return at the end of the financial year, the provisional tax you've already paid will be offset against the end-of-year tax amount you owe. When you receive rental or business income, you need to: •apply for an IRD number for your business unless you are operating as a sole trader •keep accurate records •fill out an Individual tax return - IR3 each year and send it to us by the due date. When completing your IR3 you'll need to include income from all sources and work out the tax on your total taxable income. 16 ird.govt.nz There are different requirements for getting an IRD number for a business, depending on what type of business you have. If you are operating as a sole trader, you can use your own individual IRD number. Note Visit ird.govt.nz for more information on: •the requirements for getting an IRD number for your business •paying tax •expenses or deductions you can claim •GST (goods and service tax) and employer responsibilities •good business practices when running a business in New Zealand. Our Smart business - IR320 guide is for new and existing businesses. This guide includes information on basic income tax responsibilities, bookkeeping, claiming expenses, GST and employer responsibilities. If you receive rental income, check our Rental income - IR264 guide for information on your tax responsibilities. A list of other useful publications is on page 22. GST (goods and services tax) GST is New Zealand's main type of tax after income tax. It is an indirect tax business (including retailers) charge as part of the cost of goods and services that they supply. The current rate is 15%. When a GST-registered business buys goods or services from its suppliers, it can claim a credit for the GST the suppliers charge on these purchases. However, end-user consumers cannot claim a deduction for GST in this way. This means the final consumer of any product or service pays 15% GST on its cost. GST is charged on almost all goods and services supplied in New Zealand, except for rental of residential property, financial services such as mortgages, loans and investments, and the sale of a business that is capable of being carried on by the purchaser as a taxable activity (going concern). For more information on GST read our GST guide - IR375, or go to ird.govt.nz/gst TAXES AND DUTIES 17 Accident compensation New Zealand has a comprehensive accident insurance scheme which covers the costs of all work and non-work-related accidents. The Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) administers this scheme. Levies for cover are paid by employers and self-employed people directly to ACC. Inland Revenue collects employees levies on behalf of ACC as part of the PAYE tax system. RWT (Resident withholding tax) If you receive interest from any person or organisation, RWT is deducted before the interest is credited to you. This might include interest from financial institutions such as banks, finance companies, building societies or credit unions. RWT rates The rate at which RWT is deducted from your interest depends on: •the rate you have elected •the date the interest is paid or credited •whether or not you've given your IRD number to the person or organisation who is paying you interest •whether or not you have elected an RWT rate with your interest payer •your income level. Which rate should I elect? If you've given your financial institution your IRD number, but not elected an RWT rate to be used, they'll deduct RWT at the no-notification rate. This may result in your RWT being deducted at too high a rate. The rate you choose needs to account for the income you expect to earn in the tax year, not just the income from your investment. For current RWT rates go to ird.govt.nz/rwt You can elect to have your interest deducted at a higher rate to avoid an end-of-year tax bill. If a financial institution does not have a client’s IRD number, it will deduct RWT at the no-notification rate. Note 18 ird.govt.nz How do I make an election? To make an RWT rate election you can either: •contact your bank or financial institution and tell them which rate you prefer to be on, or •complete a Choose your RWT deduction rate - IR456 form and give one to each bank or financial institution you deal with. The rate you choose will apply once your bank or financial institution has processed this information. International tax rules New Zealand residents must pay income tax in New Zealand on their worldwide income. In addition, a New Zealand resident who has significant investments overseas must calculate the income from those investments according to New Zealand tax rules. These calculation rules do not apply to ordinary overseas bank accounts that you hold. To declare the income from these bank accounts, you simply convert the interest to New Zealand dollars (using the exchange rate for the date on which the interest was credited) and include it in your tax return. For more involved or substantial overseas investments (including interests in superannuation schemes), the calculations can be quite complicated. To find out more about them contact your tax advisor or agent. Tr u s t s If you are a settlor, trustee, or beneficiary of a trust outside New Zealand, there are some trust tax rules you may need to know about. Refer to our guide Trusts and estates income tax rules - IR288 for more information. TAXES AND DUTIES 19 Part 3 - Support for families Child support Child support is money paid by parents not living with their children to help financially support those children, when: •a couple who have children split up, or •two people have children and are not living together, or •dependent children are no longer living with either parent. Child support is not a tax, it's a payment administered by Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue Child Support assesses the amount the paying parent needs to pay and collects this money. It's then passed on to the person looking after the children to help with the costs of bringing them up, or to the government where the receiving carer is receiving a sole parent benefit to help offset the cost of the benefit. Some parents pay financial support direct to the other parent without the money passing through Inland Revenue Child Support. This can only happen when the person caring for the children is not receiving a sole parent benefit. For more information about child support please go to ird.govt.nz/childsupport or call 0800 221 221. Working for Families Working for Families are for families with children aged 18 or under. There are different types of payments and you may qualify for one or more, depending on your family situation. How much you can get depends on: •how many dependent children you have who are 18 or younger •your children's ages •any shared care arrangements •how much you and your partner earn (your family income) •where your family income comes from, eg, salary or wages, business, student allowance or a benefit, and •the number of hours you work each week. You also have to meet residency requirements to be eligible for Working for Families. 20 ird.govt.nz Partner means your civil union or de facto partner. Note The Working for Families payment types are: Family tax credit (FTC) This payment depends on how much you earn, the number of dependent children you have, and any shared care arrangements. We pay FTC if you are a working family, if you receive a student allowance or receive NZ Super. Work and Income often pays FTC to families receiving a benefit. In-work tax credit (IWTC) This payment is for families who are normally in paid work: As long as families receive income from paid work or receive certain compensation payments, IWTC is available to parents who are: •self-employed •receiving NZ Super •receiving a Veteran's Pension, or veteran's weekly compensation payments. You can get IWTC if you and/or your partner are normally in paid work but are receiving accident compensation for an injury that happened on or after 1 January 2006. It is not available to families receiving an income-tested benefit or student allowance. From 1 April 2021, you will keep receiving the in-work tax credit payments for up to two weeks during an unpaid break from work. For example, changing jobs, leaving employment or unpaid time such as school holidays. Payments will stop if you/your partner start receiving an income-tested benefit or student allowance during this two week period. Minimum family tax credit (MFTC) MFTC is payable to families working for salary or wages who earn an annual family income up to $34,216 after tax from 1 April 2023. MFTC ensures families can have a minimum weekly income after tax of $658 from 1 April 2023. A single parent must be working at least 20 hours a week, and in a two-parent family, one or both parents between them must be working at least 30 hours a week. If you and/or your partner would normally work the required weekly hours but are injured and receive accident compensation instead, you can still qualify for MFTC. TAXES AND DUTIES 21 Best Start tax credit (BSTC) BSTC was introduced to assist families with the costs in a child's early years. You can get this payment for up to three years after a new child arrives. You can receive up to $3,632 per year, or $69 per week. BSTC is not adjusted for income levels in your child's first year but is adjusted in the second and third year.

This guide deals with tax residence rules only. The tax residence rules are different from the usual New Zealand immigration and residency rules. When we refer to a ‘New Zealand resident’ or a ‘non-resident’, we mean a New Zealand resident or non-resident for tax purposes. Note On page 22 you'll find a list of other publications for more detailed information about the topics covered in this guide. The information in this guide is based on current tax laws at the time of printing. TAXES AND DUTIES 5 Part 1 - General information New Zealand's tax system Everyone in New Zealand must pay their share of tax by law. This is how the government funds public services such as education, healthcare, roads and welfare. Almost all New Zealanders contribute to these services through the taxes they pay. New Zealand residents pay income tax in New Zealand on their worldwide income. If you are a New Zealand resident, most of the income you receive will be subject to tax. This includes income from personal effort, investments, benefits, pensions and overseas. New Zealand also has a goods and services tax (GST), which is included in the price you pay for most goods and services. New Zealand does not have a capital gains tax, but profits from selling some assets can be taxed in some circumstances. There's no tax on cash or personal assets you bring into New Zealand. Inland Revenue is the main government department that administers tax laws and collects tax payments. New Zealand Customs also collects some taxes and duties on imported goods. New Zealand's tax system relies on people's honesty in complying with the tax laws. It's important you understand your tax responsibilities, to avoid being penalised. Tax residence The residence rules set out in tax law is different from the normal citizenship rules. Having New Zealand citizenship or permanent residence does not necessarily mean you are a resident for tax purposes. On the other hand, you could be a resident for tax purposes, but not hold citizenship here. As an individual, you are a New Zealand resident for tax purposes if you meet any of these conditions: •You've been in New Zealand for more than 183 days in any 12-month period and have not become a non-resident (refer to page 11). •You have a ‘permanent place of abode’ in New Zealand. •You are away from New Zealand in the service of the New Zealand government. 6 ird.govt.nz The 183-day rule If you've been in New Zealand for more than 183 days in any 12-month period, you are considered to be a New Zealand tax resident from the first of those 183 days. The 183 days do not have to be consecutive. For example, if you come to New Zealand for 10 days in April and then return for 20 days in September of the same year, that's counted as 30 days. If you are in New Zealand for part of a day, it's counted as being a whole day. This means that the days you arrive or depart are treated as days present in New Zealand. If you've ever been resident in New Zealand under the 183-day rule you remain resident until you become a non-resident (refer to page 11). A permanent place of abode in New Zealand The Income Tax Act 2007 says that a person, other than a company, who has a ‘permanent place of abode’ in New Zealand is a New Zealand tax resident. This means there must be somewhere in New Zealand you could live (such as a house or other dwelling).All your ties and links with New Zealand also need to be considered. If you have strong ties to New Zealand it's likely that you have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. If there is somewhere in New Zealand you could live, it's necessary to decide whether it's your permanent place of abode - the following table has more information. TAXES AND DUTIES 7 To decide you need to consider all your circumstances. Do you have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand? CircumstanceLook at Presence in New Zealand how much time you spend in New Zealand, and whether you are here continuously or from time to time Accommodation how you've previously used the accommodation you have in New Zealand, and your connection with it. Do you own it, lease it or control it? Family and social ties where your family live (especially immediate family) and if you belong to any New Zealand clubs, associations, or organisations Economic ties if you have bank accounts, credit cards, investments, life insurance or superannuation funds here Employment or business if you run a business or you are employed here. If you have (or may have) employment to return to, the terms of any employment contract Personal property if you have vehicles, clothing, furniture or other property or possessions kept here Intentions whether you intend to come back to New Zealand to live, and if you do, when Benefits, pensions and other payments whether you receive any welfare benefits, pensions or other payments from a New Zealand agency or organisation This list is a guide only - you’ll need to consider your overall situation when working out whether you are a New Zealand tax resident. Even if you maintain ties or even a physical home in other countries, you can still be a New Zealand tax resident. As long as you have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, you'll always be a resident. This test overrides any rules about the number of days you are here. If you are a New Zealand tax resident and also a tax resident of another country under that country's tax laws, it's possible you could be taxed twice on the same income. To avoid this, New Zealand has double tax agreements with many other countries. These agreements are explained on page 12. 8 ird.govt.nz Paying tax as a resident If you are a New Zealand resident you are taxed on your worldwide income. In your first New Zealand tax return you must include your worldwide income from all sources from the date you arrived in New Zealand. You are normally allowed a credit for any tax paid overseas, up to the amount of New Zealand income tax payable on that overseas income. To claim a credit, you'll need to be able to produce records that show the overseas tax you've paid. In New Zealand the tax on each person’s income is calculated separately. For example, there are no joint assessments for a spouse or partner. Note Temporary tax exemption on foreign income Most types of individual income from overseas may be temporarily exempt from tax in New Zealand. This temporary tax exemption is available to people who: •qualify as a tax resident in New Zealand on or after 1 April 2006, and •are new migrants or returning New Zealanders who have not been resident for tax purposes in New Zealand for at least 10 years prior to their arrival in New Zealand. The temporary tax exemption for foreign income starts on the first day that you are a tax resident here. It ends 48 months after the month you qualify as a tax resident in New Zealand. Sarah was in New Zealand from 10 to 14 March 2016. She then moved here on 22 April 2016 and qualified as a tax resident on 16 October 2016. She met the criteria for her foreign income to be temporarily exempt from tax in New Zealand. Sarah’s exemption applies from 10 March 2016 until 31 October 2020. Example Qualifying for the exemption To be eligible for a temporary tax exemption on foreign income you must: •have qualified as a tax resident in New Zealand on or after 1 April 2006 •not have been a New Zealand tax resident at any time in the past 10 years before you qualified again as a tax resident in New Zealand (page 5 has information about New Zealand tax residence) •not have been eligible for this tax exemption before (including if you were eligible but chose to waive the exemption), and •not be receiving Working for Families (partner must not be receiving them either). TAXES AND DUTIES 9 The exemption can only be granted once in a lifetime - you cannot extend your tax exemption or renew it after its expiry date. There are some types of foreign income that do not qualify for a temporary tax exemption (refer to page 10). The exemption and Working for Families You cannot receive Working for Families while being tax exempt from foreign income. If you are eligible for the temporary tax exemption on foreign income and you (or your partner) are also eligible for Working for Families, you need to decide which option is the best for your situation. If you decide to waive the temporary tax exemption so you can claim Working for Families, you’ll need to show, in your Individual tax return - IR3, all the foreign income you received from the date of your arrival in New Zealand. Go to page 19 for information about Working for Families. How to claim the exemption If you are eligible, the tax exemption is automatically granted. If you qualify you do not need to tell us about foreign income you receive for the period that your exemption applies. However, you must tell us about any foreign income that does not qualify for the temporary tax exemption. You can contact us within New Zealand on 0800 227 774, or if you are calling from overseas, +64 4 832 5205. Additional countries can now call us for free from Australia, Canada, United States of America, China, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, South Korea and United Kingdom. Visit ird.govt.nz to view the Overseas customers – toll free numbers. The types of foreign income temporarily exempt from tax in New Zealand are, for example: •controlled foreign company (CFC) income that is attributed under New Zealand's CFC rules •foreign investment fund (FIF) income that is attributed under New Zealand's FIF rules (including foreign superannuation) •non-resident withholding tax (for example, on foreign mortgages) •approved issuer levy (for example, on foreign mortgages) •income arising from the exercise of foreign employee share options •accrual income (from foreign financial arrangements) •income from foreign trusts •rental income derived offshore •foreign dividends •foreign interest 10 ird.govt.nz •royalties derived offshore •income from employment performed overseas before coming to New Zealand, such as bonus payments •gains on the sale of property derived offshore (held on revenue account) •offshore business income (that is unrelated to the performance of services). The foreign income that will continue to be taxed in New Zealand is: •employment income from overseas employment performed while living in New Zealand, and •business income relating to services performed offshore. If you receive non-exempt types of foreign income from the date of your arrival back in New Zealand, you'll need to show this income in your Individual tax return - IR3, even if you qualify for a temporary tax exemption on other types of foreign income. After the exemption has ended When your temporary tax exemption ends you need to include all foreign income received since your exemption ended in your tax return along with your New Zealand income. You need to file a tax return after the end of your exemption and every tax year after that, as long as you have foreign income, regardless of whether or not you told us of your foreign income when you arrived in New Zealand. New Zealand's tax year runs from 1 April to 31 March. If your exemption ends at any time in a tax year other than on the standard balance date of 31 March, you'll need to apportion your foreign income received for that year in your tax return. Sam qualified as a tax resident in New Zealand on 10 September 2015 and met the criteria for his foreign income to be temporarily exempt from tax in New Zealand from 10 September 2015 until 30 September 2019. Sam’s exemption ends in the middle of a standard New Zealand tax year and he will continue to receive foreign income after his exemption ends (30 September 2019). In his IR3 for the year ending 31 March 2020 (the tax year that his exemption ended), Sam has to show the foreign income he received from 1 October 2019 to 31 March 2020.

TAXES AND DUTIES 11 •You can contact us within New Zealand on 0800 227 774, or if you are calling from overseas, +64 4 832 5205. Becoming a non-resident Remember that if you have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand you'll be a resident for tax purposes. However, if the ties and links described on page 7 suggest you do not have a permanent place of abode here, you can become a non-resident under the ‘325-day rule’. The 325-day rule If you are away from New Zealand for more than 325 days in any 12-month period, and you do not have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, you'll become a non-resident for tax purposes. The 325 days do not have to be consecutive. Remember, if you are here for part of a day it's counted as a whole day. Recognised seasonal employer scheme Under the recognised seasonal employer scheme, workers from overseas are employed in the horticulture and viticulture industries. This is to help with the shortage of local workers. If you are a recognised seasonal worker you are non-resident for New Zealand tax purposes, but you must pay New Zealand tax on your New Zealand income. Your employer will deduct tax at a flat rate under the PAYE scheme. You need to use the NSW (non-resident seasonal worker) tax code on your Tax code declaration - IR330. Paying tax as a non-resident If you are a non-resident you are taxed here only on your income from New Zealand sources. Non-residents file a Non-resident individual tax return - IR3NR, which is different from a resident's tax return. If you are a non-resident with income from New Zealand, please make sure you let us know. This is so we can send you the right return form and tax you correctly. Normally, overseas countries will let you claim a credit for the tax that you pay on your income from New Zealand, limited to the overseas tax payable on the New Zealand income. 12 ird.govt.nz Double tax agreements To avoid double taxation of a person who is a tax resident of 2 different countries, New Zealand has negotiated double tax agreements (DTAs) and Tax information exchange agreements (TIEAs) with many other countries. These DTAs and TIEAs establish rules to determine what taxing rights each country has. Most DTAs and TIEAs contain a ‘tiebreaker’ clause to establish which country has prior claim when settling competing tax claims. These countries or territories have a DTA or TIEA with New Zealand AustraliaIndiaRussian Federation AustriaIndonesiaSamoa BelgiumIrelandSingapore CanadaIsle of ManSouth Africa Cayman IslandsItalySpain ChileJapanSweden ChinaJerseySwitzerland Cook IslandsKorea, Republic ofTa i w a n Czech RepublicMalaysiaThailand DenmarkMexicoTu r k e y FijiNetherlandsUnited Arab Emirates FinlandNorwayUnited Kingdom FrancePapua New GuineaUnited States of America GermanyPhilippinesVietnam Hong KongPoland To get more details about any of these, call us on 0800 227 774 if you are a salary or wage earner, or 0800 377 774 if you are in business. TAXES AND DUTIES 13 IRD numbers If you do not already have a New Zealand IRD number, you can apply for 1 by filling in an IRD number application - resident individual - IR595 form or complete the IRD number application form online at ird.govt.nz/IRDnumber. If you are going to claim Working for Families Tax Credits (page 19) you'll also need to complete an IRD number application for all the children you are applying for. When applying for an IRD number you'll need some identification, such as a birth certificate or current passport. Take the IR595 form with your identification documents to an Inland Revenue appointed verifier. Further details can be found on the form. For more information on applying for an IRD number go to ird.govt.nz/IRDnumber If you've had a New Zealand IRD number before, call us on 0800 227 774 to check it's still valid. Once you have your IRD number, please have it handy whenever you call us. Balance dates New Zealand's tax year runs from 1 April to 31 March. All self-employed people, businesses and some individuals must complete a tax return after 31 March each year to declare all their income and tax paid. Some self-employed people and businesses have a balance date other than 31 March, for example, some farmers have a 30 June balance date. Depending on the circumstances, we may give approval for other self-employed people and businesses to have a different balance date. 14 ird.govt.nz Part 2 - Types of taxes and duties Income tax In New Zealand, income tax is paid on these types of income: •salary and wages •business and self-employed income •most social security benefits •income from investments •rental income •in some circumstances profit from selling capital assets (this does not usually apply to personal assets sold) •income that a New Zealand resident earns from overseas. The level of your total gross income (before tax and allowable deductions) will determine what tax rates are applied. For tax rate details go to ird.govt.nz/tax-rates Tax credits Independent Earner Tax Credit There is a tax credit that can reduce the overall amount of tax you may have to pay if you are a New Zealand tax resident and your annual net income\* is between $24,000 and $48,000 and you: •are not eligible for Working for Families (either you or your partner), •do not receive an income-tested benefit, NZ superannuation or veteran's pension, or an overseas equivalent of any of these. •Net income means your total income from all sources less any allowable deductions or current year losses, not including any losses brought forward. If your only income is from salary or wages and you do not have any allowable expenses, for example, income protection insurance your net income will be your annual salary or wages before tax. To find out about this tax credit, go to ird.govt.nz/ietc or phone 0800 227 774. Remember to have your IRD number handy. Donations tax credits If you earn a taxable income (for example, salary, wages, benefit or self-employed income) there are also tax credits for making donations to charitable organisations. TAXES AND DUTIES 15 These tax credits can be claimed using a Tax credit claim form - IR526. You need to provide receipts with your claim. Paying tax on salary or wages If your income is from salary, wages or a social security benefit, your tax will be deducted under the PAYE (pay as you earn) system. This means the pay you get in your hand has already had tax deducted. If your employer provides non-cash benefits as part of your employment package, they'll pay fringe benefit tax on them. You will not be taxed on these benefits. When you receive income from employment (salary or wages): •give your employer your IRD number so that the correct amount of tax is deducted from your pay. If you do not have an IRD number, go to page 13 to find out how to get 1. •complete a Tax code declaration - IR330 to ensure that you are taxed at the correct rate. Without a tax code declaration, tax is deducted at the higher no-notification rate of 45 cents in the dollar. For information on what tax code to use for your job refer to the Tax code declaration - IR330 or ird.govt.nz/tax-codes Most salary and wage earners and those who receive benefits and pensions pay the correct amount of tax during the year. You will receive an Income tax assessment or be required to file an Individual tax return - IR3 at the end of the tax year, depending on your situation. To check if you need to file an IR3 log in to myIR at ird.govt.nz and use the online service. Paying tax on rental or business income You may earn income that does not have tax deducted before you receive it, such as income from running your own business. In this situation other than your first year in business you'll generally have to pay your tax in instalments during the year. This is called provisional tax. When you file your tax return at the end of the financial year, the provisional tax you've already paid will be offset against the end-of-year tax amount you owe. When you receive rental or business income, you need to: •apply for an IRD number for your business unless you are operating as a sole trader •keep accurate records •fill out an Individual tax return - IR3 each year and send it to us by the due date. When completing your IR3 you'll need to include income from all sources and work out the tax on your total taxable income. 16 ird.govt.nz There are different requirements for getting an IRD number for a business, depending on what type of business you have. If you are operating as a sole trader, you can use your own individual IRD number. Note Visit ird.govt.nz for more information on: •the requirements for getting an IRD number for your business •paying tax •expenses or deductions you can claim •GST (goods and service tax) and employer responsibilities •good business practices when running a business in New Zealand. Our Smart business - IR320 guide is for new and existing businesses. This guide includes information on basic income tax responsibilities, bookkeeping, claiming expenses, GST and employer responsibilities. If you receive rental income, check our Rental income - IR264 guide for information on your tax responsibilities. A list of other useful publications is on page 22. GST (goods and services tax) GST is New Zealand's main type of tax after income tax. It is an indirect tax business (including retailers) charge as part of the cost of goods and services that they supply. The current rate is 15%. When a GST-registered business buys goods or services from its suppliers, it can claim a credit for the GST the suppliers charge on these purchases. However, end-user consumers cannot claim a deduction for GST in this way. This means the final consumer of any product or service pays 15% GST on its cost. GST is charged on almost all goods and services supplied in New Zealand, except for rental of residential property, financial services such as mortgages, loans and investments, and the sale of a business that is capable of being carried on by the purchaser as a taxable activity (going concern). For more information on GST read our GST guide - IR375, or go to ird.govt.nz/gst TAXES AND DUTIES 17 Accident compensation New Zealand has a comprehensive accident insurance scheme which covers the costs of all work and non-work-related accidents. The Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) administers this scheme. Levies for cover are paid by employers and self-employed people directly to ACC. Inland Revenue collects employees levies on behalf of ACC as part of the PAYE tax system. RWT (Resident withholding tax) If you receive interest from any person or organisation, RWT is deducted before the interest is credited to you. This might include interest from financial institutions such as banks, finance companies, building societies or credit unions. RWT rates The rate at which RWT is deducted from your interest depends on: •the rate you have elected •the date the interest is paid or credited •whether or not you've given your IRD number to the person or organisation who is paying you interest •whether or not you have elected an RWT rate with your interest payer •your income level. Which rate should I elect? If you've given your financial institution your IRD number, but not elected an RWT rate to be used, they'll deduct RWT at the no-notification rate. This may result in your RWT being deducted at too high a rate. The rate you choose needs to account for the income you expect to earn in the tax year, not just the income from your investment. For current RWT rates go to ird.govt.nz/rwt You can elect to have your interest deducted at a higher rate to avoid an end-of-year tax bill. If a financial institution does not have a client’s IRD number, it will deduct RWT at the no-notification rate. Note 18 ird.govt.nz How do I make an election? To make an RWT rate election you can either: •contact your bank or financial institution and tell them which rate you prefer to be on, or •complete a Choose your RWT deduction rate - IR456 form and give 1 to each bank or financial institution you deal with. The rate you choose will apply once your bank or financial institution has processed this information. International tax rules New Zealand residents must pay income tax in New Zealand on their worldwide income. In addition, a New Zealand resident who has significant investments overseas must calculate the income from those investments according to New Zealand tax rules. These calculation rules do not apply to ordinary overseas bank accounts that you hold. To declare the income from these bank accounts, you simply convert the interest to New Zealand dollars (using the exchange rate for the date on which the interest was credited) and include it in your tax return. For more involved or substantial overseas investments (including interests in superannuation schemes), the calculations can be quite complicated. To find out more about them contact your tax advisor or agent. Tr u s t s If you are a settlor, trustee, or beneficiary of a trust outside New Zealand, there are some trust tax rules you may need to know about. Refer to our guide Trusts and estates income tax rules - IR288 for more information. TAXES AND DUTIES 19 Part 3 - Support for families Child support Child support is money paid by parents not living with their children to help financially support those children, when: •a couple who have children split up, or •2 people have children and are not living together, or •dependent children are no longer living with either parent. Child support is not a tax, it's a payment administered by Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue Child Support assesses the amount the paying parent needs to pay and collects this money. It's then passed on to the person looking after the children to help with the costs of bringing them up, or to the government where the receiving carer is receiving a sole parent benefit to help offset the cost of the benefit. Some parents pay financial support direct to the other parent without the money passing through Inland Revenue Child Support. This can only happen when the person caring for the children is not receiving a sole parent benefit. For more information about child support please go to ird.govt.nz/childsupport or call 0800 221 221. Working for Families Working for Families are for families with children aged 18 or under. There are different types of payments and you may qualify for 1 or more, depending on your family situation. How much you can get depends on: •how many dependent children you have who are 18 or younger •your children's ages •any shared care arrangements •how much you and your partner earn (your family income) •where your family income comes from, for example, salary or wages, business, student allowance or a benefit, and •the number of hours you work each week. You also have to meet residency requirements to be eligible for Working for Families. 20 ird.govt.nz Partner means your civil union or de facto partner. Note The Working for Families payment types are: Family tax credit (FTC) This payment depends on how much you earn, the number of dependent children you have, and any shared care arrangements. We pay FTC if you are a working family, if you receive a student allowance or receive NZ Super. Work and Income often pays FTC to families receiving a benefit. In-work tax credit (IWTC) This payment is for families who are normally in paid work: As long as families receive income from paid work or receive certain compensation payments, IWTC is available to parents who are: •self-employed •receiving NZ Super •receiving a Veteran's Pension, or veteran's weekly compensation payments. You can get IWTC if you and/or your partner are normally in paid work but are receiving accident compensation for an injury that happened on or after 1 January 2006. It is not available to families receiving an income-tested benefit or student allowance. From 1 April 2021, you will keep receiving the in-work tax credit payments for up to 2 weeks during an unpaid break from work. For example, changing jobs, leaving employment or unpaid time such as school holidays. Payments will stop if you/your partner start receiving an income-tested benefit or student allowance during this 2 week period. Minimum family tax credit (MFTC) MFTC is payable to families working for salary or wages who earn an annual family income up to $35,204 after tax from 1 April 2024. MFTC ensures families can have a minimum weekly income after tax of $677 from 1 April 2024. A single parent must be working at least 20 hours a week, and in a 2-parent family, 1 or both parents between them must be working at least 30 hours a week. If you and/or your partner would normally work the required weekly hours but are injured and receive accident compensation instead, you can still qualify for MFTC. TAXES AND DUTIES 21 Best Start Best Start was introduced to assist families with the costs in a child's early years. You can get this payment for up to 3 years after a new child arrives. You can receive up to $3,838 per year, or $73 per week. Best Start is not adjusted for income levels in your child's first year but is adjusted in the second and third year.

Business Ngā Ūmanga IR296 | April 2023 This factsheet explains your tax responsibilities and entitlements if you're a self-employed private operator in the sex industry. A private operator is anyone in the sex industry who receives payment for their services without tax being deducted from it. The definition includes people who work in massage parlours, escort agencies, on the street and privately. Work out if you're self-employed (a private operator) or an employee (you work for someone else) by reading our guide Self-employed or an employee? - IR336 or by contacting us - see overleaf. If you're a private operator, you file an Individual tax return - IR3 at the end of the income year. You show your total income and work out how much tax you have to pay. You'll also have to work out your ACC levies and student loan repayments if you're a borrower. Everyone who earns money in New Zealand must pay their share of tax. Your taxes pay for services we all need, such as healthcare, education, social welfare, and transport. Taxes and how to pay them Income tax For most self-employed people, the income year starts on 1 April and ends on 31 March the following year. Your income tax returns are due on 7 July (although it can be later if you have a tax agent). In most cases, you must pay any tax by 7 February the following year. If you expect your income tax bill to be $5,000 or more at the end of the year, you may need to pay your tax in instalments throughout the year. This system is called provisional tax. Our guide Smart business - IR320 explains how you can plan for these payments. Find out more about provisional tax at ird.govt.nz/provisional-tax GST (goods and services tax) GST is a 15% tax on the supply (sale) of most goods and services in New Zealand, most goods imported into New Zealand and some specified imported services. Supplying or making a supply is your taxable activity. You must register for GST if your turnover from your taxable activities: • was over $60,000 for the last 12 months, or • is expected to go over $60,000 for the next 12 months. Private operators If you have not already registered for GST and need help deciding, use our guided help – Do I need to register for GST? You can voluntarily register for GST if your turnover is less than $60,000. If you decide you need to register, you claim GST for purchases and expenses related to your business and pay GST on your income. You can register for GST in myIR. You can reduce your end-of-year tax payment Deduct your business expenses Business expenses are products or services that you pay for and use in your work. You can claim most business-related expenses in your tax return, for example condoms, lubricants, work clothes and advertising fees. You cannot claim personal or domestic expenses such as casual clothing, groceries, gym fees and childcare. You can claim industry-specific medical expenses, for example HIV and STD tests. You may also be able to claim for pregnancy tests and cosmetic surgery. But you cannot claim private medical expenses. Find out more about expenses at ird.govt.nz/business-expenses Claim the costs of working from home If you work from home, you can claim a percentage of your household expenses, eg, rent, electricity, house insurance and rates. You'll need to set aside a specific area, for example a bedroom, hold on to all your receipts and keep a record of all the expenses you want to claim. We tell you how to do this at ird.govt.nz/business-expenses Work out depreciation for wear and tear When business items wear out or become outdated, they lose value. This is called depreciation. You can claim for single items over $500 or for a group of similar items with a combined value. Use our depreciation rates to work out the loss in value and deduct this amount in your tax return. ird.govt.nz The information in this document was current at the time of publication.

The best way of achieving this is when people willingly comply with the tax laws - voluntary compliance. We help people to comply through the information available on our website, our booklets and guides, our advisory services and call centres. We also encourage people to work within the tax laws by carrying out business audits. An audit is basically a check of tax and business records to make sure you've paid the correct amount of tax. The audit can cover income tax, GST and employer returns. After an audit you may be entitled to a refund or you may have to pay more tax. This booklet explains our different types of audits and what to expect if you are selected for one. About audits The different types of audits we do, how we select you for an audit and what it will involve. How we'll work with you Your rights (what you can expect from us) and what we require from you during an audit. After an audit This booklet will answer most of your questions about audits. If you need more information ask the IR officer or contact the IR officer's team leader.

An Inland Revenue audit is an examination of your financial affairs to check that you've paid the correct amount of tax, and you're complying with the tax laws. An audit might simply be a check of a GST registration, or it could be a full examination of business and personal records. Types of audits We broadly group our customers into two categories: Small and medium enterprises audits This includes individuals and businesses with a turnover of up to $300 million. Audits of individuals may be for self-employment or other income, and also include reviews of personal entitlement claims, such as rebates and Working for Families Tax Credits. There are various types of business audits. These include reviews of a particular transaction or return, such as a GST refund claim; employer obligation checks, e.g. PAYE and KiwiSaver, FBT; and numerous technical checks, such as deductibility of expenditure, shareholder continuity etc. Large enterprises This covers audits, reviews and checks of the tax affairs of Large Enterprises customers and industries with specific tax legislation. Audits are selected for a range of issues, revenue types and periods. Sometimes these are extended or changed throughout the audit process. How we select you for an audit Small and medium enterprises There are a number of reasons you may be selected for an audit, for example: • our analysts have identified that the information in the tax returns you've filed shows an unusual pattern, or one that's inconsistent with industry norms 7 www.ird.govt.nz • our current compliance focus includes the industry or activity you're involved in • we have received information (this could be from a variety of sources) that suggests your returns are not correct • we're aware that you have a history of not complying with your tax obligations • we have received local knowledge, perhaps arising from media reports or unexplained wealth, or • we may choose you randomly. We review our selection methods and compliance focus regularly and publish information about our compliance focus. Please note that to preserve the integrity of our selection processes we may not tell you the reason you're selected for an audit. We'll tell you what we intend our area of focus to be. Large enterprises Large Enterprise customers are subject to ongoing risk assessment. Where we identify a significant issue we'll seek to resolve it immediately. This may be by an audit. Where we identify a future risk this could be subject to an audit in the future. As part of our overall compliance plan we'll undertake additional risk reviews of particular parts of the business or compliance systems of large enterprise taxpayers. Audits may result from these reviews. They may be for a specific tax type or across all tax types. Where we identify a clear area of non compliance an audit may be commenced without a risk review. You may also be selected for an audit where our current compliance focus included the industry or activity you're involved in. INLAND REVENUE AUDITS8 Starting the audit Often audits are preceded by a "risk review". A risk review is where we request information from you in order to evaluate the risk of non-compliance. This isn't the same as an audit and our initial contact with you will clearly identify whether we are carrying out an audit or a risk review. Where a risk review detects an issue that requires more in-depth inspection, we'll advise you that an audit will be commenced. We'll usually give you reasonable warning of an audit. However, sometimes we may make an unannounced visit. In this situation you're required by law to allow an IR officer's entry into your business premises and access to your records (unless documents are covered by legal privilege - see page 17). How much advance warning do we give? If you're linked to a tax agent for the tax type we're going to investigate, we'll contact them first and send a letter to both of you to confirm the nature of our audit with an anticipated timeframe. We generally request some records to review to gain an understanding of your business prior to the first meeting. The first meeting The first meeting is an opportunity for the IR officer to meet you to discuss the audit in general and make arrangements for how the audit will be carried out. Depending on what's most convenient for you, the meeting may be held at the nearest IRD office, at your tax agent's or accountant's office, or at your premises. Our officer will ask you a number of questions relating to the records you keep, your accounting system and return- preparation procedures, and your business activities. Our officer may also check your records and look at some parts of your return(s). If you know there's something wrong with your tax affairs, this is a good time to let us know - it's called a voluntary disclosure. 9 www.ird.govt.nz Voluntary disclosures Any person or organisation liable for paying tax can make a voluntary disclosure. There are advantages in making a voluntary disclosure rather than waiting for us to find any discrepancies during an audit. A major advantage is that the penalty charged on any related tax shortfall may be reduced by up to 100% - see pages 12. If you are considering making a voluntary disclosure please read our booklet Putting your tax affairs right (IR280). Disclosure during an audit If you've already received a notice from Inland Revenue to say you've been chosen for an audit, you can still make a voluntary disclosure. You can tell us what's wrong with your (or your organisation's) tax affairs at the initial interview or at the inspection of records stage (whichever is earlier). If you do this, the amount of any related penalties charged may be reduced by 40%. How long does an audit take? There is no set time for an audit. How long it takes depends on: • the size and complexity of your business • the standard of your records, and • your cooperation. We'll provide an estimate of the timeframe at the outset of the audit, if we need to extend it we'll discuss this with you. Note Because we know an audit can affect your business routine, our officers will try to cause as little disruption as possible. INLAND REVENUE AUDITS10 How are audits carried out? Each type of audit is done differently, although the basic procedures are the same. Some audits may require one visit and some may involve more regular contact. Where appropriate our officers will work on your premises. Computer-assisted auditing techniques Compliance Technology and Audit (CT&A) helps Inland Revenue officers with some audits by applying computer- assisted auditing techniques to any size computer system, from PC to mainframe. The main techniques are: • general ledger/data download • system risk reviews • financial transaction analysis. General ledger/data download We get your financial information in electronic format and convert it into a format that can be used by the IR officer doing the audit. System risk review This is a detailed analysis and evaluation of the aspects of a computer system that are relevant to the calculation of tax eg, from data entry through to posting in the financial accounts. We'll talk to those members of your staff who have a day- to-day understanding of the computer programs and their operations. We'll also consult with accounts personnel. After documenting the system, we evaluate controls and weaknesses and discuss our findings with you. We'll usually request data to test some of the findings. Financial transaction analysis We analyse electronically stored accounting data using commercially available general audit software. Common data analysis procedures include: • getting a data profile (working out the size, number and distribution of transactions in a file) • sorting, extracting and listing records based on certain criteria sampling. 11 www.ird.govt.nz Technological specification During a review CT&A staff will assist you in establishing the most practical format to extract data from your system. You can provide us with your electronic data on portable media or portable storage devices, or CT&A can discuss other options with you as needed. We can also advise you on secure modes for transport of data. What does this mean for you? If the IR officer wants to use computer-assisted auditing techniques they'll advise you that a CT&A officer will contact you. They may also ask you to complete a CT&A questionnaire. This gives an overview of your computerised systems and the electronic financial data you have available. The CT&A officer will then discuss with you what they require and work out the best way to achieve this. Potential benefits Using CT&A techniques can mean: • less disruption to your business • fewer demands on your staff • reduced compliance costs, and • fewer, more specific requests for information. For more information about CT&A go to www.ird.govt.nz (keyword: CTA). Records check Complete and accurate business records are required to be retained for a period of seven years and, if requested, must be made available to us in a timely manner. Checking records, such as ledgers, journals, invoices and bank accounts (both business and private) is an important part of an audit and usually takes the most time. Sometimes the IR officer will need to take your records back to our office to go through them fully. If we remove records we'll give you a receipt detailing every item we've taken. You can view these records and request copies if you need them. If your business is quite large, we may check the records at your premises or use CT&A (see pages 10 and 11). INLAND REVENUE AUDITS12 Our officer may contact third parties, including your suppliers and employees, for additional information. They may also review your private activities during the audit. Interview For some audits, the words interview and meeting are interchangeable and there may only be one. For others, particularly where we've identified an error or incorrect tax treatment, we'll request a more formal interview. Technical aspects Our officer will check you have correctly applied the tax laws in assessing your tax liability. Where an incorrect tax law application is identified, we'll discuss it with you. Our officer will need to find out the cause of an incorrect tax position, as this will be taken into account when considering the application of any shortfall penalties. Shortfall penalties Where we determine that an adjustment to a tax return is required, and that adjustment results in an increase in tax to pay (or a reduction of losses), the adjustment amount is referred to as a tax shortfall. When a tax shortfall occurs, we'll consider whether any of the following shortfall penalties apply: Not taking reasonable care The law requires you to take reasonable care in meeting your tax responsibilities. This means that you must take the same care that any reasonable person would in the same circumstances. The penalty for not taking reasonable care is 20% of any resulting tax shortfall. Unacceptable tax position The legal definition of an unacceptable tax position is one that fails to meet the standard of being about as likely as not correct. 13 www.ird.govt.nz This means that the position taken need not necessarily be the correct position, or one that has a 50% chance of success, but must be one capable of being seriously considered by a court. The penalty for a tax shortfall resulting from an unacceptable tax position is 20% of the resulting tax shortfall. Gross carelessness You can be penalised for gross carelessness if your behaviour displays a high degree of carelessness or disregard for the consequences. It is conduct that creates a high risk of a tax shortfall occurring, which would have been foreseen by a reasonable person in the same circumstances. It doesn't matter whether you were unaware of being grossly careless or intended to be so. The penalty for gross carelessness is 40% of the resulting tax shortfall. Abusive tax position The aim of this penalty is to deter you from entering into arrangements that have the dominant purpose of avoiding tax. An abusive tax position is one that: • is based on an unacceptable tax position, and • has tax avoidance as a dominant purpose. This carries a penalty of 100% of the resulting tax shortfall. Evasion Tax evasion involves a deliberate attempt to cheat the system. This may involve: • evading the assessment or payment of tax, on your own or another's behalf • getting refunds for yourself or someone else, knowing there's no lawful entitlement to them • using deducted or withheld tax for anything other than it's lawful purpose The penalty for evasion is 150% of the resulting tax shortfall. In addition to being charged a shortfall penalty, some offences carry a term of imprisonment and/or a maximum fine of $50,000 INLAND REVENUE AUDITS14 Previous behaviour Depending on your compliance history, you may be eligible for a 50% reduction of any shortfall penalty imposed. To find out more about shortfall penalties go to www.ird.govt.nz (keywords: shortfall penalties). Other penalties If we find during the audit that you've wilfully or negligently made a false tax return, not filed a return, not deducted taxes or not accounted for taxes deducted, we may consider further action including further penalties and/or prosecution. Finalising the audit We usually arrange a meeting with you or contact you by phone near the completion of the process to discuss the audit, cover any unresolved issues, and let you know about any adjustments to your tax. We'll send you confirmation of any tax adjustments we consider necessary, as well as any shortfall penalties, in an Agreement to Amend Assessments, which you'll have an opportunity to review. If you don't agree with the adjustments proposed, and we're unable to resolve our disagreement, we'll issue you with a Notice of proposed adjustment (IR770). This initiates the formal disputes resolution process which is governed by firm rules, including time limits, under legislation. Information about disputes resolution is available in our booklet Disputing a notice of proposed adjustment (IR777) for information on how to get our forms and guides see page 2. We won't re-assess your returns or impose any shortfall penalties until you have agreed to the adjustments, or the disputes process has concluded (other than in exceptional circumstances). We'll send you a letter confirming completion of our audit in all cases, whether or not an adjustment is made. 15 www.ird.govt.nz How we'll work with you Confidentiality and privacy Any information or records you give an officer will remain confidential and be kept secure. It'll be used or disclosed only as required by law. During an audit we may collect information about you. This will be gathered from interviews, discussions, correspondence, or from your records. We collect this information so we can assess your tax liability or entitlements. You're required to answer all questions and provide any information we ask for. If you don't, you can be prosecuted and possibly fined. Under the Privacy Act 1993, you are entitled to see almost all of the personal information we hold about you, and ask us to correct any errors. The IR officer's role You can expect an officer to: • be prompt, courteous and professional • follow through on what they say they'll do • respect your privacy and treat all information about you as private and confidential. All officers carry a delegation of authority card showing their name and photograph, and stating their legal authority to check your records. You can ask to see this at any time, and we recommend you do, before you give them any information. Your role The officer can expect you to be courteous and honest and to give them reasonable assistance during an audit. This includes giving access to your business premises and supplying information and documents in a timely manner. We don't expect you to stop all activity and focus on the audit, but your cooperation will mean we can finish the audit as quickly as possible with minimal disruption to your business. INLAND REVENUE AUDITS16 Gifts We can't accept gifts from customers. If you'd like to recognise the work done by our officer, you're welcome to send us a letter of acknowledgment. During the audit If any of our officer's questions are not clear, ask them to clarify the question so there's no misunderstanding. Most of the questions will be about your business, but some may be about your private activities. For example, you might be asked what you spend your money on, what bank accounts you have and what your leisure activities are. We ask these questions to check that you're living within the level of income shown in your returns. Note You can have someone with you at an interview, or at any other time during the audit. For example, your tax agent, solicitor or a friend. But you’ll need to provide documented authority (such as a signed letter) before an officer can discuss your tax affairs with another person present. The officer will take notes of all interviews held during an audit. We'll ask you to sign the notes as being correct, but you have the right to refuse. You may request a copy of the officer's notes and you're also welcome to take your own notes. You'll be provided with a copy of any audio recording and transcript. If you have to collect any extra records or information, we'll give you reasonable time to do this before continuing the audit. We may ask you to fill in a Statement of assets and liabilities (IR110) form which lists your assets and liabilities at a particular date, or other forms that relate to your audit. 17 www.ird.govt.nz Obstructing the IR officer It's a serious matter if you obstruct an Inland Revenue officer as they carry out their audit. Obstruction can mean: • refusing reasonable access to your business premises • destroying relevant information • lying and falsifying details • creating deliberate delays to frustrate Inland Revenue enquiries. A shortfall penalty may be increased by 25% for obstruction. The IR officer also has the right to enter your private dwelling if they have a court warrant. Obstructing Inland Revenue in carrying out it's lawful duties, or in exercising it's lawful powers, is also an offence. The penalties for conviction are up to: • $25,000 for the first offence • $50,000 for subsequent offences. Legal privilege There are some communications between you and your solicitor that you don't have to give us. This right, known as legal privilege, is allowed under the Tax Administration Act 1994. Privileged communications must be for the purpose of getting or giving legal advice or assistance and must not relate to an illegal or wrongful act. Most records relating to a solicitor's trust account are not privileged. If you're not sure whether a document is covered by legal privilege, we'll give you reasonable time to consult a solicitor. This applies even on an unannounced visit. If necessary, we'll ask the courts to determine whether a document is privileged or not. It's not a matter for the officer to decide. INLAND REVENUE AUDITS18 Non-disclosure right for tax advice documents A non-disclosure right applies to tax advice documents which Inland Revenue wants to have disclosed. This right only applies to certain documents prepared by tax advisors bound by their code of conduct and disciplinary practices of an approved advisor group. The right also extends to certain documents created by taxpayers for the purpose of seeking tax advice from tax advisors. There are two registered approved advisor groups for this right: - New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants - Tax Agents Institute of New Zealand For more information go to our Standard Practice Statement SPS 05/07 Non-disclosure right for tax advice documents at www.ird.govt.nz Viewing our records Two Acts give you the right to see most of the information we hold about you and your business: • the Privacy Act 1993 (for individuals) • the Official Information Act 1982 (for non-individuals). We'll factor in the intention of these Acts when considering your request. However, some records and information are protected from release by the Tax Administration Act 1994, which overrides the Privacy and Official Information Acts. These are: • any matters that cover Inland Revenue procedures or checks • the reason for the audit • Inland Revenue legal opinions • information received about you from other people, unless it's used to make an assessment • information about other people • where disclosure of the information will prejudice an ongoing audit. 19 www.ird.govt.nz If you disagree with a decision to withhold information from you, you have the right to a review of the decision by the Ombudsmen. Office of the Ombudsmen PO Box 10152 The Terrace Wellington 6143 Phone 0800 802 602 Solving problems You and the officer should try to sort out any problems that arise between you. If this isn't possible you may need to contact the officer's team leader or manager, whose details will be provided to you in the initial audit letter. Large Enterprises clients should contact their sector manager or specialist business manager. INLAND REVENUE AUDITS20 After an audit Assessments We'll send you a notice of assessment and a statement of account showing any refund or tax to pay and when it's due. The assessment will be issued after an agreed adjustment or notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA) has been worked out. Refund If you've overpaid your tax you'll receive the refund shortly after we send your assessments. We may also pay interest on any overpayment. Tax to pay If you owe tax, we'll generally allow you at least one month to pay from the date the assessments are issued. If you're unable to pay any amount owing by the due date we can discuss payment options. If you want to, you can make a payment on account during the audit of the estimated tax owing. This may avoid any further late payment penalties and will reduce the amount of interest charged. Disputes If you want to dispute our NOPA please read our booklet Disputing a notice of proposed adjustment (IR777). Interest If you overpay your tax, we may pay interest on the amount overpaid. If you underpay, we may charge you interest on the underpayment. If you've overpaid, we'll pay interest from the day after the original due date for the relevant return period. For underpayments, we charge interest from the day after the original due date for payment. 21 www.ird.govt.nz Late payment If you pay the amount of tax adjusted during the audit within two months of the assessment, there will be no late payment penalties. Otherwise, we'll charge an initial 1% late payment penalty on the day after the due date. We'll charge a further 4% penalty if there is still an amount of unpaid tax (including penalties) seven days after the due date. Every month the amount owing remains unpaid after the due date a further 1% incremental penalty will be charged. Interest and late payment penalties aren't charged on outstanding amounts of $100 or less. Arrangements If you're unable to pay your tax by the due date, please call us. We'll look at your payment options which may include an instalment arrangement, depending on your circumstances. Arrangements can be agreed upon before or after the due date for payment. However, there are greater reductions in the penalties charged if the arrangement is made before the due date. For more help Read our booklet Taxpayer obligations, interest and penalties (IR240) - see page 2 for how to get our forms and guides. Non-payment of employer monthly schedule penalty (EMS) If the amount owing from an Employer monthly schedule (IR348) isn't paid by the due date we'll send you a reminder letter. If the overdue amount isn't paid or an instalment arrangement entered into, we'll charge you a non-payment penalty (NPP). Every month an amount remains outstanding we'll charge you a further NPP. If, within a month of the penalty date you don't pay in full or enter into an instalment arrangement, the non-payment penalty will be 10% of the unpaid tax. If you do pay in full or enter into an instalment arrangement within that month, the non- payment penalty will be charged at a reduced rate of 5% of the unpaid tax. INLAND REVENUE AUDITS22 Penalties will be charged on all short or unpaid KiwiSaver compulsory employer contributions. Interest won't be charged on compulsory employer contributions. For more help Find out more about penalties and interest at www.ird.govt.nz (keyword: penalties). Reduction of penalties for previous behaviour A shortfall penalty may be reduced because of your previous behaviour. This means that a shortfall penalty imposed under any of the five categories of fault may be reduced by 50% unless you've been convicted of a disqualifying offence or been liable for a disqualifying penalty. All taxpayers start with a "clean slate" from 26 March 2003. Disqualifying offence There are two categories of offences that can disqualify you from receiving the reduction for previous behaviour. Category 1 includes knowledge offences, evasion and offences relating to enquiries. If you have a conviction for an offence entered on or after 26 March 2003, and before taking the tax position the current penalty relates to, you won't qualify for a reduction for previous behaviour at any time in the future. Category 2 includes absolute liability offences and offences in relation to cheque duties. You won't qualify for a reduction for previous behaviour if your offences: • related to the same tax type as the tax position to which the current penalty relates • were entered on or after 26 March 2003 • were entered two or less years before you took the tax position the current penalty relates to for PAYE, GST, FBT, or RWT • were entered four or less years before you took the tax position the current penalty relates to, for any other tax type. 23 www.ird.govt.nz Disqualifying penalties There are three categories of penalties that can disqualify you from receiving the reduction for previous behaviour. Category 1 applies when the current penalty is imposed for evasion or a similar act. A previous penalty that disqualifies you from the reduction for good behaviour is one that: • related to the tax type to which the current penalty relates • was imposed for evasion or a similar act • was not reduced by voluntary disclosure • related to a tax position taken on or after 26 March 2003 and before you took the tax position which the current penalty relates to. Category 2 applies when the current penalty is for gross carelessness or abusive tax position. A previous penalty that will disqualify you from the reduction for good behaviour is one that: • related to the same tax type • was imposed for gross carelessness, abusive tax position or evasion • wasn't reduced by voluntary disclosure • related to a tax position taken on or after 26 March 2003 • related to a tax position taken two years before you took the tax position the current penalty relates to for PAYE, GST, FBT or RWT • related to a tax position four or fewer years before you took the tax position the current penalty relates to, for other tax types. INLAND REVENUE AUDITS24 Category 3 applies if the current penalty is for not taking reasonable care or for an unacceptable tax position. A disqualifying penalty is one that: • was imposed for any of the five categories of fault • related to the same tax type • was not reduced by voluntary disclosure • related to a tax position taken on or after 26 March 2003 • related to a tax position taken two years before you took the tax position the current penalty relates to, for PAYE, GST, FBT or RWT • related to a tax position four or less years before you took the tax position the current penalty relates to, for other tax types.

IR297A August 2019 Computer-assisted audits What it means for you 2 www.ird.govt.nz Introduction Inland Revenue recognises the challenges associated with auditing accounting systems and records kept on computers. We have a specialist computer team which works alongside the investigations team during a customer audit. Computer-assisted auditing is a very efficient way of auditing your records because we don't need hard copy reports of information and we can do more work off-site. This means: • less disruption to your business • fewer demands on your staff - investigators keep a copy of your accounting data • reduced costs - fewer requests from investigators, no printouts • you'll receive an overview on how your accounting system works. A member of the investigating team will make the first contact between the computer team and the customer. www.ird.govt.nz Go to our website for information and to use our services and tools. How to get our forms and guides You can get copies of all our forms and guides by going to www.ird.govt.nz and entering the shoulder number in the search box. You can also order copies by calling 0800 257 773. COMPUTER TAX AUDITS 3 Contents Introduction 2 www.ird.govt.nz 2 How to get our forms and guides 2 Types of computer-assisted audits 4 Keeping computer records 5 Technological specifications 6 Upgrading your computer system 6 Confidentiality 6 Other systems reviews 7 Need to know more? 7 Privacy 8 If you have a complaint about our service 8 0800 self-service numbers 9 4 www.ird.govt.nz Types of computer-assisted audits Systems audit This is a detailed analysis and evaluation of a complete accounts computer system - from data entry through to posting in the financial accounts. We'll talk to the members of your staff who have a day- to-day understanding of the computer programs and their operations, and we'll also consult with your accounts people. We don't need to operate your computer system. After documenting the system, we evaluate controls and weaknesses and discuss our findings with you. We'll usually request data to test some of the findings. We may be on site with you for up to a week for an average of three hours a day. We may need the use of a meeting room and a photocopier but we aim to cause you as little disruption as possible. Data download We'll analyse your electronically stored accounting data using commercially available software. Data analysis varies with every audit but common procedures are: • getting a data profile, ie, working out the size, number and distribution of transactions in a file • sorting, extracting and listing records based on certain criteria • sampling. We'll keep any information or data you give us confidential and secure. COMPUTER TAX AUDITS 5 Keeping computer records You must keep your business records for seven years. They can be either paper or stored on electronic media. Your records must: • contain enough information to meet legal requirements • be in English, unless we've approved another language. • be stored in New Zealand unless approval has been given to store them elsewhere. Read our factsheet Record keeping (IR323) for more details. If you aren't already keeping your records electronically (eg, disk, tape) we strongly suggest you consider it. What to keep As well as your business records, you must also keep these specific records for computer-assisted audits. • Accounting or transaction level records, including the general ledger and other journals and subsidiary accounts books in electronic format. • Charts and accounts codes, accounting instruction manuals, and system and program documents which describe the accounting system. • Layouts of all retained files if your systems have been modified. Keep old and new records. Legal definitions • "Records" includes account books and accounts stored in an electronic format. • "Documents" includes electronic data, computer programs, computer tapes and disks. 6 www.ird.govt.nz Technological specifications During an audit we'll help you work out the most practical format to extract data from your system. You can give us your electronic data on portable media, eg, CD Rom, DVD or USB memory sticks. We'll advise on secure modes of transport of data. Upgrading your computer system When you're installing or upgrading a computerised accounting system, keep these important points in mind: • Can the new system retrieve and read data from the old system? If not, can the data from the old system be converted? • If it's too expensive or not feasible to convert data, do you want a third party to maintain your old data or would you prefer to print hard copies? Your electronic data must be retrievable and readable at all times. You'll need to follow appropriate back-up procedures and install a regular maintenance programme to stop your electronic media deteriorating. Confidentiality Inland Revenue takes data security very seriously. We work under strict secrecy obligations and constantly review new security products. Please read our guide Inland Revenue audits (IR297) for more details. COMPUTER TAX AUDITS 7 Other systems reviews • The specialist computer team periodically reviews commercial accounting and payroll software for its tax usability. We'll suggest any improvements to the software providers. • The team also reviews PAYE intermediary software to ensure the information technology and administration systems can support our compliance requirements.

Notes Introduction Any beneficiary who receives income or certain distributions from either a foreign trust or a non-complying trust must fill in an IR 307. The IR 307 helps us make sure that these distributions are taxed correctly in the hands of beneficiaries. (Use a separate form for each trust, if a beneficiary is in more than one trust.) Beneficiaries in complying trusts do not need to complete this form. Types of estates and trusts • Complying trusts Trusts that have paid tax in New Zealand on all their income since the date they began are complying trusts. They include: – tru sts settled by New Zealand residents with New Zealand trustees – estates of people who were New Zealand residents when they died – other trusts that have elected to become complying trusts. A trust is not a complying trust if the only trustee income derived is non-resident withholding income. • For eign trusts A trust or estate is a foreign trust where no settlor of the trust has been resident in New Zealand from the later of 17 December 1987 or the date the trust was first settled. • Non-co mplying trusts Any trust which is not a complying or foreign trust is a non- complying trust. Generally this will be a trust that has been settled by a New Zealand resident with the non-resident trustees, and which has not been subject to New Zealand tax on all trustee income derived since the trust was first settled. Beneficiary income Beneficiary income is income which vests absolutely in a beneficiary during the income year in which it is derived by the estate or trust, or which is paid or applied to or for the benefit of the beneficiary within six months from the end of that year. Taxable distribution A taxable distribution is a distribution to a beneficiary from a foreign or a non-complying trust, that is not a distribution: – of beneficiary income, or – from corpus, or – in the case of a foreign trust, from capital profits or gains from transactions with non-associated persons. Distributions of accumulated trustee income and capital profits or gains that were derived by the trust in the 1988 or earlier income years are not treated as taxable distributions. Special rules exist to work out what each distribution is made of, to decide whether a taxable distribution has been made. These rules are explained in our booklet Trusts’ and estates’ income tax rules (IR 288). You can view a copy on our website at www.ird.govt.nz or you can order one by calling 0800 257 773. Overseas tax credits Credit for overseas tax paid on a taxable distribution received by a New Zealand beneficiary is available only if the tax deducted by the overseas country is like New Zealand non-resident withholding tax. Show only the share of total foreign withholding tax deducted which is attached to the taxable part of the total distributions received from the trust during the year. Attach proof of the foreign non-resident withholding tax paid. Details to show in the beneficiary’s income tax return • Income On IR 3 returns there is a separate box for “Total taxable distributions from non-complying trusts” under “New Zealand estate or trust income”. This is because these taxable distributions are taxed at a different rate. Show all taxable distributions from non-complying trusts in this box in the return. We will show the tax on these distributions on your notice of assessment. Show New Zealand interest and dividend beneficiary income from this form in the “New Zealand interest” or the “New Zealand dividends” boxes in the return, as applicable. Show other beneficiary income and taxable distributions from foreign trusts in the “New Zealand estate or trust income” or “overseas income” boxes in the return, as applicable. For other income tax returns, follow the instructions in the return guide about what to include in your return. • Credits All the resident withholding tax, imputation credits, dividend withholding payment credits and dividend resident withholding tax must be shown in the appropriate box under “New Zealand interest or New Zealand dividends”. Tax paid by trustees should be shown in the box under “New Zealand estate or trust income”. Credits for tax paid overseas and/or foreign non-resident withholding tax deducted from taxable distributions should be claimed at the overseas income question in the return. The credit will be limited to the New Zealand tax payable on the overseas income. For more help If you want more information or need any help completing this form, contact the trust’s agent or phone us on 0800 377 774.
IR 308 (November 2002) 17/3/04 5:31 PM Page 1 31 March A BETA is a memorandum account used to prevent double taxation of attributed foreign income derived from an income interest of 10% or greater in a controlled foreign company (CFC). A BETA is also used to prevent double taxation of income arising from an interest in a foreign investment fund (FIF): – where the branch equivalent method or accounting profits method is used, or – which is held either through a CFC or an FIF where the branch equivalent method is used. The double taxation is prevented by recording a credit in the BETA for New Zealand income tax paid on the attributed income from the CFC or FIF. That credit is able to be offset against any income tax payable when dividends are received from that CFC or FIF. For more information phone us on 0800 443 773. Attach this completed form to your income tax return.

The credit is calculated using the formula: b ax–d c Where, in relation to the return and the income year: a–is the tax payable b–is the lesser of attributed foreign income derived, or taxable income c–is the amount of the taxable income d–is the amount of any foreign tax credits allowed under section LC 4 of the Income Tax Act 1994 in calculating the tax payable on the attributed foreign income. Offset against income tax This is a debit. It arises on the date of the election to make the offset. Where a dividend is derived from a CFC by a person holding an income interest of 10% or greater or from an FIF where the branch equivalent or accounting profits calculation method is used, an amount up to the credit balance in the BETA may be offset against the income tax payable on that dividend.

Branch equivalent tax account return For the period 1 Aprilto 31 March This return must be completed by a New Zealand resident person, other than a company, who maintains a branch equivalent tax account (BETA). A BETA is a memorandum account used to prevent double taxation of attributed foreign income derived from an income interest of 10% or greater in a controlled foreign company (CFC). A BETA is also used to prevent double taxation of income arising from an interest in a foreign investment fund (FIF) where: the FIF income is treated as attributed CFC income: – where the attributable FIF income method is used, or – which is held indirectly either through a FIF where the attributable FIF income method is used or a CFC where your FIF income is based on your interest in the CFC, and the FIF is treated as a CFC, and the interest in it is treated as an income interest. The double taxation is prevented by recording a credit in the BETA for New Zealand income tax paid on the attributed income from the CFC or FIF. That credit is able to be offset against any income tax payable when dividends are received from that CFC or FIF. For more information phone us on 0800 443 773.

This guide is to help you understand if you should pay tax when you sell a property. We explain your responsibilities and help you decide what other information you might need and when to get professional advice. The information in this guide is primarily aimed at individuals. Builders, developers, dealers, etc should talk to their tax professional as different rules may apply. Also included is information on the bright-line test for residential property purchased on or after 1 October 2015. Note Property means land (including a bare section), buildings and rights or options, eg, for "off the plan" properties. The ownership structure of the property doesn't matter. Whether it's owned by an individual, by a trust, by a qualifying company or by a look-though company - the rules are still the same. Note Purchase means any form of acquisition of the property including transfers or gifts. Sale means any form of disposal of the property including transfers or gifts. Introduction ird.govt.nz5 Do I have to pay tax on property I sell? Two main property situations are covered by this guide: The intention test focuses on what your intention was at the time you purchased the property. If you intended to sell the property this makes it taxable. The bright-line test for residential property applies to properties purchased on or after 1 October 2015 and looks at the length of time you owned the property between purchase and sale. Even if you didn't intend to sell the property the bright-line test may make it taxable. Intention test This will depend on your reason or intention at the time you buy the property. If you buy a property with the firm intention of selling it when prices rise - to make a gain from the increase in the property's value - the profit is likely to be taxable. If you buy the property to provide a home for your family, any profit from the eventual resale is most likely not taxable, unless you have a history of regularly buying and selling properties. A good test is to ask yourself "what are my reasons for buying this property?" You should also remember to consider the bright-line test. 6 Buying and selling residential property Case study 1 Chris knows Tom is looking for a property in Avondale. Chris has a friend in real estate with a property Chris knows Tom will like. Chris buys the property with the hope of selling it to Tom at a profit. Chris bought the property with the intention of reselling it and making a gain and must pay tax on any profit he makes. Case study 2 Bob knows there's a shortage of houses for sale in Green Bay. Bob buys a property in the area. His immediate goal is to build a granny flat on the property and rent both properties to pay off some of the building costs. He later plans to sell both properties at a profit. Bob bought the property with the intention of improving it and then selling it. His rental income is taxable and he must pay tax on any profit he makes from the sale of the property. Case study 3 Lance is a university student. He decides to buy one of the properties he's heard advertised on the radio for "...only a $1,000 deposit down". He borrows the $1,000 as he thinks he can sell the property at a bit of a profit before the title is issued, and before he needs to pay the balance. Any profit Lance makes is taxable as his only intention was to make a profit. ird.govt.nz7 If one of your reasons for buying a property is to resell it any profit is taxable. It's a fact that nearly everyone buying a property will sell it at some stage in the future and most people hope their property will gain in value. However, this alone isn't enough to make any profits taxable. It's only when one of your specific reasons for buying a property is to resell it that any profit you make from the sale is taxable. We need to work out your intentions when you buy property so we can decide whether any profits you make on its sale will be taxable. Normally, living in a house means that any profits on its eventual sale are likely to be non-taxable, unless you have a history of regularly buying and selling properties. We make all our decisions on a case-by-case basis. Why is my reason for buying a property important? The following case studies illustrate the intention test. Even if the result isn't taxable under the intention test, the bright-line test may still apply. This is discussed in more detail on page 14. 8 Buying and selling residential property Case study 4 Moana buys a property with the intention of providing a home for herself and her children. When she eventually sells it she hopes to make a gain and leave her children a legacy. In a year's time she gets a new job and decides to sell the property to move closer to her new job. Property prices have risen, so Moana gains from the sale and can buy a bigger home. The profit from the sale of Moana's property isn't taxable as her intention was always to provide a home for her family. Case study 5 Sue buys a property with the intention of selling it for a higher price when the time is right. She and her family will live in it in the meantime. Sue has a regular pattern of buying and selling properties while living in them. Six years later, house prices in Sue's area have risen to a level where she could make a good profit on the sale of her property. The sale of Sue's property is taxable because her intention was always to sell it, and she has a history of regularly buying and selling properties. In these examples we've assumed that Moana and Sue's stated intentions are genuine and didn't change over time. ird.govt.nz9 You can have more than one reason for buying a property and for selling one. In principle, we take into account all your reasons for buying a property. For the purposes of the bright-line test assume the property was owned for longer than five years in the following case studies. Case study 6 Joe and Gail buy a second property as a rental. They also hope, in the long-term, the property could be sold for a profit. Joe and Gail's reason for buying the property is for rental income - the hope of a higher resale value wasn't a reason for the purchase. In this case, the rental income and recovery of any depreciation they've claimed against the property is taxable. Any profit from the eventual sale of the property is unlikely to be taxable. Case study 7 Frances and Bruce buy a second property hoping it will quickly gain in value. They decide to rent it out in the meantime. One of their reasons for buying the property is to make a gain from any increase in its value when they sell it, so they must show the profit in their tax returns. What if I had more than one reason for buying a property? Case study 8 Bill and Dean buy rundown properties that need minor work to get them into a saleable condition. They aim to make a profit on their sales. They also live in the houses while they work on them and don't own another home. Although Bill and Dean use each of the houses as a home, their main reason for buying the properties is to resell them at a higher price. They must pay tax on the profits because they have a history of regularly buying and selling properties. Case study 9 Mark and Jan buy a property as a family home. They are keen on DIY and do a lot of work on the house to make it more comfortable and hope this will increase its eventual resale value. Then Mark gets a job in another city and they sell their home at a substantial gain. Although Mark and Jan worked on the property they had no real intention of reselling it when they bought it. As a family home, the profit made on the house isn't taxable. The buyers' intentions in these examples seem quite clear but there may be other factors in each case which we need to consider. If Mark and Jan had bought and sold houses regularly and this one just happened to coincide with a job change, the situation might be different. Note 10 Buying and selling residential property This can happen. But, generally it's your intention when buying the property that matters. And we do accept that your intentions might change over time. For example, you might buy a property with the intention of selling it later at a higher price, but then you decide you like the area and want to stay there. However, any profit you make when you eventually sell the property would most likely be taxable as your original intention was to make a profit from the sale. On the other hand, you might buy a family home and then your circumstances change. In this situation it's unlikely that you'll be taxed on any profit you make under the intention test. You'll need to consider if the bright-line test applies to the sale. As long as you aren't in the business of trading in or developing property, or constructing buildings, it's your intention at the time you buy the property that counts. What if I change my mind after I buy a property? However, under the bright-line test, if you buy the property and sell it within five years (two years for property purchased on or after 1 October 2015 through to 28 March 2018 inclusive), you may have to pay tax on the sale, no matter what your reason was for buying the property. The bright-line test only applies to properties purchased on or after 1 October 2015. If your reasons for buying a property have changed over time, we strongly recommend you talk to a tax professional so you can work out your tax obligations. ird.govt.nz11 We work out your intentions by listening to what you tell us and looking at your actions. We might look at your history in buying and selling properties. For example, have you bought and sold a number of properties over a period of time, or bought and sold properties at regular intervals? We might look at statements you made to a bank manager or advisor when you bought the property, and at any plans made or discussed at the time. For example: What did you arrange and discuss with your bank? What did you discuss with your real estate agent/s? If you rent out the property, how long have you rented it out for? Did you draw up any plans for the property? What notes were made on council documents? What telephone, power and other utility arrangements did you make? What was your actual or planned involvement in the community, eg, attendance at schools, membership of clubs etc? What were the terms of the financial arrangements? Is the property providing you with a living? How do you work out my intention or reason for buying a property? The actions you take before and after the purchase can also help us to determine your intent. In some cases, a buyer's intention will be fairly black and white, and in others there will be grey areas. If you're not sure if you should pay tax on a property you've sold, please talk to us or your tax professional. 12 Buying and selling residential property Whether we consider a property to be your home or not depends on how you use the property. It doesn't depend on what type of property you own. The bright-line test main home exclusion differs from the family home under the other property sale rules. Note What about my family home? Case study 10 Mary lives in property A. She bought it intending to provide a home for her family. She is enrolled at the local gym, is a member of the local video store and her children attend preschool nearby. She knows her property is worth far more than when she bought it, but is happy in the area and has never put the property up for sale. Mary also owns property B and property C which she bought for resale. These are in different areas from her family home, and between tenancies, she stays in them for security reasons. Noisy neighbours move in next door to Mary at property A. She calls noise control a number of times but the noise gets worse and Mary eventually decides to sell her home. As property A was clearly bought by Mary as her family home any profit she makes won't be taxable. Mary should pay tax on any profit she makes from selling properties B and C. Under the bright-line test, the sale of the property may be taxable if it was her third main home sale within two years. ird.govt.nz13 Case study 11 Ross lives in property A, which he bought with the intention of reselling when it increased in value. Ross has a history of regularly buying and selling properties. He has taken out a six-month membership at the local gym, is a member of the local video store, and his children attend preschool in another suburb. He knows his property is worth far more than when he bought it. He likes living in the area but intends to put the property up for sale as soon as the market is right. Ross also owns two other houses (property B and property C), which he bought for resale. These are in different areas and, between tenancies, he stays in them for security reasons. The market picks up and Ross decides to sell his home. Even though Ross lived in property A as his family home, he bought it intending to resell it, and has a history of regularly doing so. He should pay tax on any profit from the resale. 14 Buying and selling residential property In addition to the usual intent rules, from 1 October 2015 residential property sales may be taxable if you buy then sell within a certain period of time, even if you didn’t intend to sell the property when you purchased it. This generally won’t apply to your main home. The bright-line test looks at whether the property: was purchased on or after 1 October 2015 through to 28 March 2018 inclusive and sold with two years, or was purchased on or after 29 March 2018 and sold within five years. You need to clearly identify when this period starts and finishes. You may be required to have residential land withholding tax (RLWT) deducted at the time of sale if you are an offshore RLWT person. This includes all residential property sales where the property was purchased on or after 1 October 2015, not just those that fall under the bright-line test. For more information on RLWT go to ird.govt.nz/rlwt Note Purchase and sale dates The bright-line test looks at the length of time you owned the property between purchase and sale. For most people the purchase date for the bright-line test is the date property ownership was registered with Land information New Zealand (LINZ) until the date you sign a sale and purchase agreement to sell. If the property is in another country, then it's the date the transfer was registered under that country's laws. If the purchase or sale occurs before the change in title is registered with LINZ or if you have subdivided the property you should consult a tax professional. Case study 12 Marie signs an agreement to buy an investment property on 5 April 2018. The transfer to Marie is registered on the title with LINZ on 17 May 2018. She decides to sell the property and signs a Sale and purchase agreement on 25 February 2020. The transfer is registered on the title on 3 March 2020. The start date for the bright-line test is 17 May 2018 (the day the transfer is registered) and the sale date is 25 February 2020 (the day the Sale and purchase agreement is entered into). Because the sale date is within five years of the purchase date the bright-line test applies and the sale of the property will be taxable. Bright-line test for residential property ird.govt.nz15 When a sale is not taxable The sale will be taxable unless one of the following exclusions apply: it's your main home you have inherited the property the property has been transferred under a relationship property agreement the property was transferred on the death of a person to the executor or administrator of the estate. How do I tell if the property is my main home? You need to have lived in the property for more than 50% of the time you owned it. You must actually live in the home. Having family members using the property as their main home is not sufficient. What about the area of land usage? More than 50% of the area of the land must have been actually used for the home, including such things as the yard, gardens and garages. The test is based on your actual use of the property and not your intended use of the property. Case study 13 Bill buys an apartment block on a single title. He lives in one of the apartments as his main home and rents out the remaining six apartments. Bill sells the apartment block to a third party. Bill can't use the main home exclusion because the land (contained on the single title) was not used predominantly as his main home. The majority of the land was used as rental property. What if I own more than one home? If you have two or more houses that you live in, you'll need to decide which house is your main home. This is determined by considering which of the properties you have the greatest connection with. Various factors may decide which property you have the greatest connection with, including: the time you occupied the home where your immediate family lives where your social ties are strongest your use of the home your employment, business interests and economic ties to the area where the home is located whether your personal property is in the home. 16 Buying and selling residential property What if my home is owned by a trust? The Trust can use the main home exclusion if the property is the main home of a beneficiary of the Trust, but only if the settlor who contributed the most to the trust doesn't have another main home. How many times can I use the main home exclusion? The main home exclusion for the bright-line test can't be used if either: you've used the main home exclusion twice within the last two years, or you've engaged in a regular pattern of buying and selling of residential properties. What if I make a loss on sale If your residential property sale is taxable only under the bright-line test and you make a loss on the sale you won't be able to claim the loss against your other income. The loss amount can only be claimed against any other taxable property sales net income in the same year. Otherwise you'll need to claim it in a future year when you have net income from another taxable property sale. If, however, the loss is part of property trading activity different rules apply. Case study 14 In June 2017 Zac sells residential property (taxable under the bright-line test). Zac purchased the land for $600,000 and sold it for $540,000, meaning he has a loss of $60,000. In the same year he had wages of $80,000. As Zac didn't have another taxable property sale in the same year he can't claim the $60,000 loss in his tax return. He needs to keep a note of this in case he can use it in a future year. In August 2019 Zac sells land (taxable under the intention test), making a profit of $100,000. In this year's tax return Zac can use the $60,000 loss from the bright-line sale in 2017. This means he only has to pay tax on $40,000 of the profit, rather than the full $100,000. How do I show income from property sales in my tax return? If you're showing your income from property sales in your tax return, you may also need to complete a Property sale information - IR833 form for each property sold. This form explains when to use it and what information is required. ird.govt.nz17 A common myth is that if you own a property for long enough the profit made isn't taxable. This isn't true - there's no time limit, it's your intention or reason for buying the property that counts. Depending on how long you’ve owned the property, you'll need to consider if the bright-line test applies to the sale (see page 14). If a property owner or an associate is involved in the business of dealing in land, building and construction work, or in a business or undertaking involving developing or subdividing land, the time the property has been owned before its sale becomes an important consideration for tax purposes. If sold within 10 years, a property may be taxable even though it wasn't bought with the intention of resale. If any of these circumstances relate to you, we strongly recommend you talk to a tax professional so you can work out your tax obligations. Does it matter how long I own a property for? 18 Buying and selling residential property No. Lots of factors influence decisions about buying and selling properties. Changing your job, children changing schools or changes in the neighbourhood are all good reasons for selling a property. However, if you buy and later sell a number of properties at a profit, giving little or no consideration to the personal inconvenience of shifting, and if there are no outside factors influencing your shift, we may question your reasons for the initial purchases. You can only use the main home exclusion twice in two years under the bright-line test. This means third and subsequent main home sales within two years are likely to be taxable. Does this mean I can't shift house when I need to? ird.govt.nz19 Income tax An individual buying and selling property, a partner in a partnership or an owner in a look-through company, needs to send us a completed Individual tax return - IR3 each year, or an Individual tax return - non-resident - IR3NR if you live overseas. You can submit your return online in myIR. You'll need to include enough information in this return to show how you worked out the amount of property income you've calculated after deducting expenses. If you have made a loss from a residential property, you will need to consider if the residential property deduction rules apply. Check our website ird.govt.nz for more information about the rules. Refer to the income tax return guide to find out where in the tax return you need to provide us the information. You may also want to use the Residential property deductions worksheets - IR1226 to help you calculate the amounts. If you're showing property sale income in your tax return, you may also need to complete a Property sale information - IR833 form for each property sold, if you haven't already done this. You can then work out the tax on your total taxable income. Tax credits, such as PAYE, are deducted from the tax on your total taxable income. What type of tax will I have to pay? For most people the tax year ends at 31 March. Any tax to pay is due by 7 February the following year (7 April if you have a tax agent with an extension of time). If you don't already send us a tax return each year, you can complete one using our online service at ird.govt.nz. Or you can call us on 0800 227 774 and we'll send you a tax return at the end of the year. If you're overseas, please call us on 64 4 978 0779. Provisional tax As a buyer and seller of properties it's likely your tax to pay will be more than $2,500, so you'll have to pay provisional tax. Provisional tax isn't a separate tax - it's another way of paying your tax as you earn your income. You usually pay three instalments of provisional tax throughout the year to cover your expected end-of-year income tax. For more detailed information read our guide Provisional tax - IR289. Residential land withholding tax (RLWT) If you're an offshore RLWT person you may have RLWT deducted from your residential property sale/disposal. If you're including a taxable property sale in your end-of-year income tax return then you're entitled to claim the RLWT deducted as a tax credit - reducing your tax to pay. For more information go to ird.govt.nz/rlwt 20 Buying and selling residential property GST (goods and services tax) GST is a tax on the supply of most goods and services in New Zealand. GST can apply to people who buy and sell property. You must register for GST if your annual turnover in the previous 12 months was more than $60,000 (or is likely to be in the next 12 months). Turnover is the total value of taxable supplies made for all your taxable activities, excluding GST. Case study 15 Tony regularly buys rundown houses with the intention of renovating them in his spare time and selling at a profit. He also owns his own family home. Tony is clearly involved in a taxable activity with taxable supplies exceeding $60,000, so he must register for GST and account for GST inputs and outputs. If your property dealings fall within the guidelines for GST registration you must register. For more information go to ird.govt.nz/gst or read our GST - do you need to register? - IR365, GST guide: Working with GST - IR375 and GST plus - Working out specific GST issues - IR546. If more than one person is involved in buying and selling property If you're in a partnership with two or more people, you'll need to get an IRD number by completing an IRD number application - resident non-individual - IR596 form. If the partnership is a non-resident or meets the definition of an offshore person you'll need to get an IRD number by completing an IRD number application - non-resident/offshore non-individual - IR744 form. The partnership only needs to keep one set of accounts to record its income and expenses and file an IR7 tax return each year. This return shows how the income was calculated and the amount of each partner's share. If you're a couple (such as a husband and wife, civil union or de facto) involved in buying and selling property, you don't need a partnership IRD number or an IR7. Each partner includes a copy of the accounts in their individual tax returns and their share of any profit. ird.govt.nz21 You have an obligation to assess your own tax liability and pay the tax you owe. To do this you'll need to know your basic tax obligations. You must: correctly calculate the amount of tax you have to pay (unless you don't have to file a return) deduct or withhold the correct amount of tax from payments or receipts (when required) pay tax on time keep all necessary information (including books and records) and maintain all necessary accounts or balances disclose all information we require in a timely and useful way cooperate with us as required by the Inland Revenue Acts correctly respond to an income tax assessment, if you receive one tell us if you should have received an income tax assessment but didn't comply with other specific tax obligations. An example of not meeting your obligations is entering false information in a tax return or knowingly not showing all your income. If you tell us about your tax situation, any penalties will be much lighter than if you wait for us to find out. Putting your tax affairs right If you've made a mistake or filed an incorrect tax return, it's best to tell us about it before we find out some other way. 22 Buying and selling residential property Voluntary disclosures A voluntary disclosure is when you tell us what's wrong with your tax return/s before we find out some other way. If you think you should have paid tax on the sale of a property but didn't, you should consider making a voluntary disclosure. Penalties are much lighter if you come forward before we contact you. This applies to all disclosures, not just property ones. Anyone can make a voluntary disclosure at any time: by completing a Voluntary disclosure - IR281 form by calling us by letter, fax or email by visiting one of our offices during an interview.

Business Ngā Ūmanga IR316 | July 2024 Provisional tax is income tax you pay during the year, helping you "spread the load" and avoid a big end-of-year income tax bill. This explains your provisional tax options. Provisional tax How provisional tax works You pay provisional tax if your residual income tax (RIT) for the previous tax year, is more than $5,000. RIT is the tax to pay on your income, less PAYE you’ve paid and other tax credits you’re entitled to (except Working for Families). Example Last year Matt earned a salary and had self-employed income. Salary $14,800 Plus self-employed income (net profit) $47,600 Taxable income $62,400 Tax on taxable income $11,740 Less tax deducted from the salary $ 1,610 Residual income tax (RIT) $10,130 Matt’s RIT is more than $5,000 so they will have to pay provisional tax for the following income year. Your first year in business If you make a net profit in your first year, you’ll need to pay tax on this. Making regular voluntary payments or putting money aside during your first year can ease your cash flow for your second year. In your second year you may have to pay end-of-year tax for your first year, on top of provisional tax instalments for your second year. For a guide on how much you should save to cover your tax during your first year, refer to our Income tax in your first year of business - IR325 factsheet. You can choose to make voluntary payments of tax during your first year of business to help spread the cost. If you make voluntary payments you may be able to get an early payment discount. Refer to ird.govt.nz/early-payment-discount for more information. New provisional taxpayers If you’re a “new provisional taxpayer”, you will not need to pay any provisional tax in your first year, but you may be charged interest. You can choose to pay provisional tax in your first year to reduce the interest charged. To find out if you’re a new provisional taxpayer, refer to our Provisional tax guide - IR289 guide. Working out your provisional tax There are 4 ways to work out your provisional tax - the accounting income method (AIM), estimation, ratio and standard options. The standard option is used if you do not choose one. The AIM option To use AIM you need to have an AIM-capable accounting package that will calculate your provisional tax payments (if any) for you using your accounting records. Your provisional tax payments are based on your taxable profits for the period. This should better align your payments with your cash flow. The estimation option To estimate your provisional tax, work out the tax on the income you expect to earn in the next tax year, and deduct any PAYE and other tax credits (except Working for Families) you’ll be entitled to. The result is your estimated RIT and provisional tax. Example Estimated expected income $70,000 Total tax on $70,000 $14,020 Less estimated tax credits $ 2,000 Provisional tax payable $12,020 You can tell us your estimate: • in your income tax account in myIR, • when you complete your income tax return for the previous year. Once you choose the estimation option, you cannot change to another option during the same tax year. You can re-estimate your provisional tax as often as you like, up to and including your final instalment date. At this date your last estimate becomes final. Remember, when making an estimate you’re required to take reasonable care. If you’re unsure about estimating provisional tax, contact your tax agent or accountant. The ratio option Your instalments are worked out by applying your ratio percentage to your GST taxable supplies in each 2-month period during the current year. The ratio percentage is calculated by dividing your RIT by your total GST taxable supplies for the previous year. The standard option Your provisional tax equals your previous year’s RIT plus 5%. For example, If your RIT was $10,130, your next year’s provisional tax will be $10,636 ($10,130 x 5% = $506. $10,130 + $506 = $10,636 – use whole dollars). If your income tax return is not yet due, and you haven’t filed on or before your first or second instalment date, your provisional tax will be based on your RIT from 2 years ago. If your RIT from 2 years ago was: • over $5,000, add 10% to the total • under $5,000, you do not have to pay provisional tax. Once you file your tax return for the previous year, your provisional tax will be recalculated based on that year’s RIT plus 5% less provisional payments made. The following table shows how you would do the calculation for provisional tax instalments (based on a standard 31 March balance date). if return filedInstalment 1 (P1)Instalment 2 (P2)Instalment 3 (P3) Due date 28 AugustDue Date 15 January Due Date 7 May On or before 28 AugustPrevious year’s RIT plus 5% ÷ by 3 = amount to pay for each instalment. After 28 August and on or before 15 January the next year (RIT 2 years ago + 10%) ÷ 3 = amount to pay (Previous year’s RIT + 5%) × 2 ÷ 3 less P1 = amount to pay (Previous year’s RIT + 5%) less (P1 + P2) = amount to pay After 15 January the next year but on or before 7 May (RIT 2 years ago + 10%) ÷ 3 = amount to pay (RIT 2 years ago + 10%) × 2 ÷ 3 less P1 = amount to pay (Previous year’s RIT + 5%) less (P1 + P2) = amount to pay Next year after 7 May(RIT 2 years ago + 10%) ÷ 3 = amount to pay (RIT 2 years ago + 10%) × 2 ÷ 3 less P1 = amount to pay Expected RIT from previous year + 5% less P1 + P2 If the RIT from 2 years ago was $5,000 or under, provisional tax will only need to be paid in 1 or 2 instalments, depending on when the tax return is filed. In this case, the provisional tax will be evenly split between the required number of instalments. Paying your provisional tax The number of instalments you’ll have is based on your GST registration and how often you file GST returns.
