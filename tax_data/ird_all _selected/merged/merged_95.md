5 Annual rates for 2020−21 7 ANNUAL SETTING OF INCOME TAX RATES (Clause 3) Summary of proposed amendment The Bill sets the annual income tax rates that would apply for the 2020–21 tax year. The annual rates to be confirmed are the same as for the 2019–20 tax year. Application date The proposed amendment would apply for the 2020–21 tax year. Key features The proposed annual income tax rates for the 2020–21 tax year would be set at the rates specified in schedule 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 9 Feasibility expenditure 10 FEASIBILITY EXPENDITURE (Clauses 11 and 16) Summary of proposed amendment Changes are proposed to codify when businesses can deduct expenditure related to completing, creating or acquiring unsuccessful and abandoned assets or business models. The proposed rules also introduce a new immediate deduction for expenditure that in total is $10,000 or less in an income year that is incurred in developing assets in a business context. Together, the changes are intended to set out the circumstances when expenditure related to business innovation and asset development can be deducted for property that, if completed, created or acquired, would be depreciable property or revenue account property. The rules complement the current tax depreciation rules in situations when property is not completed and abandoned. Application date The proposed amendment would apply to qualifying expenditure incurred in the 2020−21 and later income years. Key features Changes are proposed that affect the operation of the general deduction rules in sections DA 1 and DA 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Specifically, for certain items of expenditure proposed, new sections DB 66 and DB 67 override the limitation for expenditure of a capital nature. Proposed section DB 66 allows taxpayers to deduct expenditure incurred in completing, creating or acquiring property if: • that property: – would be depreciable property, including depreciable intangible property; – would be revenue account property; and • progress on the asset is abandoned with the outcome that the property is not completed, created or acquired; and • no other deduction for the expenditure is allowed under any other provision in the Act. The deduction does not apply to property that is depreciable at the rate of zero percent. Deductions meeting the conditions above can be spread in equal proportions over a five-year period from the income year in which progress on the property is abandoned (section DB 66(2)). 11 Proposed section DB 67 allows an immediate deduction in the income year for expenditure incurred in completing, creating or acquiring property if the total expenditure is $10,000 or less and: • the expenditure is related to depreciable property or revenue account property; and • no deduction for the expenditure is allowed under any other provision in the Act. The expenditure under both sections must be incurred in making progress towards completing, creating or acquiring the property. The amount of the available deduction is equal to the expenditure the taxpayer incurs related to making progress towards completing, creating, or acquiring property. For abandoned property that is later completed, new section CH 13 claws back the deductions allowed under section DB 66 by treating the amount deducted as income in the income year the property is completed, created, or acquired. The completed property is then subject to the tax depreciation rules in subpart EE, or deductible under section DB 23 of the Act. Background The proposed changes to the tax treatment of feasibility expenditure are part of tax measures the Government is implementing to support its economic strategy. The changes in the Bill: • respond to private sector concerns following the 2016 decision by the Supreme Court in Trustpower Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue, 1 which limited taxpayer expectations relating to deductibility of expenditure incurred on assets that are subsequently abandoned; and • ensure tax is not a barrier for businesses seeking to invest in new projects or assets, except when there is an explicit denial of deductions (for example, expenditure related to assets when the taxpayer is not expected to incur an economic loss, such as land and shares). As a general principle, the economic value of business expenditure that is expected to decline in value should be either immediately deductible or, when it provides an enduring benefit, deductible over time if that benefit declines over time. When the tax system does not provide for that treatment, an economic distortion is created. An example of this distortion arises with expenditure by taxpayers to determine the practicality of an investment or new proposal: “feasibility expenditure”. In some cases, the Act will deny taxpayers an immediate deduction for such expenditure when it has a connection with an asset that has the potential to yield future economic benefits beyond the current income year. If the asset is not completed, it is not recognised for tax depreciation purposes and is unable to be deducted for tax purposes, resulting in what is referred to as “black hole” expenditure. This creates an incentive for businesses to complete projects that, but for the tax effect, would otherwise be abandoned. 1 SC 74/2015 \[2016\] NZSC 91. 12 The non-deductibility of this expenditure effectively raises the cost of risky investments in new assets (where the chance of a viable outcome is uncertain) and therefore can act as a barrier to businesses committing resources to developing new assets, business models or processes – which are important to innovation and driving productivity improvements. The proposed amendments are intended to sit alongside the Act’s rules for tax depreciation and Inland Revenue’s interpretation statement IS 17/01 2 for businesses that regularly incur feasibility expenditure. The proposed amendments do not give tax deductions for expenditure related to assets that are not expected to decline in value. While assets that are not expected to decline in value sometimes do, it would only be appropriate to provide deductions for this expenditure if the tax system taxed gains in assets that appreciated. Under current policy settings it would not be correct to allow deductions for expenditure related to property that is not depreciable (or that result in expenditure that would not otherwise be deductible if the property is completed). The proposed amendments are not designed to alter the rules that exist for: • tax depreciation; • company administration costs; • research and development; • resource consents; • unsuccessful software projects; • patents; and • plant variety rights. The amendments also do not affect the application and effect on the general permission test relating to deductions. The proposed amendments in this Bill are the product of discussions with stakeholders following the release of the Government discussion document Black hole and feasibility expenditure, released May 2017, and further rounds of targeted consultation in October 2017 and November 2019. The Tax Working Group also made recommendations regarding reform to the tax treatment of feasibility expenditure and other non-deductible expenditure. The Bill seeks to implement those recommendations. 3 2 Interpretation statement IS17/01: Deductibility of feasibility expenditure. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 29, No 3 (April 2017) available at https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/tib/volume-29---2017/download-tib- vol29-no3 3 Future of Tax: Final Report Volume I – Recommendations, Thursday, 21 February 2019 https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz/resources/future-tax-final-report-vol-i -html#section-3 , recommendation 33 refers. 13 Detailed analysis Spread deduction rule for feasibility expenditure Proposed section DB 66 is directed at expenditure incurred by taxpayers in making progress towards completing, creating or acquiring property that is subsequently abandoned. The term property is defined by reference to property that if completed would be depreciable property, including certain types of intangible property, and/or revenue account property. A deduction is allowed for expenditure related to completing, creating or acquiring the abandoned property. Abandonment is when no further money is applied, or the taxpayer documents a decision to not proceed with the property, whichever happens first. The expenditure must satisfy the general permission requirements, in that the taxpayer must have an existing income-earning process and to which the expenditure must have sufficient nexus. The capital limitation, however, is overridden. The amount of the available deduction is equal to the expenditure the taxpayer has incurred in relation to the abandoned property, and is not otherwise deductible under any other provisions of the Act. The proposed amendment is designed to allow a broad concept of what expenditure can be deducted, including direct and indirect expenses. General overhead expenses that have an indirect relationship, or expenses that are later determined to have been connected with the abandoned property are expected to be within scope. The deduction for the expenditure is spread in equal proportions (one-fifth) over a five-year period, starting from the year of abandonment. Example 1: When the new sections apply – wind studies Company A, an electricity generator, is exploring the practicality of establishing a new wind farm. It incurs expenditure over a five-year period associated with measuring wind frequency and speeds (anemology) relevant to the local geography. Anemology expenditure connected with the project is booked against a work in progress account (an asset on Company A’s balance sheet for financial accounting purposes). At the end of year two, the studies regarding the site are inconclusive as to reliability of wind supply and the project is mothballed. Tax impact Under current law, the anemology expenditure incurred in developing an asset does not give rise to an immediate deduction under the Act. As the asset is not completed, there is no tax asset to depreciate. Under new section DB 66, the collective anemology expenditure would, had the project gone ahead, have formed part of a depreciable asset (wind turbine generators). The expenditure will be deductible in equal parts over five years. 14 Example 2: When the new sections apply – nanotechnology study Company B, a water management company, is working on ways to meet demand in times of low-aquifer inflows and drought, to prevent water restrictions. It is exploring the viability of desalination. The company carries out a number of studies on the practicality of building and operating a desalination plant, and researches how water from the plant could be connected to the wider network. Work on the project is abandoned after an assessment determines it is uneconomic, in terms of energy needs and water output, for the plant to meet forecast demand. The project is shelved pending future advances in desalination nanotechnology. Tax impact Under current law, the expenditure incurred in studying the practicality of desalination would be included as part of an asset and does not give rise to an immediate deduction under the Act. As the asset is not completed, there is no tax asset to depreciate. Under new section DB 66, the collective desalination study expenditure would, had the project gone ahead, have formed part of a depreciable asset (water treatment plant and reservoir). The expenditure will be deductible in equal parts over five years. Example 3: When the new rules will not apply – design property rights Company C, an aeronautics company, has plans to redesign the cockpit and airframe canopy for a model of small single propeller aircraft. The redesign is intended to improve flight performance and pilot visibility for such purposes as aerial crop dusting. The company incurs expenditure in costing the project and scoping initial airframe designs. The multi-year project is shelved in year two when a competing overseas company brings a comparable (and cheaper) improved aircraft to the market. Tax impact Under current law, the design expenditure is incurred in developing depreciable intangible property. The designs are subject to tax depreciation and therefore cannot be deducted under new section DB 66. Example 4: When the new rules will not apply – acquisition of shares Company D is seeking to diversify the range of products it provides to commercial clients. It is considering options to either directly acquire the products or acquire the shares in another firm that is offering comparable products. Company D decides to acquire the shares in the firm as it is keen to retain the firm’s existing staff, management and the client list the firm has built up. Tax impact Expenditure connected with Company D acquiring the firm are not deductible under new section DB 66 as they relate to the acquisition of shares (which are not depreciable property). If Company D had decided to acquire the products directly but abandoned the idea after working though the implications of distribution and product support, the expenditure attributable to that work would be deductible under DB 66 as the expenditure has a relationship with the acquisition of revenue account property. Example 5: When the deduction starts The finance team at Company E is considering the expenditure debited in its work in progress account after balance date for the year 20X1. They decide that a study directed at improving the energy efficiency of the company’s plant won’t proceed due to cash flow constraints. The abandoned work related to a potential refit of the company’s premises for lighting and heating. No further amounts had been spent on the project after balance date and the decision is made in 20X2 that the project has been abandoned for financial reporting purposes. Tax impact The expenditure would be deductible under new section DB 66 given its relationship with depreciable property. A deduction of one-fifth of the expenditure can be made in the 20X1 tax return. 15 Immediate deduction for feasibility expenditure Proposed section DB 67 works in a similar way to DB 66, with modifications to reflect that DB 67 is a compliance cost saving measure. That is, feasibility expenditure can be immediately deducted by the taxpayer if the total expenditure incurred is $10,000 or less in an income year. There is no requirement that the property be abandoned. However, like the requirements of section DB 66, the expenditure must satisfy the general permission provisions and not be deductible elsewhere under the Act. Section DB 67 is not a replacement for tax depreciation for low-value assets. Example 6: When the deduction can be claimed immediately – revenue account property Retailer F specialises in selling cake decoration supplies, cupcakes and other baked goods, and is considering adding takeaway coffee and other hot drinks. It incurs expenditure in doing a cost-benefit analysis and a survey of foot traffic and customer opinion. During the study a coffee shop opens two doors down and the project finishes. About $1,700 was committed to the analysis. Tax impact Under Inland Revenue’s Interpretation statement 17/01, the retailer would not be able to deduct the expenditure as it is not recurrent. Under new section DB 67, as the expenditure is connected with selling revenue account property (trading stock) and a coffee machine (depreciable) and other consumables, it would be deductible. As the expenditure is under $10,000 it would be immediately deductible. Example 7: When the deduction cannot be immediately claimed – depreciable property Retailer G incurs expenditure in acquiring a secondhand vehicle to assist with deliveries. The vehicle and associated expenditure totals $8,000. Tax impact The cost of the vehicle is not immediately deductible under section DB 67 as the cost of the vehicle is subject to the tax depreciation rules. Clawback of abandoned expenditure deductions As an integrity measure, amounts deducted for abandoned property that is later completed, created or acquired are treated as income in the year in which that happens. Under proposed section CH 13, the income equals the direct costs for that property. The requirement to return as income amounts previously deducted does not apply to expenditure that has been immediately deducted under the $10,000 de minimis rule. This deduction clawback rule is directed at situations where taxpayers may be incentivised to prematurely abandon work on property. For example, property may be partially abandoned to take advantage of the five-year deduction if this would accelerate the deductions that would have been allowed had the property been completed and depreciated. Example 8: Previous deduction clawed back – example 2 continued A decade after Company B’s decision not to proceed with a desalination plant, population growth in the region and the need for greater water infrastructure has led Company B to restart its earlier work on nanotechnology. Development of the plant and reservoir begins and seven years later it is operational and connected to the wider water supply network. In the year in which the depreciable property is operational, the deduction claimed 17 years earlier is returned as income, with the expenditure included in the cost of the depreciable property. 16 Example 9: Previous deduction not clawed back – example 5 continued Company E’s financial situation improves, and it refits the lighting and heating in its premises three years after the initial study using an alternative model. The earlier deduction taken for the previous study is not clawed back as those expenses do not have a direct connection with the final fitout as it did not use any of the earlier work to complete the fitout. 17 Land 19 HABITUAL BUYING AND SELLING OF LAND (Clauses 5, 6 and 7) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendments expand the regular pattern restrictions in the main home exclusion, the residential exclusion and the business premises exclusion to apply to regular patterns of buying and selling land by a group of persons acting together. The amendments will ensure that taxpayers cannot structure around the regular pattern restrictions by using different people or entities to carry out separate transactions, or by varying what is done to the land in each transaction so that there is no “pattern”. The proposed amendments also clarify that the regular pattern restrictions in the residential and business premises exclusions will only apply when the land was acquired with a purpose or intention of disposal. Application date The proposed amendments would apply to land acquired after the date of enactment. However, land acquired before the application date would be able to be considered for the purposes of determining whether a group of persons have a regular pattern. Key features The proposed amendments will: • expand the regular pattern restrictions in the main home, residential and business premises exclusion so they apply to a group of persons undertaking buying and selling activities together, rather than the activities of a single person; • expand the regular pattern restrictions in the residential and business premises exclusions so they apply to a regular of pattern of buying and selling land, focusing on the regularity of the transactions rather than what is done on the land while it is held; and • clarify that the regular pattern restrictions in the residential and business premises exclusions apply only when the land was acquired with a purpose or intention of disposal. Background The land sales rules in subpart CB of the Income Tax Act 2007 contain various exclusions for land used as a main home, residence or business premises. If one of these exclusions applies, an amount that would otherwise be subject to tax under one of the land sales rules, will not be taxable. For example, an amount derived by a land dealer from selling land is usually subject to tax, but will not be taxable if the land dealer used the land as their residence while they owned it. 20 However, the following exclusions do not apply when there has been a regular pattern of buying and selling land used for such purposes: • main home exclusion in section CB 16A (which applies for the bright-line test in section CB 6A); • residential exclusion in section CB 16 (which applies for some of the other land sales provisions); and • business premises exclusion in section CB 19. The restrictions assume that a person who has a regular pattern of buying and selling land primarily acquires that land for sale and should be taxed on any gain, whether or not they used the land as their residence or business premises while they owned it. There are concerns that the current regular pattern restrictions allow taxpayers who habitually buy and sell land to structure around the rules. This can be done by using different people or entities to carry out separate transactions, or by varying each transaction so that there is no “pattern”. This undermines the integrity of the tax system by allowing people to take advantage of the exclusions in circumstances when this was not intended. Detailed analysis Group of people acting together All of the current regular pattern restrictions apply quite narrowly to the activities of a single person. This allows taxpayers to circumvent the application of the regular pattern restrictions by buying and selling land using different people and entities each time (for example, the first property is purchased by the person, the second is purchased by their partner, the third by their family trust, and so on). The proposed amendments will expand all of the regular pattern restrictions so they apply to a group of persons undertaking buying and selling activities together. For the main home and residential exclusions, a group of persons will be treated as undertaking buying and selling activities together when: • all the people occupy all of the properties together as their residence; and • where a property is owned by a trustee or other entity, at least one of the people who occupy all the properties has significant involvement in, or control of, the trust or other entity. Example 10 illustrates a regular pattern involving a group of persons for the main home or residential exclusions. 21 Example 10: Residential and main home exclusions Mr and Mrs A occupy the following properties as their homes Acquired: Jan 2026 Sold: Jan 2028 Owned by: Trust B (trustees = Mr A and independent trustee) Acquired: Jan 2020 Sold: Jan 2022 Owned by: Mr A Acquired: Jan 2024 Sold: Jan 2026 Owned by: Trust A (trustees = Mrs A and independent trustee) Acquired: Jan 2022 Sold: Jan 2024 Owned by: Mrs A Mr and Mrs A occupy all of the properties together as their residence. As a trustee of Trust A, Mrs A has significant involvement in, or control of, Trust A. As a trustee of Trust B, Mr A has significant involvement in, or control of, Trust B. Because Mr and Mrs A occupy all of the properties and have significant involvement in, or control of, the trusts that own two of the properties, Mr and Mrs A, Trust A and Trust B will be treated as a group of persons who undertake buying and selling activities together. Because those buying and selling activities form a regular pattern (as the properties are bought and sold at regular intervals), they will be subject to the regular pattern restriction (assuming all the properties were acquired with an intention of resale (see below)). For the residential and main home exclusions the most important factor is that all the people in the group occupy all the properties. In example 10, if Mr and Mrs A’s daughter and son- in-law, Mr and Mrs B, lived with them in the second property for a year and then moved into their own home, Mr and Mrs B’s separate home would not form part of the pattern when it is sold because Mr and Mrs A did not occupy that property, and Mr and Mrs B did not occupy all of the other properties. For the business premises exclusion, a group of persons will be treated as undertaking buying and selling activities together where: • all persons in the group occupy premises mainly to carry on a substantial business, irrespective of the nature of any business carried on; and • a person, whether or not they also occupy land as a business premises, has significant involvement in, or control of, the activities of all those in the group. Example 11 illustrates a regular pattern involving a group of persons for the business premises exclusion. 22 Example 11: Business premises exclusion Persons in control of all companies Sold: Jan 2028 Owned by: Company D Sold: Jan 2022 Owned by: Company A Sold: Jan 2026 Owned by: Company C Sold: Jan 2024 Owned by: Company B Companies A, B, C and D all occupy their land as business premises mainly to carry on a substantial business. (It does not matter whether the businesses are related.) The same persons have significant involvement in, or control of, the activities of all of the companies (for example, all the companies have the same shareholders). Therefore, companies A, B, C and D form a group of persons who are treated as undertaking buying and selling activities together. Because those buying and selling activities form a regular pattern (the properties are sold at regular intervals), they will be subject to the regular pattern restriction (assuming all the properties were acquired with an intention of resale (see below)). The terms “significant involvement” and “control” are used in other parts of the Act. In this context these terms indicate that the relevant person is able to direct, alone or as part of a group, the relevant trust or entity’s decision-making process. Regular pattern of buying and selling For the residential exclusion the regular pattern restriction currently applies when a person has engaged in a regular pattern of acquiring and disposing of, or erecting and disposing of, dwellinghouses occupied mainly as a residence by the person. For the business premises exclusion the regular pattern restriction currently applies when a person has engaged in a regular pattern of acquiring and disposing of, or erecting and disposing of, premises used by the person for a substantial business. In contrast, the regular pattern restriction for the main home exclusion applies when the person has engaged in a regular pattern of acquiring and disposing of residential land used as their main home. Because of the language used in the residential exclusion and the business premises exclusion, the regular pattern restrictions in those provisions have been interpreted very narrowly to apply only when there is a similarity or likeness between the transactions (for example, a pattern of buying land, building a home on the land and then selling). This means that the regular pattern restrictions do not apply if a person has a pattern of buying and selling land that they occupy as a residence or business premises and they carry out different activities on the land while they hold it. For example, the restriction would not currently apply where the first property is bought, lived in and sold, the second is renovated while it is lived in and sold, or the third is a bare section where a house is built and occupied then sold. This problem does not appear to arise from the more general wording used in the main home exclusion. 23 The proposed amendments will expand the regular pattern restrictions in the residential and business premises exclusions to align them with the main home exclusion. This will ensure they apply to any regular pattern of buying and selling land used as a residence or business premises, with a focus on the regularity of the transactions rather than on what is done on the land while it is held. Purpose or intention Expanding the regular pattern restrictions gives rise to an increased risk that they could catch ordinary residential transactions that occur for family reasons, and small businesses that are upgrading premises as the business grows. In particular, this risk arises for people who are associated with a person in a business involving land (such as a dealer, developer or divider, or builder). This is because they are, prima facie, subject to tax on all sales of land within ten years of acquisition, whether or not the land is used in a business or other income-earning scheme. Such people are entitled to rely on the exclusions to ensure their genuine homes and business premises are not taxed on sale. Therefore, the proposed amendments clarify that the regular pattern restrictions in the residential and business premises exclusions apply only when the land was acquired with a purpose or intention of disposal. This ensures that the restrictions are better targeted at people who regularly buy and sell land on a speculative basis. 24 COST OF REVENUE ACCOUNT PROPERTY (Clause 14) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment clarifies that the cost of revenue account property is deductible even if it was not known when the costs were incurred that the property would be subject to tax on sale, or if the property was used privately while it was held. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from 1 April 2008, being the commencement date of the Income Tax Act 2007. Key features The proposed amendment clarifies that section DB 23, which allows a deduction for the cost of revenue account property, supplements the general permission and overrides the private limitation. Background In most cases, there has to be sufficient connection between expenditure and income, or between expenditure and a business carried on for the purpose of deriving income before expenditure can be deducted. This is known as the general permission (section DA 1). Whether the general permission has been satisfied is judged at the time the expenditure is incurred. Section DB 23, which allows a deduction for the cost of revenue account property, is currently subject to the general permission. However, in some situations involving land subject to the land sale rules there may not be the required connection between expenditure on acquiring or improving the land and income. This is because, at the time the expenditure is incurred, it may not be known whether the disposal of the land will be taxed. This may be the case for land that is taxed if sold within a particular timeframe (for example, land sold within five years for the bright-line test), or if certain circumstances eventuate during the time the land is held (for example, if a division or development is carried on). In addition, section DB 23 is currently subject to the private limitation. This means that technically, where there is private use of land that is subject to tax on sale, part of the costs of acquisition and improvements should also be denied to take into account the private benefit received. It was clearly intended that the cost of acquiring and improving land that is taxed under any of the land sale rules would be fully deductible to ensure that only the net proceeds are income (or a loss). That is how the provisions operated before the rewrite of the Act, under the “profits or gains” approach. However, it seems that the splitting out of income and deductions into separate provisions may have inadvertently created some uncertainty in respect of land taxed under some of the land sales provisions. 25 CONTENT OF THE LAND TRANSFER TAX STATEMENT (Clauses 95 to 100) Summary of proposed amendment The Bill proposes changes to the Land Transfer Act 2017 to move the content of the Land transfer tax statement (LTTS) to regulations. This change will make it easier to amend the LTTS in the future, for example to make changes that would reduce compliance costs for property transfers. All references are to the Land Transfer Act 2017 unless otherwise stated. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from the date of enactment. The current requirements in section 79 of the Act will apply until the first regulations which prescribe the content for the LTTS come into force. Key features The amendments propose that the content of the LTTS will be set by regulation. This will enable the content of the LTTS to be updated more easily and enable streamlining of property transfer information requirements. The framework around the LTTS, for example, the rules around disclosure and use of information, are unchanged and remain in the Act. Background From 1 October 2015, sellers and purchasers of land have been required to complete an LTTS at the time of transfer. The LTTS collects information used for assessing compliance with tax obligations. It also gathers statistics for use in housing policy. People buying and selling property may also have to complete: • a residential land withholding tax declaration, for sellers of property sold within the bright-line period; and • a residential land statement, for buyers of residential land acquired after 22 October 2018. The content of the LTTS is currently largely prescribed by the Act. Making any changes to the information required on the form currently requires an amendment to the Act. Detailed analysis Amendments are proposed to section 77 to refer to tax information as that which is specified in a tax statement under the Act. 26 Section 79 is replaced with proposed new section 79 which requires that the tax statement must contain the prescribed information. Section 227(1)(3) provides that the Governor General may make regulations prescribing information to be contained in, and documents that must accompany, any instrument, application, notice, certificate, record, or any other thing for the purposes of the Act. A clarification is proposed to section 227 for the avoidance of doubt, to insert a reference to “statement” to make it clear that regulations can be made to prescribe information requirements for the LTTS. Amendments are also proposed to section 83 to update the references to the types of information which may be released under this section. The purpose of this section is to continue the current rules regarding disclosure of information in aggregate form. This is achieved by including a definition of identifying information and allowing future regulations to deem any further information as identifying information. Transitional provisions are proposed to specify that the current LTTS requirements apply until the new regulations are made. 27 Purchase price allocation 29 PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION (Clause 40) Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments tighten the rules that govern how parties to a sale of two or more assets with different tax treatments (a “mixed supply”) allocate the total price between the assets, for income tax purposes. The amendments do not affect existing law relating to the determination of the price when the purchaser assumes any vendor liabilities. The objective of the amendments is to prevent an overall revenue loss when vendors and purchasers adopt different price allocations that minimise their own tax liabilities. Application date The proposed amendments would apply to agreements for the disposal and acquisition of property entered into on or after 1 April 2021. Key features The core elements of the proposal are: • If the parties agree an allocation, they must follow it in their tax returns. • If the parties do not agree an allocation, the vendor is entitled to determine the allocation, and must notify both the purchaser and the Commissioner of it within two months of the change in ownership of the assets. However, the vendor must allocate amounts to taxable property (depreciable property, revenue account property, financial arrangements) such that there is no additional loss on the sale of that property. • If the vendor does not make an allocation within the two-month timeframe, the purchaser is entitled to determine the allocation, and notify both the vendor and the Commissioner of it. • The Commissioner may challenge an allocation if she considers it does not reflect market values. • The purchase price allocation rules will not apply to a transaction if the total purchase price is less than $1 million, or the purchaser’s total allocation to taxable property is less than $100,000. Background When a bundle of assets is sold, and not all the assets have the same tax treatment for a party, that party must allocate the total transaction price between the various assets for tax purposes. The allocation determines the vendor’s tax liability from the sale, and the purchaser’s cost base for claiming deductions over time. Under the current law, the parties are generally required to ascribe market values to the assets. However, market value is a range, and other than for trading stock there is no requirement for the vendor and purchaser to use the same market value. This means that the 30 two parties can adopt different allocations which minimise their own respective tax liabilities and are therefore detrimental to the government’s revenue base overall. Such discrepancies have been identified in a number of large commercial property transactions and sales of going concern businesses, with the total revenue loss sometimes being in the millions of dollars. The proposed amendments are designed to improve the integrity of the income tax rules by requiring consistency between the parties’ allocations, and to reinforce the existing requirement that the allocation be based on relative market values. Detailed analysis The purchase price allocation reforms are proposed to be implemented by two new sections in subpart GC of the Income Tax Act 2007. Proposed section GC 20 applies when the vendor and purchaser (person A and person B) in a mixed supply have agreed an allocation to the property before filing their respective returns of income in relation to the transaction. The parties must file in accordance with the agreed allocation. There is no de minimis for this requirement, because a threshold would undermine the expectation that parties who have agreed an allocation should always adhere to that agreement. Proposed section GC 21 applies when the vendor and purchaser have not agreed an allocation to the property before filing their returns of income in relation to the transaction. The objective of the section is to ensure that a single allocation is made, and that the allocation is followed by both parties when they file their tax returns. The vendor is required, within two months after the change in ownership of the property, to determine the allocation, and must notify both the purchaser and the Commissioner of its allocation. Both the vendor and the purchaser must then file on the basis of that allocation. In making the allocation, the vendor is subject to one constraint that over-rides the market value requirement: it must allocate amounts to taxable property such that there is no additional loss on the sale of that property. The vendor cannot, therefore, allocate to an item of depreciable property an amount that is less than its adjusted tax value (adjusted for a pro rata portion of the depreciation in the year of sale). This constraint is included to protect the purchaser from an unreasonably low allocation that might not be challenged by the Commissioner. It is possible that in some cases, despite the obligation on it to do so, the vendor will not make an allocation. For example, it may be in liquidation and decide that making an allocation is not necessary for practical reasons. If the vendor fails to make an allocation within the two-month timeframe, the obligation to determine the allocation is transferred to the purchaser. The purchaser must notify both the vendor and the Commissioner of its allocation. Both the purchaser and the vendor must then file on the basis of that allocation. There is no constraint on the purchaser’s allocation other than the requirement for relative market values to be used. Whether the allocation is agreed between the parties or made unilaterally by the vendor or the purchaser under section GC 21, the Commissioner has the power to require the parties to adopt a different allocation if she considers the allocation does not reflect relative market value. 31 It is not intended that parties have to allocate an amount to every individual item. It will be sufficient for the allocation to be made at the level of asset categories subject to particular income or deduction rules – for example, depreciable property, buildings, revenue account property, financial arrangements, land, and so on. This eliminates most of the scope for tax manipulation without imposing unrealistic compliance costs. Of course, more detailed allocations are also acceptable. De minimis thresholds apply to the consistency rules outlined above. These thresholds are included so that parties to small transactions, in which the scope for tax manipulation is small, do not have to bear any extra compliance costs that might arise from being required to notify an allocation, or follow one notified by the other party. These de minimises only apply where the parties have not agreed an allocation; if the parties have agreed an allocation, they must file their returns on the basis of it, regardless of the transaction size. The thresholds are a total sale/purchase price of $1 million and an allocation by the purchaser to taxable property of $100,000. If the transaction falls below either of the two thresholds, the proposed consistency requirements will not apply to the parties. Because the second threshold depends on the purchaser’s allocation, the vendor may require an undertaking from the purchaser before relying on it. There is one other de minimis threshold, which applies to the Commissioner’s ability to replace an agreed or vendor’s allocation with a market value allocation. The Commissioner cannot challenge an allocation to an item of depreciable property if: • the original cost of the property to the vendor is less than $10,000; • the allocation to the property is no less than its adjusted tax value and no greater than its original cost; and • where there are multiple identical assets each with an original cost of less than $10,000, the total amount allocated to those assets is less than $1 million. This de minimis is included to provide additional certainty to vendors that are adopting a simple method of ascribing values to low-value depreciable assets. In the unlikely event that neither party makes an allocation, the vendor is treated as disposing of the property for its relative market value, and the purchaser is treated as acquiring the property for nil consideration. The effect of this is that the purchaser is unable to claim depreciation or other deductions in relation to the property until it has made an allocation, so it has an incentive to do so before it files its tax return. There is a specific rule, which applies to both the vendor and purchaser, for allocations to agricultural, aquacultural and forestry improvements that are amortisable under sections DO 4, DO 12 and DP 3 respectively. In line with the existing law, the amount that must be allocated to these improvements is the diminished value amount under the relevant section. The vendor is obliged to provide this figure to the purchaser. If the diminished value cannot be determined, the purchaser is treated as acquiring the improvement for nil consideration, and therefore cannot claim deductions for it going forward. Section EB 24, which requires the purchaser to use the vendor’s allocation for trading stock, will be redundant once the proposed purchase price allocation rules are implemented, and is therefore being repealed. 33 Other policy items 35 GST ON OUTBOUND MOBILE ROAMING SERVICES (Clauses 86, 87, 89 and 91) Summary of proposed amendment These amendments would result in outbound mobile roaming services used by a person with a New Zealand mobile device while they are outside New Zealand becoming subject to GST at the standard rate of 15%. Currently, outbound mobile roaming services are either zero- rated (subject to GST at the rate of 0%) or not subject to GST. These amendments would also ensure that inbound mobile roaming services used by a non- resident in New Zealand would be zero-rated or not subject to GST. Currently, inbound mobile roaming services may be subject to GST at the standard rate of 15% but are generally not subject to GST. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from 1 April 2022. Key features The amendment would add a definition to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 for mobile roaming services. These would be mobile telecommunications services supplied to a person’s mobile device while they are outside the country of their usual mobile network. The country of a person’s usual mobile network would be determined by the country code of the subscriber identity module (SIM) used in their mobile device. Outbound mobile roaming services would mean mobile roaming services used by a person whole usual mobile network is in New Zealand. The amendments would result in these services becoming subject to GST at the standard rate of 15%. Inbound mobile roaming services would refer to mobile roaming services used by a person who is in New Zealand and whose usual mobile network is outside New Zealand. The amendments would result in inbound mobile roaming services supplied to non-residents being zero-rated if supplied by a resident, or treated as being made outside New Zealand (and therefore not subject to GST) if supplied by a non-resident. Background In 2003 special GST rules for cross-border supplies of telecommunications services were introduced to address concerns around how the GST rules at that time applied to these services, such as mobile roaming services. These special rules use the location of the person who initiates the supply from a telecommunications supplier as a proxy for determining the place of consumption of these services. Under the current rules for telecommunications services, outbound mobile roaming services used by a New Zealand resident travelling overseas are either zero-rated or not subject to GST. Conversely, inbound mobile roaming services used by non-residents travelling in New 36 Zealand may be subject to GST at the standard rate of 15%. However, a special registration rule for non-resident telecommunications suppliers means inbound mobile roaming services are generally not subject to GST. 4 This non-application of GST to both outbound and inbound mobile roaming services is contrary to New Zealand’s broad-based GST framework. Since the rules for telecommunications services were introduced, the OECD has developed the International VAT/GST Guidelines, which provide proxies for determining the place of consumption of cross-border services and intangibles. For “on-the-spot” services, where the supplier and the consumer need to be in the same place (for example, a haircut), the Guidelines suggest a place of performance test for determining the place of consumption. For remote services and intangibles, where it is not necessary for the supplier and the consumer to be in the same place (for example, a digital download), the Guidelines suggest the consumer’s usual place of residence as the test for determining the place of consumption. The Guidelines adopt a broad definition of what is a remote service, including supplies of telecommunications services. In light of the Guidelines, the European Union and the United Kingdom both now apply VAT to outbound mobile roaming services used by their residents while overseas. Detailed analysis Definition of mobile roaming services The amendments would add a definition to the GST Act for mobile roaming services. These would be mobile telecommunications services supplied to a person’s mobile device while they are outside the country of their usual mobile network. The country of a person’s usual mobile network would be determined by the country code of the subscriber identity module (SIM) used in their mobile device. Paragraph (c)(ii) of the definition would define outbound mobile roaming services as roaming services received by a person whose usual mobile network is in New Zealand. Example 12: Outbound mobile roaming service Kelvin-Kyle is a New Zealand resident visiting his friend Raymond in the town of Stewart, Minnesota. While there he uses his mobile phone for calls, texts and data. Kelvin-Kyle’s SIM has a New Zealand country code, which means that while he’s overseas he is using outbound mobile roaming services. Paragraph (c)(i) of the definition would define inbound mobile roaming services as services received by a person who is in New Zealand and whose usual mobile network is outside New Zealand. 4 See section 51(1)(e). 37 Example 13: Inbound mobile roaming service Graeme is a Scottish resident visiting New Zealand. While in New Zealand he uses his mobile phone to make calls. His SIM has a British country code, which means that while he is in New Zealand he is using inbound mobile roaming services. The definition of mobile roaming services would also include services supplied to enable a person to receive mobile telecommunications services when they are outside the country of their usual mobile network. This is intended to capture roaming deals offered by telecommunications suppliers that enable their customers to continue using their regular mobile plan while overseas for a flat daily or weekly fee. Example 14: Services to enable mobile roaming Kiwiphone is a New Zealand telecommunications supplier that allows its customers to continue using their regular mobile plan while travelling overseas for a fee of $5 per day. This service is an outbound mobile roaming service as it enables Kiwiphone’s customers to receive mobile telecommunications services while outside New Zealand. If a person travelling overseas uses a local SIM in their mobile device, they would not be using mobile roaming services. This is because their usual mobile network would be determined by the country code of the SIM – which in this case would be the country they are travelling in. Example 15: Local SIM Emmett is an Australian resident on holiday in New Zealand and he purchases a New Zealand SIM card to use in his mobile device. Because the country code of the SIM is New Zealand, that is considered to be the country of his usual mobile network. So Emmett is not using mobile roaming services. Outbound mobile roaming services Currently, outbound mobile roaming services are zero-rated if supplied by a resident, and treated as being made outside New Zealand (and therefore not subject to GST) if supplied by a non-resident. The amendments would result in outbound mobile roaming services becoming subject to GST at the standard rate of 15%. This would be achieved by: • new section 11AB(2) preventing the zero-rating provision in paragraph (1)(b) from applying to outbound mobile roaming services; and • new section 8(8B) treating supplies by non-residents of outbound mobile roaming services as being made in New Zealand. Inbound mobile roaming services Currently, inbound mobile roaming services are subject to GST at 15%. The amendments would result in inbound mobile roaming services supplied to non-residents becoming zero- rated if supplied by a resident, and treated as being made outside New Zealand if supplied by a non-resident. This would be achieved by: • new section 11AB(1)(c) adding a zero-rating provision for inbound mobile roaming services supplied to non-residents; and 38 • amending section 8(7) by moving the existing subsection to new paragraph (a) and adding paragraph (b) to treat inbound mobile roaming services supplied to non- residents by a non-resident as being made outside New Zealand (and therefore not subject to GST). Section 51(1)(e) would also be repealed by the amendments. This paragraph ensured that non-residents whose only supplies in New Zealand were inbound mobile roaming services were not required to register for GST. The amendments would make this paragraph unnecessary as inbound mobile roaming services supplied by a non-resident to non-residents travelling in New Zealand would no longer be treated as being made in New Zealand. 39 INCOME TAX TREATMENT OF LEASES SUBJECT TO NZ IFRS 16 (Clauses 8, 15, 22, 23, 26, 58 (lease (10), NZ IAS 17 (11), NZ IFRS 16 (12))) Summary of proposed amendment The Bill proposes changes to allow taxpayers with certain leases accounted for under New Zealand Equivalent to International Financial Reporting Standard 16 Leases (NZ IFRS 16) to choose to more closely follow their accounting treatment for tax purposes. The proposed tax changes result from the replacement of the previous accounting standard for leases, New Zealand Equivalent to International Accounting Standard 17 Leases (NZ IAS 17), with NZ IFRS 16, which applies to income years starting on or after 1 January 2019. Application date The proposed amendment would apply for balance dates starting on or after 1 January 2019, to align with the application date of NZ IFRS 16. Key features The Bill proposes to allow lessees who use NZ IFRS 16 a one-off choice to more closely follow their accounting treatment for tax. For the purpose of this commentary making this choice is referred to as “applying NZ IFRS 16 for tax” and the date it is done is called the “tax transition date”. Income and expenditure arising from a lease would be calculated under proposed new section EJ 10B, which will apply only if the taxpayer elects to apply NZ IFRS 16 for tax under proposed section EJ 10B(1)(d). Expenditure would be deductible under proposed section DB 51C and income would be assessable under proposed section CC 14. Most amounts calculated under section EJ 10B are expected to be expenditure, but income can arise in some circumstances, such as when an impairment adjustment from a previous year is reversed through profit and loss for accounting purposes. NZ IFRS 16 is proposed to apply for tax purposes for all operating leases of personal property that meet the proposed criteria to be an IFRS lease in section EJ 10B(1), which are that: • the person applies NZ IFRS 16 for accounting and has chosen to apply NZ IFRS 16 for tax; • the lessor and lessee are not associated; and • the asset is not subleased to another person. NZ IFRS 16 spreads certain lease expenditure, including provisions, in a way that results in the timing of recognition of this expenditure for accounting purposes being significantly different to when it would be incurred for tax purposes. Proposed section EJ 10B(2) to (4) requires adjustments to ensure this expenditure is deductible for tax at a similar time to when it would be deductible for a taxpayer not applying NZ IFRS 16 for tax. 40 When an IFRS lease ends, either because the lease itself ends or because it no longer qualifies to be an IFRS lease, proposed section EJ 10B(5) and (6) requires a wash-up to ensure that total deductions over the term of the lease match those that would have been deductible for a taxpayer not applying NZ IFRS 16 for tax. Proposed section EJ 10B(7) and (8) includes transitional adjustments for certain leases when NZ IFRS 16 applies for tax after the original start of the lease. This can arise in the year a taxpayer first chooses to apply NZ IFRS 16 for tax, or in a later year for an individual lease that did not meet the IFRS lease requirements but subsequently does. Background Under a lease, one person (the lessor) who owns (or otherwise holds) an asset provides it to another person (the lessee) to use in exchange for payment over the term of the lease. For entities with NZ IFRS reporting obligations, the accounting treatment was previously determined under NZ IAS 17. This standard has been replaced by NZ IFRS 16 for years starting on or after 1 January 2019. It was also possible to apply the standard before this and officials are aware that some taxpayers did so. Under NZ IAS 17, there was a difference in the accounting treatment for operating and finance leases for both lessors and lessees. NZ IAS 17 defined the distinction as: A lease is classified as a finance lease if it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership. A lease is classified as an operating lease if it does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership. For lessees, NZ IFRS 16 removes the distinction between operating and finance leases for accounting purposes. Under NZ IFRS 16, lessees are required to include all leases on their balance sheet by recognising both an asset, being the right to use the leased asset for the lease term, and a lease liability, representing the obligation to pay rentals. NZ IFRS 16 also changes the timing of accounting expenditure for lessees compared to the previous treatment, but total deductions are unchanged over the life of the lease. This can be shown in the simplified example in table 1 for a five-year lease, that was an operating lease under NZ IAS 17, with $100,000 per year of lease payments and a 3.7237% 5 discount rate. 5 This interest rate has been chosen as a representative rate as it was the NZ dollar five-year BBB+ rate on a particular day when officials were considering this project. This rate is used in all NZ IFRS 16 examples in this commentary. The actual interest rate is determined for each individual lease, based on its specific terms and features, following the requirements set by IFRS 16. 41 Table 1: Simplified example for a five-year lease Year NZIAS 17 expenses IFRS 16 expenses 1 $100,000 $106,439 2 $100,000 $103,337 3 $100,000 $100,120 4 $100,000 $96,783 5 $100,000 $93,322 Total $500,000 $500,000 NZ IFRS 16 does not significantly change the accounting treatment of leases for the lessor. The lessor will continue to show the leased asset on their balance sheet for operating leases. The Bill does not propose any changes for the tax treatment of lessors. Nor does it propose any changes for the tax treatment of leases for taxpayers that do not have NZ IFRS reporting obligations. The Income Tax Act 2007 requires a different tax treatment for operating and finance leases. The tax definitions of operating and finance leases are similar but not identical to the accounting definitions. The Bill does not propose to change these tax definitions. Detailed analysis Updates to the tax definition of finance leases and operating leases The definition of finance lease in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 refers to NZ IAS 17. The Bill proposes to update the definition to refer to NZ IFRS 16. No changes are proposed to the existing distinction between finance leases and operating leases for tax purposes. Finance leases and the yield to maturity method Section EW 15I allows a person who has a tax finance lease that is classified as an operating lease under NZ IAS 17 to apply the yield to maturity method. NZ IFRS 16 has removed the accounting distinction between operating and finance leases for lessees. However, the yield to maturity method will continue to be available for these leases by applying section EW 15E. The Bill proposes updating section EW 15I to refer to NZ IFRS 16 rather than NZ IAS 17, as a lessor applying NZ IFRS 16 may still have a tax finance lease that is classified as an operating lease for accounting. Lessors under tax operating leases for NZ IFRS taxpayers No changes are proposed to the tax treatment of lessors. 42 Lessees under tax operating leases for NZ IFRS taxpayers The changes proposed in the Bill are optional. NZ IFRS taxpayers who choose not to apply NZ IFRS 16 for tax will be able to continue to follow their existing treatment. Optional election The Bill proposes that a taxpayer that applies NZ IFRS 16 for accounting can make a one- off choice in section EJ 10B(1)(d) to apply NZ IFRS 16 for tax. The Bill proposes that the election would be made by calculating deductions under the proposed rules in the income tax return for the income year the choice is made. No separate election would be required. Once a taxpayer makes this choice they would use this method for all future years that they apply NZ IFRS 16 for accounting purposes. This election is proposed to be available in any income year, so a taxpayer can choose to first apply NZ IFRS 16 for tax in a year later than when they first apply NZ IFRS 16 for accounting. Leases within the scope of the proposed rules A taxpayer choosing to apply NZ IFRS 16 for tax would be required to follow the proposed rules for all qualifying tax operating leases where they are the lessee. This would apply to all new and existing leases from the start of the first year the election is made. Such leases are defined in proposed section EJ 10B(1) as an IFRS lease. However, the Bill proposes that a taxpayer would continue to apply their existing treatment for the following tax operating leases: • a lease of real property; • a lease from an associated party; and • a lease where the asset is subleased. Real property The Act already treats all leases of real property as an operating lease. The proposed rules mean that a lease of real property will continue to follow the existing treatment even if a taxpayer has chosen to apply NZ IFRS 16 for tax for other leases. The existing definition of a finance lease in the Income Tax Act 2007 applies only to personal property lease assets, so that a lease of real property cannot be a finance lease. The Bill proposes to apply this same approach to exclude real property from being an IFRS lease. Real property leases will continue to be subject to the existing tax treatment. Associated parties The different treatment between lessors and lessees under NZ IFRS 16 means that if a taxpayer could choose to apply NZ IFRS 16 for tax for an asset they lease from an associated party, it would result in a tax timing advantage compared to purchasing it directly. To prevent this scenario the Bill proposes to continue using the existing tax treatment for all operating leases from an associated party as such a lease will not come under proposed section EJ 10B(1)(b). 43 Two unassociated parties might enter into an operating lease under the proposed rules and then subsequently become associated, for example because of a change in shareholding. It is proposed that the lease would no longer qualify as an IFRS lease, and the tax treatment of that lease would revert to the existing treatment including a wash-up as described below. Subleases Under NZ IFRS 16, when an asset is subleased to a second person, and the sublease of the lessor is a finance lease for accounting, the asset in the first person’s balance sheet changes from a right-of-use asset to a finance lease receivable. If the tax treatment followed the accounting treatment, the lessor would not be entitled to deductions for the amortisation of a right-of-use asset. To resolve this situation the Bill proposes to continue the existing tax treatment for all operating leases when the asset is subleased to another person, as such a lease will not come under proposed section EJ 10B(1)(c). If an asset is subleased to another person part-way through a lease term, it is proposed that the lease would no longer qualify as an IFRS lease, and the tax treatment of that lease would revert to the standard treatment and include a wash-up as described below. The exclusion of real property leases from the proposed rules is expected to significantly reduce this situation occurring. Leases that previously did not meet the definition of an IFRS lease For a lease that would not have qualified before the tax transition date but does qualify at the transition date there are no additional complications. In other words, this lease will transition into applying NZ IFRS 16 for tax in the same way as leases that have always qualified. For a lease that did not qualify after the tax transition date (either because it never met the definition of an IFRS lease or because it no longer met the definition and was therefore subject to a wash-up as described below) but that subsequently meets the IFRS lease definition (for example, the lessee and lessor are no longer associated and therefore the lease is not excluded under proposed section EJ 10B(1)(c)) the lessee will apply NZ IFRS 16 for tax from the date it meets the definition but will be required to apply the transitional adjustment in proposed section EJ 10B(7) and (8). Leases that do not follow NZ IFRS 16 A lessee that follows NZ IFRS 16 for accounting may have individual leases that are not accounted for on their balance sheet. Examples of this could include short-term or low-value leases. The accounting treatment of these leases will still be in accordance with NZ IFRS 16, and any accounting expenditure recognised through the profit and loss account will be deductible. The accounting treatment for these specific leases is expected to be similar to the existing tax treatment. Adjustments The proposed rules are not intended to significantly accelerate tax deductions compared to those available under the existing rules. It is proposed that tax adjustments set out in table 2 may be required when a taxpayer chooses to apply NZ IFRS 16 for tax. 44 Table 2: Results of spreading and the proposed tax adjustments that may be required If the spreading results in accounting deductions that are... ...then it is proposed that a tax adjustment is made before the expenditure is incurred (for example, impairment or revaluation amounts, or make-good costs) • to ensure that tax deductions are only available in a similar period to when the expenditure is incurred. later than when the expenditure is incurred (for example, certain direct or mobilisation costs) • to ensure tax deductions are available in a similar period to when the expenditure is incurred, and • it would be optional, so that a taxpayer who would incur higher compliance costs in making the adjustment than the perceived value of that adjustment will not be required to do so. The formula in proposed section EJ 10B(2) includes three adjustment amounts: add-back adjustment, impairment and revaluation adjustment, and make-good and direct costs adjustment: • Add-back adjustment decreases the tax deduction by the total increase in impairment or revaluation adjustments for a lease when they are recorded or amended through profit and loss (and likewise increases the tax deduction if these impairment or revaluation adjustments are reversed through profit and loss). This is necessary as these impairment or revaluation adjustments do not reflect expenditure that has been incurred. These adjustments are referred to in paragraphs 33 and 35 of NZ IFRS 16. There is no equivalent adjustment for fair value movements referred to in paragraph 34 of NZ IFRS 16 as these relate to investment property, which will be excluded from applying NZ IFRS 16 for tax as it is real property. • Impairment and revaluation adjustment increases the tax deduction by the amount of the add-back adjustment spread in equal proportions over the remaining term of the lease, taking into account part-years on a pro rata basis (and likewise decreases the tax deduction if the add-back adjustment increases the tax deduction). This is designed to approximate the accounting (and therefore tax) deductions that would have been available had the impairment or revaluation adjustment not been made. • Make-good and direct costs adjustment realigns the tax impact of these costs that are required to be spread over the lease term under NZ IFRS 16 but are incurred at a single point (or points) for tax purposes. The adjustment decreases the tax deduction by the amount of make-good costs described in paragraph 24(d) and the amount of direct costs described in paragraph 24(c) of NZ IFRS 16. These are nominal amounts (not discounted). The amounts are spread in equal proportions over the remaining term of the lease, taking into account part-years on a pro rata basis. Make-good costs are the costs of restoring the leased asset and are spread over the term of the lease under NZ IFRS 16 but are tax deductible when they are incurred, which is typically at or near the end of the lease. A make-good cost adjustment is proposed to be compulsory to prevent expenditure being deductible before it is incurred. Direct costs are the costs of obtaining or setting up the leased asset and are spread over the term of the lease under NZ IFRS 16 but, in some circumstances when they are not required to be capitalised into the asset value, would be tax deductible when they are incurred, which is typically at or near the beginning of the lease. A direct cost adjustment is proposed to be 45 optional, so if a taxpayer would incur greater compliance costs in calculating the adjustment than they would benefit from making it, they can choose to continue following their accounting treatment. An equal spread of either the impairment and revaluation adjustment or the make-good and direct costs adjustment may not exactly replicate the accounting spread of these adjustments but is intended to be easier for taxpayers to calculate and will total to the same amount over the term of the lease. Proposed section EJ 10B(4) allows a deduction for make-good costs and direct costs when they are incurred. To ensure all direct costs incurred are deductible only once, this will apply only when the taxpayers has chosen to include direct costs in the formula in proposed section EJ 10B(2). Example 16: Impairment On 1 April 2022, A Co enters into a five-year equipment lease with payments of $100,000 at the end of each year. Its expected deductions are shown in the table.

Cumulative adjustments An impairment and revaluation adjustment and a make-good and direct costs adjustment must be carried forward into the remaining income years of the lease term when applying the formula in proposed section EJ 10B(2). This means there may be more than one impairment and revaluation adjustment or make-good and direct costs adjustment in a year. Example 18: Cumulative adjustments Continuing the scenario in example 17, on 1 April 2024 B Co decides that the estimated make-good costs should be increased by $30,000 to $155,000.

NZ IFRS 16 requires a specific lease term for each lease but this can change over time, for example when an entity decides they will take up an option to extend a lease that they previously had not planned to do. The lease term referred to in these proposed adjustments is the lease term recognised by NZ IFRS 16 at the time of the initial adjustment, but this is not updated if the lease term recognised by NZ IFRS 16 subsequently changes. By not having to change the tax adjustments to reflect the change in lease term, compliance costs are expected to be minimised. The consequence of this approach is if the lease term shortens the full amount of adjustments will not be made before the maturity of the lease so these will be covered by the wash-up calculation described below. Likewise, if the lease term extends, the full amount of adjustments will be made before the maturity of the lease so there may not be adjustments in the final years. In either case, on an individual year basis the tax adjustments will not match the accounting consequences arising from the change in lease term. However, over the full term of the lease these differences will net to zero. Example 19: Extended lease term Continuing the scenario in example 17, on 1 April 2025 B Co agrees with the lessor to extend the lease to seven years. Lease payments remain at $100,000 per year and make-good costs are estimated to increase by $20,000 to $145,000. They are now incurred in March 2029 instead of 2027. B Co’s deductions are shown in the table.

Transitional adjustment Appendix C of NZ IFRS 16 sets out the accounting transition for entities applying NZ IFRS 16 for the first time. The two possible transition approaches in paragraph C5 allow taxpayers to choose between applying NZ IFRS 16: 48 • retrospectively to each prior period’s profit and loss account, which will result in a movement (positive or, more commonly, negative) to the entity’s opening retained earnings in the year of transition; and • to the remaining lease term at the date of initial application of NZ IFRS 16, which will not affect the opening retained earnings in the year of transition. The Bill includes proposed section EJ 10B(7) and (8) to ensure the correct tax deductions are available for any leases outstanding when the entity transitions to applying NZ IFRS 16 for tax. A tax transitional adjustment could be necessary in one of three scenarios. • A taxpayer has applied NZ IFRS 16 retrospectively to ensure any movements to retained earnings upon to the year of tax transition 6 are correctly deductible. • A taxpayer chooses to apply NZ IFRS 16 for tax one or more years after they started following NZ IFRS 16 for accounting, to ensure any difference between NZ IFRS 16 deductions and tax deductions under the existing rules are correctly deductible. • A taxpayer is already applying NZ IFRS 16 for tax and has one or more leases that previously did not meet the requirements to be an IFRS lease but subsequently does qualify. The transitional adjustment will ensure any difference between NZ IFRS 16 deductions and tax deductions before applying NZ IFRS 16 for tax is correctly deductible. The tax transitional adjustment is calculated for each lease at the date of tax transition using the formula in proposed section EJ 10B(7): retrospective accounting expenditure − retrospective tax adjustments − previous tax deductions Each of these terms is defined in proposed section EJ 10B(8): • Retrospective accounting expenditure is the total expenditure or loss recognised under NZ IFRS 16 for the income years that a person has applied NZ IFRS retrospectively. • Retrospective tax adjustments is the total tax adjustments that would have been required in relation to the total expenditure or loss recognised under NZ IFRS 16 for the income years that a person has applied NZ IFRS 16 retrospectively, if the entity had applied proposed section EJ 10B. • Previous tax deductions is the total tax deductions incurred from entering into the lease until the tax transition date. The proposed transitional adjustment may be deductible expenditure or assessable income. In either case this should be spread equally over the tax transition year and the four subsequent years. When a transitional adjustment arises due to an election to apply NZ IFRS 16 for tax it will arise at the start of an income year and apply evenly across these five years. When a transitional adjustment arises because an existing lease newly meets the IFRS lease definition, the transitional adjustment could first arise in the middle of an income year; however, it should still be spread evenly across the five income years even if the 6 The year of accounting transition and tax transition will usually be the same, but if tax transition happens in a subsequent year the tax transitional adjustment will also need to include the retained earnings impact of the years when the entity follows NZ IFRS 16 for accounting and not for tax. 49 remaining period of the first income year is shorter than a full year. This is in contrast to the impairment and make-good costs adjustments referred to above which would take into account part-years on a pro rata basis. In many instances an existing lease will mature before the end of this five-year spreading period. The Bill proposes that any undeducted expenditure or unreturned income would be incorporated into the wash-up calculation discussed below. Example 20: Retrospective transition C Co entered into a seven-year equipment lease with $100,000 annual payments on 1 April 2017. It adopted NZ IFRS 16 using the retrospective transition approach on 1 April 2019. Its accounting entries are shown in the table. Year ended 31 March NZ IAS 17 accounting expenditure NZ IFRS 16 accounting expenditure NZ IFRS 16 retained earnings adjustment 2018 $100,000 2019 $100,000 2020 $103,333 $15,529 2021 $100,231 2022 $97,014 2023 $93,677 2024 $90,216 Total $200,000 $484,471 $15,529 Grand total $700,000 As there are no adjustments for impairment, revaluation or direct costs the total tax transitional adjustment is equal to the NZ IFRS 16 retained earnings amount of $15,529. When this is spread equally over five income years the tax transitional adjustment is $3,106 per year. C Co’s tax deductions are shown in the table.

It adopted NZ IFRS 16 using the retrospective transition approach on 1 April 2019. Its accounting entries are identical to those for C Co in example 20. D Co chooses not to apply NZ IFRS 16 for tax in its year beginning 1 April 2019 and instead chooses to apply NZ IFRS 16 for tax in its year beginning 1 April 2020. Again, there are no adjustments for impairment, revaluation or direct costs so the total tax transitional adjustment is $3,333 + $15,529 = $18,862, as shown in the table.

D Co will get a wash- up deduction of $3,772 and total tax deductions will be $700,000. 51 Example 22: Non-retrospective transition E Co entered into a seven-year equipment lease with $100,000 annual payments on 1 April 2017. It adopted NZ IFRS 16 without using the retrospective transition approach on 1 April 2019. There is no adjustment to the 1 April 2019 retained earnings, and subsequent lease expenditure is calculated as though there was a five-year lease starting on 1 April 2019. No tax transitional adjustment is required. E Co’s tax deductions are shown in the table.

It adopted NZ IFRS 16 without using the retrospective transition approach on 1 April 2019. Its accounting expenditure is identical to E Co in example 22. However, F Co chooses not to apply NZ IFRS 16 for tax in its year beginning 1 April 2019 and instead chooses to apply NZ IFRS 16 for tax in its year beginning 1 April 2020. Again, there are no adjustments for impairment, revaluation or direct costs so the total tax transitional adjustment is $6,439, as shown in the table.

F Co’s tax deductions are shown in the table. As the fifth-year transitional adjustment deduction is not available before the maturity of the lease, it is incorporated into the wash-up calculation (described below). F Co will get a wash-up deduction of $1,288 and total tax deductions will be $700,000. 52 Wash-up When a taxpayer is no longer a lessee in an IFRS lease, either because it no longer meets the IFRS lease requirements in proposed section EJ 10B(1) or because the lease itself ends, proposed section EJ 10B(5) and (6) require a wash-up calculation to ensure total deductions match what would have been available under the existing tax treatment. This adjustment is conceptually similar to a base price adjustment under the financial arrangements rules. The lease will no longer be an IFRS lease when: • the lease matures; • the lessee and lessor have become associated; • the asset has been subleased to another person; or • the lessee stops following NZ IFRS 16 for accounting. This wash-up is typically expected to be zero when a lease runs its full term and NZ IFRS 16 has been applied for tax for at least five years so that the transitional adjustment spreading period in proposed section EJ 10B(7) is exhausted. If a lease existed before NZ IFRS 16 was adopted for tax, and it runs for its full term, which is less than 5 years after NZ IFRS 16 is adopted, the wash up will typically be equal to any undeducted expenditure or unreturned income under the transitional adjustment. The wash-up adjustment is calculated for each lease using the formula in proposed section EJ 10B(5): IFRS deductions − IFRS income − expenditure Each of these terms is defined in proposed section EJ 10B(6): • IFRS deductions is the total amount deducted for tax for the lease for all income years, including the year in which the lease stops being an IFRS lease but excluding the wash- up adjustment. This may include deductions in years when section EJ 10B was not applied. • IFRS income is the total amount of income returned for tax for the lease for all income years, including the year in which the lease stops being an IFRS lease but excluding the wash-up adjustment. This may include income in years when section EJ 10B was not applied. • Expenditure is the total expenditure incurred since entering into the lease until the wash- up date, ignoring proposed section EJ 10B. The wash- up adjustment may be deductible expenditure or assessable income. 53 Example 24: Full-term wash-up G Co entered into a five-year equipment lease with $100,000 annual payments on 1 April 2017. It adopted NZ IFRS 16 using the retrospective transition approach on 1 April 2019. G Co’s deductions excluding the wash-up calculation are shown in the table. Year ended 31 March NZ IAS 17 accounting deduction NZ IFRS 16 accounting deduction NZ IFRS 16 retained earnings adjustment Tax deduction excluding transitional adjustment Tax transitional adjustment Total tax deduction 2018 $100,000 $100,000 $100,000 2019 $100,000 $100,000 $100,000 2020 $100,120 $9,775 $100,120 $1,955 $102,075 2021 $96,783 $96,783 $1,955 $98,738 2022 $93,322 $93,322 $1,955 $95,277 Total $200,000 $290,225 $9,775 $490,225 $5,865 $496,090 G Co calculates its wash-up as: • IFRS deductions = $496,090 • IFRS income = $0 • Expenditure = $500,000 • $496,090 – $0 – $500,000 = -$3,910 G Co has an additional deduction available in the year ended 31 March 2022 of $3,910. This amount is equal to the two remaining years of transitional adjustment that were unclaimed when the lease matured. Example 25: Part-term wash-up example H Co entered into a five-year equipment lease with $100,000 annual payments on 1 April 2019. On 31 March 2021 they agree with the lessor to terminate the lease early with no further payments owing. H Co’s deductions are shown in the table. Year ended 31 March Payments Accounting expenditure and tax deduction 2019 $100,000 $106,439 2020 $100,000 $103,337 2021 $100,000 $100,120 Total $300,000 $309,895 H Co calculates its wash-up as: • IFRS deductions = $309,895 • IFRS income = $0 • Expenditure = $300,000 • $309,895 – $0 – $300,000 = $9,895 H Co has additional income in the year ended 31 March 2021 of $9,895. This is the amount its deductions in the 2019–2021 years exceeded the expenditure it incurred, ignoring section EJ 10B. 54 SCHEDULE 32 OVERSEAS DONEE STATUS (Clause 62) Summary of proposed amendment The Bill proposes to amend the Income Tax Act 2007 by adding three charities to the list of donee organisations in schedule 32. Application date The proposed amendments would apply from 1 April 2020. Key features It is proposed to add three charitable organisations to schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Donors to these charities would be eligible for tax benefits on their donations in money. Background Donations in money made by individuals to organisations listed in schedule 32 can receive a tax credit of 33⅓% of the donation, up to the amount of their taxable income. Companies and Māori authorities may claim a deduction for donations up to the level of their net income. Charities that apply funds towards purposes that are mostly outside New Zealand must be listed in schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007 before donors become eligible for these tax benefits. Detailed analysis The three charitable organisations being added to schedule 32 are engaged in the following activities: Active Hearts Foundation Active Hearts Foundation formalised in 2017 the charitable activities of a group of New Zealand trekking guides, which were directed at improving living conditions and education outcomes in Nepalese villages in the Himalayas. Key projects to date have involved disaster relief following the 2015, 2018 and 2019 earthquakes, refitting and resourcing school libraries, resourcing community health clinics, and ensuring the resilience of local infrastructure, including an irrigation pipeline for food production. Kiwilink Kiwilink was formally established as a charitable trust in August 2018 to separate humanitarian projects formerly undertaken within the Associated Churches of Christ New Zealand, and continue to undertake missions with a particular focus on Zimbabwe and Vanuatu. Recent work undertaken by the Trust in Zimbabwe includes collaborating with local charities to provide orphan care, student bursaries, and water borehole drilling in the 55 Zvishavane region in South Western Zimbabwe. In Vanuatu, the Trust has worked on relocating people in the Ambae region displaced by volcanic activity, and providing first-aid supplies and a water storage tank at the Noui Noui Hospital. Shimshal Trust Shimshal Trust was set up in 2003 to support education outcomes and the relief of poverty for communities and villages in the northern region of Pakistan (Shimshal). The principal focus of the Trust is to fund scholarships to help local students with promising ability but no financial support, to attend high school or university. The Trust also provides financial support to community aid and development projects in the region. 56 GST CREDIT NOTES (Clause 90) Two amendments are proposed to ensure that a supplier that issues a GST credit note to correct a previous mistake in a GST return receives similar outcomes to a supplier that applies to the Commissioner to amend the original GST return. All section references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. Using a credit note to correct an invoice when 15% GST was incorrectly charged on a zero-rated supply or an exempt supply Summary of proposed amendment A supplier may have issued an incorrect invoice charging 15% GST on a supply of goods or services which was actually zero-rated supply (such as an export) or an exempt supply (such as a financial service). The proposed amendment to insert new subparagraph 25(1)(aaa) would allow the supplier to issue a credit note to correct the mistake. The supplier can then include an adjustment for the correct amount of GST in the GST return for the taxable period in which the credit note was issued. Application date In order to align with existing commercial practices, the proposed amendments would apply retrospectively from 1 April 2012. Background A GST-registered supplier that supplied goods or services and incorrectly charged GST (because the supply was either zero-rated or exempt) needs to correct the error. For example, if the invoice was for $100 supply plus $15 of GST that was incorrectly charged, it would be common commercial practice to issue a credit note for the full value of the original invoice ($115), and then issue a new invoice for the correct amount ($100). This method is used for many reasons, including that it is more practical and provides a better audit trail. It also involves fewer compliance and administrative costs than alternatives for correcting the GST, such as the supplier asking Inland Revenue under section 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to amend the GST return in which the supply occurred. Suppliers issuing a credit note in situations whereby 15% GST was incorrectly charged on a supply which actually zero-rated or exempt are currently relying on paragraph 25(1)(b) to allow them to do so. However, it is not clear that this provision was intended to be used for issuing a credit note in these situations. Section 25(1)(b) was mainly designed to apply when the supplier subsequently offered a discount. For example, if a price is discounted from $230 to $200 the deduction allowed by section 25(2)(b) in a subsequent GST return will be 3/23 of the $30 discount: $3.91. If the relevant supply was for consideration of $200 plus $30 of GST that was incorrectly charged, an adjustment of $30 (rather than $3.91) would be required to correctly account for the overpayment of GST. 57 The proposed amendment would insert a new section 25(1)(aaa) which will explicitly allow the supplier to issue a credit note when 15% GST was incorrectly charged on an exempt or zero-rated supply. After issuing the credit note, the supplier could then include an adjustment for the correct amount of overpaid GST ($30 in the preceding example) in the GST return for the taxable period in which the credit note was issued. Time limit for issuing a credit note for a supply made in an earlier period Summary of proposed amendment Proposed new section 25(3)(f) sets time limits for issuing a credit note for a supply made in an earlier period. The proposed time limit for issuing a credit note is intended to align with the “time bar” that applies to GST refunds made through amendments to GST returns, which is generally four years from the end of the taxable period. The time limits for refunds are referred to in sections 45(1), (2) and (3) of the GST Act. Proposed section 25(3)(f)(iii) provides the same four-year time limit for issuing a credit note that relates to a supply which was included in a previous GST return. The time limit is measured from the end of the taxable period for the earlier return. Under section 45(4) an extra four years may be available to adjust a GST return to correct an overpayment of tax that resulted from a clear mistake or simple oversight. This effectively provides an eight-year time bar in these circumstances. Proposed section 25(3)(f)(ii) provides the same additional time limit for issuing a credit note. This means the total of eight years is only available when the overpayment of tax, which the credit note is being issued to correct, was due to the result of a clear mistake or simple oversight. Existing section 25(3)(f) provides a seven-year time limit for credit notes issued under section 25(1)(ab) for supplies of land which were incorrectly standard-rated rather than zero- rated. Proposed section 25(3)(f)(i) of the Bill duplicates and retains that existing section. This is because it involves a different time limit (seven years) and applies from the date of settlement, which is different to the end of the taxable period that the supply was included in a GST return. The shorter of the new proposed limits, or the existing seven year limit for credit notes issued under section 25(1)(ab), would be used to limit the time for issuing a credit note. Application date The proposed amendment to impose a time limit on issuing a credit note would apply from the date that the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020–21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill was introduced. This is necessary as there is a potential fiscal risk from publicising the fact that the current time bar may be ineffective for credit notes. 58 Background The existing time limits on GST refunds in section 45 may be ineffective when a credit note is issued to provide the adjustment. This is because a credit note amends the current GST return, even though the original supply to which the credit note relates was included in an earlier GST return. This poses a potentially large fiscal risk as it means a GST registered person may be able to use credit notes to claim GST refunds if they discovered they had been applying an incorrect GST treatment for a long time. This would undermine the policy intent and effectiveness of the time limits for GST refunds. 59 PORTABILITY OF AUSTRALIAN UNCLAIMED SUPERANNUATION MONEY (Clauses 58(3) and 93) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendments would support an enhancement to Trans-Tasman retirement savings portability, to enable the direct transfer of New Zealanders’ Australian unclaimed superannuation money (USM) from the Australian Tax Office (ATO) to a KiwiSaver scheme. In addition to the amendments proposed in this Bill, this enhancement requires amendments to Australian legislation and to the Trans-Tasman Retirement Savings Portability Arrangement between New Zealand and Australia (the Arrangement). Application date The proposed amendments would come into force on the same date as amendments to the Arrangement. The Arrangement will be amended through an exchange of diplomatic notes between the Governments of Australia and New Zealand, with these notes stipulating when the amendments to the Arrangement, and therefore the amendments in this Bill, will come into force. Before amendments are made to the Arrangement, amendments to legislation in New Zealand (in this Bill) and legislation in Australia first need to have been passed into law. It is unlikely that both New Zealand and Australian amendments will be passed until late 2021, at the earliest. Inland Revenue officials will provide further guidance on the date the amendments in the Bill would come into force when these prerequisites are closer to being met. Key features The proposed amendments would extend the definition of “Australian complying superannuation scheme” in the KiwiSaver Act 2006 and Income Tax Act 2007 to include the Australian Commissioner of Tax in their capacity as the holder of USM. This would mean the rules that currently apply to retirement savings transferred from Australian superannuation schemes to KiwiSaver schemes, would apply to USM transferred from the ATO to KiwiSaver schemes. Background The Arrangement came into effect from 1 July 2013 and allows for the transfer of retirement savings between certain Australian superannuation schemes and New Zealand KiwiSaver schemes. It reflects the special relationship between New Zealand and Australia and removes an impediment to labour movement. 60 A number of provisions in the KiwiSaver and Income Tax Acts give effect to the Arrangement in New Zealand. An unresolved portability issue relates to “lost” Australian retirement savings. Under Australian law a superannuation account is generally considered to be lost when the account is inactive and the member uncontactable. Eventually, under the Australian Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999, Australian superannuation schemes are required to transfer savings from lost superannuation accounts to the ATO. These savings are then commonly referred to as USM. The Arrangement does not currently enable the direct transfer of USM from the ATO to New Zealand KiwiSaver schemes. Domestic legislation in Australia and New Zealand also does not permit this. Instead, New Zealanders currently wanting to recoup USM held by the ATO must first transfer these savings to an Australian superannuation scheme before they can be transferred to a KiwiSaver scheme. As many affected New Zealanders will no longer have an Australian superannuation account, this acts as a significant hurdle to the repatriation of USM to New Zealand. Detailed analysis The amendments in this Bill would regulate how USM would be treated in New Zealand after being transferred from the ATO to KiwiSaver schemes. Under the proposal it would be voluntary for KiwiSaver members, or KiwiSaver scheme providers on their behalf, to request the transfer of USM from the ATO. The ATO would then be required to transfer the USM to the member’s KiwiSaver scheme provider. More detailed guidance on operational matters relating to the transfer of USM from the ATO to KiwiSaver schemes would be provided closer to the start date for transfers. Rules applying to transferred savings The proposed amendments would extend the definition of “Australian complying superannuation scheme” in section 4 of the KiwiSaver Act and section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act to include the Australian Commissioner of Tax in their capacity under the Australian Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999. Therefore, transferred USM would be covered by the existing rules applying to retirement savings transferred from an Australian superannuation scheme to a KiwiSaver scheme. Generally, this would mean USM transferred from the ATO to a KiwiSaver scheme would be subject to the same KiwiSaver rules as New Zealand-sourced retirement savings. However, a number of special rules apply to transferred savings, which are set out below. These special rules are intended to ensure individuals transferring their retirement savings across the Tasman are neither advantaged nor disadvantaged by differences between Australian and New Zealand superannuation settings. Withdrawal of savings for retirement: under clause 4B of schedule 1 of the KiwiSaver Act, transferred USM could be withdrawn from KiwiSaver when the member is 60 years or older and satisfies the Australian definition of retirement. 61 First home withdrawal: clause 8(4) of schedule 1 of the KiwiSaver Act would prevent transferred USM from being withdrawn from KiwiSaver for the purchase of a first home in New Zealand. Permanent emigration: after being transferred to KiwiSaver, clauses 14(1)(b) and 14(2)(b) of schedule 1 of the KiwiSaver Act would prevent USM from subsequently being transferred to a third country if the member permanently emigrates. Invalid enrolment: if a person’s membership in KiwiSaver is discovered to be invalid, transferred USM would be returned to an Australian superannuation scheme selected by the person under section 59D(2)(c)(ii) of the KiwiSaver Act or by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue under section 59D(2)(c)(iii). (The option under section 59D(c)(i) of the KiwiSaver Act to have savings refunded to the scheme they were transferred from would not apply in relation to USM, as it would not be appropriate for USM to be refunded back to the ATO.) Government contribution: USM would not count towards a member’s entitlement to the annual $521.43 Government contribution in the year it was transferred to New Zealand. (Amounts transferred from an Australian complying superannuation scheme are specifically excluded from the definition of “member credit contribution” in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act; this definition is used to determine what payments count towards the Government contribution entitlement.) Tax treatment: under section CW 29B of the Income Tax Act, USM would be treated as exempt income on entry into New Zealand (after being transferred to New Zealand, any subsequent earnings on transferred savings would be taxed under the portfolio investment entity rules). Clause 14B of schedule 1 of the KiwiSaver Act currently sets out the portability rules applying to the transfer of savings from a KiwiSaver scheme to an Australian complying superannuation scheme. Although the proposed amendments would bring USM within the definition of Australian complying superannuation scheme for the purpose of transferring USM to KiwiSaver, this would not make it possible for a transfer in reverse (that is, a transfer from a KiwiSaver scheme to the ATO). A transfer from KiwiSaver to the ATO would not involve USM. 62 MYCOPLASMA BOVIS TAX ISSUE (Clause 33) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendments would enable the taxable income arising from the culling of certain qualifying Mycoplasma bovis affected livestock to be spread over six income years. Application date The proposed amendments would apply for the 2017−18 and later income years. Key features The income would only be able to be spread if: • The business has been subject to Biosecurity Security New Zealand requiring a cull of Mycoplasma bovis affected stock. • The business is a dairy or a beef breeding operation, with the breeding stock that is culled being valued under NSC or self-assessed cost. The expectation is that the breeding stock that is culled would comprise mainly mixed-aged cows, in combination with any other class of breeding stock. • The stock is substantially replaced through purchasing equivalent breeding stock by the end of the income year following the cull year. • The replacement stock continues to be valued using, as relevant, NSC or the cost price method. This is to ensure that farmers cannot enter the herd scheme on more advantageous terms than those not affected by Mycoplasma bovis. Given that a livestock owner might use a couple of valuation methods in combination, 7 not all of the breeding stock might be valued at cost. However, only the income derived from the culling of the breeding stock valued under NSC or the self-assessed cost scheme would be able to be spread. For this purpose, breeding stock would include immature female stock intended for future breeding in the business. Owners of the affected livestock, including sharemilkers, would be covered, that is, the ability to spread income from the cull is not be limited to just the owners of farmland with livestock. The qualifying proceeds from the cull would comprise payments from the slaughterhouse, top-up compensation from the government for the difference between the normal market value for the stock and the payments from the slaughterhouse, and in some cases, further compensation to cover the additional cost of purchasing equivalent replacement stock. The income arising from the culling of stock valued under another valuation method, or stock culled from a fattening stock business valued under NSC, would not qualify for this 7 For example, an owner might use the herd scheme in conjunction with NSC (the alternative valuation option). 63 spreading provision. The Income Equalisation Scheme is available in those circumstances to mitigate the income implications of the cull. Background Some farmers have significant unexpected taxable income through their herds being culled following a primary sector and government decision to eradicate Mycoplasma bovis in New Zealand. Federated Farmers requested an amendment to ensure there would be no income tax implications from culling and replacing dairy and beef cattle impacted by Mycoplasma bovis. They cited the special treatment given to depreciation recovery income on buildings damaged by the Christchurch and the Hurunui-Kaikōura earthquakes as a precedent. The issue arises for farmers who have used a cost-based method (that is, the national standard cost scheme (NSC) and self-assessed cost scheme) 8 to value their breeding stock on hand for tax purposes. This is because the difference between the total proceeds received from the cull and the cost of the stock is income. This creates a cash-flow issue for those farmers who purchase replacement livestock after the cull. Those replacement stock are valued at their purchase price and cannot, for tax purposes, be immediately written down to the homebred cost to offset the income. To avoid this outcome, the proposed legislative changes would enable the proceeds from the cull to be transferred from the year of the cull and spread evenly over the following six income years. This ability to spread will be optional. Detailed analysis Relevant current legislation The livestock valuation rules are contained in subpart EC of the Income Tax Act 2007, including the requirements that apply when using multiple valuation options and the restrictions on switching between valuation options. These rules ensure that the cost of stock on hand is valued appropriately and that the cost of purchases is not deducted ahead of their being sold. Precondition for the spread Proposed section EZ 4B(1) sets out the following preconditions: • A person would have to have, as part of their business, mixed-age cows on hand at the start of the cull year and those cows would need to be valued under either NSC or the cost price method at the end of the income year before the cull year. The cull year would need to be before the 2028−29 income year. (The focus on mixed-age cows is to ensure that the spread is provided to those who have sizeable additional income as a result of the cull given that female breeding stock make up a high proportion of a 8 The NSC scheme values the animals at, if the animal is homebred, a standard cost (determined by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue) for the respective age and type of animal that reflects that animal’s average costs of production, or at its purchase cost if the stock is purchased. The self-assessed cost scheme (a cost price method) involves farmers using their own farm costs rather than standard costs. 64 standard herd. The 2028−29 income year cut-off is in the expectation that Mycoplasma bovis should be less significant by that stage). • In the cull year, some or all of the person’s cattle would need to be destroyed, because of Mycoplasma bovis, using the powers in either sections 121 or 122 of the Biosecurity Act 1993 that enable Biosecurity New Zealand to examine organisms and give directions. (Normally the whole herd is destroyed but in some isolated cases only a portion needs to be destroyed). • A significant portion of the culled stock would need to be replaced by the end of the income year following the cull year. The expectation is that the culled livestock are replaced with purchased stock. Specifically, the requirement is that the number of mixed-age cows valued under the national standard cost scheme or the cost price method that the person has on hand (or expects to have on hand) at the end of the income year following the cull year is at least seventy five percent of the number of mixed-age cows valued under the national standard cost scheme or the cost price method that the person had on hand at the start of the cull year. The spread There are two parts to the spread. Proposed section EZ 4B(2) would enable the income calculated under proposed section EZ 4B(5) to be spread evenly over the six income years following the cull year. Proposed section EZ 4B(3) would spread the deduction that the livestock owner would otherwise be able to claim under section EC 2 for the equivalent number of stock. 9 Their combined effect is that the net income arising from the culling of the relevant livestock would be spread. For the income spread component, the formula in proposed section EZ 4B(5) is: Σ(number × (sale proceeds + compensation) ÷ culled stock) This formula works on a livestock class basis, where: • Σ is the summation of the amounts calculated using the formula for each of the following classes of each of the beef cattle and dairy cattle types of livestock: (a) rising 1 year heifers; (b) rising 2 year heifers; (c) mixed-age cows; and (d) breeding bulls. • Number, for a class of livestock, is the number that is the lesser of: (a) the number calculated using the formula in proposed EZ4B(12): valuation method breeding stock + culled stock − opening stock (b) the number of livestock of that class that are part of the destroyed cattle (culled stock). 9 Section EC 2 provides a deduction at the beginning of the cull year for the value of stock on hand at the end of the preceding income year). 65 • Sale proceeds, for a class of livestock, is the amount of income the person derives from the disposal of the livestock of that class that are part of the destroyed cattle. • Compensation, for a class of livestock, is the amount of compensation which the person is entitled to under section 162A of the Biosecurity Act 1993 and that the person receives by the end of the income year following the cull year for: (a) the difference between the stock’s market value and the sale proceeds; and (b) the cost of the replacement cattle of the same class being greater than the total amount received in relation to the stock it replaces. • Culled stock, for a class of livestock, is the number of livestock of that class that are part of the destroyed cattle. • Valuation method breeding stock is the number of livestock of that class that: (i) were breeding stock or stock that the person expected to be capable of, and intended be used for, breeding upon reaching maturity; and (ii) the person valued under NSC or the cost price method in the income year before the cull year. • Opening stock is the number of livestock of that class that the person had on hand at the start of the cull year. The formula takes into account the possibility that a livestock owner might be using more than one valuation method to value the stock, and might reduce the number on NSC or the cost price method between the start of the cull year and the cull date. When all the stock are on NSC or the cost price method, stock numbers are constant and all stock is culled, then the formula simplifies to just the sales proceeds plus compensation. Ceasing business Should the business cease, or the owner of the business die, proposed section EZ 4B(4) would require any unallocated amount of spread income and deduction to be allocated to the “cessation” year. Already filed income tax returns For those taxpayers that have already filed their 2018−19 income tax returns, once the legislation has been enacted they can apply for a reassessment under section 113 of the Tax Administration Act. In the meantime, Inland Revenue is allowing instalment arrangements to be entered into, in relation to the tax due to match the proposed spread. No legislative amendment is necessary for this to occur. Since the proposed spread would apply from the 2017−18 income year, some taxpayers would also be eligible to apply for reassessment of their 2017−18 income tax returns once the legislation has been enacted. Notification Those taking up the spreading option need to notify Inland Revenue in writing. This can be done electronically. 66 Proposed section EZ 4B(14) requires an election to be made by the date of filing of the taxpayer’s return of income for the 2020−21 income year, if the cull year is the 2020−21 income year or earlier, and by the date of filing their return for the cull year in any other case. The additional compliance costs from this notification requirement would be small given the anticipated small number of farmers affected by Mycoplasma bovis and the fact that many will need to contact Inland Revenue anyway in the interim period before the legislation is enacted to arrange instalment arrangements. The amount of income and tax involved is significant for each affected taxpayer so knowing who has taken up this option will also be helpful from a compliance perspective. The election would be irrevocable, but would not be treated as being made if, at the end of the income year following the cull year, the number of mixed-age cows on hand that were valued under one of the cost schemes was less than seventy five percent of the equivalent pre-cull levels. 67 Table 3: Income spread Opening numbers for cull year Cull numbers Income spread Total for class Valued in cost Held in herd scheme A − B Held for breeding Breeding in NSC D − C Number culled Valued in NSC E + F − A Spread based on smaller of F or G Cull proceeds per class Compo per class Gross cull income I + J Cull income per head K ÷ F Income to spread H × I A B C D E F G H I J K L R1 heifers 0 R2 heifers (AVO in use) 20 5 15 20 5 19 4 4 $15,200 $7,600 $22,800 $1,200 $4,800 MA cows 100 100 0 100 100 80 80 80 $95,000 $55,000 $150,000 $1,875 $150,000 Breeding bulls 0 Total income spread $154,800 Presumed that when the alternative valuation option (AVO) is in use, the herd scheme animals are the breeding or replacement animals.

This amendment proposes a clarification to ensure that expenditure must be closely connected with conducting an R&D activity to be eligible. The changes proposed are in line with the original policy intent, and are not intended to change how the expenditure rules work but instead are intended as a clarification so that claimants apply the law correctly. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from the beginning of the R&D tax credit scheme, which is the 2019−20 income year (1 April 2019 for most taxpayers). Key features It is proposed that the definition of eligible R&D expenditure for the R&D tax incentive, as prescribed in section LY 5 of the Income Tax Act 2007, be amended to clarify that only expenditure that is directly connected with an eligible R&D activity is eligible. To be eligible, it is proposed that expenditure must be: • required for conducting an R&D activity; • integral to conducting an R&D activity; and • directly related to conducting an R&D activity. The existing requirement that expenditure must be listed in schedule 21B, part A and not in schedule 21B, part B also applies. All section references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. Background The legislation currently requires that expenditure be on an activity, but does not give direction as to how closely the expenditure must be connected to the activity. Section LY 5(1) defines eligible R&D expenditure, so that expenditure or loss (“expenditure”) is eligible to the extent to which it is: • incurred on an eligible R&D activity in the relevant income year; and • described in schedule 21B, part A (which lists the categories of expenditure that are eligible for R&D tax credits); and • not described in schedule 21B, part B (which lists the categories of expenditure that are ineligible for R&D tax credits). 72 In addition to these requirements, to ensure that expenditure claimed has sufficient nexus with the eligible R&D being conducted, the proposed amendment clarifies that expenditure is only eligible if it is directly related to the R&D taking place. Detailed analysis The proposed amendment to section LY 5(1)(a) inserts a requirement that expenditure must be required for, integral to, and directly related to an eligible R&D activity to be eligible for the credit. These are in addition to the existing requirements that expenditure must be listed in schedule 21B, part A and not described by schedule 21B, part B to be eligible for the credit. Directly relates to (proposed new section LY 5(1)(a)(i)) The “directly relates to” requirement clarifies that expenditure must have a direct connection to an R&D activity to be eligible. A person must make a reasonable assessment of whether their expenditure has a sufficiently close connection to R&D to be eligible. If a person’s expenditure relates to an R&D activity, but also relates to another purpose, the person must apportion the expenditure accordingly. This requirement is intended to ensure that expenditure that is too remote from the R&D activity to which it relates is not eligible for the credit. Requiring expenditure to directly relate to an R&D activity clarifies the policy intent, which is that only expenditure that closely relates to an R&D activity should be eligible. Example 26: Expenditure must directly relate to R&D to be eligible for the credit LiamCo operates a mixed-use facility in Auckland, where fifty percent of the facility is devoted to R&D, while the other fifty percent is used for HR for LiamCo’s operations across New Zealand. Expenditure on cleaning products used to clean the R&D area of the facility (while used for eligible R&D) would be eligible expenditure, because it directly relates to performing eligible R&D. However, expenditure on products used while cleaning the HR work area would not be eligible, even though HR spends some time supporting R&D staff, because these costs have no direct connection with performing R&D. Required for and integral to (proposed new section LY 5(1)(a)(ii) and (iii)) The “required for” requirement clarifies that expenditure is only eligible to the degree it is necessary to support an R&D activity. The “integral to” requirement clarifies that expenditure must be essential to an R&D activity to be eligible. That is, the activity could not be performed or completed without the expenditure. Similarities with supporting activity limb These two requirements are taken from the definition of supporting R&D activity in section LY 2(3)(a). A supporting R&D activity is an activity that contributes to and is necessary for a core R&D activity (an activity that resolves scientific or technological uncertainty via a systematic method in order to produce new knowledge or things). The policy intent is that supporting activities must be very closely connected to a core activity in order to be eligible, and the tests required by the supporting R&D activity definition are designed to necessitate this close connection. 73 The policy intent for R&D expenditure is likewise that it must be closely connected with an eligible R&D activity to be eligible for the credit. Replicating part of the supporting R&D activity tests for the definition of eligible R&D expenditure clarifies that there must be a close connection between expenditure and an R&D activity for the expenditure to be eligible. This ensures the legislation matches the policy intent. Example 27: Expenditure must be required for and integral to the R&D To the extent that their duties relate to eligible R&D, expenditure on the salaries of staff at LiamCo’s Auckland facility is eligible for the credit, as it is required for and integral to the R&D taking place. This includes the salaries of LiamCo’s R&D staff, but also the salaries of the HR staff inasmuch as their duties relate to the R&D staff, as this expenditure is considered required for and integral to R&D (it relates to the performance of R&D and the R&D could not be performed without it). However, the HR staff at the Auckland facility also perform HR duties for LiamCo’s operations nationwide. The salaries of the HR staff cannot be claimed to the extent that their duties do not relate to R&D staff, as this expenditure is not required for R&D. In addition to their salaries, staff at the facility receive a number of employee benefits, such as discounted gym subscriptions and on-site childcare facilities. These benefits are optional and are not factored into an employee’s remuneration package. While some R&D staff may use these facilities, they are not integral to the R&D taking place; R&D could still be performed even if these benefits were not provided. Expenditure on these benefits is therefore not eligible. "Only or main purpose” test not included It is not proposed that all of the supporting activity tests are included in the amended eligible expenditure definition in section LY 5. In particular, it is not proposed that the “only or main purpose” requirement be included. The “only or main purpose” test would go beyond the policy intent, by requiring that expenditure be incurred only or mainly for the purpose of supporting an R&D activity to be eligible. For example, a business does R&D in a lab, which forms part of a larger complex that also includes non-R&D facilities. The R&D portion of the total complex is twenty five percent. The policy intent is that twenty five percent of the rent be eligible for the credit; however, an “only or main purpose” test may completely exclude the rent. Therefore, the “only or main purpose” has not been included in the proposed amendment. Businesses not obligated to minimise expenditure As with the supporting R&D activity tests, the proposed new “required for” and “integral to” expenditure tests do not obligate a business to adopt the cheapest possible approach to its R&D. For instance, one business may want the highest possible quality for materials and equipment used in R&D, while another may be satisfied with a lower standard. In both cases the expenditure required for and integral to the R&D activity would be eligible. Similarly, businesses may go about their research in different ways. Expenditure that is required for an approach that a business has chosen will not be disqualified simply because another business might have chosen a cheaper option. 74 Example 28: Business not obligated to minimise expenditure Loud Co is performing eligible R&D to develop new drilling equipment for use in constructing tunnels. Their equipment emits noise at a volume damaging to human hearing, so, to protect its employees’ (and future customers’) health and safety, Loud Co incorporates noise-reducing technologies into the design of its drilling equipment. At the same time, Equally Loud Co is performing R&D on similar equipment. Rather than altering the design of the equipment, Equally Loud Co addresses the problem more cheaply by buying noise-cancelling earmuffs for all of its employees working on the drill. Both Loud Co’s expenditure on reducing the noise of the drill and Equally Loud Co’s expenditure on earmuffs are eligible for the credit. It does not matter that Loud Co could have taken a cheaper approach to solve the issue. Existing requirements in section LY 5(1)(a) and (b) still apply Schedule 21B, part A To be eligible, expenditure must be described in schedule 21B, part A, which provides a list of expenditure that may be eligible for the R&D tax credit (section LY 5(1)(a)). It is proposed that this requirement continue to apply (that is, the proposed amendments to this section would not affect this requirement). Schedule 21B, part B If expenditure is described in schedule 21B, part B, then it is not eligible for the R&D tax credit (section LY 5(1)(b)). It is proposed that this requirement continue to apply (that is, the proposed amendments to section LY 5 would not affect this requirement). “To the extent” test still applies The amendment removes the “to the extent” test (which ensures that expenditure is only eligible to the extent to which it is incurred on an R&D activity) from LY 5(1)(a). The test still applies to R&D expenditure, however, because it is explicitly referred to in each of the clauses in schedule 21B, part A. Each of the clauses in this schedule stipulates that expenditure in that category is only eligible to the extent to which this expenditure relates to performing an R&D activity. 75 Example 29: Eligible R&D expenditure under the new requirements GeneriCo is a company whose main business activity is performing R&D. It files its supplementary return for the 2020−21 income year. GeneriCo can claim the costs of employees performing eligible R&D, as well as costs for other staff to the extent that their duties are required for and integral to performing R&D. For instance, GeneriCo can claim the cost of HR staff to the extent that they are supporting R&D staff, cleaning staff to the extent that they are cleaning facilities used for R&D, and payroll staff to the extent that they are paying R&D staff. However, GeneriCo cannot claim expenditure with a less direct connection to R&D. For instance, it cannot claim the cost of payroll staff to the extent that they are paying HR staff who are supporting R&D staff, or cleaning staff to the extent that they are cleaning the offices of payroll staff who are paying R&D staff, and so on. This is because these costs do not directly relate to an R&D activity. GeneriCo can claim rent, utilities, insurance, and other expenses necessary to operate its R&D-performing facility in Christchurch, to the extent that the expenses relate to the performance of eligible R&D activities. However, GeneriCo cannot claim the costs of its on-site cafeteria or grounds maintenance costs at the facility. These costs are not required for or integral to the performance of R&D – R&D could still take place at the facility even in the absence of these costs. Variation of facts: Under the current expenditure rules The legislation currently only requires that expenditure be on an activity, but does not give direction as to how closely the expenditure must be connected to the activity. Without the clarification provided by this amendment, this could allow GeneriCo to claim costs that are only loosely connected with R&D, contrary to the policy intent (which is that only expenditure that closely relates to and is reasonably necessary for performing R&D should be eligible). For instance, GeneriCo might interpret the law in a way that allows it to claim the full cost of its staff for the credit; as GeneriCo’s main business is performing R&D, all staff costs could be considered as necessary to support the performance of R&D activities. Likewise, as they are part of the costs of a facility used solely for R&D activities, GeneriCo might interpret the law in a way that allows it to claim the costs of the staff cafeteria or maintaining the grounds at its Christchurch facility. Application date It is proposed that this amendment would apply from the beginning of the R&D tax credit regime, which is the 2019–20 income year. The proposed amendment is a simple clarification that expenditure must be directly connected with R&D to be eligible and is not intended as a change in policy, or to change the way the law currently operates. It should therefore not affect R&D tax credit claims already filed, and should provide future claimants with more explicit legislative direction regarding what expenditure may be eligible for the credit. 76 MINING DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES EXCLUSION (Clause 59) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment clarifies the current exclusions on mining activities to make it explicit that they also cover development activities relating to mining minerals, petroleum, natural gas, or geothermal energy. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from the beginning of the R&D tax credit scheme, which is the 2019−20 income year (1 April 2019 for most taxpayers). Key features Prospecting, exploring, and drilling for minerals, petroleum, natural gas, or geothermal energy are excluded from being core or supporting R&D activities (schedule 21, parts A and B, clause 5). It is proposed that development activities be added to the existing core and supporting activity exclusions. Background Schedule 21 of the Income Tax Act 2007 lists activities that are ineligible for the R&D tax credit. It is divided into two parts. Part A lists activities that are excluded from being core R&D activities. Part B lists activities that are excluded from being supporting R&D activities. The existing mining exclusion excludes such activities from being both core and supporting activities for the tax credit. The policy intent is for mining activities in and of themselves to be ineligible for the credit. The proposed amendment expands on this by further excluding development activities such as developing land for the purposes of mining. This exclusion only targets development activities in and of themselves. R&D that relates to such activities may still qualify for the credit, provided it meets the other eligibility criteria. It is not proposed that development activities be explicitly defined for the purposes of the R&D tax credit regime, although there are various related definitions in the Income Tax Act 2007 (like petroleum development expenditure, which covers activities such as acquiring or constructing petroleum mining assets). These existing definitions would help inform what is considered a development activity, and additional guidance will be published with more information on what is considered a development activity for the purposes of the R&D tax credit regime. 77 AMENDMENT TO TANGIBLE DEPRECIABLE PROPERTY EXCLUSION (Clause 60(2) and (7)) Summary of proposed amendment It is proposed that schedule 21B, part B, clause 3 be amended so that, other than expenditure/loss on developing prototypes or on employees doing core R&D, expenditure that contributes to the cost of tangible depreciable property is ineligible for the credit when it is incurred. Depreciation loss on the property may be eligible, however, if the property is subsequently used in R&D. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from the beginning of the R&D tax credit scheme, which is the 2019−20 income year (1 April 2019 for most taxpayers). Key features This proposed amendment would make two changes to the existing exclusion on expenditure or loss that contributes to the cost of tangible depreciable property (schedule 21B, part B, clause 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007). First, a change is proposed to clarify the scope of the exception for expenditure that contributes to the cost of property intended for use as a prototype (“prototype exception”), by adding further requirements that: • the property must only be intended for use in performing R&D in the future; and • creating the property must involve a core R&D activity. This proposed amendment would ensure the provision operates consistently with the policy intent, which is for expenditure on tangible depreciable property to be ineligible unless it is on a prototype (property that is developed through R&D, and is only used in R&D). Second, a change is proposed to allow expenditure/loss on employees doing core R&D to be eligible for the credit, despite the exclusion for costs that contribute to tangible depreciable property (“employee cost carve-in”). Background Schedule 21B, part B, clause 3 currently excludes expenditure or loss that contributes to the cost of tangible depreciable property. An exception exists for expenditure that contributes to the cost of property intended for use solely in performing an R&D activity. This prototype exception is intended to capture expenditure required to produce items created by and solely used in core R&D activities, such as prototypes. Expenditure on tangible depreciable property that meets this test is still eligible for the tax credit. 78 This amendment proposes two changes to the exclusion. The first change would amend the prototype exception. The second would allow certain employee costs to be eligible, even if they contribute to the cost of tangible depreciable property. Prototype exception In addition to the current requirement that the property must only be used in performing R&D, the proposed amendment requires that the property must only be intended for use in performing R&D in the future, and that creating the property must involve a core R&D activity. This is consistent with the policy intent, which the current legislation does not satisfy. The policy intent of the prototype exception is to allow expenditure or loss on items of tangible depreciable property created through R&D and used solely in R&D throughout their lifetime to be eligible. However, the current wording of the exception may include a greater range of expenditure than is intended. There is a risk that expenditure on assets whose construction involves some core R&D and which are used solely for that purpose in the year in which the expenditure in incurred, but which are not solely intended for use in R&D throughout their lifetime, or assets which involve no core R&D in their construction but which are intended for use in R&D, may be eligible through the exception. Employee cost carve-in The proposed second change would allow expenditure or loss on an item of tangible depreciable property to be eligible for the tax credit, regardless of whether it meets the above tests, to the extent to which it relates to the cost of employees performing core R&D activity. This means that a business could claim expenditure on employees that contributes to the cost of an item of tangible depreciable property for the tax credit, even where the item of property is not intended as a prototype, to the extent that the employees are performing a core R&D activity. Usually this means an identifiable separate activity incidental to the creation of a larger item of tangible depreciable property. This is consistent with the existing inclusion for labour costs for R&D undertaken in commercial production environments, and recognises that it should be easier to identify whether labour costs directly relate to R&D compared with non-labour costs, such as electricity costs. The proposed amendment would allow more genuine R&D costs to be eligible while still ensuring any fiscal risk posed by R&D projects involving significant tangible depreciable assets is minimised. Detailed analysis Clarifying the prototype exception The proposed amendment would add further tests into the clause that ensure the exception is better targeted towards the concept of a prototype. In addition to the current requirement that an item of property is only used in R&D, these tests would require that the property’s sole intended future use is in performing R&D, and that the creation of the item involves a core R&D activity: • Sole intended future use is in performing R&D means that a person’s intent must be that the item of property will only ever be used in performing R&D activities, and never be used for any other purpose. 79 • Creation involves a core R&D activity means that, for expenditure or loss on an item of property to be eligible, the expenditure or loss must also be incurred on performing a core R&D activity (that is, the creation of the item involves resolving a scientific or technological uncertainty via a systematic method). For expenditure or loss on an item of tangible depreciable property to be eligible, all three tests must be met. New exception for employee costs on core R&D activity The proposed amendment would also allows expenditure or loss on an item of tangible depreciable property to be eligible for the tax credit, regardless of whether it meets the above tests, to the extent to which it relates to employee costs on core R&D activity. Expenditure or loss on employee costs for an item of tangible depreciable property is ineligible to the extent to which the costs do not relate to performing a core R&D activity (unless the item of property meets the tests required by the prototype exception). Example 30: Tangible depreciable property exclusion and employee costs Claire’s Construction is experimenting with new construction materials that would allow the construction of lighter yet sturdier bridges. The construction of their first bridge involves some eligible R&D as it requires the resolution of scientific or technological uncertainty. Assuming the R&D is successful, Claire’s Construction intends that the bridge be used for commercial transport once it is complete. Under the new amendment, the cost of the scientists and engineers employed by Claire’s Construction to resolve the scientific or technological uncertainty involved in creating the bridge is eligible expenditure for the tax credit. However, Claire’s Construction cannot claim the cost of the workers building the bridge, nor any of the costs of materials or equipment. 80 OTHER AMENDMENTS TO SCHEDULE OF EXCLUDED EXPENDITURE (Clause 60(1), (3), (4) , (5) , (6), (7)) Summary of proposed amendments Various amendments are proposed to schedule 21B, part B of the Income Tax Act 2007, to clarify what expenditure is excluded from the R&D tax credit. Application date The proposed amendments would apply from the beginning of the R&D tax credit scheme, which is the 2019−20 income year (1 April 2019 for most taxpayers). Key features Several additions or changes are proposed to the categories of expenditure ineligible for the R&D tax credit set out in schedule 21B, part B. These are: • Changing the word “purchase” in the existing exclusion on expenditure to purchase land (clause 10) to “acquire”. • Changing the exclusion on professional fees incurred in determining a person’s entitlement to the tax credit (clause 13) to also cover in-house expenditure incurred in determining a person’s entitlement. • Inserting new clause 2B, which excludes expenditure or loss on acquiring property where the property would have been depreciable in the absence of an election to treat it as non-depreciable under section EE 8 of the Income Tax Act 2007. • Inserting new clause 13B, which excludes expenditure or loss incurred in performing corporate governance activities. • Inserting new clause 20B, which excludes expenditure or loss incurred in decommissioning. • Inserting new clause 20C, which excludes expenditure or loss incurred in remediating land. Background Changing “purchase” to “acquire” (clause 10) Clause 10 currently excludes expenditure to purchase land. It is not appropriate to give an R&D tax credit for land acquired for use in R&D for two reasons. The first is that it is difficult to apportion what cost of the land relates to R&D, given the land could be used for non-R&D purposes later. The second reason is that land generally increases in value and therefore can be sold to recoup the cost. This amendment would broaden the scope of clause 10 so that it excludes expenditure to acquire land, rather than merely to purchase it. This is consistent with the policy intent of 81 the original exclusion, which is intended to exclude expenditure on obtaining land regardless of the method used to obtain it. Excluding in-house costs on determining tax credit entitlement (clause 13) Clause 13 currently excludes professional fees incurred in determining a person’s entitlement, or lack of entitlement, to an R&D tax credit. This exclusion covers fees paid to determine the eligibility of a person, activity, or amount of expenditure, such as amounts paid to an accounting firm to prepare a person’s R&D claim. The proposed amendment broadens the scope of clause 13 to cover all expenditure or loss incurred in determining a person’s entitlement to the tax credit by replacing the words “professional fees” with “expenditure or loss.” This is intended to exclude in-house expenditure on determining entitlements, as well as the fees currently targeted by the exclusion. These amounts should be ineligible under current legislation because they do not directly relate to R&D (they do not relate to resolving scientific or technological uncertainty), but the proposed amendment to clause 13 provides explicit legislative guidance that these costs are not eligible for the R&D tax credit. Exclusion of expenditure where election made under section EE 8 (new clause 2B) Proposed new clause 2B excludes expenditure or loss on acquiring an item of property that would have been depreciable in the absence of an election under section EE 8 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The policy intent is that expenditure on the upfront cost of large capital assets generally be ineligible for the credit. Instead, it is intended that depreciation loss on these assets over time be eligible (to the extent the assets are used in R&D), similar to the tax treatment of these assets. Section EE 8 allows a taxpayer to elect that an item of property be treated as non-depreciable property (where, in the absence of this election, it would otherwise be depreciable property) upon acquisition or, in limited circumstances, a change in use. This could potentially allow taxpayers to bypass the exclusions for the upfront cost of depreciable property, and claim the full upfront cost of their property as eligible expenditure. This is contrary to the policy intent. The proposed amendment will ensure the legislation better satisfies the policy intent by excluding expenditure on property that would have been depreciable absent an election under section EE 8. Exclusion of expenditure on corporate governance activities (new clause 13B) Proposed new clause 13B excludes expenditure or loss on performing corporate governance activities. These costs should already be ineligible under current legislation, but the proposed new exclusion is intended to provide certainty and clarity to firms that they cannot claim these costs. These amounts are excluded because they do not directly relate to R&D. They are costs that have to be incurred regardless of whether R&D takes place. Exclusion of decommissioning expenditure (new clause 20B) Proposed new clause 20B excludes expenditure on decommissioning, such as decommissioning plant, structures, and sites. This expenditure, in and of itself, should largely already be excluded from the credit as it is unlikely to relate to resolving scientific or technological uncertainty. The intent of this exclusion is to clarify that expenditure on decommissioning is not eligible for the credit. 82 Note that the exclusion only relates to expenditure on the act of decommissioning itself. Expenditure on R&D relating to decommissioning is potentially eligible for the credit, providing it meets the other eligibility criteria, is an identifiable separate activity, and is incidental to the decommissioning activity. Exclusion of expenditure on remediating land (new clause 20C) Proposed new clause 20C excludes expenditure on remediating land. This expenditure, in and of itself, should largely already be excluded from the credit as it is unlikely to relate to resolving scientific or technological uncertainty. The proposed clause clarifies this by explicitly excluding expenditure on remediating land from the credit. Note again that the exclusion only relates to expenditure on the act of remediating land itself. Expenditure on R&D relating to remediation could still be eligible for the credit, providing it meets the other eligibility criteria, is an identifiable separate activity, and is incidental to the decommissioning activity. 83 CRITERIA AND METHODOLOGIES APPLICATION DUE DATE CHANGE (Clause 76) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment brings forward the due date for submitting an application for criteria and methodologies (CAM) approval to six months before the end of a person’s income year. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from the 2021−22 income year (1 April 2021 for most taxpayers). Key features It is proposed that the CAM due date in section 68CC(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 be amended, so that CAM approval applications must be submitted on or before the last day of the 6th month before the end of the first income year to which the CAM applies (30 September for most taxpayers). Applications submitted after that date will not be considered for the relevant income year. Background From the 2020−21 income year, businesses must obtain either general approval or criteria and methodologies (CAM) approval. Under general approval, a business must apply for approval of each of its core and supporting R&D activities. Businesses which expect to spend more than $2m on R&D in a given year can opt out of general approval and into CAM approval. Under CAM approval, a business instead applies for approval of the criteria and methodologies it uses to determine the eligibility of its R&D activities and expenditure. Currently, CAM approval applications are due after the end of the income year. The amendment proposes amending the due date for applying for CAM approvals, so that these are due six months before the end of the first income year to which a CAM relates (CAM approvals can be obtained for up to three income years). So, for a standard balance date (31 March) claimant in the 2021−22 income year, their year-end would be 31 March 2022, and their CAM approval application would be due on 30 September 2021 under the proposed new due date. This amendment does not require that the CAM approval process be completed by the above due date, only submitted. The proposed earlier due date would ensure businesses have the correct R&D processes and methodologies in place when their R&D is actually occurring (during the relevant income year). This would reduce the need for businesses to have to retrospectively amend their processes and methodologies to ensure their R&D claims are correct. In addition, an earlier due date means businesses would have more time to seek general approval should their CAM approval application be declined (or only cover part of their R&D). This is important, 84 because without general or CAM approval, a person is not eligible for the R&D tax credit regime from the 2020−21 income year. The proposed amendment would apply prospectively from the 2021−22 income year (from 1 April 2021 for most claimants). This would ensure taxpayers (particularly those with early balance dates) intending to apply for CAM approval for the 2020−21 income year have sufficient time to plan for the new due date. 85 MORE TIME TO CONSIDER REQUESTS TO INCREASE R&D CLAIMS (Clause 79) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment would provide the Commissioner with more time to consider section 113 requests to increase claims in a taxpayer’s favour. The current legislation imposes a time bar that prevents the Commissioner from considering requests if more than a year has passed since a taxpayer’s income tax return due date for the relevant year. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from the beginning of the R&D tax credit scheme, which is the 2019−20 income year (1 April 2019 for most taxpayers). Key features It is proposed that section 108(1E) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 be amended to allow the Commissioner to adjust a person’s R&D tax credit claim upwards if the person has made a section 113 request within a year of their income tax return due date. Provided a request is initiated within this timeframe, the Commissioner could consider the request. Background A person can only file a request to increase their R&D tax credit claim once for each R&D tax credit claim they make (section 113E of the Tax Administration Act 1994), whether through a section 113 request or a notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA). A time bar prevents the Commissioner from increasing a person’s R&D tax credit claim if the person fails to make the request to increase their claim within a year of their income tax return due date (section 108(1E)). The legislation currently requires a section 113 request to increase an R&D tax credit claim to be initiated and processed within a year of the relevant taxpayer’s income tax return due date. This is contrary to the policy intent, which is simply that the person must initiate the disputes process within that timeframe. By requiring the request to be processed within that timeframe, the Commissioner may not have enough time to fully consider requests. This proposed legislative amendment would remove the requirement that the request be fully processed within that timeframe, while still requiring the request be initiated within a year of the relevant taxpayer’s income tax return due date. This would make the time bar which applies to section 113 requests consistent with the rules that apply for NOPAs, which were amended by the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans and Remedial Matters) Act 2020 in a similar way. The proposed amendment would ensure the Commissioner has enough time to consider requests consistent with the policy intent. 86 CONFIRMING HOUSING NEW ZEALAND BUILD LIMITED SUBJECT TO INCOME TAX (Clause 63) Summary of proposed amendment The proposal is to add Housing New Zealand Build Limited, a subsidiary of Kāinga Ora – Homes and Communities, to the schedule of state enterprises in the Income Tax Act 2007, to confirm that it is subject to income tax. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from 23 May 2018, when Housing New Zealand Build Limited was incorporated. Key features Schedule 36, part A of the Income Tax Act 2007 would be amended. Background The Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Act 2020 updated the list of state enterprises in schedule 36 of the Income Tax Act 2007 to replace Housing Zealand Corporation with Kāinga – Homes and Communities. This change simply reflected that Kāinga Ora had absorbed the functions of Housing Zealand Corporation and like the Corporation, is subject to income tax. In the absence of being listed in schedule 36, Kāinga Ora, as a statutory entity, would be exempt from income tax. Interpretative advice received by officials is that Kāinga Ora’s subsidiaries should also be listed in schedule 36. Therefore, a further amendment to schedule 36 is proposed to similarly confirm that its subsidiary, Housing New Zealand Build Limited, is also subject to income tax. This is not a change in tax status as the company is already being treated as taxable. Kāinga Ora’s other current subsidiary, Housing New Zealand Limited, is already listed in schedule 36. 87 CHANGING THE DUE DATE FOR LOCKED-IN PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT ENTITIES (Clauses 70, 71, 72 and 75) Summary of proposed amendment The Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Act 2020 introduced a year-end square-up of the tax on income from multi-rate portfolio investment entities (PIEs) for natural persons. This PIE tax square-up happens alongside the year-end process for income tax. The result of the square-up is applied to the person’s end-of-year income tax position, resulting in one overall tax refund or bill, if any. The proposed amendment brings forward the filing due date by which multi-rate PIEs that are a superannuation fund or retirement savings scheme are required to file detailed income information for their investors to 15 May, to align with that of other multi-rate PIEs. Application date The proposed amendment would apply retrospectively from the 2020−21 income year to align with the application date of the new PIE rules, with the first filing due date under the change being 15 May 2021. Key features The proposed amendment would bring forward the date by which multi-rate PIEs that are a superannuation fund or retirement savings scheme are required to file detailed income information for their investors each year to 15 May, to align with the filing due date of other multi-rate PIEs. Detailed analysis The Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Act 2020 amended the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 to provide for a year-end square- up of the tax on income from multi-rate PIEs for natural persons. This PIE tax square-up happens at the same time as the year-end process for income tax. The result of the square- up is applied to the person’s end-of-year income tax position, resulting in one overall tax refund or bill if any. For individuals who only have reportable income, 10 the year-end process for tax on PIE income is an automated process at the same time as the auto-calculation process for income tax. However, currently section 25K of the Tax Administration Act 1994 requires multi-rate PIEs that are a superannuation fund or retirement savings scheme to file the detailed income 10 Reportable income is income that Inland Revenue receives regular information about, typically from third- party payers such as employers. It is defined in section 22D(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 for the purposes of this Act and the Income Tax Act 2007. 88 information for their investors by 30 June each year, whereas all other PIEs are required to file the information by 15 May each year under section 25J. This would mean that the income tax auto-calculation process including any amount resulting from the PIE tax square-up in future would have to be run much later (after 30 June) after Inland Revenue receives the PIE income details for the investors. This would affect a considerable number of individuals, as the 30 June due date applies to KiwiSaver PIEs. The proposed amendment brings forward the filing due date for multi-rate PIEs that are a superannuation fund or retirement savings scheme from 30 June to 15 May to align with that of other multi-rate PIEs. This would avoid a delay to the year-end income tax auto- calculation process for a large number of individuals under the new PIE tax square-up. 89 PIE INVESTOR INTEREST EXEMPTION FOR LINES TRUSTS (Clause 61) Summary of proposed amendment The Bill proposes to add lines trusts to schedule 29, part A of the Income Tax Act 2007. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from the date of enactment. Key feature It is proposed that lines trusts would be able to own up to one hundred percent of a PIE without the PIE breaching its minimum number of investor or maximum investor interest requirements. Background A lines trust is an existing defined term used in the associated persons rules. This definition covers trusts established under the Energy Companies Act 1992 or the Southland Electricity Act 1993. These lines trusts are commonly referred to as energy consumer trusts. The Bill proposes to add lines trusts to schedule 29, part A of the Income Tax Act 2007. This will allow lines trusts to own up to 100 percent of a PIE without the PIE breaching their minimum number of investor or maximum investor interest requirements, which are normally 20 investors and no investor with more than twenty percent respectively. A lines trust invests for the benefit of electricity customers and communities within its local area. Its holding of a majority interest in a PIE is therefore equivalent to the PIE itself being widely held. Schedule 29 part A already includes a number of similar vehicles, including local authorities and the New Zealand Superannuation Fund. 90 CUSTODIAL INSTITUTIONS: APPLICATION OF DEFINITION TO FIXED ESTABLISHMENTS (Clauses 56 and 73) Summary of proposed amendment An amendment is proposed to the definition of a “custodial institution” to ensure that custodians whose New Zealand operation is a fixed establishment of a non-resident entity is able to access the investment income withholding and reporting obligations as intended. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from 1 April 2020. Background Custodial institutions act as a conduit between the payer of investment income and the ultimate owner of that income. Changes to clarify the investment income withholding and reporting obligations imposed on custodians were introduced by the Taxation (KiwiSaver and Student Loans) Act 2020 with effect from 1 April 2020. The rules also provide relaxations to the strict requirements of the withholding and reporting rules. Only entities which meet the definition of a custodial institution may access the specific reporting and withholding rules for custodians. In order to meet the definition, a custodial institution must be able to show that its activities are regulated or supervised under New Zealand’s laws, or similar overseas laws. The applicable law will depend on whether the custodian is resident in New Zealand or in another jurisdiction. Some custodians operate their New Zealand business by way of a fixed establishment in New Zealand. The overseas entity may meet the definition of a non-resident custodial institution, but the New Zealand fixed establishment is excluded from the non-resident limb of the definition of a custodial institution. This is because although a fixed establishment is not a resident in New Zealand for tax purposes, its activities are regulated under New Zealand’s financial markets legislation. The exclusion of fixed establishments from the non-resident limb of the test means that those custodial institutions which use this business model are unable to access the relaxations available to other custodians. This outcome is contrary to the policy intent. 91 CUSTODIAL INSTITUTIONS: NON-RESIDENT WITHHOLDING TAX OBLIGATION (Clause 56) Summary of proposed amendment Custodial institutions may be required to withhold resident withholding tax (RWT) or non- resident withholding tax (NRWT) when they pay or transfer investment income to the end investor. Rules which provide a framework for the withholding obligation were introduced by the Taxation (KiwiSaver and Student Loans) Act 2020, with effect from 1 April 2020. The obligation to withhold currently refers to RWT only. The exclusion of NRWT was inadvertent. Officials propose an amendment to clarify that custodial institutions should withhold RWT or NRWT as applicable. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from 1 April 2020. 92 BENEFICIARIES AS SETTLORS (Clause 43) Summary of proposed amendment This amendment would ensure that if, at the end of an income year, a beneficiary of a trust is owed more than $25,000 by the trustee and interest has not been paid on this amount at the prescribed or market rate, then the beneficiary will become a settlor of the trust. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from 1 April 2020. Key features Under section HC 27(6), if a trustee of a trust owes an amount to a beneficiary of the trust, the beneficiary will not become a settlor of the trust if the amount owed at the end of the income year is $25,000 or less or the beneficiary is paid interest on the amount at a rate equal to the prescribed rate of interest or the market rate. New section HC 27(2)(bb) clarifies that a beneficiary that is owed money by a trust will always become a settlor if they do not meet the requirements of subsection (6). As such, a beneficiary that is owed more than $25,000 on which interest has not been paid at the prescribed or market rate will become a settlor of the trust. Background A settlor of a trust is typically someone that transfers value to the trust. As such, a beneficiary of a trust may become a settlor if they are owed money by the trustee and are not paid interest on this amount at the prescribed or market rate of interest. Being a settlor of a trust has consequences for a person in a number of areas, including for social assistance and student loan repayments. As such, an amendment was made in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019 to clarify that beneficiaries only owed small amounts by the trustee ($25,000 or less) would not become settlors regardless of whether they were paid interest. This amendment was clarified further in the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Act 2020 and has applied since 1 April 2020. It was always intended that beneficiaries owed more than $25,000 on which interest has not been paid would become settlors of the trust. However, a beneficiary owed more than $25,000 on which interest has not been paid may not become a settlor if they do not have sufficient knowledge of the amount they are owed or how it is being used by the trustee. While the Commissioner of Inland Revenue can determine the amount owed to a beneficiary and whether interest is being paid, it can be difficult for the Commissioner to ascertain the beneficiary’s level of knowledge. Therefore, the Bill proposes to amend the definition of a settlor so that a beneficiary owed more than $25,000 by the trustee on which adequate interest has not been paid, is deemed to be a settlor of a trust, regardless of their level of knowledge. 93 SETTLOR OF A TRUST MIGRATING TO NEW ZEALAND (Clauses 41 and 44) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendments confirm that where a settlor of a trust has migrated to New Zealand, a trustee of the trust may distribute accumulated trustee income to a beneficiary as exempt income. The amendments apply if the trustee has satisfied their New Zealand tax obligations for world-wide trustee income in either of the following circumstances: • for an assessment of tax on world-wide trustee income arising under a voluntary disclosure; or • for an assessment of tax on world-wide trustee income arising under an election to pay tax on world-wide trustee income. Application date The proposed amendments would apply as follows: • for a voluntary disclosure made on, before or after 23 March 2020; and • for an election made under section HC 33, from 23 March 2020. Key features The proposed amendments would apply for a trust of which a settlor has migrated to New Zealand and: • has not made an election to pay tax on world-wide trustee income within a prescribed period; but • has taken steps under either the voluntary disclosure rules or the voluntary election rules to pay tax on world-wide trustee income for past years after the prescribed period has ended. Voluntary disclosure Under the voluntary disclosure process, New Zealand tax (including penalties and interest) has been assessed and paid for the earlier period or periods to which the voluntary disclosure relates. In this circumstance, the intent of the voluntary disclosure rules is that a distribution from tax-paid accumulated trustee income for those past years is exempt to a beneficiary. However, it is possible that such a distribution may still be taxed at 45% under current law. The proposed amendment would ensure the law works as intended with effect from 1 April 2008 to protect tax positions assessed under such voluntary disclosures. 94 Voluntary election A settlor of a foreign trust that migrates to New Zealand may elect to pay New Zealand tax on worldwide trustee income from a specified date. The main benefit of making this election is that there is no additional layer of tax when the tax-paid trustee income is distributed to a beneficiary. If this election is not made, distributions from the trust to a beneficiary may be taxed at 45%. Under recent amendments, it is now clear that a trust of which a settlor has migrated to New Zealand within the previous four years may make a retrospective election to pay New Zealand tax on up to four years of earlier worldwide trustee income. However, it is unclear if this election results in an additional layer of tax when this trustee income is distributed to beneficiaries. The proposed amendment would ensure that distributions to beneficiaries from New Zealand-taxed worldwide trustee income is tax free. Background Voluntary disclosure The voluntary disclosure rules permit the Commissioner to assess tax on past incorrect tax positions that have been voluntarily disclosed to Inland Revenue. A purpose of the voluntary disclosure rules is to allow the taxpayer to “put right” their past tax position, subject to appropriate penalties and interest being imposed. The definition of complying trust in the Income Tax Act 2007 does not currently address the voluntary disclosure situation for an assessment made under voluntary disclosure for a trust of which a settlor has migrated to New Zealand and had not elected to pay tax on world- wide trustee income. The proposed amendment would confirm that a trust of this nature that has made a voluntary disclosure and satisfied the related New Zealand tax obligations can be a complying trust for those periods to which the voluntary disclosure relates. An election under section HC 33 Recent amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 clarified that an election may be made to pay tax on worldwide trustee income, and this may be retrospective for up to four earlier years. However, the effects of this election for a trust of which a settlor has migrated to New Zealand did not explicitly ensure that a retrospective election can result in distribution of accumulated trustee income being exempt income for the beneficiary. The proposed amendment would achieve this intended effect. 95 NOMINEE TREATMENT FOR TRUSTEE OF EXEMPT EMPLOYEE SHARE SCHEME (Clause 10) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment to section CE 6 of the Income Tax Act 2007 clarifies that a trustee of an exempt employee share scheme (ESS) can be treated as a nominee of the company providing the scheme. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from the date of enactment. Key features Section CE 6 is amended so that a trustee is treated as the nominee of a company to the extent that the trustee’s activities relate to an ESS or an exempt ESS (and as long as the other criteria of the section are met). Background Under section CE 6, if a trustee carries out activities related to a company’s ESS, and shares or related rights are issued or transferred under the ESS, the trustee is treated as the nominee of the company to the extent of those activities. As a nominee, the trustee acts for the company and is therefore treated the same way the company would be treated if the company were carrying out the ESS activities. This prevents tax being triggered when shares and other rights are passed between the trustee and company in legal terms but there is no substance to the transactions because the trustee is performing the role of the company itself. Under the current wording of section CE 6, a trustee is only treated as a nominee to the extent that its activities relate to an “employee share scheme”. An “exempt employee share scheme” is not an “employee share scheme” (section CE 7(b)(i)). There is no policy reason why, in this context, a trustee of an exempt ESS should not be treated the same way for tax purposes as the trustee of an ESS. The only difference between taxable schemes and exempt schemes is that exempt schemes allow the employer to grant tax-exempt share scheme benefits. This should not have a bearing on the tax treatment of a trustee administering the scheme on the company’s behalf. Therefore, the proposed amendment extends nominee treatment to trustees of exempt ESSs. 96 DISPOSAL OF COMPANY’S OWN SHARES BY EMPLOYEE SHARE SCHEME TRUSTEE (Clause 13) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment to section CW 58 of the Income Tax Act 2007 clarifies that if a trustee of an employee share scheme (ESS), while acting as a nominee for the company offering the scheme, disposes of shares the company holds in itself (“treasury stock”), any income the trustee derives from the disposal is exempt. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from the date of enactment. Key features Amended section CW 58 includes an explicit reference to section CE 6 (Trusts are nominees). If a company disposes of its own shares as the result of the application of section CE 6 – that is, through a trustee nominee – any income the trustee derives from the disposal is exempt. Background Under section CW 58, if a company disposes of its own shares, having acquired them without cancelling them, any income the company derives from that disposal is exempt. This is because the disposal is a partial transfer of ownership of the company to shareholders, not a sale that produces any economic gain or loss. A company that offers an ESS may nominate a trustee to carry out activities related to the scheme, such as holding shares on trust for employees, transferring shares to employees, or reacquiring shares from employees if the company wishes to hold them as treasury stock. As a nominee of the company under section CE 6, the trustee effectively acts as the company, and should therefore be treated in that capacity the same way the company would be treated. Since income derived by a company from disposing of its own shares is exempt, income derived by a trustee from disposing of the company’s shares while acting in its capacity as nominee of the company should also be exempt. However, the current wording of section CW 58 does not explicitly contemplate the possibility of a trustee nominee. Consequently, the section could be interpreted as not exempting that trustee income. The proposed amendment to section CW 58 resolves this ambiguity by including a reference to section CE 6. 97 USE OF PRE-CONSOLIDATION IMPUTATION CREDITS (Clauses 48 to 51) Summary of proposed amendment This amendment clarifies that the use of pre-consolidation imputation credits by a consolidated imputation group (CIG) is consistent with the use of pre-amalgamation imputation credits by an amalgamated company and the use of imputation credits by an individual company, which is on a first-in first-out (FIFO) basis. Under the proposed legislation, a CIG is permitted to use pre-consolidation imputation credits of individual member companies (group companies) before using group credits, as long as shareholder continuity requirements are met. Application date The proposed amendment would apply for the 2008−09 and later income years. Key features Amended section OP 22 applies when: • a CIG has an imputation debit (normally because a group company is paying a dividend and wishes to attach imputation credits); • a group company has an imputation credit balance (pre-consolidation imputation credits); and • the group company’s credit balance existed before the CIG’s debit arose. The CIG may make an election to transfer some or all of the credit balance in a group company’s imputation credit account (ICA) to the ICA of the group. This election is made by a nominated company recording the amount of the credit balance transferred as a debit in the group company’s ICA (under section OB 52), and as a credit in the group’s ICA. Three restrictions apply: • The CIG and the group company must meet the shareholder continuity requirements for the carrying forward of imputation credits until the end of the day on which the debit arises in the group ICA (section OA 8). • Credits of the group and all group companies must be used to reduce the debit in the order in which the credits arose (FIFO). • The amount of credits that can be transferred from group companies to the group is limited to the amount of the imputation debit to the group’s ICA. 98 Background The Commissioner’s view and practice is that current section OP 22 and its corresponding provisions in earlier legislation have always required a CIG to exhaust all its group imputation credits before it can draw on the pre-consolidation credits of the individual group companies. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 16, No 1 (February 2004) explained the policy and practice for the use of pre-consolidation imputation credits for CIGs: As with the original consolidation provisions, the existing pre-consolidation balances of the members’ individual imputation credit accounts are not transferred to the imputation group’s consolidated imputation credit account, but continue to remain separate until such time as the imputation credit account of the imputation group has a debit to its account which it cannot offset by an existing credit within the group ICA. This view has been contested by stakeholders from the private sector, who have argued that: • the general legislative framework for individual companies requires imputation credits to be used on a FIFO basis; • imputation credits of an amalgamated company include the pre-amalgamation credits of amalgamating companies and these may be used on a FIFO basis; and • there is no policy reason to depart from this principle when addressing the use of pre- consolidation imputation credits by a CIG. Detailed analysis Under the proposed amendment to section OP 22, a CIG may use pre-consolidation imputation credit balances in a group company’s ICA before it uses group credits. This means that imputation credits generally will be used on a FIFO basis, which is in line with the wider imputation framework. To be used by the CIG, the pre-consolidation imputation credit balance of the group company must exist at the date of the debit to the group ICA (so shareholder continuity must be satisfied for the amount to be transferred). The amount of the credit balance that can be transferred from group companies to the group is limited to the amount of the group’s imputation debit. This is because, when an imputation credit is transferred from a group company’s ICA to the CIG’s ICA, the date for the credit becomes the day of the credit transfer, rather than the day the tax was paid. Consequently, if the credit transfer were not limited to the CIG’s debit, credits could be carried forward that would (and should) otherwise have been extinguished due to changes in shareholder continuity calculated by reference to the date the credit originally arose. 99 COMPULSORY ZERO-RATING OF COMMERCIAL LAND LEASES (Clause 88) Remedial amendments are proposed to ensure that the compulsory zero-rating rules that apply to leases of land work as intended. All section references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. Remedial amendment to section 11(8D)(a) to remove “paragraph (b) does not apply” Summary of proposed amendment An amendment is proposed to section 11(8D)(a) to ensure that all assignments or surrenders of a lease agreement for land that meet the criteria in section 11(1)(mb) 11 are zero-rated. Application date The proposed amendment would apply retrospectively from 30 June 2014, being the date that amended section 11(8D) came into force under the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2016–17, Closely Held Companies, and Remedial Matters) Act 2017. However, as there may be instances where the relevant supplies were standard-rated, a savings provision is proposed to preserve tax positions taken under the existing section 11(8D)(a) prior to the proposed amendments being enacted. Background Section 11(8D)(a) ensures that lease assignments and surrenders are subject to compulsory zero-rating if they meet the requirements of section 11(1)(mb). Section 11(8D)(a) was amended in 2017, by inserting the words “and paragraph (b) does not apply” at the end of paragraph (a). This addition has significantly changed the scope of section 11(8D)(a). The change was unintended and was not referred to in any of the guidance materials. The effect of the 2017 change seems to be that only assignments or surrenders of leases that have failed the 25 percent bright-line test in section 11(8D)(b) will be zero-rated (as opposed to all leases that met the section 11(1)(mb) criteria). Assignments or surrenders of leases that have not failed the bright-line test would be standard-rated (subject to GST at 15%). The proposed amendment would delete the reference to “and paragraph (b) does not apply” in section 11(8D)(a). This would achieve the original policy intent which is that all assignments or surrenders of a lease agreement for land that meet the criteria in section 11(1)(mb) should be zero-rated. 11 This section provides, in broad terms, that a supply of land between registered persons used for the intention of making taxable supplies is zero-rated for GST purposes. 100 Zero-rating business assets when a business is sold and the vendor’s lease is transferred or the vendor arranges a new lease Summary of proposed amendments Amendments are proposed to sections 11(8D)(a), (ab), (b) and (c) to clarify that, in the context of business sales, that involve a zero-rated supply relating to land leases under these provisions, any business assets that are transferred as part of that same supply or arrangement should also be zero-rated. The proposed amendments insert references to “the supply wholly or partly consists of” and “the arrangement wholly or partly consists of”. This replicates the opening words of section 11(1)(mb) which refers to “the supply wholly or partly consists of land.” Application date The proposed amendments would apply retrospectively from 30 June 2014, being the date that amended section 11(8D) came into force under the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2016–17, Closely Held Companies, and Remedial Matters) Act 2017. However, as there may be instances where the relevant supplies were standard-rated, a savings provision is proposed to preserve tax positions taken under the existing section 11(8D) before the proposed amendments are enacted. Background When a registered person sells a business which includes land and other assets to another registered person, the zero-rating of land rules will zero-rate both the supply of land and the other business assets. This is achieved by section 11(1)(mb) referring to “the supply wholly or partly consists of land”. Alternatively, the sale of the business may be zero-rated as a going concern under section 11(1)(m). The policy intent was that because the transfer of a commercial lease could be economically equivalent to a transfer of land, these transfers should also be zero-rated and should produce similar GST outcomes. So any business assets that are transferred as part of the same overall arrangement as the transfer of a lease should also be zero-rated supplies. However, there is uncertainty as to whether the current section 11(8D) achieves this intended policy outcome. Some taxpayers or practitioners may consider that the rules in section 11(8D) which apply to certain lease arrangements have a limited scope so that they only zero-rate the supply of the lease procurement or arranging services. This approach could mean that, in the context of a business sale, if a vendor (previous lessee) supplies other business assets to a purchaser (new lessee) alongside the services in section 11(8D), these business assets may potentially be regarded as a separate, standard-rated supply subject to GST at 15%. Standard-rating the business assets in these circumstances would represent aa different GST outcome to similar business sales where land was supplied or if an entire business was sold and zero-rated as a going concern. In both of these cases, the supplies of the business assets would be zero-rated. Amendments are therefore proposed to sections 11(8D)(a), (ab), (b) and (c) to clarify that, in the context of business sales, that involve a zero-rated supply relating to land leases under 101 these provisions, any business assets that are transferred as part of that same supply or arrangement should also be zero-rated. Lease is cancelled by lessor, but lessee helps arrange a new lease for a new lessee Summary of proposed amendment An amendment to section 11(8D)(c) is proposed so compulsory zero-rating will apply when a lease is cancelled by the lessor and the previous lessee arranges a new lease for a new lessee. Currently, section 11(8D)(c) only applies if the lessee cancels the lease and then provides this service. Application date The proposed amendments would apply retrospectively from 30 June 2014, being the date that amended section 11(8D) came into force under the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2016–17, Closely Held Companies, and Remedial Matters) Act 2017. However, as there may be instances where the relevant supplies were standard-rated, a savings provision is proposed to preserve tax positions taken under the existing section 11(8D)(c) before the proposed amendment is enacted. Background Under current law, section 11(8D)(c) applies in the context of a business sale to zero-rate the service of arranging a new lease when the old lease is surrendered by the lessee. However, the law currently doesn’t apply compulsory zero-rating to similar scenarios when the lessor has cancelled the lease. An amendment is required to ensure that the service of arranging a new lease will be zero-rated in both situations. This accords with the policy intent which is that the same GST outcome (zero-rating) should arise regardless of whether the old lease was surrendered by the lessee (tenant) or cancelled by the lessor (landlord). 102 CLARIFYING THAT DIVIDENDS ARE DERIVED ON A CASH BASIS (Clause 9) Summary of proposed amendment This is a minor amendment to clarify that a cash dividend (a dividend other than a non-cash dividend) is allocated to the income year in which the person receives it. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from the 2020−21 income year. Key features Dividends paid in money are assessable on a cash basis and not on an accrual basis. Detailed analysis This issue was raised in a “Questions We’ve Been Asked” item: When is income from a cash dividend paid on ordinary shares derived? The draft answer was that for shareholders accounting for tax on an accrual basis, the dividend will be derived when a debt in their favour is established. When the draft was sent out for comment, feedback was that the draft answer was not in line with general practice. Currently, dividends paid in money are assessable on a cash or accrual basis (depending on which best reflects the taxpayer’s income). Many external stakeholders consider that dividends paid in money should only be assessable on a cash basis. Allowing this would simplify filing, reduce compliance costs, and better align with other legal requirements. The proposed amendment would add a subsection to section CD 1 stating that cash dividend (a dividend other than a non-cash dividend) income is allocated to the income year in which the person receives it. This does not change when the dividend is derived, but affects when the income is allocated. 103 NON-RESIDENT CONTRACTORS’ TAX (Clause 54) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment clarifies that when a non-resident contractor seeks an exemption from income tax for a payment, they must show that the amount derived from that payment is not “assessable income”. The section previously required them to show that the payment was not “income”. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from the date of enactment. Background This amendment relates to non-resident contractors who perform or supply services or property in New Zealand, such as someone who travels to New Zealand to provide IT services on a short-term basis to a local company. However, due to their limited links to New Zealand, there is a risk of revenue loss – the contractor may not be aware of, or comply with, New Zealand tax laws. For that reason, income received by contractors is ordinarily subject to PAYE. A contractor may apply to the Commissioner for an exemption from PAYE under section RD 24 of the Income Tax Act 2007, as long as one or more conditions are met. Under section RD 24(1)(a) the contractor must show that the payment is not “income” and therefore no tax is payable on it. Typically, this will be because a double tax agreement exempts the payment from tax. Arguably, a payment will be income even if it is not subject to tax. The previous formulation of the test required the contractor to demonstrate that the “income derived” was not “subject to income tax”. 12 The change to “income” was unintended. The amendment confirms that the correct test is “assessable income”. This change will clarify that Inland Revenue does not seek to withhold tax from payments to contractors if no tax is ultimately due. 12 Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979, cl 5(1A)(a). 104 RESTRICTED TRANSFER PRICING: THIRD PARTY TEST FOR EXOTIC FEATURES (Clause 39) Summary of proposed amendment The third-party test in section GC 18 allows exotic features (such as subordination or terms longer than five years) in cross-border related borrowing if those features are present in significant third-party borrowing. This test effectively treats all debt other than borrowing from associated persons as third-party debt. However, cross-border related borrowing is wider than associated persons including funding such as from a non-resident owning body or a back-to-back loan. The Bill proposes to amend the test so that cross border related borrowing that is not from an associated person cannot be used to justify an exotic feature of related party debt. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from 1 July 2018 to align with the introduction of the restricted transfer pricing rules. However, a savings provision is proposed to apply for any taxpayer that has filed a return under the existing rules before the introduction of the Bill. Key features There are 12 instances of “associated persons” in section GC 18(5), (7), (8) and (9). The Bill proposes to amend each of these references so that, in these provisions, cross-border related borrowing is treated consistent with loans from an associated person. For the avoidance of doubt, these proposals do not affect which loans are covered by the restricted transfer pricing rules, which continue to apply to cross-border related borrowing. Detailed analysis Section GC 18(3) provides a list of features that cannot be included when pricing cross- border related borrowing. However, there is an exception to this restriction so that these features can still be included if they are also present in significant third-party debt. If a feature is present in significant third-party debt this supports there being a commercial reason for the feature’s existence. However, the definition of a cross-border related borrowing includes loans made by lenders that are not associated with the borrower. The definition of cross-border related borrowing is in section GC 6(3B). Associated persons are covered by section GC 6(3B)(a)(i) but there are additional categories in section GC 6(3B)(a)(ii) to (iv). 105 The consequence of the current law is that a cross-border related borrowing that is not from an associated lender is included in the category of loans from non-associates that determines whether exotic terms can be included in that cross-border related borrowing. This creates two issues when a group has lending that is cross-border related borrowing that is not from an associated person: • The features of that loan partially or fully determine the appropriate features of that same loan. • The features of a loan within the control of people controlling the borrower are included within a third-party test to determine appropriate exotic features. 106 THIN CAPITALISATION REMEDIALS (Clauses 34, 35 and 36) Summary of proposed amendment The Bill proposes three remedial amendments to the thin capitalisation rules. These amendments would: • remove certain New Zealand resident trusts from the inbound thin capitalisation rules when the only reason they were included was because a New Zealand resident settlor is associated with a non-resident company or trust; • introduce a separate formula for calculating apportionment of interest by an excess debt entity controlled by a non-resident owning body or trustee; and • update a cross-reference as a consequential amendment to one made in the Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Act 2018. Application date The first two proposed amendments would apply from the date of enactment. The updated cross-reference would apply for income years starting on or after 1 July 2018 to align with the original amendment in the Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Act 2018. Key features Inbound thin cap scope Proposed new section FE 2(4B) would treat a New Zealand resident as not being associated with certain non-resident companies or trusts when determining whether a trust has been settled by a non-resident or an associated person of a non-resident. This means a New Zealand trust with a New Zealand resident settlor will not be subject to the inbound thin capitalisation rules just because that New Zealand resident settlor also has an interest in a non-resident company or trust. Interest apportionment formula Proposed new section FE 6(3B) and (3C) introduces a new formula for calculating the income of an excess debt entity that is controlled by a non-resident owning body or trustee. For these entities this proposed formula will apply instead of the existing formula in section FE 6(2). Consequential to this is a change to sections FE 6(4) and (5). These subsections allow an excess debt entity with income calculated under the formula in section FE 6(2) to allocate that income to another member of their group up to the amount of interest that member has incurred. Proposed changes to section FE 6(4) and (5) will continue this position for income calculated under proposed section FE 6(3B), except that the amount able to be allocated will be limited to interest on debt owed to related parties. 107 Cross-reference Section FE 12(2) sets the requirements for a worldwide group when the debt percentage of the New Zealand group is more than sixty percent, as described in section FE 5(1)(a), or seventy five percent, as described in section FE 5(1)(b). The Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Act 2018 introduced section FE 5(1)(ab) for worldwide groups given by section FE 31D. However, it did not update the reference in section FE 12(2). The Bill proposes to update section FE 12(2) by replacing the reference to section FE 5(1)(a) with a reference to section FE 5(1)(a) and (ab) so the worldwide group requirements apply correctly to these groups. Detailed analysis Inbound thin capitalisation scope A trust is subject to the inbound thin capitalisation rules if it satisfies section FE 2(1)(d)(i). This occurs when fifty percent or more of the value of settlements on the trust are made by a non-resident or a person associated with a non-resident. Existing section FE 2(4)(b) treats a New Zealand resident as not being associated with a non- resident relative for the purpose of section FE 2(1)(d)(i), provided that the non-resident has not also made a settlement on the trust. For example, a family trust will not be subject to the thin capitalisation rules just because the New Zealand resident settlor has a sibling who lives outside New Zealand, unless that sibling has also made a settlement on the trust. Proposed section FE 2(4B) extends this treatment. It provides that for the purpose of the inbound thin capitalisation rules, a New Zealand resident settlor will not be associated with a non-resident company they have made an investment in, or a non-resident trust they have made a settlement on, unless that non-resident entity has also made a settlement on the New Zealand trust. The intention of this amendment is to carve out trusts with New Zealand resident settlors that are currently only subject to thin capitalisation because the settlor is associated with a non-resident if that non-resident has no investment in or control over the trust. Interest apportionment formula Since the extension of the thin capitalisation rules to groups controlled by a non-resident owning body from 1 April 2015, the thin capitalisation limit for these groups has been the greater of a sixty percent debt percentage or a percentage 13 of their debt with unrelated parties. The principle is that the thin capitalisation rules should not limit deductibility of debt paid by such groups to unrelated lenders. If the thin capitalisation debt percentage threshold is breached, income is derived by applying the formula in section FE 6(2). This formula essentially calculates the proportion of allowable debt then multiplies this proportion by total deductible interest. While this works correctly for the usual case – when there is no distinction between debt owed to related parties and unrelated parties – if it is applied to a group controlled by a non-resident owning 13 This percentage was originally 110% but was reduced to 100% by the Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Act 2018 with effect from income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. 108 body it implicitly assumes that the same interest rate applies to both related-party debt and unrelated-party debt. This will often not be the case, for example because the related-party debt and unrelated- party debt were entered into at different times. In these circumstances interest that should be deductible (because it is paid to unrelated lenders) can be disallowed, or interest that should be disallowed (because it is paid to related lenders and the sixty percent debt threshold is exceeded) can remain deductible. The Bill proposes a new formula that generates an amount of income to the extent that interest is paid to related parties on debt that is above the sixty percent threshold. This formula is: (related interest − mismatch + FRD2) × total debt – concession total debt × group NZ debt percentage − 60% (group NZ debt percentage − group world debt percentage) This formula essentially multiplies pre-thin capitalisation deductible related-party interest by the proportion of total debt not eligible for the on-lending concession and by the proportion of related-party debt that is deductible under the thin capitalisation rules. The individual terms in the formula can be described as: • Related interest is the equivalent of total deduction in existing section FE 6(3)(a), except it is limited to debt with counterparties that would be excluded from the worldwide group under existing section FE 18(3B). • FRD2 is the equivalent of FRD in existing section FE 6(3)(ab), except it is limited to fixed-rate foreign equity or fixed-rate shares that would be excluded from the worldwide group under existing section FE 18(3B) if that section applied to fixed rate foreign equity or fixed-rate shares instead of just financial arrangements. • Group NZ debt percentage is the total debt percentage and is identical to the group debt percentage in existing section FE 6(3)(d). • Group world debt percentage is the debt percentage for debt with counterparties that would not be excluded under existing section FE 18(3B). • Mismatch, total debt and concession are worded identically to the equivalent term in existing section FE 6(3)(aba), (b) and (c) respectively. 109 NRFAI DEFERRAL CALCULATION FORMULA CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENT (Clause 57) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment to section RF 2C(6)(a) of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) would ensure the non-resident financial arrangement income (NRFAI) deferral calculation formula cannot produce an undefined outcome as a consequence of the insertion of the “hybrid deductions” item in this formula. Application date The proposed amendment would apply for income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. This would align the application date for the amendment with that of the relevant sections in the Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Act 2018. Background The NRFAI rules address situations where there is a sufficient degree of deferral between deductions and payments under a financial arrangement between associated parties so that non-resident withholding tax should be imposed on an accrual basis, rather than a cash basis. This ensures there is better matching between deductions for the borrower and the imposition of non-resident withholding tax on the lender. The Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Act 2018 inserted the “hybrid deduction” item in the NRFAI deferral calculation formula in section RF 2C(4) of the ITA. This amendment ensures that expenditure for which a deduction is denied under the hybrid mismatch rules in subpart FH of the ITA, is not taken into account in determining whether a loan gives rise to NRFAI. However, as a consequence of this change it is possible for the NRFAI deferral calculation formula to produce an undefined outcome. This would occur if a borrower is denied deductions for all of their relevant expenditure by the hybrid mismatch rules, resulting in a zero denominator in the NRFAI deferral calculation formula. Section RF 2C(6)(a) of the ITA currently specifies that if the deferral calculation formula item “accumulated accruals” results in a zero denominator NRFAI will not arise. However, this rule has not been updated to take in to account the “hybrid deduction” item in the calculation of the denominator. The proposed amendment would address this gap. 110 FERTILISER COSTS (Clause 21) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment clarifies the position for a taxpayer who wishes to spread a tax deduction for fertiliser costs over one to four years under section EJ 3(5) of the Income Tax Act 2007. The proposed amendment provides the notice requirements of section EJ 3(5) will be considered satisfied when the taxpayer files their tax return on that basis. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from the 2020−21 income year. Background Section EJ 3 currently allows taxpayers to spread the cost of fertiliser over one to four years. This attempts to align the cost of fertiliser with the benefits provided by it, and is known as the “spreading” method. The section requires the taxpayer to provide “notice” to the Commissioner that they are using the spreading method but does not specifically state what form that notice should take. Detailed analysis The problem with the current law is that it does not specify what constitutes “notice” for the purposes of section EJ 3(5). While section 14B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 does contain some guidance on what forms notification can take, it doesn’t specifically assist with the fertiliser spreading notice. The preference under self-assessment is to allow taxpayers to provide notice by filing their return of income for the year in which the election is made. Under the proposed amendment, doing this would satisfy the notice requirement of section EJ 3. 111 APPLICATION OF THE MINORS’ INCOME TAX EXEMPTION TO MINOR BENEFICIARY INCOME (Clause 12) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment would clarify that beneficiary income of a minor is not exempt income under the minors’ income tax exemption rule in section CW 55BB of the Income Tax Act 2007. Application date The proposed amendments would apply from 29 May 2012, this being the original start date of the minors’ income tax exemption. A savings provision will apply for people who took a tax position relying on the current law in a return filed before this Bill was introduced into Parliament. Key features Proposed new section CW 55BB(2)(a)(iiib) would provide that income derived by a beneficiary of a trust who is a minor does not qualify for the income tax exemption in section CW 55BB (the minors’ income tax exemption). This amendment would address the current gap in the law which allows minor beneficiaries to access the tax exemption, despite trustees being in a position to pay tax on their behalf. Background Referred to as the minors’ income tax exemption, section CW 55BB provides school children with an income tax exemption on income up to $2,340 each year which is not taxed at source (such as money for mowing a neighbour’s lawns). The exemption is intended as a compliance cost savings measure, which ensures children who meet the criteria do not have to file an income tax return. The exemption is not intended to apply when there is a someone in a position to pay tax on behalf of the child. Accordingly, section CW 55BB(2)(a) sets out situations where the exemption will not apply, such as when a minor derives salary or wages, dividends or interest income. Generally, under section HC 35, beneficiary income derived by a minor is treated as trustee income and taxed at the trustee tax rate, with the amount being excluded income to the minor. For the purpose of the trust tax rules a minor is someone who is under the age of 16 on the date of the trust’s balance date. 112 Section HC 35(4) sets out certain exceptions to this general rule. These include if: • the minor’s total beneficiary income in the tax year is $1,000 or less; or • no settlements on the trust have been made by the minor’s relative or guardian (or any person associated with them). In these situations, tax should be paid at the beneficiary’s marginal tax rate. Section HC 32(3) provides that it is the trustee’s responsibility to pay this on behalf of the beneficiary. It is possible under the current law for a minor’s beneficiary income to be treated as exempt income under section CW 55BB (as long as the payment was not in the nature of salary or wages, a dividend or interest income). However, it was never the policy intent for beneficiary income to qualify for this income tax exemption, given that trustees have an obligation to pay tax on the beneficiary’s behalf. 113 NZ SUPERANNUITANTS AND THE END OF YEAR AUTO- CALCULATION PROCESS (Clause 84) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment clarifies that New Zealand Superannuation or Veteran’s Pension recipients who incur a tax liability through the auto-calculation process as a result of the use of a tailored tax code are limited to a write-off of the amount specified in schedule 8, part B 1(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, which is currently $50. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from the 2020−21 income year. Key features The amendment means that any write-off of a New Zealand Superannuation or Veteran’s Pension recipient’s tax liability incurred through the auto-calculation process as a result of the use of a tailored tax code is limited to $50, as specified in schedule 8, part B 1(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Background The new end-of-year auto-calculation rules allow taxpayers who only receive New Zealand Superannuation or Veteran’s Pension income and have a tax liability (perhaps through the under-deduction of PAYE) to have this tax liability written off. This also applies if the taxpayer has used a tailored tax code (for example, a taxpayer with tax losses carried forward that reduce their overall taxable income can get a tailored tax code to reflect that). The underlying policy intent of these rules is that anyone using a tailored tax code should be entitled to a tax liability write-off that is limited in the same way as for the general tax codes. This is because a tailored tax code is based on a taxpayer’s estimate of their income for the year. Schedule 8, part B, clause 1(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 will be amended to clarify that recipients of New Zealand Superannuation and Veteran’s Pension are limited to a $50 write-off if they have used a tailored tax code. 114 REMOVAL OF THE THREE-YEARLY PARENTAL TAX CREDIT REVIEW (Clauses 46 and 47) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment will remove the requirement to review the rate of parental tax credit (PTC) every three years, as PTC is not available for babies born on or after 1 July 2018. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from the date of enactment. Key features The requirement to review the amount of the PTC every three years would be removed as it is no longer required. Background Section MF 7(4) requires the Minister of Revenue, in consultation with the Minister for Social Development, to cause a review into the amounts of in-work tax credit and PTC by 30 June. The first review was in 2008 and each subsequent review is at three-year intervals. The government stopped paying PTC for babies born on or after 1 July 2018 when it put in place the new Best Start tax credit. PTC can now only be claimed in submitting or finalising returns for previous tax years. Inland Revenue may also amend a person’s entitlement if fraud or mistakes are discovered in past years’ returns. The payment for those years would be the amount that applied then. It is extremely unlikely these amounts will be retrospectively changed. Therefore, the need to review the amount of PTC is now redundant. 115 BRINGING KIWISAVER EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS INTO THE PENALTIES, RECOVERY AND USE-OF-MONEY INTEREST REGIMES (Clauses 67(4), 68, 80 and 83) Summary of proposed amendments Amendments are proposed to the Tax Administration Act 1994 in response to legislative changes to the operation of KiwiSaver. From 1 April 2020 the government will pay compulsory and voluntary KiwiSaver employer contributions to KiwiSaver scheme providers before the employer pays the amounts to Inland Revenue. Voluntary employer contributions are currently not subject to the same penalties, debt collection and interest that apply to compulsory employer contributions. The proposed amendments ensure that the same penalties and debt collection mechanisms apply to both voluntary and compulsory employer KiwiSaver contributions. It also updates a number of existing cross-references in the Act. Application date The proposed amendments would apply from 1 April 2021. Key features Voluntary employer KiwiSaver contributions are brought within the penalties, recoveries and use of money interest regimes. Detailed analysis Bringing voluntary KiwiSaver contributions within the penalties regime The proposed amendment is designed to bring voluntary employer KiwiSaver contributions within the penalties regime in Part 9 of the Act. This would be achieved by amending the definition of “tax” in section 3(1) of the Act. The proposed amendment would replace the specific reference to “compulsory employer contribution\[s\]” with the more generic “KiwiSaver Act 2006 employer contributions”, so it includes both compulsory and voluntary employer KiwiSaver contributions. Additionally, in order to not imply the exclusion of voluntary employer KiwiSaver contributions, it is proposed that paragraph (a)(viii) of the definition be repealed. Bringing voluntary employer KiwiSaver contributions within the PAYE deduction rules The propsoed amendment is designed to ensure that the PAYE administration provisions of the Act would apply to voluntary employer KiwiSaver contributions. 116 Section 4A(3) of the Act extends the PAYE withholding and deduction rules to a range of deductions prescribed under other pieces of legislation. While section 4A(3)(bc) includes compulsory employer KiwiSaver contributions, it does not mention voluntary employer KiwiSaver contributions. The proposed amendment would replace the current reference to “compulsory employer contributions” with the more generic “KiwiSaver Act 2006 employer contributions”. Bringing voluntary employer KiwiSaver contributions within the recoveries rules The recoveries provision in section 157 of the Act allows the Commissioner to make deductions from any amounts payable to a taxpayer who has overdue income tax. Section 157(10) includes its own definition of “income tax”. This definition includes compulsory employer contributions, but not voluntary. The proposed amendment would add “KiwiSaver Act 2006 employer contributions” to the definition, thus extending it to include voluntary KiwiSaver employer contributions. Bringing voluntary KiwiSaver employer contributions within the use of money interest regime Use of money interest (UOMI) compensates the Commissioner when taxpayers either pay less tax than they are required to or delay payments to Inland Revenue. Part 7 of the Act contains the UOMI rules, but section 120B(bb) specifically excludes unpaid compulsory employer KiwiSaver contributions. The proposed amendment to section 120B(bb) repeals this exclusion. This, coupled with the amendment to the definition of “tax” (above), will bring both compulsory and voluntary employer KiwiSaver contributions under the UOMI regime. Minor cross-referencing error corrected It is proposed that reference to section 101I(5) of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 in paragraph (a)(iii)(CD) of the definition of tax in section 3(1) of the Act be replaced with section 141(5) of the KiwiSaver Act 2006. The same amendment is made to sections 120B(bb) and 157(10) of the Act, which also refer to section 101Iof the KiwiSaver Act 2006. The reason for this amendment is that section 101I was repealed on 1 December 2014 by section 90 of the Financial Markets (Repeals and Amendments) Act 2013. The equivalent section is now section 141(5) of the KiwiSaver Act 2006. 117 AMEND THE DEFINITION OF DEFERRABLE TAX (Clause 67(2)) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment alters the definition of “deferrable tax” to include consequential amendments from an amended assessment. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from the date of enactment. Key features The definition of deferrable tax would be changed to include consequential amendments from an amended assessment that is in the disputes process. This would reduce the compliance and administrative costs of also challenging those consequential assessments. Background When a taxpayer has a dispute with Inland Revenue, they are only required to pay a proportion of the tax owing until the dispute is settled. The current rules do not deal well with the situation where an amendment to the liability of one taxpayer affects an associated taxpayer. For example, a company may have part of its expenditure disallowed as a deduction, which alters the amount of a loss offset made to another company in the same group. In that situation both entities must object or challenge the assessments. This imposes undue compliance and administrative costs and lengthens the dispute process. Detailed analysis Sections 128 and 138I of the Tax Administration Act 1994 state that a taxpayer is not liable to pay deferrable tax related to tax in dispute. However, the current rules mean that when there are consequential amendments to related taxpayers, those taxpayers cannot defer their tax. They are required to object or otherwise challenge that consequential assessment. This results in increased administrative and compliance costs for those taxpayers. The proposed amendment would alter the definition of deferrable tax to include consequential amendments resulting from an amended assessment that is in the disputes process. 118 RESTRICTING THE ABILITY TO CHALLENGE A TAX POSITION (Clauses 77 and 78) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment closes a potential loophole in the disputes rules whereby taxpayers could circumvent the time limit for challenging an assessment. Under the current rules, taxpayers could attempt to reopen an entire tax assessment by making a voluntary disclosure for a particular item within the period. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from the date of enactment. Background There is arguably a loophole in the current disputes procedures which allows a taxpayer to circumvent the time limit for challenging an assessment. This involves the taxpayer making a voluntary disclosure for a particular item, which arguably, could allow them to reopen the entire original assessment. This would have the effect of circumventing the four-month time limit for challenging an assessment. Detailed analysis Section 89D of the Tax Administration Act 1994 outlines when a taxpayer can issue a notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA). Section 89D(1) states: If the Commissioner- (a) Issues a notice of assessment to a taxpayer; and (b) Has not previously issued a notice of proposed adjustment to the taxpayer in respect of the assessment, whether or not in breach of section 89C,- The taxpayer may, subject to subsection (2), issue a notice of proposed adjustment in respect of the assessment except to the extent to which the assessment takes into account amounts arising under subpart HB of the Income Tax Act 2007. This means that if a taxpayer issues a voluntary disclosure and then receives a notice of assessment when they have not previously been issued a NOPA, they can then issue a NOPA for the entire return even if they are outside the four-month time limit for issuing a NOPA. A similar rule is contained in section 89DA. 119 Example 31 Kstew Winers Limited (KWL) is a company that specialises in the sale of cheap imported wine. KWL files its 2020 tax return and receives an assessment on 20 April 2021. KWL has four months to object to or challenge the assessment, which expires on 24 August 2021. On 6 October 2021 KWL makes a voluntary disclosure for the 2020 tax return indicating it had overclaimed expenses of $5,000 relating to personal air travel to Paris. The Commissioner accepts the voluntary disclosure and issues an amended assessment on 4 February 2022. On 11 March KWL files a notice of proposed adjustment to the Commissioner’s assessment arguing that some unrelated income is not taxable as it was a capital gain. By making the voluntary disclosure KWL has been able to extend the four-month challenge time limit for its original tax return. In the reverse circumstance the Commissioner is prevented from doing this by section 138B(1) which restricts the Commissioner to the “particular” of the amended assessment. The proposed amendment would mean that if a taxpayer issues a NOPA for an assessment from a voluntary disclosure they are limited to the issues raised in the voluntary disclosure, which is identical to the position that applies to the Commissioner. 120 ALIGNING THE DEFINITION OF BENEFIT (Clauses 58(13), 64 and 65) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment would align the definition of a main benefit in the Acts administered by Inland Revenue with that used in the Social Security Act 2018. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from the date of enactment. Key features The proposed amendment would align the definition of a main benefit in the tax Acts with that used in the Social Security Act 2018. The proposed amendment: • adds a new definition of main benefit in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007; • removes the definition of “specified living allowance” as it is redundant; and • makes consequential amendments. Background The tax Acts and the Social Security Act both contain lists of various benefit payments in their definition sections. However, the defined terms are different for the same list of payments. Aligning the definitions between the Acts would reduce confusion and misunderstanding of the law. 121 CLARIFYING THE COMMISSIONER’S POWERS TO TAKE COPIES OF DOCUMENTS (Clause 69) Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendment would clarify that the Commissioner’s powers to take copies and the like in relation to documents produced under various sections of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (the Act) also extend to documents produced in the course of the Commissioner’s inquiries under section 17I of the Act. Application date The proposed amendments would apply from the date of enactment. Key features The proposed amendment would extend the Commissioner’s powers under section 17C to take copies and the like in relation to documents provided under other sections of the Act to documents which are produced in the course of the Commissioner’s inquiries under section 17I. The proposed amendment would also make minor changes to better reflect the interaction of the sections with one another. Background The various information collection provisions in the Act were rewritten and consolidated as part of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018−19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019. As part of this exercise, section 17C was introduced to consolidate the various provisions relating to the ability of the Commissioner to take extracts from documents and the like. Section 17I (which allows the Commissioner to conduct inquiries to obtain information) did not contain rules for taking extracts and the like and therefore was not included within the scope of section 17C. There is no policy reason why the Commissioner should not have the power to take an extract from a document, make a copy of a document, or remove a document from a place for inspection as part of her inquiry powers. Detailed analysis All section references are to the Tax Administration Act 1994. Sections 17 to 17M primarily deal with the collection of information. These provide the Commissioner with broad and wide-ranging powers to obtain information in specific circumstances. For example: 122 • section 17B allows the Commissioner to require information or the production of documents; • section 17G allows the Commissioner to obtain information from large multinational groups; and • section 17H permits the Commissioner to apply to the District Court for an order requiring the provision of information. Operating in concert with these sections is section 17C(1). This section provides the Commissioner with the power to take extracts or copies of documents produced by a person under sections 17, 17B, 17G and 17H. However, there is another section under which the Commissioner may require a person to produce documents. Section 17I allows the Commissioner to conduct inquiries in relation to a person’s tax liability. Under this section, the Commissioner may require a person to produce documents in their position or control. Unfortunately, section 17C(1) does not contain an explicit reference to section 17I. The absence of a reference to section 17I within section 17C(1) makes it unclear whether the Commissioner has the same powers over documents produced under section 17I such that she is able to, for example, take extracts or copies of documents produced under section 17I in the same way as she is under sections 17, 17B, 17G and 17H. The proposed amendment to section 17C(1) would address this issue by incorporating a specific reference to section 17I within section 17C(1). This would make it clear that the Commissioner is able to take extracts or copies of documents produced under section 17I. Minor amendments The proposed amendment would also make minor changes to better reflect the interaction of the sections with one another. These are: • replacement of the term “provided” with “produced” in section 17C(5); • replacing the reference within section 17C(1) to section 17H with the more specific, section 17H(6); and • repealing the reference within section 17C(1) to section 17G as documents are not provided or produced under this section. 123 Maintenance items 125 MAINTENANCE AMENDMENTS Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments reflect minor technical maintenance items arising from both the rewrite of income tax legislation and subsequent changes. Application dates Application dates for each proposed amendment are stated in table 5. Minor maintenance items The proposed amendments in table 5 correct any of the following: • ambiguities; • compilation issues; • cross-references; • drafting consistency, including readers’ aids – for example, the defined terms lists; • grammar; • consequential amendments arising from substantive rewrite amendments; and • inconsistent use of terminology and definitions.

supplied to consumers in New Zealand by registered persons (such as businesses). 1.2 New Zealand’s GST is highly efficient and accounts for about thirty percent of tax revenues. However, specific provisions in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act) need to be regularly maintained or updated in response to changing technology, business practices, jurisprudence, and other factors. 1.3 A number of issues have been identified where the legislation produces an outcome that does not reflect the underlying policy intent. These issues need to be addressed to maintain the certainty, efficiency and fairness of the tax system. 1.4 The purpose of this officials’ issues paper is to outline technical tax policy issues and provide potential policy options and, where possible, proposed solutions to these issues. Summary of issues, options and proposals 1.5 Officials’ are seeking public feedback on the issues set out in this paper. The table summarises the issues, options and proposals. Chapter and topic Issue Option/proposal Chapter 2 – Tax invoice requirements Aligning GST invoicing requirements with changes in business practices and technology. Remove some of the requirements or make them more flexible. Chapter 3 – Cryptocurrencies Cryptocurrencies have an unfavourable GST treatment compared to money or other investment products. Exclude cryptocurrencies from GST and the financial arrangement rules. Income tax will still apply to any profits made when cryptocurrencies are sold or traded. Chapter 4 – Apportionment and adjustment The apportionment and adjustment rules can be complex and difficult to apply. In addition, in some situations they can result in under or over-taxation. A number of different amendments to specific apportionment and adjustment rules are considered. In addition, feedback is sought on further ways in which the rules could be simplified and improved. 6 Chapter and topic Issue Option/proposal Chapter 5 – Domestic legs of the international transport of goods Courier business practices involve sub-contracting part of the journey for an international delivery to other providers. The GST zero-rating rules for international transport do not accommodate these sub-contracting practices. Zero-rating domestic transport services that are supplied to a non-resident transport supplier that has been contracted to provide international transport of goods to or from New Zealand. Chapter 6 – Business conferences and staff training It is impractical for non- resident businesses to register for GST to claim a GST refund for a one- off expense of sending their staff to a conference or training course in New Zealand. Zero-rate conference and staff training services supplied to non- resident businesses. Chapter 7 – Managed funds The GST treatment of different types of management services supplied to managed funds is complex and applies inconsistently. Develop new rules for fund manager and investment manager services. Several alternative options are discussed: 1. Taxable (15% GST). 2. Exempt financial services. 3. Deem a percentage to be exempt (and the remainder taxable). 4. Zero-rating or a reduced input tax credit mechanism. Chapter 8 – Insurance pay-outs to third parties Compliance difficulties from a GST-registered third party unknowingly receiving an insurance pay-out (which they treat as compensation). Three alternative options are discussed: 1. Making the insurer responsible for the GST obligations. 2. Requiring disclosure that the payment is covered by insurance. 3. No law change but provide education and guidance. 7 Chapter and topic Issue Option/proposal Chapter 9 – Compulsory zero- rating of land Some situations have been identified where the current compulsory zero- rating of land rules appear to produce flawed outcomes or the timing of when the relevant provision should apply could be improved. Clarify that section 5(23) applies to place the output tax liability on the purchaser, in cases where a vendor incorrectly zero-rates land. Section 5(23) should apply to standard-rate the supply of land on the date that the original supply was incorrectly zero-rated. Adjustment of second-hand goods input credit in cases where land should have been zero-rated in the taxable period in which it became apparent that the amount of input tax deducted was incorrect. Clarify that section 20(3J), applies from the time of supply of the land. Chapter 10 – Technical and remedial issues Other technical or remedial changes are required to various rules in the GST Act to ensure these rules work as intended. The proposals relate to: • GST grouping rules. • Input credits on goods not physically received yet at the time the GST return is filed. • Second-hand goods input credits on supplies between associated persons. • Providing more flexibility for the Commissioner to approve the end date of a taxable period. • Members of non-statutory boards. • Right to challenge Commissioner’s decision to re- open time-barred GST returns. 1.6 Subject to submissions on this issues paper, the proposals would be included in the next suitable omnibus tax bill. Making a submission 1.7 Submissions are invited on the options and proposals in this issues paper. 1.8 Submissions should include a brief summary of submitter’s major points and recommendations. They should also indicate whether it is acceptable for officials from Inland Revenue to contact submitters to discuss the points raised, if required. 1.9 The closing date for submissions is 9 April 2020. 8 1.10 Submissions can be made: • by email to policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with “GST policy issues” in the subject line; or • by post to: GST policy issues C/- Deputy Commissioner, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue Department P O Box 2198 Wellington 6140 1.11 Submissions may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982, which may result in their publication. The withholding of responses on the grounds of privacy, or for any other reason, will be determined in accordance with that Act. If you consider that any part of your submission should properly be withheld under the Act please clearly indicate this. 9 CHAPTER 2 Tax invoice requirements 2.1 While tax invoices remain a useful tool both for Inland Revenue and businesses to ensure GST compliance and monitor refund claims, the standard requirements for invoices have not changed very much since 1986. Vast changes in business practices and the use of technology since then have given rise to a risk either of non-compliance with the legislation or excessive compliance costs on businesses, suggesting that a review of these requirements is needed. 2.2 As well as modern business practices, international developments make it timely to review GST invoicing requirements. 2.3 In other jurisdictions there is emerging interest in GST (or VAT) adopting some form of split-payment system where a vendor or an intermediary involved in an electronic payment can split the GST off from any payment to the vendor and remit the amount to the revenue authority. 2.4 The New Zealand and Australian governments are also working together to facilitate electronic invoicing (e-invoicing). These changes are intended to facilitate Trans-Tasman trade for small and medium businesses with an ABN or NZBN by allowing data exchange to be used in place of traditional invoices. 2.5 With e-invoicing, businesses will no longer need PDF or paper invoices that have to be scanned, posted or emailed, and entered manually. Instead, the suppliers’ and buyers’ finance systems will “speak” directly to each other, enabling faster delivery, processing and payment of invoices, helping save time and money. Current invoice requirements 2.6 As an integrity measure, the GST Act denies an input tax credit claim unless the supplier has provided the registered person making the claim with a tax invoice and the tax invoice is held by the registered person at the time of making the relevant GST return (see section 20(2)(a)). 2.7 To be a tax invoice, the GST Act requires that documents with consideration exceeding $1,000 must contain: • the words “tax invoice” in a prominent place; • the name and registration number of the supplier; • the name and address of the recipient of the supply; • the date of issue; • a description of the goods and services supplied; • the quantity or volume of the goods and services being supplied; and • the amount of the tax and the pre-tax consideration or the tax-inclusive amount with a statement that it includes GST. 10 2.8 Invoices are not required if the consideration is under $50, and a slightly simplified form of tax invoice can be used where the consideration is between $50 and $1,000. 2.9 The Commissioner does have some authority not to require a tax invoice (section 24(6)). This is where the Commissioner is satisfied that “there are or will be sufficient records available to establish the particulars of any supply or class of supplies, and that it would be impractical to require that a tax invoice be issued.” 2.10 The authority not to require tax invoices to be issued may provide some flexibility in the use of invoices (for example, in allowing data exchange in place of a traditional invoice) but it is not a long-term solution. There is limited guidance about when it would be impractical to issue or obtain a tax invoice, as opposed to simply having relatively high compliance-costs. Options for simplification 2.11 It is proposed that a wider range of ordinary business-to-business information, predominantly electronic information, should be able to be used to support GST output tax and input tax. To achieve this, we are suggesting a number of changes to the GST Act requirements for tax invoices. Required information on the tax invoice 2.12 The current requirement of the name and registration number of the supplier and the name and address of the recipient should remain as key requirements of a tax invoice. The former is needed to identify the taxpayer who supplies the goods and services and is therefore liable for the GST charged. The latter is needed to ensure that the correct person receives any corresponding input tax deduction. 2.13 The requirement to state the GST-exclusive amount of the consideration and the tax or the GST-inclusive amount of the consideration is necessary to identify that the supply has been subject to GST and therefore any related output or input tax. 2.14 On the other hand, the requirement to provide details of the quantity and volume of goods and services supplied could be removed. 2.15 The quantity and volume of goods and services would normally be found in commercial documents and so it seems unnecessary to have this as a set requirement in the GST legislation. There are already general tax record-keeping requirements in the legislation, and these should largely suffice when information is required to support the information in a GST return. Use of electronic invoicing 2.16 With invoices now being largely electronically generated it would make sense to also remove the requirement that a “copied” invoice be marked as “copy only” since the requirement makes little sense in the electronic environment. 2.17 The requirement in section 20(2)(a) that the recipient seeking an input tax claim “hold” a tax invoice has been interpreted by some to suggest that, although hard- copy invoices are not required, a hard copy (for example, in PDF format) must be able to be downloaded. It is questionable whether this requirement is suitable for 11 modern business practices and we are interested in views about whether the wording can be modified by, for example, requiring only that the information required to be kept on a tax invoice be retained. Buyer-created tax invoices 2.18 With the tax system becoming increasingly automated, it seems unnecessary for taxpayers to obtain Inland Revenue approval to use buyer-created tax invoices. A key requirement of this approval is for the parties to demonstrate why it is preferable for the buyer to provide the invoice rather than the supplier. For example, in the dairy industry, this is likely to be because the buyer has better information about what is being purchased (including quantity and price) than the seller. 2.19 Rather than involving Inland Revenue, buyer-created invoices should be based on what is most appropriate for the businesses in question. 1 However, for revenue integrity reasons some requirements should be retained, such as agreements: • between the supplier and the recipient that the recipient should issue the tax invoice along with a shared understanding of the commercial reasons for this; and • that both parties retain a copy of the buyer-created invoice (or the information required to produce the document). Shared invoices 2.20 In some circumstances, shared invoices will be used for more than one supply by more than one supplier. Section 24BA treats a shared invoice that meets the tax invoice requirements as a tax invoice, but only in the limited circumstances of the suppliers being part of the same group of companies or the shared invoice being a practical response to statutory requirements. 2.21 It is proposed that shared invoices should be able to be used in a wider range of circumstances. The proposed new requirements could include: • An agreement between the relevant GST-registered parties that a shared invoice be used. • Requiring the supplier that issues the invoice to retain all the information that would be required to be retained if a separate tax invoice were required for each supply. • Requiring the underlying suppliers to hold the information relevant to their supplies. This seems reasonable given that the information would be generated from the underlying suppliers. • Making clear that the underlying supplier would remain ultimately responsible for the GST, while otherwise allowing the supplier issuing the invoice to pay the tax as their agent. 1 This is consistent with the 2019 recommendation of the Government’s Tax Working Group, that the requirement for taxpayers to seek the approval of the Commissioner to issue buyer-created tax invoices be removed. 12 Tax invoice related penalties 2.22 Knowledge offence penalties can arise if the supplier does not provide a recipient with a tax invoice within 28 days of a request to do so or if the supplier issues more than one tax invoice in relation to the same supply. 2.23 Deeming the issuing of more than one invoice to be an offence, in the same way as the “copy only” requirement, seems outdated for electronic transactions. Historically, the concern was not with issuing an invoice for the same supply more than once, but for claiming more than one input tax deduction in respect of a supply. It is therefore proposed that any penalty (which would generally be placed on the purchaser) be limited to multiple claims for the same supply. Questions for submitters • Do you agree with the proposals outlined in this chapter? • Are there further proposals which should be developed that would simplify or enhance the tax invoice requirements, keeping in mind the likely impact on compliance costs and the implications for Inland Revenue in administering the tax system? 13 CHAPTER 3 Cryptocurrencies 3.1 This chapter discusses proposals to exclude cryptocurrencies (crypto-assets) from GST and the financial arrangement rules to ensure these rules do not impose barriers to developing new products, raising capital or investing through crypto-assets. The tax system strives for neutrality and to minimise distortions. 3.2 Income tax will still apply to any profits made when cryptocurrencies are sold or traded (this is further discussed in paragraphs 3.60–3.62). 3.3 The proposed GST changes would only apply to supplies of crypto-assets. Other services related to crypto-assets, that are not in themselves supplies of crypto-assets such as mining, providing crypto-asset exchange services or providing advice, general business services or computer services will continue to be subject to the existing GST rules. 3.4 GST will continue to apply to supplies of goods and services which are bought using a crypto-asset (the same as if those goods or services had been purchased using money or swapped for another good or service). Crypto-assets are a fast-growing sector 3.5 Crypto-assets are digital assets (commonly known as coins or tokens) that use cryptography to secure transactions and verify the transfer of the coins or tokens. Instead of relying on a financial institution to verify transactions, crypto-asset transactions are confirmed by computers operating on the currency's network. 3.6 At the time of writing, there are currently over 5,000 crypto-assets and the total global market value of all crypto-assets exceeds US$300 billion. 3.7 The use and development of crypto-assets are growing in New Zealand, including investors, exchanges and start-ups. Should different types of crypto-assets have different GST treatments? 3.8 Tax rules in New Zealand and overseas do not contemplate crypto-assets and can be difficult to apply as crypto-assets will often not fit into existing definitions that were designed for other investment products such as currency, shares, debt or equity securities. Because of their innovative nature, they will often also have different features to these other investment products. 3.9 This means that some existing tax rules can be difficult to apply, involve very high compliance costs or may provide policy outcomes for some crypto-assets that lead to over-taxation compared to other alternative investment products. 3.10 More simple and certain tax rules could contribute to the further growth and development of the crypto-asset sector in New Zealand by: 14 • Ensuring New Zealand businesses, investors and crypto-asset users are not disadvantaged from issuing or selling tokens in New Zealand (relative to selling the tokens outside New Zealand or raising capital through other means). • Making it more attractive for businesses to issue their initial coin offerings or other token generating events from New Zealand, which could facilitate increased investment, business growth and technology development in New Zealand. • Making it easier to buy or sell crypto-assets with New Zealand dollars as opposed to having to exchange New Zealand dollars into foreign currencies and incur foreign exchange fees. 3.11 It is intended that crypto-assets should have a similar tax treatment to other investment products or asset classes which are close substitutes for the crypto-asset. It is not intended that crypto-assets would receive a concessionary tax treatment. 3.12 A key question is whether the same tax treatments should be applied to most types of crypto-assets or apply different tax treatments depending on the key features of the particular crypto-asset, such as whether it is a payment token, a utility token, security token, an asset token or a hybrid token with a mix of features. 3.13 Two potential approaches to this issue are discussed. Token classification framework and deeming rules 3.14 One option would be to develop a framework for categorising different types of crypto-assets and use this to create some deeming provisions that apply across all Revenue Acts. For example, rules that deem certain types of crypto-assets to be included in the Revenue Act definitions of securities, or currency, depending on whether the crypto-asset has some particular features. 3.15 This approach could mean: • Crypto-assets deemed to be currency would be subject to income tax on disposal for those who are cash-basis persons and on an accrual basis for those who are not. Currently, supplies of currency are not subject to GST and the exchange of currency is an exempt financial service for GST purposes. • Crypto-assets deemed to be shares would not be financial arrangements for income tax purposes (so would generally be taxed on a realised basis) and would be exempt financial services for GST purposes. • Other types of crypto-assets could be deemed to have a different GST or income tax treatment. 3.16 An advantage of this approach is that it should provide a neutral tax treatment for those crypto-assets which are close substitutes for existing financial products such as currency or shares. 3.17 However, this approach assumes that crypto-assets generally have similar uses or features to existing financial products (which may not be the case), and that the existing tax rules for these other financial products are practical to apply and provide sensible policy outcomes when applied to crypto-assets. 15 3.18 In addition, because of the specific definitions that apply for different tax rules, this approach could still lead to different tax treatments between a crypto-asset and the financial product they are deemed to be for the purposes of the Revenue Acts. For example, a particular crypto-asset could be deemed to be a share, but if it does not provide an interest in a foreign company or partnership, it would still be taxed very differently to other foreign equity investments which will often be foreign companies subject to the FIF rules or partnerships subject to flow-through tax treatment. 3.19 There may also be practical limitations from trying to accurately classify tokens and apply differing tax treatments to different types of token. 3.20 There are over 5,000 crypto-assets – many which have different rights or features. In contrast other investment products, such as a portfolio consisting of shares in listed companies, are much more standardised. There is no universal standard for classifying tokens. This means an investor who buys a lot of different crypto-assets may find it difficult to identify whether a deeming rule in the New Zealand tax legislation applies or not. Some tokens will be hard to classify as they are hybrid. The legal or economic features of a crypto-asset may change as it is developed, leading to a change in tax treatment. For example, some of the proposed features of a particular crypto-asset will not exist yet at the time of investment and may change as the underlying software is developed. Broad definition 3.21 An alternative approach would be to prioritise specific changes to those tax rules and provisions which are identified as creating the most significant policy issues when applied to crypto-assets. 3.22 For example, it appears that the GST and financial arrangement rules lead to significant policy and practical issues when applied to crypto-assets. Some of these issues are explained in the next section. Therefore, there appears to be a case to exclude most types of crypto-asset from the GST and financial arrangement rules by developing a broad definition of crypto-assets for this purpose. Issues with applying GST to crypto-assets 3.23 New Zealand has a broad-based GST system that applies to nearly all goods and services. A service is broadly defined to mean anything which is not goods or money. 3.24 GST does not apply to money or financial services, but the existing definitions of money and financial services were not designed with crypto-assets in mind. It is likely that many crypto-assets have a different GST treatment to money or financial services. 3.25 When a crypto-asset is traded or sold, the GST treatment may vary depending on the specific facts and features of the crypto-asset and the residency of the buyer and seller. The supply of a crypto-asset could be an exempt financial service, subject to 15% GST, or a zero-rated supply to a non-resident. 16 3.26 In this regard, the current GST rules provide an uncertain and variable GST treatment making, using or investing in crypto-assets less attractive than using money or investing in other financial assets. The variable GST treatment may distort decisions around the type of crypto-assets a business may choose to develop and issue, whether they issue the token in New Zealand or offshore, and what type of tokens New Zealand investors choose to buy or sell. 3.27 The final issue is that, because of the complexity of the GST treatment and the limited information available about the specific features of a crypto-asset and the residency of the seller or purchaser, the current GST rules can be difficult to apply or impractical to comply with. Issues from applying financial arrangement rules to crypto-assets 3.28 Financial arrangements are broadly defined, and this broad definition means that some types of crypto-assets are likely to be financial arrangements under the current rules. 3.29 Many security, asset, or utility tokens could be considered financial arrangements between the holder who provides money and another person who provides money or money’s worth in the future. Payment tokens such as bitcoin are unlikely to be financial arrangements as they do not involve an arrangement between two persons. 3.30 Requiring the financial arrangement rules to be applied to some crypto-assets would lead to accrual-based taxation on large unrealised gains and losses from crypto- asset values, which can be very volatile. It could also bias investment decisions about which types of crypto-assets New Zealand investors may prefer to invest in, if some tokens are only taxed on realised gains or losses when they are sold or exchanged for other tokens, and others that are subject to tax on accrued gains or losses. 3.31 If they apply to a crypto-asset, the financial arrangements rules would require the person to convert the value of their crypto-asset into NZD, spread income and expenditure over the term of the arrangement and undertake a base price adjustment on maturity. 3.32 From an income tax policy perspective, it seems more appropriate and practical to tax crypto-assets at the time they are sold (or exchanged for other tokens) rather than on accrued gains or losses. 3.33 Traders who have a business of dealing in crypto-assets should be taxed under the trading stock rules the same way that share traders are. 3.34 Some crypto-assets may have features that make them economically equivalent to debt arrangements – for example a token that is issued at $1 of value (in money, other tokens or services) and can be redeemed for $1.20 of value in two years’ time. Such tokens should continue to be taxed under the financial arrangement rules. This could be achieved by excluding such tokens from the definition of crypto-assets which qualify as excepted financial arrangements. 17 How should a crypto-asset be defined? 3.35 It is proposed that a broad definition of crypto-assets be developed which captures nearly all the crypto-assets that are used or invested in. 3.36 This broad definition would then be used to remove crypto-asset from both the GST rules (by making crypto-assets an exempt supply) and the financial arrangement rules (by making a “crypto-asset” a new type of excepted financial arrangement). 3.37 A crypto-asset could be defined based on a requirement that the token use cryptography and a block chain. 3.38 The proposed definition is broader than the definition of “digital currency” which Australia has legislated to remove GST on certain types of crypto-assets as well as the proposed definition of “digital payment token” which Singapore has developed for the same purpose. 3.39 Australia’s and Singapore’s definitions exclude crypto-assets whose value is pegged to or dependent on a fiat currency (for example, stable coins) as well as tokens that give a right or entitlement to receive something else. This means their definitions exclude utility tokens which can be redeemed for specific goods and services and asset-backed coins which can be redeemed for gold or other specific assets. 3.40 Singapore’s draft guidelines clarify that some “hybrid” utility tokens may still qualify as digital payment tokens so long as they can still potentially be used as a medium of exchange even after they have been used to obtain a product or service. 3.41 Australia’s and Singapore’s definitions are not explicitly limited to crypto-assets as they do not require cryptography or block chain. However, they do exclude tokens that are not generally available to be used without substantial restrictions. This requirement excludes tokens issued on private block chains, currency that can only be redeemed within an online game, or loyalty points that can only be redeemed at certain merchants. 3.42 We consider it could be complex to require a crypto-asset to be generally available without restriction. For example, initial coin offerings are often made to a select group of investors before they later become available on an exchange. In this context a requirement that the coins be “generally available” could lead to the tax treatment for particular crypto-asset changing over time or being uncertain at a particular point in time. 3.43 We welcome submissions on how a crypto-asset should be defined including whether there are other distinguishing features of a crypto-asset which should be included in the definition. How should GST be removed from supplies of crypto-assets? 3.44 There are two main options for removing GST on crypto-assets: • Making all supplies of crypto-assets not subject to GST. Under this option supplies of crypto-assets would have the same GST treatment as supplies of money, which are not subject to GST. 18 • Making supplies of crypto-assets to New Zealand residents exempt from GST and supplies to non-residents zero-rated supplies (subject to GST at 0%). Under this option supplies of crypto-assets would have the same GST treatment as financial services. 3.45 The key difference between these two options is the GST treatment of supplies of crypto-assets to non-residents. To the extent that a GST-registered person makes zero-rated supplies of crypto-assets to non-residents, they would be able to claim GST input credits (a refund on the GST charged on goods and services) in relation to inputs that they use to make these zero-rated supplies. 3.46 Zero-rating of supplies to non-residents could therefore make it more attractive for GST-registered persons to sell crypto-asset to non-residents than New Zealand residents or discourage New Zealanders from using New Zealand-based exchanges. This could hinder the development of the New Zealand dollar market for crypto- assets which would make it more difficult and costly for New Zealand businesses and investors to convert crypto-assets to New Zealand dollars. 3.47 In addition, zero-rating supplies of crypto-assets to non-residents would mean that New Zealand investors who traded more than $60,000 of crypto-assets in a 12-month period on international exchanges would typically be required to register for GST (assuming most of their trades were with non-resident persons), and incur the compliance costs of filing GST returns and returning GST on any other taxable supplies they may make. 3.48 Furthermore, the global nature of crypto-asset markets means that businesses and investors who trade crypto-assets could potentially have a mix of supplies to non- residents and supplies to New Zealand residents. In many cases, it will be impractical to identify if the supply of a crypto-asset is to a resident or a non- resident. 3.49 It is therefore proposed that all supplies of crypto-assets be made not subject to GST, including supplies to non-residents. 3.50 This would ensure New Zealand businesses and investors are not disadvantaged when they sell crypto-assets to other New Zealand residents, which should facilitate the exchange of crypto-assets for New Zealand dollars. It would also reduce compliance costs and would be consistent with the GST treatment of money. In addition, making crypto-assets not subject to GST would be consistent with existing market practices. Input credits for capital raising 3.51 The GST rules were amended in 2017 to allow GST-registered persons to claim input credits for inputs such as legal or advisory services used to raise capital using equity or debt securities (see section 20H of the GST Act). It is proposed that GST- registered businesses that raise funds through issuing security tokens which have features that are similar to debt or equity securities (such as a right to a share of the profits of a project) should also be able to claim input credits on their capital raising costs. 3.52 This would ensure that businesses are not disadvantaged if they choose to raise capital through issuing crypto-assets which are close substitutes for debt or equity 19 securities. These input credits for inputs related to capital raising costs could be claimed regardless of whether the GST-registered person issued the qualifying securities tokens to residents or non-residents. Other services related to crypto-assets 3.53 The proposed changes would only apply to supplies of crypto-assets. 3.54 Although the simple fact of owning a crypto-asset is not itself a financial arrangement, crypto-asset can still be used as part of a financial arrangement (in the same way that money or money’s worth can form part of a financial arrangement). For example, lending funds in the form of crypto-assets and derivatives based on the value of crypto-assets will still be treated as financial arrangements. 3.55 Similarly, for GST purposes, other services related to crypto-assets, that are not in themselves supplies of crypto-assets such as mining, providing crypto-asset exchange services or providing advice, general business services or computer services will continue to be subject to the existing GST rules. 3.56 Under the existing GST rules these services could be either taxable supplies to New Zealand residents subject to 15% GST or zero-rated supplies to non-residents. Because of the global nature of crypto-asset markets, many of these services are likely to be zero-rated supplies to non-residents. 3.57 The intention is that the change in the GST treatment of the supply of crypto-assets should not change the GST treatment of the supply of these other services, even though the service provider may receive crypto-assets as consideration for performing these services. This is consistent with the fact that supplies of goods and services have the same GST treatment regardless of whether the consideration was paid in money or another form of payment (such as barter or crypto-assets). If the GST treatment changed depending on the type of payment received it could create a tax bias for preferring some payment types over others. 3.58 The standard GST rules will therefore continue to apply to supplies of goods and services which are bought using a crypto-asset (the same as if those goods or services had been purchased using money or swapped for another good or service). 3.59 However, the changes proposed above will mean that if a person has received a crypto-asset as a payment for goods or services, they will be able to exchange the crypto-asset for money or another crypto-asset with no GST consequences. Other tax rules will continue to apply to crypto-assets 3.60 Under the proposed changes, crypto-assets would only be excluded from the GST and financial arrangement rules – they would still be subject to other tax rules. 3.61 In particular, a crypto-asset is considered property for income tax purposes. When a person acquires crypto-assets for the purpose of disposal (selling or exchanging it) the proceeds made from selling it are subject to income tax (see section CB 4 of Income Tax Act). Disposal includes swapping one type of crypto-asset for another 20 or exchanging a crypto-asset for New Zealand dollars or another fiat currency such as US dollars or Euro. 3.62 Investors who have a business of dealing in crypto-assets (see section CB 5 of the Income Tax Act 2007) will be subject to income tax each year under the trading stock rules. Application date 3.63 It is proposed that the relevant law changes to exclude crypto-assets from the GST and financial arrangement rules should apply retrospectively from 1 January 2009, the date the first crypto-asset, bitcoin, was launched. 3.64 The proposed application date should ensure all New Zealand traders of crypto- assets are not subject to GST or the financial arrangement rules, regardless of when their purchases or disposals took place. 3.65 It should also mean the proposed new rules would generally align with current and previous tax positions where we understand most of the affected New Zealand taxpayers have generally not applied GST or the financial arrangement rules to determine their tax positions. 3.66 The application date for any changes to the capital raising deduction rules would be from 1 April 2017 as this was the date that the capital raising deduction rule took effect. 3.67 Submissions are sought on whether any variations or savings provisions to the proposed application dates should be provided. For example, a savings provision could be included to preserve tax positions taken based on the GST Act provisions or financial arrangement rules that applied prior to the new amendments. Other tax issues with crypto-assets 3.68 Officials appreciate that some other aspects of the tax rules may also be difficult to apply to investments and transactions involving crypto-assets. While we welcome submissions identifying these issues, this issues paper only proposes excluding crypto-assets from the GST and financial arrangement rules. 3.69 Inland Revenue intends to continue to publish guidance such as answers to commonly asked questions in respect of how other tax rules may apply to crypto- assets. 21 Questions for submitters • Should different types of crypto-assets have different GST treatments, or should a broad definition of crypto-asset be developed to exclude all types from GST? • How should a crypto-asset be defined? • How should GST be removed from supplies of crypto-assets? Should the same GST treatment apply to supplies to residents and non-residents? 23 CHAPTER 4 Apportionment and adjustment 4.1 The apportionment and adjustment rules apply when a GST-registered person uses or intends to use goods and services for both taxable and non-taxable purposes. For example, a contractor that acquires a car for both their contracting business and private travel will only be able to claim input tax credits for the intended taxable use of the car. 4.2 Following acquisition of an asset, the GST-registered person must annually compare the intended taxable use of an asset with the actual taxable use of an asset. If there is a difference the person must make an adjustment to either claim extra input tax credits or pay output tax to reflect the actual taxable use of the asset. 4.3 This chapter discusses a number of issues with the apportionment and adjustment rules and suggests some possible solutions. We would also like feedback on further ways in which the apportionment and adjustment rules could be simplified and improved. Change of use wash-up calculation (non-land assets) 4.4 Section 21FB of the GST Act contains a wash-up calculation that requires a registered person to claim or pay the full input tax credits for an asset when they switch the use of that asset to one hundred percent taxable or non- taxable. 4.5 The rationale for the wash-up calculation is to reduce compliance costs for taxpayers by reducing the number of adjustments they need to perform. 4.6 Without the wash-up calculation the number of adjustments a taxpayer needs to make will depend on the type and value of the asset (see section 21G). For non-land assets a taxpayer must perform two adjustments for assets valued between $5,000 and $10,000, five adjustments for assets valued between $10,000 and $500,000 and ten adjustments for assets valued over $500,000. Alternatively, for non-land assets a taxpayer may choose the relevant number of adjustment periods based on the estimated useful life as determined by the tax depreciation rates determinations set by the Commissioner. For land there is no limit to the number of adjustments required. 4.7 For a change in use to one hundred percent taxable, the wash-up formula entitles a taxpayer to a full input tax deduction less any actual deduction already claimed for that asset. For a change in use to one hundred percent non-taxable, the wash-up formula requires a taxpayer to pay as output tax an amount equal to the actual deduction claimed for that asset. The terms “full input deduction” and “actual deduction” are defined by paragraphs 21FB(a) and (b) respectively. 4.8 In order for an asset to be subject to the wash-up rule its use must be changed to one hundred percent taxable or non-taxable and this total taxable or non-taxable use remain unchanged for an unbroken period of the remainder of the adjustment period 24 in which the change in use occurred, and the entirety of the following adjustment period. Example 1 On 1 April 2016 Fernanda, a GST-registered plumber, acquires a van for $34,500, intending to use it 50% for taxable and 50% for non-taxable purposes. As such, Fernanda claims $2,250 in input credits on acquisition. Halfway through her first adjustment period, Fernanda switches the taxable use of the van to 0%. Therefore, in Fernanda’s first adjustment the actual taxable use of the van was only 25% and Fernanda must pay output tax of $1,125. If the taxable use of the van remains at 0% for all of the next adjustment period Fernanda must perform the wash-up calculation. As such, Fernanda will be required to return as output tax the remaining input credits she had claimed for the van ($1,125). 4.9 This section considers a number of issues with the change of use wash-up calculation for non-land assets. Issues with the wash-up calculation for land are discussed later in this chapter. Issue 1: Wash-up adjustments are disproportionately large 4.10 For non-land assets the wash-up calculation results in adjustments that are disproportionately large. This is because the wash-up calculation does not take into account any business or private consumption of the asset that has occurred prior to the wash-up being performed. In addition, the wash-up calculation does not take into account any change in value of an asset that may have occurred. 4.11 For assets that have had a change in use to one hundred percent taxable, the wash- up requires the taxpayer to claim all the input tax (less any input tax already claimed) for the asset. The concern is that taxpayers can effectively use and “consume” an asset for private purposes over a period of years and then enjoy full input tax recovery upon a subsequent change to full taxable use. Therefore, the wash-up calculation does not tax the non-taxable usage prior to the change to full taxable use. Example 2 Leigh, a GST-registered fisherman, purchases a boat for $1,150,000 (including GST) on 1 April 2017. Leigh uses the boat equally for both private use and his taxable fishing activities. As such Leigh can claim $75,000 as an input tax credit. On 1 April 2023 Leigh switches the use of his boat to being used solely for his taxable activity of fishing. At the end of his 7th adjustment period on 31 March 2024 Leigh performs an adjustment under section 21A and claims $10,714.29 of input tax credits. After the end of his 8th adjustment period on 31 March 2025 Leigh can perform the wash-up calculation under section 21FB and claim $64,285.71 of GST in input tax credits. This gives Leigh a total deduction of $150,000 despite 50% of the boat’s use for the first six years Leigh owned it being non-taxable. If the wash-up rule did not exist Leigh would have instead only been able to claim the following input tax deductions after switching to 100% taxable use: 25 7th adjustment: $10,714.29 8th adjustment: $8,035.71 9th adjustment: $6,250 Final adjustment: $5,000 Total inputs claimed: $105,000 This is because over the ten years in which adjustments were required only 70% of the use of the boat was taxable. 4.12 Conversely for assets that have had a change in use to one hundred percent non- taxable, the taxpayer is required to pay as output tax all the input tax they have claimed for the asset. As the wash-up calculation does not take into account prior taxable use, it therefore results in over-taxation of assets that are switched to one hundred percent non-taxable use. Issue 2: Wash-up can only be used for changes of use to one hundred percent or zero percent taxable 4.13 Section 21FB only applies to a complete change of use to either one hundred percent taxable or one hundred percent non-taxable use. However, if a registered person permanently changes their use of an asset to something other than one hundred percent taxable or one hundred percent non-taxable, they are required to perform the full number of yearly adjustments as required under section 21G. Example 3 On 1 April 2017 Claire, a GST-registered florist, purchases a van for $23,000 (including GST). Claire’s use of this van is 75% taxable as she mainly uses it for her taxable activity but does also use it for private purposes. As such, Claire claims an input tax deduction of $2,250. On 1 April 2019 Claire permanently switches the use of the van to 50% taxable. Claire will need to make yearly adjustments for the next three years to account for this change of use. 4.14 Discussions with business groups have indicated that allowing the wash-up to be performed after a permanent change in use to something other than one hundred taxable or non-taxable would reduce compliance costs. Issue 3: Usual adjustment provisions not switched off following wash-up calculation 4.15 Section 21(2) of the GST Act provides an exception from the requirement to make an adjustment if one or more exceptions apply. However, there is no exception from the requirement to make an adjustment for goods and services that have been subject to the wash-up calculation under section 21FB. 4.16 As such, it appears that a registered person is required to continue to perform adjustments for goods and services that have had a complete change of use and have been subject to the wash-up under section 21FB. 4.17 We are proposing to introduce an exception to the requirement to perform adjustments when the wash-up has been performed. 26 Proposal: New wash-up formula 4.18 To address the first two issues above we propose changing the formula for the change in use wash-up calculation for non-land assets. The proposed new formula is: Time remaining × (Full input tax deduction × Current use - Actual deduction) Total time 4.19 This formula would apply for both changes to 100% taxable use or 100% non- taxable use. It would also apply for any permanent change of use to something between 0% and 100% taxable. 4.20 Full input tax deduction and actual deduction would both have their current meanings. 4.21 Current use would be the percentage taxable use of the asset since the change of use. 4.22 Total time would be defined as the total amount of time from acquisition of the asset until the end of the last adjustment period that would be required under section 21G in the absence of the wash-up. Time remaining would be calculated by subtracting from total time the amount of time from acquisition of the asset until the end of the adjustment period in which the change of use occurred. 4.23 As with the existing formula, the proposed wash-up formula would apply if the use has been changed and remains unchanged for the remainder of the adjustment period in which the change of use occurred, and the adjustment period following the period in which the change of use occurred. 4.24 Under the proposed formula, the result under the wash-up is the same as if the person had instead used the standard change in use provisions for the remaining adjustment periods (ignoring the restrictions to performing adjustments under section 21(2)). This is illustrated in examples 4–6. Example 4: Change to 100% non-taxable On 1 April 2017 Caroline, a GST-registered electrician, purchases a van for $46,000 (including GST). Caroline’s use of this van is seventy five percent taxable as she mainly uses it for her taxable activity but does also use it for private purposes. As such, Caroline claims an input tax deduction of $4,500. On 1 April 2019 Caroline switches the use of the van to one hundred percent non-taxable as she has now purchased a new vehicle for use in her taxable activity. At the end of her 3rd adjustment period on 31 March 2020 Caroline’s actual taxable use of the asset was fifty percent so she is required to return $1,500 as output tax. After the end of her 4th adjustment period Caroline is able to perform the wash-up calculation and return $1,200: 2 years × ($6,000 × 0% - $3,000) 5 years = -$1,200 This brings the total amount of inputs Caroline has claimed for the van to $1,800. This is equal to the amount of inputs she would have been able to claim under the standard change of use rules (ignoring the restrictions on performing adjustments under section 21(2)). This is because over the five years in which adjustments were required, 30% of the use of the van was taxable. 27 Example 5: Change to 50% taxable On 1 January 2018 David bought a vintage car for $230,000 (including GST). David is initially not registered for GST. However, on 1 February 2019 he registers for GST and begins renting out the car for weddings and special events while still using it privately. David’s taxable use of the car from this point forward is 50%. Under section 21B David’s first adjustment period will end on 31 March 2019. David calculates that his taxable use of the car for this adjustment period was 6.67 % (50% taxable use for two months and 0% taxable use for 13 months). As such he claims $2,000 in input tax. After the end of his second adjustment period David is able to perform the wash-up calculation and claims an additional $9,904.76 of input tax: 48 months × ($30,000 × 50% - $2,000) 63 months = $9,904.76 This brings the total amount of inputs David has claimed for the car to $11,904.76. This is equal to the amount of inputs he would have been able to claim under the standard change of use rules. Example 6: Change to 100% taxable Consider example 2 with Leigh. At the end of his 8th adjustment period on 31 March 2025 Leigh can perform the wash-up calculation. Under the proposed formula he can claim an additional $19,285.71 in input tax credits: 3 years × ($150,000 × 100% - $85,714.29) 10 years = $19,285.71 This gives Leigh a total deduction of $105,000, equal to his total deduction under the standard change in use rules. 4.25 We are seeking feedback on the proposal to amend the wash-up formula for non- land assets in the manner described above. Zero-rated supplies of going concerns 4.26 Under section 11(1)(m) of the GST Act, the sale of a going concern from one registered person to another may be zero-rated if the supplier and the recipient agree. 4.27 Issues arise with this rule when the recipient of the going concern intends to use the supply for both taxable and private or exempt purposes. Zero-rating the supply of a going concern means that there is no input tax to apportion. As a result, any exempt or private use of the going concern is not correctly accounted for. 28 Example 7 Shanae has a mobile dog washing business. She enters into an agreement to sell the entire business, including the business’s van to Gordon for $100,000 (plus GST if any). This $100,000 is made up of $50,000 for the van and $50,000 for all other assets. Shanae and Gordon agree to zero-rate the sale of the business as a going concern. Gordon estimates that the private use of the van will be 50%. However, as no GST has been paid Gordon does not need to account for this private use. Alternatively, Shanae and Gordon could have agreed to not zero-rate the supply as a going concern. Gordon would then have been required to pay Shanae $115,000 and Shanae would have had to return $15,000 in output tax. As Gordon will be using the vehicle for 50% private use, he can only claim an input tax deduction of $11,250. 4.28 In contrast, under the zero-rating of land rules any private or exempt use of zero- rated land is effectively taxed. Section 20(3J) requires the purchaser to determine the nominal amount of GST they would have incurred if the supply was standard rated and return as output tax the proportion of this nominal GST relating to private or exempt use. 4.29 We are proposing to introduce a similar provision to section 20(3J) that would apply to zero-rated supplies of going-concerns. In example 7, such a provision would have required Gordon to return $3,750 in GST if he and Shanae had agreed to zero-rate the sale of the business as a going concern. Apportionment of land 4.30 Some apportionment and adjustment issues mainly affect land rather than other assets. This is because land is different from most other assets in that it tends to appreciate in value. Furthermore, it is common for land to be used for a mix of taxable and non-taxable purposes given it is often used privately or for the supply of accommodation in a dwelling. 4.31 Issues with the apportionment and adjustment rules for land are discussed in the next section. Concurrent use of land 4.32 A special apportionment rule in section 21E of the GST Act applies where a GST- registered person is concurrently using the same piece of land with a dwelling for both a taxable (development) and non-taxable (supply of accommodation in a dwelling) purpose. 4.33 The rule applies in the adjustment periods prior to the sale of the property and adjusts the input credits that can be claimed on the property based on the ratio of taxable use to total use. 4.34 This rule was developed in response to issues raised by the Court of Appeal decision in Lundy (2005) 22 NZTC 19 at 637, which involved land being used concurrently for taxable (advertised for sale) and non-taxable (supply of accommodation in a dwelling) purposes. In that case a developer bought houses intending to develop and quickly sell them. The developer was initially unable to find buyers and so rented out the houses until they were able to find a buyer. As the developer was 29 using the land concurrently for both taxable and exempt activities, they could not apportion their inputs based on time or space. Scope of section 21E 4.35 The rule was developed under an assumption that the concurrent use of the land would only be for a short period of time (a few adjustment periods) prior to the sale. 4.36 However, the rule can also apply in situations in which there is a concurrent use of land for a long period. For example, the concurrent use of land rule may apply if a property developer rents out houses but has a well-developed plan to sell them in 20 years. In this situation it may be argued that they are passively using the land for taxable purposes as they are holding it for future sale at the same time as they are actively using the land for the non-taxable use of supplying accommodation in a dwelling. 4.37 Note that section 21E would not necessarily apply even if there is a well-developed plan to sell the land. Whether or not there is concurrent use would depend on all of the facts of an arrangement. 4.38 The concurrent use rule was not intended to apply to situations in which the only taxable use was passively holding the land for future sale. Instead it was targeted at situations similar to the Lundy case in which land was actively being advertised for sale or had some other active taxable use whilst simultaneously being used for non- taxable purposes. 4.39 We therefore propose limiting the application of section 21E to not apply in situations where the only taxable use of the land in an adjustment period is holding the land for its eventual sale or development. If the only taxable use of land in an adjustment period is holding the land for its eventual sale or development, then the taxable use of the land during that period would be zero percent. 4.40 We are seeking feedback on the appropriateness of this proposal to limit the scope of section 21E. Concurrent use apportionment formula 4.41 In addition to the scope of the concurrent use rule being broader than intended, the apportionment formula in section 21E(3) appears to be overly generous. 4.42 The apportionment formula in subsection (3) compares the expected consideration for taxable supplies (approximated by the current market value of the property) with the total consideration, where total consideration is the current market value of the property plus any rental income (or imputed rent) that has been received since the registered person purchased the property. This ratio of taxable use to total use is then used to determine the percentage of GST input credits which can be claimed on the property and expenses associated with the property. 4.43 As the market value of the property will generally be significantly more than the rental income received, this formula often allows a high proportion of GST input credits to be claimed. This may provide a registered person with a concurrent use of land a time value of money advantage over someone with a fully-taxable use of the land (that is, a property developer renting out the land as commercial 30 accommodation while advertising it for sale), or someone with a fully non-taxable use of the land (that is, a residential landlord). 4.44 In addition, the existing formula in subsection (3) does not appear to calculate either the extent to which the use of land is taxable, or the extent to which the land holder’s purpose in using the land is taxable. As such, we consider that the apportionment formula in subsection (3) should be amended. Two options for amending the formula are discussed. 4.45 The first option would recognise that, as it is being entirely used for taxable purposes and entirely used for non-taxable purposes, the land is being equally used for both purposes. As such, the taxable use of the land for periods of concurrent use would be fifty percent. This option would appear to be consistent with a time and space apportionment approach. Example 8: Fifty percent taxable use for concurrent use Property Co acquires bare zero-rated land on 1 April 2020 for $1,000,000. They spend the next three years building houses on the land. As such, their use of the land for these three years is 100% taxable. On 1 April 2023 Property Co begins renting out the houses as residential accommodation while advertising the houses for sale. Their taxable use of the land from 1 April 2023 on will be 50% as the land is being used concurrently. On 31 March 2024 Property Co calculates that their taxable use of the land since acquisition was 87.5% (three years of 100% taxable use and one year of 50% taxable use). As such, they make an adjustment and return $18,750 (12.5% of the nominal GST component of the purchase price). 4.46 The second option would attempt to calculate taxable use based on the benefit the registered person receives in using the land concurrently. This would be achieved by comparing, over the period the land is used concurrently, the taxable benefit the owner receives from the land with the total benefit the owner receives from the land. This would be calculated using the formula: Consideration for taxable supply - Cost Total consideration for supply - Cost 4.47 Consideration for taxable supply and total consideration for supply would maintain their current meaning. 4.48 Cost would be the market value of the land at the time the land began to be used concurrently. 31 Example 9: Option 2 formula Develop Co acquires land on 1 April 2020 for $1,150,000 (no GST). They intend to use the land entirely in their taxable activity of property development so claim a second-hand goods input tax deduction of $150,000. Develop Co spends the next two years demolishing the house on the land and constructing an apartment building. As such, their use of the land for these two years is 100% taxable. On 1 April 2022 Develop Co begins renting out the apartments as residential accommodation while advertising the building for sale. As such, from 1 April 2022 they are concurrently using the land. The market value of the land on this date is $2,300,000. Over the next year Develop Co receives 200,000 in rental income and the market value of the land increases to $2,400,000. As such, their taxable use of the land for the last year is calculated as: $2,400,000 - $2,300,000 $2,400,000 + $200,000 - $2,300,000 = 33 1 3 % On 31 March 2023 Develop Co. calculates that their taxable use of the land since acquisition was 77 7/9% (two years of 100% taxable use and one year of 33 1/3% taxable use). As such, they make an adjustment and return $33,333.33 of the input credits they had previously claimed for the land. 4.49 Note that under the second option the proposed formula would not work if the land depreciates in value over the period of concurrent use. In these situations, the taxable use of the land over the period of concurrent use would be zero percent. 4.50 We are seeking feedback on whether the apportionment formula in section 21E(3) should be amended, and if so which of the two options discussed above is more appropriate. We are also seeking feedback on whether there are other options for amending the formula in subsection (3) that would be more appropriate than the two options discussed above. Transitional rules 4.51 There may be some registered persons that own land that section 21E currently applies to but under the proposal to limit the scope of the rule would no longer have a concurrent use of land. This may result in them being required to make large adjustments to return input tax claimed on the land as their taxable use of the land going forward would be zero percent. We are therefore seeking feedback on whether any transitional rules are necessary to limit the impact of the change on these registered persons. 4.52 Any transitional rule would only apply when the registered person’s concurrent use of the land (as currently defined) began prior to 24 February 2020. Disposal of land with a mix of taxable and non-taxable use 4.53 Section 21F applies when a registered person disposes of an asset which they have used for a mix of taxable and non-taxable uses and have therefore only claimed some of the GST they incurred when they acquired the asset. 4.54 Section 21F allows the registered person to claim as an adjustment the proportion of the output tax related to their non-taxable use. However, the amount of the adjustment is capped at the amount of GST paid by the registered person on acquisition of the asset. 32 4.55 For depreciating assets, the final adjustment under section 21F appears to achieve an appropriate result as the net GST returned on disposal of the asset will be equal to the taxable proportion of the asset’s use. This is shown in example 10. Example 10: Depreciating asset Paul purchased a car for $115,000 and 50% of its use is taxable. As such he has claimed an input tax deduction for the car of $7,500. After a few years Paul sells the car for $46,000. He is required to return $6,000 as output tax but can claim an adjustment under section 21F of $3,000 as calculated below: 3 23 × $46,000 × �1 - $7,500 $155,000 � = $3,000 As such, the net GST Paul returns on disposal of the car is only $3,000 (50% of the $6,000 of output tax). This recognises that 50% of Paul’s use of the car was non-taxable. 4.56 However, for land, which often appreciates in value, the final adjustment under section 21F will often produce an inappropriate outcome. 4.57 The amount of the adjustment under section 21F is capped at the unclaimed portion of the GST paid by the registered person on acquisition of the asset. This cap on the adjustment means that, despite any non-taxable use, all the appreciation in value of land is treated as being related to the land’s taxable use. 4.58 Treating all the appreciation in value of land as relating to the taxable use of the land is appropriate in some circumstances. For example, a property developer may use land for some non-taxable purposes (that is, supplying accommodation in a dwelling) before they dispose of it. However, given their taxable activity is property development, the appreciation in the value of the land is likely to primarily relate to their taxable use of the land, rather than any non-taxable use. As such, capping the adjustment under section 21F to the unclaimed portion of the GST paid on acquisition of the land by the property developer is appropriate. 4.59 However, in other situations in which the use of land is both taxable and non- taxable, treating the entire appreciation in value of the land as relating to the taxable use does not appear to be appropriate. When the taxable use of the land does not include adding value to the land, such as having a home office or using a home or bach both privately and for providing short-term commercial accommodation, appreciation in the value of the land relates to both the taxable and non-taxable uses of the land. In these cases, the cap on the adjustment results in the disposal of the land being overtaxed. This is shown in example 11. Example 11: Home office Kelvin purchases a house for $1,150,000 (including GST). He lives in it as his main home, but also has a home office from which he runs his online business of selling biscuits. His taxable use of the house is 20% so he claims an input tax deduction for the house of $30,000. After a few years Kelvin sells the house for $1,265,000. He is required to return $165,000 as output tax but can claim an adjustment under section 21F of $120,000, being the remainder of the input tax he had not previously claimed. As such, the net GST Kelvin returns on disposal of the house is $45,000. This is 27.27% of the output tax on disposal even though Kelvin’s taxable use of the house was only 20%. 33 4.60 We understand that because of the cap on the adjustment in section 21F, some registered persons that have some taxable use of their home or bach are attempting to structure in such a way as to keep their land out of the GST base. Proposal: Removing cap on adjustment for non-developers 4.61 To address the issue discussed above we propose removing the cap on the adjustment in section 21F for land that is disposed of by someone other than a property developer. 4.62 This would be achieved by removing the cap on the adjustment in section 21F for land unless, in the absence of any other taxable supplies the land is used to make, the supply of the land would still be considered as being made in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. Examples 12–14 demonstrate how this would work. Example 12: Home office Consider example 11 with Kelvin. Kelvin’s only taxable activity is his online business of selling biscuits. As such, in the absence of the use of his home for a home office for his online business, the sale of his home would not be considered as being made in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. The cap in section 21F would therefore not apply to the disposal of Kelvin’s home. On disposal of his home Kelvin is required to return $165,000 as output tax but can claim an adjustment for $132,000, recognising his 80% non-taxable use of the home. Example 13: Short-term commercial accommodation Brian and Nita bought a bach in Whangamata for $690,000 that they mainly use privately. However, they also have a taxable use of the bach as they use it for supplying short-term commercial accommodation. Their taxable use of the bach is 40% so they only claim an input tax deduction of $36,000. After a few years they sell the bach for $1,035,000 (including GST). As such they return output tax of $135,000. In the absence of the supplies of short-term commercial accommodation Brian and Nita made from the bach, the supply of the bach would not be considered as being made in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. The cap on adjustments in section 21F would therefore not apply to the disposal of the bach so Brian and Nita claim an adjustment of $81,000. This recognises that 60% of their use of the bach was non-taxable. 34 Example 14: Property developer House Co is a property developer that purchases a house for $2,300,000 that is currently rented out as residential accommodation. Six months later the tenancy ends and they begin renting out the house as short-term commercial accommodation while developing plans and obtaining consent for development work. After six months of using the home for providing short-term commercial accommodation House Co begins the process of demolishing the house, subdividing the land and constructing five new houses on the land. Two years after acquiring the land House Co sells the five new houses for a total price of $5,750,000 (including GST) and returns output tax of $750,000. House Co has a taxable activity of property development and therefore, even in the absence of the supplies of short-term commercial accommodation they made with the land, the supply of the land would still be made in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. As such, the cap on adjustments in section 21F would apply to the disposal of the land. Over the period House Co owned the land their taxable use was seventy 75% so they had claimed an input tax deduction of $225,000. Their adjustment under section 21F would therefore be $75,000. This is the remainder of the input tax they had not previously claimed for the land. 4.63 In removing the cap on section 21F for land (except for property developers) we consider that section 5(18) would no longer be required. The proposal would have a broader impact than section 5(18) as section 5(18) only applies to disposals of dwellings and does not apply to disposals of commercial dwellings or other types of land. Furthermore, section 5(18) could apply to disposals by property developers and we consider this to be inappropriate as, for property developers, increases in the value of the land relate primarily to the taxable use. 4.64 We are seeking feedback on the proposal to remove the cap on adjustments in section 21F for disposals of land by someone other than a property developer. 4.65 At this stage we are not proposing to remove the cap on adjustments for any other appreciating assets. However, we are seeking feedback on whether there are any other situations where the cap on the adjustment should be removed when an asset appreciates in value. Change of use wash-up calculation for land 4.66 As discussed above, the wash-up calculation in section 21FB applies when a registered person changes the use of an asset to one hundred percent taxable or one hundred percent non-taxable. 4.67 As there are no limits to the number of adjustment periods required for land under section 21G, the new formula for the change of use wash-up calculation proposed above would not apply for land. However, there are still some issues with the change of use wash-up calculation for land and these are discussed below. 4.68 For land, the wash-up calculation can result in adjustments that are disproportionately small. This is because the wash-up calculation is based on the cost of an asset rather than its market value and land tends to appreciate in value. This creates a concern that a taxpayer could reduce their output tax liability by switching the use of land to one hundred percent non-taxable and performing the wash-up prior to disposal. 35 4.69 Given the proposed changes to section 21F for non-property developers discussed above, the wash-up calculation in section 21FB may also result in a worse outcome for a person that changes their use of land to one hundred percent taxable, compared to if they had disposed and reacquired the land at its current market value. 4.70 As with non-land assets, the wash-up calculation in section 21FB can only currently be performed when the use of land has been changed to one hundred percent taxable or one hundred percent non-taxable. As such, a person who permanently changes the use of land to something between zero percent and one hundred percent taxable would need to perform yearly adjustments until they dispose of the land. This creates additional compliance costs. Option 1: Deemed disposal and reacquisition 4.71 One option to address the issues discussed above would be for land to be treated as being disposed and reacquired at market value when the change of use wash-up is performed. For ease of compliance, the deemed disposal would be considered a standard rated supply. 4.72 This option could apply for both changes to one hundred percent taxable or non- taxable use and for permanent changes in use to something between zero percent and one hundred percent taxable use. Examples 15–17 illustrate how this would work. Example 15: Change to one hundred percent taxable use On 1 April 2020 Ben purchases a house for $1,150,000 (including GST) that he intends to use both privately as his main home and for supplying short-term commercial accommodation. His intended taxable use of the house is 20% so he claims an input tax deduction of $30,000. On 1 January 2024 Ben switches the use of the house to one hundred percent taxable as he has purchased a new property to live in as his main home. On 31 March 2024 Ben calculates that his taxable use of the land since acquisition has been 25% (3.75 years 20% and 0.25 years 100% taxable use) and performs an adjustment, claiming an additional $7,500 of input tax. On 31 March 2025 Ben can perform the wash-up calculation. He is deemed to dispose of the property and reacquire it at its current market value of $1,285,000 (including GST). As such, he returns output tax of $165,000 but can claim this all back as an input tax deduction. Ben also performs an adjustment under section 21F for his deemed disposal of the land. In the absence of the supplies of commercial accommodation he has made, the disposal would not be in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. As such, the cap on the adjustment in section 21F does not apply and Ben claims an adjustment of $123,750. This is the net effect of performing the change of use wash-up adjustment. 36 Example 16: Change to zero percent taxable use On 1 April 2020 Joanna purchases a house for $690,000 (including GST) that she intends to use both privately as her main home and for a home office that she uses in her taxable activity. Her intended taxable use of the house is 30% so she claims an input tax deduction of $27,000. On 1 October 2023 Joanna switches the use of the house to 0% taxable. On 31 March 2024 Joanna calculates that her taxable use of the land since acquisition has been 26.25% (3.5 years 30% and 0.5 years 0% taxable use) and performs an adjustment, returning $3,375 of input tax she had previously claimed. On 31 March 2025 Joanna can perform the wash-up calculation. She is deemed to dispose of the land and reacquire it at its current market value of $920,000 (including GST). She therefore returns output tax of $120,000 but cannot claim any of this back as an input tax deduction. Joanna also performs an adjustment under section 21F for her deemed disposal of the land. As she was not a property developer the cap in section 21F does not apply so Joanna claims an adjustment of $88,500 (73.75% of the output tax). The net effect of performing the change of use wash-up adjustment is that Joanna must return $31,500. Example 17: Change to twenty five percent taxable On 1 October 2021 Graeme purchases a bach for $805,000 (including GST). He intends to use the bach equally for both private use and for making supplies of commercial accommodation. As such he claims an input tax deduction of $52,500. On 1 January 2024 Graeme switches the taxable use of the bach to twenty five percent. On 31 March 2024 Graeme calculates his taxable use of the bach since acquisition as 47.5% (2.25 years fifty percent and 0.25 years twenty five percent). As such he performs an adjustment and returns $2,625 of the input tax he had previously claimed. On 31 March 2025 Graeme can perform the wash-up calculation. He is deemed to dispose of the bach for its current market value of $1,035,000 (including GST). He therefore returns output tax of $135,000 but can claim $33,750 of this back as an input tax deduction as his taxable use of the bach going forwards will be twenty five percent. Graeme also performs an adjustment under section 21F for his deemed disposal of the land. As he is not a property developer the cap on section 21F does not apply. Graeme therefore claims an adjustment of $70,875 (52.75% of the output tax). The net effect of performing the change of use wash-up adjustment is that Graeme must return $30,375. 4.73 One concern with this option is that it may impose compliance costs on registered persons in determining the market value of the land when they perform the wash- up calculation. However, the one-off compliance cost of determining the land’s market value may be less than the compliance costs of performing continual yearly adjustments after a permanent change in use. There is also a risk that obtaining an estimate of the land’s market-value could be open to manipulation. 4.74 We are seeking feedback on the appropriateness of this option to make the change in use wash-up for land a deemed disposal and reacquisition at market value. Option 2: Updated formula 4.75 As an alternative, the existing wash-up adjustments for land could be maintained but the calculation amended to allow it to be used for permanent changes in use to 37 something other than one hundred percent taxable or non-taxable. This would be achieved by replacing both of the current formulas with this formula: Full input tax deduction × Current use - Actual deduction 4.76 Current use would be the percentage taxable use of the land since the change of use occurred. 4.77 This proposed formula would not address the concerns that the wash-up calculation for land can result in adjustments that are disproportionately small. However, to address the fiscal risk from someone reducing their output tax on disposal by performing the wash-up adjustment, a special adjustment rule would apply when land that has been subject to the wash-up after a permanent decrease in its taxable use is disposed of within five years of the permanent change of use occurring. This special rule would not apply when land is disposed of after the wash-up has been performed following a permanent increase in the land’s taxable use. 4.78 This rule would require the actual taxable use of the land since acquisition to be calculated and an adjustment made to claim input tax in line with this percentage. The supply of the land would then be a taxable supply (even if the use of the land had changed to zero percent) and section 21F would apply to the disposal of the land. Examples 18–19 demonstrate how this would work. Example 18: Change to zero percent taxable use Consider example 16 with Joanna. On 31 March 2025 Joanna performs the wash-up calculation and returns the $23,625 of input tax she had previously claimed. On 30 September 2027 Joanna sells the house for $1,150,000. As this is within five years of the permanent change of use to 0% taxable use the supply of the house is treated as a taxable supply and Joanna must return output tax of $150,000. Joanna calculates her actual taxable use of the land since acquisition as 14% (3.5 years 30% and four years 0% taxable use). As such, Joanna claims $12,600 in input tax for the land. She then claims an additional adjustment under section 21F of $129,000, being eighty six percent of the output tax. Example 19: Change to twenty five percent taxable Consider example 17 with Graeme. On 31 March 2025 Graeme can perform the wash-up calculation and returns $23,625 of the input tax he had previously claimed: $105,000 × 25% − $49,875 = $23,625 Graeme sells the house on 1 January 2028 for $1,265,000 (including GST) and returns output tax of $165,000. As the disposal is only four years after the permanent change in use to 25% taxable use, the special adjustment rule would apply. Graeme calculates his taxable use of the property since acquisition as 34% (2.25 years 50% and four years 25% taxable use). As such he claims an additional $9,450 input tax for the property. He also claims an adjustment under section 21F of $108,900 (66% of the output tax). 38 4.79 The special adjustment rule would also apply if a person ceases being a registered person within five years of the permanent change of use occurring. 4.80 We are seeking feedback on the appropriateness of the proposed new formula under this option. We are also seeking feedback on the proposed special adjustment rule to address the fiscal risk from someone reducing their output tax by performing the wash-up after a permanent decrease in the taxable use of land. Zero-rated land 4.81 If either the existing wash-up calculation is maintained or the proposed calculation under option 2 is adopted a minor amendment would need to be made to the definition of “actual deduction”. 4.82 For the purposes of the wash-up calculation, “actual deduction” is defined in section 21FB(3)(b) as the “amount of deduction already claimed, taking into account adjustments made up to the end of the adjustment period referred to in subsection 1(c)(ii)”. This definition does not take into account any nominal deduction received for zero-rated land. In contrast, the definition of “full input tax deduction” does include the nominal GST component chargeable under section 20(3J)(a)(i). 4.83 We propose to update the definition of “actual deduction” to include a nominal deduction for the proportion of the nominal GST component not returned as output tax on acquisition of zero-rated land. Other ways to simplify the apportionment and adjustment rules 4.84 We have also heard from many stakeholders that the apportionment rules can be complex and difficult to apply. As such, we are considering ways in which the apportionment and adjustment rules could be simplified. 4.85 Some possible ways in which the rules could be simplified are discussed below. We are interested in feedback on whether these ideas have merit and are worth exploring further. We also welcome submissions on any other ways the apportionment and adjustment rules could be simplified. Understanding which rule is applicable 4.86 We understand that it may not always be easy for a registered person to determine which particular apportionment or adjustment rule applies to them. To assist in navigating these rules a signposting provision could be added at the beginning of the apportionment and adjustment section of the GST Act. 4.87 Alternatively, Inland Revenue could provide additional guidance material to assist taxpayers and their agents navigate the apportionment and adjustment rules. De minimis thresholds for minor taxable use 4.88 The sale of an asset that has been used in a person’s taxable activity will generally be a taxable supply. This means that very minor taxable use of a good or service can make the eventual disposal of that asset a taxable supply. 39 4.89 A threshold for minor taxable use of an asset could be established, for example ten percent. If the taxable use of the asset is below this threshold and no input tax deductions have been claimed in relation to the asset, the disposal of the asset would not be considered as being made in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. 4.90 A de minimis threshold for minor taxable use would mean that, when the taxable use of an asset is below this threshold a registered person could choose not to claim any input tax and would therefore not be required to perform any adjustments. Accuracy of apportionment and adjustments 4.91 The current apportionment and adjustment rules require precise calculations of the taxable use of a good or service. However, the rules could instead require the taxable use of an asset be calculated to a certain level of accuracy, for example the nearest five percent. 4.92 This would mean that if the intended taxable use of an asset was 50%, but it is determined that during the first adjustment period the actual taxable use was 52% or 49% no adjustment would be required. Conversely, if the actual taxable use was 53% the taxable use of the asset would be considered 55% and an adjustment would be required. 4.93 We note that for high-value assets it is more important for apportionment to be accurate. Therefore, it may only be appropriate to allow taxable use to be calculated to a certain level of accuracy for assets acquired for less than a particular amount. 4.94 There are also some thresholds under which adjustments are not required. For example, adjustments are not required for goods and services under $5,000 (excluding GST), or if the difference between the percentage intended use and percentage actual use is less than 10 percentage points and the amount of the adjustment does not exceed $1,000. These thresholds could be amended to reduce the instances of adjustments being required. Questions for submitters • Do you support the proposed new wash-up calculation for non-land assets that have had a permanent change in use? • Do you support the proposal to limit the application of section 21E so it does not apply in situations where the only taxable use of the land in an adjustment period is holding the land for its eventual sale or development? • Should the apportionment formula in section 21E be amended and if so which of the two proposed formulae is more appropriate? • Would any transitional rules be necessary if the scope of section 21E was limited? • For disposals of land that has had a mix of taxable and non-taxable use, do you support the proposal to remove the cap on the final adjustment for non-developers? • Should the wash-up calculation for land that has had a permanent change of use be amended and if so which of the two proposed options do you support? • How can the apportionment and adjustment rules be amended more generally to make them simpler and easier to apply? 41 CHAPTER 5 Domestic legs of the international transport of goods Background 5.1 The GST Act zero-rates services provided to transport goods to and from New Zealand. Furthermore, in certain circumstances, the transport of goods within New Zealand as part of the international transport of goods may also be zero-rated. This is because exported goods are zero-rated, and the value of transport services is already included in the cost of imported goods which are subject to 15% GST. 5.2 However, the rules around when domestic transport services that form part of the international transport of goods may be zero-rated do not align with common commercial practices. It is now common commercial practice for an international courier contracted to supply the international transport of goods to or from New Zealand (the primary transport supplier) to subcontract to a New Zealand-based courier company to supply the domestic transport services – instead of establishing their own courier company in New Zealand to carry out the domestic portion of the courier service. 5.3 For the domestic transport services to be zero-rated, the requirement that the primary transport supplier must also supply the domestic portion of the international transport of goods for the domestic transport services is applied strictly. That means that if a New Zealand-based courier is subcontracted by the international transporter to provide domestic transport services as part of the international transport of goods service, the New Zealand-based courier must charge GST on this supply, even if they are associated with, or a wholly owned subsidiary of, the international transport supplier. Example 20 Jason’s Amazing Shipping Experience (JASE), an international courier company, has a New Zealand-based subsidiary called Kim Couriers. JASE is hired to transport goods from Sydney to Greymouth. JASE delivers the goods from Sydney to Christchurch and contracts Kim Couriers to deliver the goods from Christchurch to Greymouth. Despite being associated JASE and Kim Couriers are considered to be different suppliers. Therefore, the domestic transportation services supplied by Kim Couriers to JASE should be subject to GST at the standard rate. Issues Non-compliance 5.4 The current rules have led to significant non-compliance within the goods transportation industry. Officials understand that many goods transporters are incorrectly zero-rating their domestic services, even though they do not qualify under the GST rules. 42 5.5 Much of this non-compliance is due to a lack of understanding of the requirement that for the domestic transportation leg to be zero-rated it must be supplied by the exact same supplier as the international transportation. We understand that some couriers erroneously consider the same supplier requirement to be met if an associated or sub-contracted courier supplies the domestic transportation services. 5.6 We also understand that there can be significant commercial pressure for suppliers of domestic transport services to erroneously zero-rate their supply, especially when the recipient of the supply of the domestic transport service is not registered for GST. Naturally, the current rules create a bias towards the international transport supplier of the international transport services also supplying the domestic transport services. This can lead to commercial pressure on domestic courier companies to zero-rate their supplies of domestic transportation services provided as part of the international transport of goods. Tax cascades 5.7 The current rules may create tax cascades when a business that is not registered for GST (such as an offshore courier company) is charged GST by a domestic courier undertaking the domestic leg of the transportation. Any GST charged to a non- registered business by a supplier of the domestic leg of the international transport of goods cannot be refunded by Inland Revenue. Consequently, this GST will become embedded in the price charged for the international transport of the goods and ultimately will become embedded in the price of the goods. Example 21 Brett’s Golf Emporium, a GST-registered golf store from Hamilton, purchases a large order of golf clubs from Luecker Golfing Supplies, a golf equipment manufacturer based in Chicago. Brett’s Golf Emporium hires JASE, an international courier company that is not registered for GST, to transport the golf clubs from Chicago to Hamilton. JASE subcontracts the domestic leg of the transportation to Kim Couriers, JASE’s New Zealand subsidiary. Kim Couriers is registered for GST so charges JASE $115 (including GST) for its supply of domestic transport services. As JASE is not registered for GST, they are unable to recover the $15 GST charged to them by Kim Couriers. The total price charged by JASE to Brett’s Golf Emporium is $215. This price includes the $15 of GST charged to JASE by Kim Couriers. Despite Brett’s Golf Emporium being registered for GST they are unable to reclaim this $15 of GST that is embedded in the price of the international transport of the golf clubs. This unrecoverable GST will therefore become embedded in the price of the golf clubs sold by Brett’s Golf Emporium. 5.8 Tax cascades (where a business absorbs the GST cost that is otherwise irrecoverable and passes this additional cost on to its customers as part of the sales price) can be avoided if non-resident businesses chose to register for GST in New Zealand either under section 51 if they have a taxable activity in New Zealand or section 54B if they do not make taxable supplies in New Zealand but do incur GST. Services provided to international postal agencies 5.9 Section 11A(1)(g) of the GST Act zero-rates services supplied to overseas postal organisations for delivery in New Zealand of postal articles mailed from outside New Zealand, regardless of whether parts of the service are provided by the same transport provider. This difference in GST treatment between courier-delivered 43 packages and postal-delivered packages has unintentionally favoured postal- delivered businesses. Possible solution 5.10 We propose allowing domestic transport services supplied to the primary transport supplier contracted to transport goods to or from New Zealand to be zero-rated if the primary transport supplier is a non-resident. This is similar to the approach taken in Australia and Singapore. Example 22: Non-resident courier subcontracts a domestic courier JASE, a non-resident courier company, is contracted to transport goods from Mumbai to Hamilton. JASE transports the goods to Auckland and subcontracts Kim Couriers to provide domestic transport services between Auckland and Hamilton. Under the current rules Kim Couriers must charge GST on its supply to JASE. Under the proposed rules Kim Couriers can zero-rate its supply of domestic transport services as they are part of the international transport of goods and are supplied to the primary transport supplier who is a non-resident. Example 23: Resident courier subcontracts a domestic courier Laura’s Logistics, a resident courier company, is contracted to transport goods from Stewart Island to New York City. Laura’s Logistics subcontracts Pilko’s Post, a domestic courier company based in Stewart Island, to transport the goods from Stewart Island to Bluff. Laura’s Logistics then transports the goods from Bluff to New York City. Despite Laura’s Logistics being the primary transport suppliers, Pilko’s Post would still need to charge GST on its supply to Laura’s Logistics under the proposed rules. This is because Laura’s Logistics is a resident courier company. Why should domestic transport services only be zero-rated if supplied to a non-resident? 5.11 The rationale for only allowing zero-rating of domestic transport services supplied to the primary transport supplier if the international transport supplier is a non- resident is that non-residents are much less likely to be registered for GST. The commercial pressure to zero-rate the domestic transport services and potential for tax cascades from standard rating domestic transport services only arise when the recipient of these services is not registered for GST. 5.12 In addition, only allowing zero-rating when the international transport supplier is non-resident means the supplier of domestic transport services only needs to determine if their supply is part of the international transport of goods if supplied to a non-resident. 5.13 However, we are interested in receiving feedback on whether it would be better to zero-rate all domestic transport services supplied to the primary transport supplier contracted to transport goods to or from New Zealand regardless of the residency of the primary transport supplier. This approach may be simpler for domestic transport providers because rather than determining the residency of the international transport provider, they would need to identify whether the goods delivery service they are undertaking is related to an international transport service. 44 Domestic transport services supplied as part of the international transport of goods 5.14 Consistent with the existing policy intent, we are proposing that if the international transport supplier is contracted to deliver goods from point A outside New Zealand to point B in New Zealand then they can zero-rate their entire supply. Any domestic transport services contractually supplied to the international primary transport supplier between point A and point B can therefore also be zero-rated if the international transport supplier is non-resident. 5.15 Likewise, if the international transport supplier is contracted to deliver goods from point B in New Zealand to point A outside New Zealand then they can zero-rate this entire supply. Any domestic transport services contractually supplied to the international transport supplier between point B and point A can therefore also be zero-rated if the primary transport supplier is non-resident. 5.16 However, we are interested in feedback on whether we need a more prescriptive definition of what constitutes the international transport of goods. For example, Australia has specific rules to determine when domestic transport services have been supplied as part of the international transport of goods. 5.17 In Australia, the transport of imported goods may be zero-rated up to the place of consignment. This is generally where the goods are to be delivered under the international transport supplier’s contract for international transport services. Any domestic transport services supplied to the international transport supplier until the goods reach the place of consignment can therefore be zero-rated if the international transport supplier is a non-resident. 5.18 Likewise, for the international transport of exported goods Australia allows zero- rating from the final place of collection prior to containerisation. This is the location that the goods will be collected under the international transport supplier’s contract of service before the goods are placed into shipping containers. Any domestic transport services provided to the international transport supplier from the final place of collection prior to containerisation can therefore be zero-rated if the international transport supplier is a non-resident. Questions for submitters • Other than subcontracting arrangements, are there any other commercial practices that should be considered? • Should any amendment to the rule be based on whether the international transport provider is a non-resident, or alternatively, zero-rate all domestic transport services where they relate to an international transport service? • Should any amendment include a prescriptive definition of when domestic transport services have been supplied as part of the international transport of goods? 45 CHAPTER 6 Business conferences and staff training 6.1 GST is designed to be a broad-based low rate tax on consumption of goods and services in New Zealand. When GST has been incurred by businesses making taxable supplies, then the business should be able to recover the GST paid on their business expenses, in a cost-effective way. This includes situations where a business sends their staff to a New Zealand conference or training course. 6.2 A business that is registered for GST can claim GST input credits in relation to the GST it pays for its employees to attend a New Zealand conference (see figure 1). Figure 1: Claiming GST for a New Zealand conference NZ business (GST-registered) NZ conference Conference fees ($2,300 per person) Inland Revenue $300 GST paid $300 GST refund Impractical for offshore businesses to claim back GST on conferences and staff training 6.3 However, most offshore business will not be registered for GST in New Zealand so are unable to claim GST input credits in relation to GST on conference or training fees. 6.4 Although it is possible for such offshore businesses to register for GST (under section 54B of the GST Act) in order to claim refunds, in practice the process of registering for GST solely to claim small, irregular GST refunds can impose an undue compliance on offshore businesses (when their only New Zealand expenses are a one-off or occasional expense of attending a conference). 6.5 For some conferences, a large number of offshore businesses may attend and each of these businesses would need to register for GST and file a GST return if they wished to claim a GST refund. This means the current rules are not a practical way for offshore businesses to recover their GST costs when they attend New Zealand conferences. 46 6.6 To mitigate these practical difficulties, Australia and Singapore have made conferences, staff training, and other services provided to offshore businesses “GST-free” or zero-rated for GST (GST applies at 0%). 6.7 The New Zealand conference industry faces a disadvantage in respect of attracting international conferences compared to Australia and other locations such as Singapore which do not charge GST on business conferences or staff training. In contrast, the European Union countries apply VAT/GST at full rates on conference services provided to offshore businesses. Zero-rating GST on conferences and staff training supplied to non-resident businesses 6.8 To address this issue, officials are proposing to zero-rate GST on conferences, conventions and staff training supplied in New Zealand to non-resident businesses. 6.9 Zero-rating GST for conference services provided to offshore businesses would make it relatively more attractive to host large international conferences in New Zealand. 6.10 The proposal could increase the competitiveness of New Zealand training providers that provide staff training courses. We are interested in any market data available on the current size of this market. Design issues 6.11 In order to implement a clear and robust zero-rating rule, a number of design issues would need to be worked through with the affected conference organisers, business training providers and tax advisors. 6.12 The two main design issues are the definition of a non-resident business and the definition of the qualifying conference or staff training services. Non-resident business 6.13 The rationale for the proposed zero-rating rule is to ensure GST does not impose unrecoverable costs on businesses. Therefore, zero-rating should only apply when the service is supplied to a non-resident business. 6.14 In many cases, training and education services will be received by students in a personal capacity (as opposed to a business buying training for its staff). In such circumstances the training represents final consumption in New Zealand rather than a business input, so it should continue to be standard-rated (subject to 15% GST). 6.15 For the purposes of the proposed zero-rating rule a non-resident business could be defined using the existing criterion in section 54B. That criterion refers to a non- resident who is not registered for GST under section 51 and is registered for a consumption tax (GST or VAT) in a country or territory in which they are resident (or is resident in a country or territory without a consumption tax and would have at least $60,000 of taxable supplies if they were resident in New Zealand). In addition, the zero-rating rule would also not apply to non-resident businesses which 47 were already registered for GST under section 54B as these businesses are already able to claim input credits in respect of New Zealand GST costs. 6.16 A key difference between the existing rules in section 54B and a proposed zero- rating rule for conferences, would be that the New Zealand supplier would need to obtain sufficient information to be able to determine both the residency and business status of the conference attendee. Services which qualify for the zero-rating provision 6.17 Singapore’s GST rules zero-rate exhibitions, conventions, staff training or retraining for business or employment. 6.18 Singapore’s rules also zero-rate services which are supplementary to providing the exhibition, convention or staff training (such as organising these events), but specifically exclude “services related to entertainment and accommodation” (such services are subject to the standard rate of GST). 6.19 Officials consider Singapore’s rules provide a clear boundary between business conferences and staff training and private consumption of tourism activities and that similar zero-rating rules could be used in New Zealand. 6.20 It is proposed that the service would have to relate to a business conference or staff training and there would be specific exclusions for accommodation or entertainment. So, for example, conference fees would be zero-rated but hotels and tourism experiences would continue to be standard-rated (subject to 15% GST). 6.21 However, we note that it is industry practice to “bundle” accommodation and other services (such as hospitality) into a conference or convention attendance fee. There could be a greater incentive to bundle other services (such as entertainment) into a conference package, to subject all of the services to zero-rate. 6.22 Officials are keen to receive submissions on the types of services that are typically bundled into a conference or convention fee, to assist officials with the policy development of this proposal. 6.23 Accordingly, most parts of “incentive tours” that businesses use to reward employees with tourism experiences would remain standard-rated. This is consistent with the fact that similar incentives provided to New Zealand employees as rewards for their work would be liable for fringe benefit tax and subject to GST as they represent private consumption. 6.24 It is therefore proposed that the zero-rating would only apply if a non-resident business uses the service for the purpose of carrying on a taxable activity. This should ensure that training provided to an individual in a personal capacity would not qualify for zero-rating. 48 Questions for submitters • What are the costs, benefits and risks from the proposal to zero-rate GST on business conferences and staff training supplied to non-resident businesses? What data is available to assist with estimating these costs and benefits? • How should a non-resident business be defined and identified by the relevant suppliers? • What type of conference and training services should qualify for the proposed zero- rating? How should these be defined to provide certainty and reduce the risk of private consumption such as tourism activities becoming zero-rated? 49 CHAPTER 7 Managed funds 7.1 This chapter discusses policy options for changing the GST treatment of manager and investment manager services supplied to managed funds. There are differing GST treatments for management services supplied to managed funds 7.2 The current GST treatment of different types of management services supplied to managed funds is complex and inconsistent. 7.3 Consider for example, a KiwiSaver scheme that invests into many underlying funds that specialise in different investments such as United States shares or New Zealand fixed interest. Each of these funds has a manager and investment managers. The KiwiSaver scheme will buy services from a KiwiSaver manager, and for each underlying fund they invest into they will be charged for services provided by managers and investment managers. 7.4 There is a specific GST exemption for the “management of a retirement scheme”, which would apply to the management services provided by the KiwiSaver manager. However, this exemption does not apply when a retirement scheme invests into a general wholesale fund as the managers and investment managers will be providing their services to the wholesale fund rather than the retirement scheme. 7.5 For services provided to wholesale funds there are a range of differing GST practices: • Some managers and investment managers apply 15% GST to all of their services (as in their view their services are providing “advice” or other types of services that are subject to 15% GST). • Others treat ten percent of their services as being subject to 15% GST and the remaining ninety percent as exempt from GST (because they consider their services are mostly “arranging” the buying and selling of investment products and so should qualify for the GST exemption for financial services). 7.6 Inland Revenue analysed the existing law and publicly consulted on two draft questions we’ve been asked outlining the Commissioner’s considered views on how the current GST Act would apply to unit trust managers and investment managers. 2 The draft views concluded that: • Unit trust manager fees are exempt from GST as the unit trust manager is considered to be arranging financial services. • Investment manager fees are subject to 15% GST in the typical case where the unit trust manager is not required to accept decisions made by an 2 PUB00277aa: Goods and Services Tax – GST treatment of fees payable to manager of a unit trust PUB00277bb: Goods and Services Tax – GST treatment of outsourced services in relation to a unit trust 50 investment manager and the investment manager does not have authority to give instructions to the trustee (who holds the assets of the unit trust). In these cases, the investment manager is considered to be providing advice (which is subject to 15% GST), rather than arranging a financial service (which would qualify as an exempt financial service). • Other outsourced services such as administrative or registry services will typically be subject to 15% GST as they are not financial services. 7.7 Because different types of manager and investment manager services can have complex and differing GST treatments, the current GST rules can distort competition by favouring certain types of managed funds, business structures, or judgements for how the supplier may choose to interpret the GST rules (for example, where one interpretation or position may provide them more favourable outcome than an alternative position). 7.8 The current GST rules can also add costs to managed funds products. These costs include compliance costs of identifying and working out the GST treatment of different types of management services and unrecoverable GST costs to the extent to which a provider of exempt financial services is charged GST on their inputs of non-financial services. 7.9 For these reasons, officials propose developing some special rules for determining the GST treatment of manager and investment manager services. The appropriate GST treatment of these services is not obvious as it depends on the policy objectives of the reform. Policy objectives when considering GST treatment of services supplied to managed funds Limiting the GST exemption for financial services 7.10 GST is a broad-based tax with few exemptions. The GST exemption for financial services means these services are undertaxed compared to other services which creates biases (discussed in the next section) and requires increased taxation on other activities to generate the same amount of Government revenue. From a GST policy perspective, the financial services definition should be as limited as necessary. 7.11 The main reason for the proposed GST exemption for financial services is valuation difficulties. These valuation difficulties arise because some financial services involve a mixture of a savings product and a service. These valuation issues do not arise for managers and investment managers as they charge a separate fee for their services (rather than a fee for a bundled mix of services and investment products). Minimising any significant biases that GST may create 7.12 It is important to ensure that GST treatment of various managed fund fees does not provide a significant competitive advantage for certain types of savings products, managed funds, business structures or larger funds which may be better able to reduce or recover some of their GST costs. 51 7.13 For example, because the GST rules currently provide an exemption for “management of a retirement scheme”, there could be a bias for managed funds to invest into specialist retirement funds, rather than more general funds. This may encourage inefficient arrangements. More generally, the retirement scheme exemptions were introduced in 1985 to ensure that the GST exemption for life insurance did not encourage life insurance to be the preferred long-term savings product compared to retirement schemes. Commercial developments with how life insurance products are used, and how retirement funds invest into and are close substitutes for other types of managed funds mean there is no longer a good policy rationale for having different GST rules apply depending on whether the management service is provided to a retirement scheme, compared to another type of managed fund. 7.14 GST exemptions also create a bias for exempt service providers to provide services in-house as they face unrecoverable GST costs from outsourcing. This bias is undesirable given that outsourcing may be more commercially efficient or more consistent with financial market regulations. Providing certainty of GST treatment 7.15 To minimise compliance costs, potential errors or competitive biases it will be important to develop a clear definition of the manager and investment manager services which qualify for a particular GST treatment. Minimising adjustment costs compared to current commercial practices 7.16 Transitional and compliance costs could be reduced by aligning with existing commercial practices. The difficulty is there are a range of current practices. GST treatment of managed funds in other countries 7.17 Looking at the rules in other countries, there are different ways that other GST and VAT systems treat managed funds and investment management services. Australia and Singapore 7.18 Both Australia and Singapore’s GST rules apply GST at standard rates to all services provided to managed funds. However, both these countries then allow the funds to claim back most of the GST costs of their inputs through a reduced input tax credit mechanism. In Australia reduced input tax credits are available for seventy five percent of the GST costs except for trustee fees where only fifty five percent of the GST cost can be deducted. In Singapore a GST remittance is allowed for qualifying funds – the percentage varies each year but is about ninety percent of the GST charged to the fund. 7.19 The rationale for providing a reduced input tax credit is to reduce the bias to perform the relevant services in-house (as there are GST costs from outsourcing but none from the insourcing). Conceptually, the reduced input tax credit should be set so it is equal to the percentage of the outsourced service provider’s fee that comprises their own wages and profits (as opposed to third party costs). In practice, determining the appropriate percentage is not obvious. 52 European Union countries 7.20 A European Union VAT directive requires European Union member states to exempt the “management of special investment funds as defined by member states”. European Union countries exempt management services provided to funds on the basis that the VAT system should not impose additional VAT costs from investing through managed funds, compared to investing in the underlying shares or bonds directly. Policy options for how GST could apply to manager and investment manager services 7.21 Officials propose amending the GST Act definition of “financial services” to provide a more certain and consistent GST treatment for manager and investment manager services supplied to managed funds. 7.22 Three main options for changing the law are discussed below. We welcome submissions on these or other potential policy options. If the law is changed, Inland Revenue will not finalise or implement its view of the current law (which is currently in draft). Making all management services supplied by investment managers and other fund managers taxable supplies 7.23 This option would involve excluding services provided by fund managers and investment managers from the GST Act definition of financial services. 7.24 This would be consistent with the rationale that the financial services exemption should generally be limited to cases where there are valuation issues. This is not the case for fund managers and investment managers as they usually charge a separate fee for their services (rather than a margin or a bundled combination of services and investment products). 7.25 Applying GST to all services provided by fund managers and investment managers could reduce insourcing biases and simplify GST compliance as they would be able to claim input credits for GST charged on their external costs. 7.26 However, because the services that funds provide to investors would still be exempt from GST, applying GST to the manager’s fees charged to funds would impose an unrecoverable GST cost on funds. These GST costs are likely to lead to higher fees and reduced after-tax returns for retail investors. 7.27 Also, if the existing GST exemption for managers of a retirement scheme was retained, there would be inconsistent GST treatment as managers of retirement schemes would have no GST on their fees whereas other types of fund managers would have 15% GST on their fees. This could create biases for investing through retirement funds rather than other types of managed funds and for retirement schemes to be structured so that they receive manager services directly, rather than indirectly through investing in non-retirement funds. 53 Exempting all management services supplied by investment managers and other fund managers 7.28 This option would broaden the GST Act definition of financial services to include fund management. This would involve expanding the existing exemption for managers of a retirement scheme, so it also applies to managers who provide management services to other types of funds. 7.29 A more general exemption for fund managers and investment managers may be justified on the basis that the financial services exemption already extends to some services which are close substitutes for another type of exempt financial service in order to reduce tax distortions on business or investment decisions. For example, because services provided by a manager of a retirement scheme are specifically exempt from GST, a managed fund may prefer to purchase those services as opposed to services provided by an investment manager, unless investment management services are also exempt. 7.30 On the other hand, a broader financial services exemption that includes all fund manager and investment manager fees would narrow the GST base and lead to greater amounts of financial services being only partially subject to GST (on their taxable inputs), compared to other services (such as financial advice) which are subject to 15% GST. 7.31 This creates a bias because an individual investor seeking financial advice would be charged GST for that advice but a managed fund purchasing investment management services (which may include investment advice) would not be charged GST. However, this bias is unlikely to be significant enough to affect decisions about whether to invest into a managed fund or invest directly into shares or bonds. 7.32 Similarly, Discretionary Investment Management Services (DIMS) services may be disadvantaged if they are required to charge GST on their services and managed funds are not. 7.33 An exemption would impose GST costs for managers and investment managers to the extent to which they purchase inputs such as renting office space, hiring contractors, or procuring data, external advice, administrative services or computer services. 7.34 Depending on how the relevant services are defined an exemption could create boundary issues in determining whether a service was a management service or another type of service. For example, there could be incentives to bundle or reclassify some other types of services as being management services to further reduce GST costs for managed funds. 7.35 Providing an exemption for management services would also lead to policy arguments that other types of services provided to managed funds should also be made exempt from GST in order to further reduce GST costs for managed funds. See paragraphs from 7.58 onward for a further discussion about the GST treatment of other types of services provided to managed funds. 7.36 It would be important to develop a robust and certain definition of the services which qualify for any fund management exemption. European Union case law has found that the “management” of an investment fund has a broad meaning for 54 European Union VAT purposes and can include administrative services and advice. In contrast, New Zealand has made policy decisions that administrative services and advice should be subject to 15% GST and should not qualify as exempt financial services. Legislate that managers and investment managers are deemed to have a certain percentage of taxable (subject to GST at 15%) and exempt supplies 7.37 This approach could be used to partly tax the relevant services. It could provide certainty and consistency which may reduce competitive distortions. 7.38 Depending on the percentage used, it could also potentially align with some existing industry practices (ninety percent exempt, ten percent taxable), although this would represent a major change for other managers who are currently treating their supplies as taxable supplies. 7.39 One of the issues with this approach is that it is not obvious what the appropriate percentage should be. Any legislated percentage could either overcompensate or undercompensate relative to the true nature of the manager’s services unless it was supported by evidence. We are interested in submissions on what percentage could be considered a reasonable approximation of the taxable services provided by managers and investment managers. 7.40 As with an exemption option, a partial exemption option would also mean there was less GST charged on these services compared to other types of services which are subject to GST at 15%. 7.41 This option would also be inconsistent with the fact that the GST Act does not usually apportion output tax on supplies. (The main exception to this is section 10(6) which deems sixty percent of domestic goods and services provided in a commercial dwelling to be taxable supplies if the occupant stays for more than four weeks.) 7.42 If the manager is providing multiple types of services to the fund, a better approach could be to apply the analysis for determining if there is a single or multiple supply as discussed in the Inland Revenue Interpretation Statement IS 18/04 (Goods and services tax – single supply or multiple supplies). Applying this analysis would typically conclude that a service is a single supply if it had a dominant element and the other elements were reasonably incidental. This option of deeming a certain percentage of the supply to be taxable would therefore represent a significant departure from this approach. Zero-rating or a reduced input tax credit mechanism 7.43 Compared to an exemption, zero-rating would further reduce the GST costs associated with providing management services to funds, as the managers and investment managers would still be able to claim back the GST costs of their own inputs. 7.44 A reduced input tax credit mechanism for the managers and investment managers would allow partial recovery of the GST costs on the inputs. 55 7.45 Both options give rise to many of the same disadvantages of the exemption or partial exemption options discussed above – such as the need to carefully define manager and investment manager services to provide certainty as to what services qualify for the special GST treatment. 7.46 However, compared to the other policy options, zero-rating or a reduced input tax mechanism would mean the manager and investment manager services would be substantially undertaxed (compared to both other services and to GST-exempt financial services). It would also create a much more significant precedent. Furthermore, compared to current practices it would have a high fiscal cost for the Government. 7.47 While both Australia and Singapore provide reduced input tax credits for managed funds, these countries also have a narrower definition of financial services than New Zealand that excludes services of “arranging” a financial product. Accordingly, the services provided by managers and investment managers are subject to GST in these countries. 7.48 In Australia, reduced input tax credits are available to all financial service providers, not just managed funds. The policy rationale for providing reduced input tax credits is to reduce the bias that an exemption creates to provide inputs in-house rather than outsource these to other providers. It may also be hard to justify why reduced input credits should only be provided for managed funds or managers of managed funds (which for commercial and regulatory reasons often need to outsource certain services regardless of the GST cost) compared to other financial service providers (where GST may create a bigger bias against outsourcing). 7.49 Even if the GST treatment of manager and investment manager fees generates a significant problem by discouraging outsourcing, it is not obvious what percentage of GST should be recoverable under the reduced input tax credit. Conceptually, it should be the percentage of the outsourced service providers’ fees that comprises their profit and staff wages, but in practice this can differ across service providers and will be difficult to reduce into a single percentage. 7.50 For these reasons, officials consider the case for introducing reduced input tax credits would be more appropriately considered as part of a more fundamental review of the financial services definition that considered the full range of financial services, not just manager and investment manager services. Reduced input tax credits are a logical alternative option to providing an exemption for the service of “arranging” a financial product. 7.51 Providing zero-rating or reduced input tax credits would further reduce the partial GST on non-financial services that retail investors benefit from as a result of investing through managed funds. This would make receiving these services through managed funds further advantaged compared to other services, such as individual investors buying their own research or financial advice which would be subject to 15% GST. 7.52 Finally, either a new zero-rating rule or a reduced input tax credit mechanism would have a significant fiscal cost compared to the current rules where GST partially applies to managed funds. For example, zero-rating would effectively allow GST to be removed on all administrative services provided to managed funds as these 56 would be purchased by a manager who makes zero-rated supplies and is able to claim input credits for these GST costs. Application date 7.53 It is proposed that the potential law change could apply prospectively but with grandparenting of existing contracts for a period (for example, three years) to ease adjustment costs and to enable new contracts to be negotiated. Defining the relevant management and investment management services 7.54 The changes would apply to both management services by a manager and investment services by an investment manager that were provided directly or indirectly to a managed investment scheme or a foreign equivalent. 7.55 The terms “manager”, “investment manager” and “managed investment scheme” could be defined by referencing the existing definitions of these terms in section 6(1) and section 9 of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013. Relevant definitions from Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 investment manager means, in relation to a managed investment scheme, a person to whom a manager of the scheme has contracted the investment of some or all of the scheme property. manager means,— (a) in relation to a registered scheme (other than a restricted scheme), the person designated or appointed as the manager of the scheme: (b) in relation to a restricted scheme, the persons designated or appointed as trustees of the scheme or, if only 1 person is designated or appointed as a trustee of the scheme, that person: (c) in relation to a managed investment scheme if there is no person to whom paragraph (a) or (b) applies or if it is not a registered scheme, a person occupying the position of, and carrying out any of the functions of, the manager set out in section 142: 142 Management and administration functions of manager (1) The manager of a registered scheme is responsible for performing the following functions: (a) offering the managed investment products; and (b) issuing the managed investment products; and (c) managing the scheme property and investments; and (d) administering the scheme. 57 managed investment scheme means a scheme to which each of the following applies: (a) the purpose or effect of the scheme is to enable persons taking part in the scheme to contribute money, or to have money contributed on their behalf, to the scheme as consideration to acquire interests in the scheme; and (b) those interests are rights to participate in, or receive, financial benefits produced principally by the efforts of another person under the scheme (whether those rights are actual, prospective, or contingent, and whether they are enforceable or not); and (c) the holders of those interests do not have day-to-day control over the operation of the scheme (whether or not they have the right to be consulted or to give directions). 7.56 “Foreign equivalents” would include Australian Managed Investment Trusts (AMITs) and other entities subject to the AMIT regulatory regime as well as other foreign funds that are comparable to the relevant New Zealand funds. 7.57 The proposed changes would also apply to “out of fund” fees. Out of fund fees are charged in cases where a fund invests into a second wholesale fund that is managed by another manager, but the management fee of that other manager is invoiced directly to the manager of the first fund. This practice occurs to ensure that there is no duplication of investment management fees. Other outsourced services which are not management services 7.58 Officials do not propose changing the GST treatment of other services provided to managed funds such as accounting, administrative or registry services. These outsourced services are generally subject to GST (taxable supplies) unless they are themselves exempt financial services. 7.59 We consider it is sensible to draw a distinction between providing management services to a fund and providing other types of services. 7.60 Providing a special GST treatment such as an exemption for administrative services provided to managed funds would create a precedent and make it difficult to justify continuing to apply 15% GST to administrative services provided to other financial service providers such as banks or life insurers. 7.61 There is already an existing precedent for exempting the “management” of a retirement scheme. In addition, under the current GST rules three similar types of fund management services (management of a retirement scheme, managers of managed investment schemes and investment managers) can have three different GST treatments which creates more significant uncertainty and biases on how these services are arranged or priced. 58 7.62 The same uncertainties and inconsistent GST treatments should be much less likely to arise for administrative services as there is a clearer position that such services are taxable in the typical cases where they are outsourced (as opposed to being incidental services supplied as part of a much larger, single supply of an exempt financial service). 7.63 The legislative position whereby GST applies to such outsourced administrative inputs was established in 1987 through the decision in Databank Systems Ltd v CIR (1987) 9 NZTC 6,213 which found that Databank was providing computing services to banks rather than financial services. As a result of the Databank proceedings, a clarifying amendment was also made to explicitly exclude “general accounting and record-keeping” services from the definition of financial services. Questions for submitters • What are the pros, cons or practical issues associated with each of the policy options? How well would they achieve the policy objectives? • What types of manger and investment manager services should the proposed policy or law change apply to? What is the clearest way to define the relevant services? • If the law was changed, what transitional issues could arise and what measures could be implemented to enable a smooth transition to the new law? 59 CHAPTER 8 Insurance pay-outs to third parties 8.1 The GST rules require GST-registered recipients of an insurance pay-out to return GST on these pay-outs. When a GST-registered recipient of an insurance pay-out is a third party to the insurance contract, they may not be aware they are receiving a payment which is covered by insurance. As a consequence, they may fail to comply with the rules or may be under-compensated as they did not expect to have to return GST on the payment. 8.2 This chapter discusses some potential options for mitigating this issue. Current GST rules for insurance 8.3 The GST Act includes special rules for applying GST to general (non-life) insurance. Insurers pay GST output tax on premiums they receive and claim GST input credits on the total amount of their pay-outs. 8.4 If the insured party is a GST-registered person who is insuring their taxable activity they can claim deductions for GST input credits in relation to the GST that is charged on their insurance premiums. 8.5 Section 5(13) of the GST Act requires GST to be returned on insurance pay-outs received by GST-registered persons to the extent that it relates to a loss incurred in the course and furtherance of the person’s taxable activity (for example, their business, rather than a private use). It does this by deeming the GST-registered person to have made a taxable supply to an insurer when they receive a payment under a contract of insurance, “whether or not they are a party to the insurance contract”. 8.6 This means that even if the recipient of the insurance pay-out is a third party to the insurance policy, they will still be required to return GST output tax if they are a GST-registered person and the loss is incurred in the course and furtherance of their taxable activity (such as an asset used for their business). 8.7 This deeming rule is not intuitive, as the GST-registered person has not made a sale or supplied any actual goods or services to the insurer. Also, GST does not generally apply to compensation payments. So, if the third party had received a compensation payment that was not covered by insurance, GST would not apply to the payment. 8.8 Problems can arise when the insurance pay-out is made to a third party, rather than the insured person. Intended operation of rules when insurance pay-out is to a GST-registered third party 8.9 A typical scenario involves: 60 • an insured party causes loss to a third party (for example, vehicle or property damage, professional liability, and so on); • the insurer assists the insured party to reach a settlement agreement between the insured party and the third party which specifies a sum to be received by the third party. 8.10 If the insurer makes a payment to an GST-registered insured party who caused the loss in the course and furtherance of their taxable activity, the insured party is liable to return GST under section 5(13) on the payment, and typically the amount of the pay-out would be grossed up to account for this. The insured party then pays the funds to the third party under the settlement agreement and because that payment is a compensation payment it is typically not subject to GST. This is illustrated in figure 2. Figure 2: Pay-out to a GST-registered insured party General insurer Insured business $115,000 insurance pay-out Inland Revenue Third-party business Repair businses $100,000 compensation payment (not subject to GST) $15,000 input tax $15,000 input tax $115,000 cost of repairs $15,000 output tax Net GST collected = NIL (GST neutral because all the supplies are B2B) 8.11 However, we understand that insurers will usually direct the payment to the third party, rather than the insured party in cases where the insurance policy is covering a loss to the third party. 8.12 The insurer can claim an input tax deduction in relation to the insurance pay-out regardless of whether it pays the insured party or the third party. However, the third party may be unaware of the nature of the payment. 8.13 If the third party knows the settlement payment is an insurance pay-out and correctly applies section 5(13) of the GST Act, they would return GST output tax on the payment. This is illustrated figure 3 which provides the same overall GST outcomes as figure 2. 61 Figure 3: Pay-out to third party who correctly returns GST on the payment General insurer Insured business Inland Revenue Third-party business Repair businses $15,000 input tax $15,000 input tax $115,000 cost of repairs $15,000 output tax $115,000 Insurance pay -out $15,000 output tax Net GST collected = NIL Problems occur when a GST-registered third-party is unaware of source of the payment 8.14 A GST-registered third party may often not know whether the source of the funds is from the insured party or an insurer, as the payment will usually be disbursed from a solicitor’s trust account. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that an insurer may conceal its involvement in the dispute to lower the third party’s expectations of a sizeable settlement. The insurer will benefit where the third party is unaware of the insurer’s involvement and does not require the settlement to be grossed up for GST. This is because the third party may incorrectly assume they are receiving a compensation payment which is not subject to GST and therefore not return any GST on the payment. 8.15 The scenario where the third party does not know they are receiving an insurance payment is illustrated in figure 4, which results in a revenue loss to Inland Revenue and corresponding cost saving to the insurer compared to figures 2 and 3. 62 Figure 4: Pay-out to third-party who does not know the pay-out is covered by insurance General insurer Insured business Inland Revenue Third-party business (unaware that payment is an insurance pay-out and therefore does not return GST) Repair businses $13,000 input tax $115,000 cost of repairs $15,000 output tax $100,000 Insurance pay-out Net GST collected = $13,000 revenue loss to Inland Revenue $13,000 cost saving to insurer compared to figures 2 and 3 Scale of the problem 8.16 Officials do not have enough information to quantify the magnitude of these issues. 8.17 However, the potential fiscal risk is high given the commercial incentives to negotiate a lower settlement amount. For example, reaching agreement on a settlement amount of $10 million, rather than needing to gross that amount up to a $11.5 million (to offset the GST that is required to be paid by the recipient), could represent a $1.3 million cost saving for the insurer. 8.18 Inland Revenue has dealt with an increasing number of disputes involving section 5(13). Several tax and legal advisors have also raised concerns with us that GST may not be properly considered in negotiated settlements with third parties, leaving the third party undercompensated or at risk of an unexpected GST liability. 8.19 We are interested in submitters’ views about the scale of the problem described above and their experiences with trying to apply the existing requirements. 8.20 In particular, is it obvious when a payment is an insurance payment (subject to GST) or a compensation payment (not subject to GST)? Are the legal advisors that deal with claims or settlements involving insurance generally aware of the existing requirements of section 5(13) of the GST Act? Do they take care to ensure the agreed amount is grossed up to include GST and that GST-registered recipients of insurance payment correctly return output tax as required by section 5(13)? 63 Policy options for improving certainty and compliance with GST on insurance pay- outs 8.21 We have identified three main options for mitigating this issue and providing more certainty for third parties who are negotiating such settlements. Making the insurer responsible for the GST obligations 8.22 We consider the most effective way to address the problem would be to make the insurer (rather than the person receiving the pay-out) responsible for the GST obligations. 8.23 This could be achieved by amending section 5(13) so it operates as a reverse charge on the insurer. This would mean that the insurer, rather than the third party, would be deemed to make a taxable supply and required to pay the GST when the requirements of section 5(13) apply. This is illustrated in figure 5. Figure 5: Pay-out to third party with a reverse charge on insurer General insurer Insured business Inland Revenue Third-party business Repair businses $115,000 cost of repairs $15,000 output tax $115,000 insurance pay-out $15,000 output tax $15,000 input tax $15,000 input tax Net GST collected = NIL 8.24 Alternatively, section 20(3)(d) could be amended to deny the insurer an input tax deduction for insurance pay-outs where the current section 5(13) applies to the payment (that is, the payment is to a GST-registered person and relates to a loss incurred in the course and furtherance of that person’s taxable activity). Under this approach, a consequential amendment would be made to repeal section 5(13) so there would no longer be any GST output tax on the recipients of insurance payments. 64 Figure 6: Pay-out to third party with no input credit for insurer General insurer Insured business Inland Revenue Third-party business Repair businses $115,000 cost of repairs $15,000 output tax $115,000 insurance pay -out $15,000 input tax Net GST collected = NIL 8.25 Limiting the input deduction under section 20(3)(d) would appear to be simpler than a reverse charge but we invite submissions on which type of amendment would be less costly for insurers to implement. 8.26 Either of the proposed amendments would require the insurer to determine whether the person receiving the pay-out is GST-registered and whether the insurance pay- out relates to a loss incurred in the course or furtherance of their taxable activity (as opposed to a private or exempt activity). 8.27 This would increase compliance costs for insurers as they would need to request information about the recipient’s GST status, and they would need to implement new systems to treat pay-outs differently depending on the GST status of the recipient. 8.28 In cases where a damaged asset is partly used for a taxable and non-taxable activity (such as a residential home with a home office, or a work vehicle with private use) it would also be necessary to determine to what extent the insurance payment relates to a taxable asset. In such cases it could be difficult for the insurer to obtain information from the recipient of the pay-out to correctly account for GST on payment. 8.29 One possible solution to this issue could be to require the insurer to account for the full amount of GST output tax (or not claim any input tax credit) when an insurance payment is made to a GST-registered person (regardless of the extent to which the payment was connected to the registered person’s taxable activity). A corresponding amendment could be introduced to allow a GST-registered person who receives that payment to be able to claim a new type of GST deduction under section 20(3) to the extent to which the insurance payment was made in respect of 65 an asset that was not used by the registered person to make taxable supplies (for example, a private or exempt use). 8.30 We note that non-resident suppliers of remote services (which includes general insurance) are already required to determine if they are supplying services to a GST- registered person as part of that person’s taxable activity (see section 8(4D)). In that case the Commissioner can agree that a supplier can use an alternative method for determining if they are making supplies to a GST-registered person. This type of approach could be used to assist insurers if they were required to determine whether they were making a pay-out to a GST-registered person. 8.31 Australia’s GST rules for general insurance require insurers to distinguish between pay-outs in relation to insurance contracts with GST-registered persons and contracts with unregistered persons. Under Australia’s rules the insurer is only entitled to a GST deduction (called a decreasing adjustment) in cases where the insured party did not claim a GST deduction in respect of the premiums paid on that insurance contract. We would be interested in submitters’ views about any compliance costs that this differing GST treatment of insurance claims creates for Australian insurers. 8.32 Making the insurer responsible for GST could reduce compliance costs on other GST-registered businesses as they would no longer have to return GST on insurance pay-outs, and they could treat insurance pay-outs the same as compensation payments (which are not subject to GST). 8.33 In addition, as discussed above the insurer will know the settlement payment is an insurance payment, whereas a GST-registered third party is often unaware of the nature of the payment. Even if they knew the payment is insurance, they may not be aware of the GST rules (in section 5(13) of the GST Act) which require them to return GST on insurance payments. 8.34 Officials are concerned that this option would impose high compliance costs and systems changes on insurers and welcome submissions explaining these costs. Officials are also interested in working with insurers, legal and tax advisors and affected businesses to develop some alternative options to address the problem. Two of these alternatives are discussed. 8.35 However, if these alternatives are not effective at improving GST compliance and Inland Revenue continues to observe and receive feedback that the commercial incentives to not disclose insurance make complying with GST too difficult, it may become necessary to shift GST obligations onto the insurer if this is the only way to effectively address the fiscal risk and fairness concerns. Requiring disclosure that the payment is covered by insurance 8.36 An alternative option would be to require the insurer to disclose in writing to the third party that the amount of their settlement payment is covered by insurance and that if they are registered for GST, they may be required to return GST on that amount under section 5(13). 8.37 This information would allow the third party to be aware of their GST obligations and consider if the amount of the settlement is sufficient (or if it needs to be grossed up to account for GST). 66 8.38 The timing of the disclosure would need to be considered. In order to be fair to the third party, they would need to know about the GST implications prior to agreeing to the settlement. However, such a disclosure requirement may lead to the agreed settlement amount being significantly higher in those cases where it is covered by insurance. This could have a flow-on effect in increasing the costs for businesses in obtaining public or professional indemnity insurance to cover the risk of potential damages to other GST-registered persons. 8.39 Another consideration is the consequences for the insurer if they fail to disclose the information. One potential consequence would be to shift the GST liability to the insurer (as opposed to the GST-registered person) but this may create uncertainty and disputes about who is liable for the GST. Another possibility would be a separate standalone penalty on insurers who fail to disclose the information, but it may be difficult to set this penalty at the right amount to promote compliance (considering the potential cost savings from non-compliance will vary depending on the amount of the payment). 8.40 Information disclosure requirements could also lead to confusion. For example, a large number of insurance recipients are not registered for GST, but may become prompted by an information disclosure to consider whether or not GST obligations apply to them. This may lead to increased contacts and questions to insurers, advisors or Inland Revenue. One way to mitigate this could be to target the information disclosure requirement so it only applies to those insurance products where the problem is most likely to arise such as commercial property or professional liability insurance. No law change, but provide education and guidance 8.41 The least disruptive option would be to retain the current insurance rules but provide education and guidance for advisors and GST-registered businesses. 8.42 If third party claimants were aware of the potential GST risk they could ask for advice as to who is paying the settlement amount, or the source of the settlement amount, and ask for either a GST gross-up and/or a GST indemnity. 8.43 For example, when negotiating settlement agreements, a third party could include a warranty that the payment they are receiving is not a payment of insurance or require the settlement amount be “plus GST, if any”. Under such an agreement, the third party would be able to require the payment to be grossed up by the insured party in those cases where they discover they must return output tax on an insurance payment under section 5(13) of the GST. 8.44 However, in our view, this option is unlikely to be effective. It relies on the third party (or more likely their tax and legal advisors) being both: • aware and sufficiently concerned about the GST risk; and • being able to obtain information that the insured party (or their insurer) has commercial incentives to not provide (in order to lower the third party’s expectations about the amount of an acceptable settlement). 8.45 Also, just because the settlement agreement includes a “plus GST if any” clause or a GST indemnity it does not mean that the recipient will return GST on insurance payments as they may mistakenly believe that the payment is not subject to GST. 67 If the recipient of an insurance payment fails to return GST, they could be liable for penalties and interest if the error is subsequently identified. The third party could also be exposed in cases where the insured party goes out of business. 8.46 It could be difficult to adequately alert the potentially affected parties (or their advisors) of the issue, particularly as negotiating a large insurance settlement will be an unlikely or rare event for most GST-registered persons. Application date 8.47 Any law change would apply prospectively from a future date after the date the relevant legislation was enacted (which could be in 2021). 8.48 We invite submissions on how much lead time submitters consider could be necessary (for example, following enactment of any new legislation) for the affected parties to prepare their systems in order to comply with the potential legislative options discussed above. 8.49 We also invite submissions on potential compliance costs and systems impacts of the policy options described above and if there are ways to design the proposed rules to mitigate some of these impacts. Questions for submitters • When a damaged third-party receives an insurance or compensation payment is it difficult for them to determine whether or not the payment comes from an insurer? • In what situations does the problem occur and what information is available to assess the potential scale of the problem? • What are the costs, benefits and practical issues associated with the policy options? How much lead time would insurers or other affected parties need to implement these options? 69 CHAPTER 9 Compulsory zero-rating of land 9.1 The GST Act requires a supply that wholly or partly consists of land to be zero- rated if the supply: • is made by a registered person to another registered person who acquires the supply with the intention of using the goods and services for making taxable supplies; and • is not a supply of land intended to be used as a principal place of residence of the recipient of the supply or a person connected with them by blood relationship, marriage, civil union, de facto relationship or adoption. 9.2 This chapter consults on several suggested technical amendments to address situations where the current compulsory zero-rating of land rules appear to produce flawed outcomes or the timing of when the relevant provision applies could be improved. These scenarios include: • Clarifying the relationship between sections 5(23) and 78F where land is incorrectly treated as zero-rated. • Non-taxable supplies of land that have been incorrectly treated as zero-rated. • The date that the deemed supply under section 5(23) should occur on. • The taxable period for the adjustment when a second-hand goods deduction has been incorrectly claimed by purchaser of zero-rated land. • The date of output tax adjustment under section 20(3J) which applies when a person acquires zero-rated land that they intend to use for both taxable and non-taxable purposes. Relationship between sections 5(23) and 78F when land is incorrectly treated as zero- rated 9.3 Where the land zero-rating rules are incorrectly applied to treat a supply as zero- rated, the purchaser of the land is required to return GST on the supply under section 5(23). Section 5(23) provides that if a supply of land is incorrectly zero-rated and this fact is discovered after the date on which the transaction was settled, the recipient of the supply is treated as though they were a supplier making the supply of land on the date of settlement. 9.4 Section 78F requires the recipient of the land to notify the supplier whether at the date of settlement they will be a GST-registered person and are acquiring the land with an intention to make taxable supplies and do not intend to use the land as a principal place of residence for themselves or an associated person. 9.5 It is not clear how section 5(23) interacts with the requirement in section 78F for the recipient of the land to provide information to the supplier. 70 Suggested solution 9.6 We propose making an amendment to clarify that section 5(23) applies to place the output tax liability on the purchaser, in cases where a vendor incorrectly zero-rates land (as a matter of fact), regardless of the information that was provided (or not provided) by the recipient of the land under the section 78F disclosure requirement. 9.7 The policy concern that the business-to-business zero-rating of land rules were trying to address was phoenix fraud by the vendor. The GST liability should be placed on the purchaser whenever a supply of land was incorrectly zero-rated because that still enables Inland Revenue to recover the unpaid GST if the vendor ceases to operate, as the purchaser has a valuable asset (land) and is likely to continue their taxable activity. This approach is also consistent with the original policy proposal for addressing phoenix fraud which was to introduce a reverse charge mechanism on the purchaser (this was later changed to a zero-rating mechanism in response to submissions). 9.8 The proposed amendment would provide certainty that the purchaser is always liable for any GST output tax liability. However, we acknowledge that the proposed approach places a lot of risk on the purchaser. 9.9 In particular, it could lead to unfair outcomes in some cases where a vendor has unilaterally and incorrectly zero-rated the supply contrary to the purchaser’s section 78F information disclosure, either by mistake or by a deliberate act to shift the output tax liability onto the recipient of the land. This may occur because the vendor is “trying to get it right” and thinks that the recipient’s statement is either wrong or is likely to change. It also includes the situation where the vendor simply ignores the recipient’s statement (despite the statement being correct). 9.10 We note that these issues can be resolved through the contracts between the parties. For example, if the contract price is expressed as “plus GST (if any)” the vendor will have nothing to gain from zero-rating the supply, so any incorrect zero-rating will be because they have simply made a mistake. With a plus GST (if any) contract price, the purchaser will have agreed to assume contractual liability to pay an additional amount for any GST. Therefore, if section 5(23) applies, the purchaser will pay the GST to Inland Revenue but will also be eligible for an input tax credit to claim back this additional GST. Non-taxable supply incorrectly treated as zero-rated 9.11 Section 5(23) will achieve the correct result in circumstances where a supply of land has been incorrectly zero-rated as a result of the registration status of the purchaser (that is, the purchaser is not registered for GST or does not acquire the goods and services for the purpose of making taxable supplies). However, an anomalous result arises where a supply is incorrectly treated as zero-rated owing to the vendor’s registration status or by way of oversight as a result of the vendor carrying on both taxable and non-taxable activities. This anomaly is illustrated in example 24. 71 Example 24: Property sold was held in trust unrelated to trust’s taxable activity The M Trust carries on a taxable activity and is GST-registered, but also has property holdings unrelated to the taxable activity which relate to residential accommodation for the beneficiaries. The property is sold for $1 million plus GST if any to Chris who acquires the land to make taxable supplies. Chris does not intend to use the land as a principal place of residence for himself or any person associated with him under section 2A(1)(c) and is not associated with any of the trustees of the M Trust. Matthew, the trustee of M Trust treats the supply of the land as zero-rated. It is discovered after settlement of the transaction that this is an error. Section 5(23) applies to treat Chris as making a supply of the land in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity for $1 million. Chris is therefore required to account to Inland Revenue for output tax of $150,000. As Chris is acquiring the land for the purposes of making taxable supplies, he will be able to claim $150,000 as input tax, meaning that the net cost of the land to him is $1 million. However, the supply should not have been subject to GST at all in the first place. Instead, Chris should have been entitled to a second-hand goods input tax deduction of $130,434.78 (assuming that Chris is not associated with Matthew or any of the other trustees of the M Trust under section 2A(1)). This would have made the net cost of the land to Chris $869,565.22. This position cannot be rectified by re-characterising the transaction correctly. This is because if it is found after settlement that the supply was incorrectly zero-rated, the transaction is not re- characterised; instead, section 5(23) applies to deem a taxable supply made by Chris. 9.12 This issue may also arise when the Commissioner of Inland Revenue cancels the vendor’s registration (after the date of settlement) with retrospective effect to the date of settlement or earlier. In these instances, the transaction may be incorrectly treated by the vendor as zero-rated on the date of settlement (this treatment being incorrect as a consequence of the retrospective deregistration, as the retrospective deregistration would mean the vendor was not a “registered person” on the date of settlement). Suggested solution 9.13 An amendment could be made so that, where it is discovered after the date of settlement that section 11(1)(mb) was incorrectly applied by the vendor and the relevant supply is in fact not a taxable supply, section 5(23) does not apply and the original supply is instead re-characterised to be a non-taxable supply. Date of deemed supply under section 5(23) 9.14 As mentioned above, section 5(23) treats the purchaser as making a taxable supply on the date of settlement. This means the resulting output tax is attributed to the taxable period in which the original supply was made. This can be contrasted with the credit and debit note provisions in section 25, where the liability to pay output tax does not arise until the parties have become aware of the need to adjust the output tax returned and input tax claimed. 9.15 Where the purchaser is acquiring the goods and services for the purpose of making taxable supplies, there is no rule deeming the input tax deduction to also arise in the period in which settlement occurred. The practical effect of this is that the recipient of the supply is required to issue themselves with a tax invoice in respect of the supply they are deemed to make under section 5(23), and then claim an input tax 72 deduction in a later period. The timing difference means that in the period in which settlement occurs, the recipient will have underpaid GST, even though the net effect of the transaction is GST-neutral. Suggested solution 9.16 An amendment could be made so that the recipient of the incorrectly zero-rated supply is treated as making a supply on the date that it becomes apparent that the original supply was incorrectly treated as zero-rated. Taxable period for adjustment when a second-hand goods deduction has been incorrectly claimed by purchaser of zero-rated land 9.17 Section 25AB of the GST Act is designed to ensure that the rules dealing with changes in the consideration for a supply of second-hand goods apply correctly to deductions claimed by a GST-registered purchaser of second-hand goods. 9.18 When the terms of a contract for the supply of goods or services are varied (for example, by a discount being subsequently offered), the supplier may be required to issue a debit or credit note to the recipient if the supply is taxable. This triggers obligations on both the GST-registered supplier and a GST-registered purchaser to correct their tax position. 9.19 This requirement did not work well when a supply of second-hand goods was not a taxable supply. Although a second-hand goods deduction was available for a GST- registered purchaser (to the extent that they used the goods for making taxable supplies), the debit and credit note rules did not clearly apply to correct the purchaser’s GST position where the consideration for the goods changed. 9.20 Section 25AB applies to a supply of second-hand goods to a registered person when the GST-registered purchaser claimed a second-hand goods deduction, and the amount of the claimed deduction exceeds the correct amount as a result of one of the following events: • the supply has been cancelled; • the nature of the supply has been fundamentally varied or altered; • the previously agreed price of the goods changes, whether through the offer of a discount or by other means; • the goods (or part of those goods) supplied have been returned to the supplier; or • the compulsory zero-rating of land rules were incorrectly applied to the supply, so that the supply was not treated as zero-rated when it should have been. 9.21 In these circumstances, section 25AB requires the purchaser of the goods to return the excess amount of the deduction claimed as output tax for the taxable period in which one of the events referred to above occurred. 9.22 Requiring the adjustment to be made in the taxable period in which the event occurred should lead to the correct result where the relevant event is the cancellation 73 of a supply, decrease in the amount of consideration for a supply or the return of goods or services. In these cases, the purchaser should be aware of the occurrence of the relevant event when it happens. 9.23 A problem with this requirement however arises in the following scenario: • A person supplies land to a GST-registered purchaser who intends to use the land for making taxable supplies. The purchaser will not use the land as a principal place of residence for themselves or for a natural person associated with them under section 2A(1)(c). • The vendor is not registered for GST at the date of settlement, but as at that date, has a liability to register for GST. Therefore, in terms of the definition of “registered person” in section 2(1) of the GST Act, the vendor is a “registered person” at the date of settlement. The conditions for zero-rating are therefore met, but the purchaser would not know this at the time of settlement. • Based on the vendor’s representation that they are not GST-registered, the purchaser claims a second-hand goods credit for the acquisition of the land. This means the purchaser underpays the amount of GST they are liable to return for that period. • The Commissioner discovers that the vendor should have been registered and registers the vendor, back dated to before the date of settlement. • Section 25AB therefore requires the purchaser to make an output tax adjustment for underpaid GST (equal to the amount of the second-hand goods deduction claimed on the acquisition of the land). 9.24 The issue is that section 25AB(2) requires the adjustment to be made for the taxable period in which the relevant “event” occurred (which in this case is the incorrect application of the land zero-rating rules to the treatment of the supply, so that it was not zero-rated when it should have been). This would lead to the purchaser incurring debit interest for the excess deduction claimed. 9.25 While in some cases the purchaser may be able to recover these interest costs (along with the amount of the denied second-hand goods deduction) from the vendor, this is not an ideal policy outcome. This result would be particularly problematic in cases where the GST return for the taxable period in which the supply was made was time-barred, resulting in a revenue loss to the Crown. Suggested solution 9.26 The requirement that the GST-registered purchaser make an output tax adjustment for the taxable period in which the event occurred could be replaced with a requirement that the adjustment be made for the taxable period in which it became apparent that the amount of input tax deducted was incorrect. Date of output tax adjustment under section 20(3J) 9.27 If a person acquires zero-rated land that they intend to use for both taxable and non- taxable purposes they must calculate and return the portion of the nominal GST component relating to non-taxable use as output tax. Section 20(3J) requires the 74 recipient of the zero-rated land to calculate and return the output tax for the non- taxable use of the land on “acquisition”. 9.28 It is not clear when acquisition of the land occurs for the purposes of section 20(3J). For instance, acquisition may be viewed as occurring at the time of supply, settlement, unconditional contract or at some other time. Section 20(3J) should therefore be clarified to make it clear exactly when the recipient must calculate and return output tax for the portion of the nominal GST component that relates to non- taxable use. Suggested solution 9.29 Time of supply seems to be an appropriate time in which the recipient should have to return the output tax. If the land was not zero-rated, the supplier would have to return output tax for the taxable period in which the time of supply occurred (assuming they use the invoice or hybrid accounting basis). Therefore, using time of supply as the trigger for when an output tax adjustment is required to be made under section 20(3J) would ensure that output tax is returned at the same time, regardless of whether the land is zero-rated or not. 9.30 Officials suggest that this amendment should apply for supplies made on or after 1 April 2011, being the date that the compulsory zero-rating of land provisions came into force, but submissions are invited on whether application from the date of enactment may be more appropriate. Questions for submitters • What are your views on these issues and the suggested solutions? • Are there other policy or practical issues with the compulsory zero-rating of land rules which officials should consider? 75 CHAPTER 10 Technical and remedial issues 10.1 This chapter seeks feedback on several proposals which involve more minor or technical changes to the GST Act. These proposals relate to: • GST grouping rules; • input credits on goods not physically received yet at the time GST return is filed; • second-hand goods input tax credits on supplies between associated persons; • providing more flexibility for the Commissioner to approve the end date of a taxable period; • members of non-statutory boards; and • challenge rights in relation to a decision of the Commissioner to re-open time- barred GST returns. 10.2 We also welcome submissions with suggestions for other technical amendments or remedial matters which could improve or correct the operation of provisions in the GST Act. GST grouping rules 10.3 The GST grouping rules are intended to reduce distortions that might arise between a single entity, a branch structure and a group structure. For example, by disregarding intra-group taxable supplies, a group of companies is treated in the same way as a single company that might make taxable supplies between different departments or branches. In the case of a single company, the supply would be a “self-supply” and disregarded. The grouping rules ensure that in the case of a group of companies, the supply may similarly be disregarded. 10.4 The GST grouping rules are also intended to reduce compliance costs. For example, the representative member is responsible for filing a single consolidated GST return on behalf of all members in the GST group, which reduces compliance costs for group members who do not all need to file separate GST returns. Also, by disregarding supplies between group members for GST purposes, the cost of accounting for these intra-group supplies is reduced. Clarify how the GST grouping rules relate to the other provisions in the GST Act 10.5 There is currently no legislative guidance on how the grouping rules should interact with the other parts of the GST Act. We note that there are two different interpretations – the first interpretation (the narrow interpretation) is that other provisions are applied before the grouping rules. Under the second interpretation (the wide interpretation), the grouping rules are applied before other provisions. 76 Applying other provisions first (the narrow interpretation) 10.6 Under this approach, by deeming the representative member to make a group member’s supply, the supply is still treated as “made” by the group member and simply attributed to the representative member. Applying the grouping rules first (the wide interpretation) 10.7 By deeming the representative member to make a group member’s supply, the supply is treated as “made” by the representative member. Comment 10.8 These two possible interpretations and some examples of where they produce differing outcomes are further explained in IRRUIP 13 Consequences of GST Group Registration issues paper which was released in April 2019. 10.9 In most cases, it does not matter which interpretation is applied. The outcome and analysis are the same under both interpretations. 10.10 In some cases, the wide interpretation provides an outcome that is more consistent with the purpose of the grouping rules. For example, the wide interpretation is more likely to reduce distortions that might arise between a New Zealand resident single entity, a New Zealand resident entity with an offshore branch, and a group structure with a New Zealand-resident representative member. 10.11 Another case where the wide interpretation helps achieve the policy intent is where a holding company group member is used to raise capital on behalf of another group member which is the operating company. In this case the holding company may only make exempt supplies of financial services, so under the narrow view could be unable to claim input tax deductions for capital raising costs. This is because the taxable supplies of the operating company group member would not be considered when determining if section 20H 3 can be applied by the holding company. Under the wider view, the taxable supplies made by the operating company would be considered, which is consistent with the policy intent of the capital raising deduction rules. Suggested solution 10.12 We consider it would be useful to add a provision to clarify how the GST grouping rules should be applied in relation to the other provisions in the Act. 10.13 Specifically, the new provision could clarify that the GST grouping rules in section 55(7) should be applied prior to the application of other provisions in the Act. This would be consistent with the wide interpretation that is described in IRRUIP 13 Consequences of GST Group Registration. 3 The provision of the GST Act which contains the rules for the treatment of GST incurred in making financial services for raising funds. 77 Allow the representative member to issue invoices on behalf of all group members 10.14 A practical issue that arises from the wide interpretation is whether there is an ability for the representative member to issue tax invoices on behalf of other group members. This is because section 55(7)(h) states that grouping does not affect a registered person’s obligations under section 24. Section 24 requires a registered person to issue tax invoices. 10.15 Requiring each individual group member to issue their own tax invoices in cases where their supplies are deemed to be made by the representative group member would reduce some of the benefits that GST grouping has in reducing compliance costs by allowing GST accounting to be consolidated within the representative member. Suggested solution 10.16 Officials consider an amendment to allow the representative member to be able to issue a tax invoice on behalf of all members, regardless of whether or not those members are registered or unregistered would be appropriate. Input tax credits on goods not physically received yet at the time the GST return is filed 10.17 Section 20(3C) provides that where goods are acquired by a registered person, an input tax deduction is allowed to the extent to which the goods are “used for, or are available for use in” making taxable supplies. 10.18 The issue is whether goods are “available for use” if the registered person has not yet physically acquired those goods by the time they file their GST return. For example, they may have paid for or received an invoice for purchase of the goods, but the goods may not have been delivered to them yet. 10.19 Section 20(3C) was introduced in 2010. The previous rule required the registered person to consider the “principal purpose” of the goods. 10.20 This suggests that from a policy perspective section 20(3C) is intended to limit the deduction to the extent to which the goods will be used to make taxable supplies (as opposed to a non-taxable use such as private use or exempt supplies). Suggested solution 10.21 It was not intended to exclude input tax credits in cases where the person has not yet obtained physical possession of the goods. Therefore, it is proposed that section 20(3C) be amended to clarify that the requirement is met to the extent to which the goods are “used for, or are expected to be used for, or are available for use in,” making taxable supplies. 10.22 We consider this would be a remedial amendment which should apply retrospectively from 1 April 2011, as this is the date from which section 20(3C) first applied. 78 Second-hand goods input tax credits on supplies between associated persons 10.23 Section 3A(3)(a) of the GST Act limits a second-hand goods input tax credit on supplies between associated persons to the lesser of: (i) the tax included in the original cost of the goods to the supplier; and (ii) the tax fraction of the purchase price; and (iii) the tax fraction of the open market value of the supply. 10.24 In many cases the supplier may have purchased an asset for which they were not charged any GST (although GST costs can be embedded in the cost of the asset). As example 25 illustrates this can lead to section 3A(3)(a)(i) denying the ability to claim any second-hand goods input tax credit: Example 25: No ability to claim a second-hand goods input credit for an associated supply A developer sells a property to Sam for $1.15 million, including $150,000 of GST. Sam is not registered for GST (or, if registered does not use the property to make taxable supplies). Two months later Sam sells the property for $1.15 million to John. As this sale is not subject to GST, there is no GST included in the sale price to John. John lives in the property for five years and then sells the property for $1.5 million to his sister, Jasmine who will re-develop the property to use it as the premises for her business of making taxable supplies. Currently, section 3A(3)(a)(i) would limit the second-hand goods input tax credit to the GST included in the original cost to John, which was zero – therefore Jasmine is unable to claim any second-hand goods input tax credit. The correct policy result is that Jasmine should be able to claim a second-hand goods input credit based on the tax fraction (3/23rds) of the original cost to John which would be a $150,000 second- hand goods input credit. Suggested solution 10.25 Officials consider it would be appropriate for an amendment to section 3A(3)(a)(i) so that the second-hand goods input tax credit is limited to the tax fraction (3/23rds) of the original cost of the goods to the supplier. We consider this amendment should apply prospectively from the date of enactment. Providing more flexibility for the Commissioner to approve the end date of a taxable period 10.26 A taxable period generally ends on the last day of a month, but under section 15E(2) a registered person may apply to the Commissioner for approval to have a taxable period ending on a different day, so long as that day is not more than seven days before or after the last day of the month. 10.27 Many businesses like to use a “4-4- 5” accounting period 4 which in some cases could end on a date in the month that is outside the seven days before or after the 4 The 4-4 -5 accounting period divides a year into four quarters of 13 weeks grouped into two four-week periods and one five-week period. Its advantage over a regular monthly calendar is that the end date of the period is always the same day of the week, which is useful for shift or manufacturing planning. 79 last day of the month. In these situations the Commissioner cannot approve a different taxable period end date under section 15E(2). Therefore, the taxable periods for these businesses’ GST returns may not align with their accounting periods which increases their compliance costs. Suggested solution 10.28 Officials propose removing the requirement in section 15E(2) that the approved date must be within seven days before or after the last day of the month. This would allow the Commissioner to approve a taxable period end date for a broader range of dates, and could better cater for “4-4- 5” accounting periods. Members of non-statutory boards 10.29 Section 6(3) of the GST Act excludes several activities from being taxable activities. Examples of exclusions from the meaning of “taxable activity” include those for employees, directors, Members of Parliament and members of local authorities and statutory bodies. The rationale for these exclusions is to minimise compliance and administration costs as the contracts for these positions would be (at least predominantly) business-to-business, there would be compliance and administration costs for very little revenue if such persons were required to register for GST. 10.30 The issue is that the scope of the exclusion for board members in section 6(3)(c)(iii) appears to be narrower than was intended. 10.31 Section 6(3)(c)(iii) excludes from the meaning of “taxable activity” any engagement, occupation, or employment as a Chairman or member of any local authority or any statutory board, council, committee or other body. 10.32 The question is whether this exclusion is limited to members of statutory boards and other statutory bodies, or whether it equally applies to members of non- statutory bodies. The current view being applied by Inland Revenue is that section 6(3)(c)(iii) only applies to members of statutory bodies. Therefore, members of non-statutory boards are treated differently to members of statutory boards despite the well-documented policy intention to exclude board members more generally from having a taxable activity. Suggested solution 10.33 The exclusion for members of statutory boards and other statutory bodies could be widened so that it clearly applies to members of non-statutory boards. Challenge rights in relation to a decision of the Commissioner to reopen time-barred GST return 10.34 Section 108A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 prohibits the Commissioner from amending a GST assessment to increase the amount assessed if four years have passed from the end of the taxable period in which the return was filed. The Commissioner may however amend a GST assessment at any time if the Commissioner considers the person knowingly or fraudulently failed to disclose all 80 of the material facts that are necessary for determining the amount of GST payable for a taxable period. 10.35 Section 138E(1)(e) of the Tax Administration Act sets out that a right of challenge against a decision made by the Commissioner under section 108A to reassess a time-barred GST assessment is not conferred under Part 8A. However, taxpayers do have the right to challenge a decision made by the Commissioner under section 108 to reopen a time-barred income tax assessment. The consequence of this is that a Commissioner-initiated reassessment for income tax is a “disputable decision”, whereas her decision to reopen for GST is not. A decision by the Commissioner to reopen a time-barred GST assessment can therefore only be challenged by way of judicial review on very limited grounds. 10.36 The reasons for section 108 being a disputable decision arose from the decision in Maxwell v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[1962\] NZLR 683. In Maxwell, the Court of Appeal ruled that under the law as it was then, the decision could not be challenged on the grounds it was incorrect but opined that this was an unsatisfactory state of affairs. Shortly afterwards, the relevant legislation was amended to provide that this type of decision was the then-equivalent of a disputable decision. 10.37 Until very recently Inland Revenue’s view had been that an income tax reassessment under section 108 could only be challenged on essentially judicial review grounds (such as where the Commissioner did not truly hold the requisite opinion, the Commissioner took the wrong grounds into consideration, or the Commissioner misdirected herself as to the relevant law). Under this view, the taxpayer could not challenge whether the returns were in fact fraudulent, wilfully misleading or omitted income. On this basis the difference between a challenge to an income tax reassessment compared with a GST reassessment was simply a technical one as to what form of proceedings (Part 8A challenge or judicial review) would be used to advance the challenge, rather than the grounds on which the challenge could be made. 10.38 However, two cases Edwards v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2016\] NZHC 1795 and Great North Motor Company Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2017\] NZCA 328 have made it clear that a taxpayer may challenge an income tax assessment on the basis that it was time barred and the Commissioner was not permitted to make a reassessment under section 108. In these cases, the Court must review from the beginning whether the return in question was in fact fraudulent, wilfully misleading or omitted income. As noted in the decisions, this outcome is consistent with the scheme of the challenge provisions in the Tax Administration Act and with the Commissioner’s role in the section 108 decision. 10.39 The consequence of this is that there are two very different approaches to challenging a time bar for income tax as opposed to GST. There is no reason why a taxpayer should have much more limited scope to challenge a decision by the Commissioner under section 108A to reopen a GST return based on the Commissioner’s opinion that the taxpayer has, for instance, fraudulently failed to disclose necessary matters in the return. 81 Suggested solution 10.40 Section 108A could be removed from the excluded provisions listed in section 138E(1)(e) of the Tax Administration Act to ensure that challenges to both time bar provisions (sections 108 and 108A) can be made on the same grounds. Questions for submitters • What are your views on these issues and the suggested solutions? • Are there other technical or remedial issues with the GST legislation that officials should consider?

supplied to consumers in New Zealand by registered persons (such as businesses). 1.2 New Zealand’s GST is highly efficient and accounts for about thirty percent of tax revenues. However, specific provisions in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act) need to be regularly maintained or updated in response to changing technology, business practices, jurisprudence, and other factors. 1.3 A number of issues have been identified where the legislation produces an outcome that does not reflect the underlying policy intent. These issues need to be addressed to maintain the certainty, efficiency and fairness of the tax system. 1.4 The purpose of this officials’ issues paper is to outline technical tax policy issues and provide potential policy options and, where possible, proposed solutions to these issues. Summary of issues, options and proposals 1.5 Officials’ are seeking public feedback on the issues set out in this paper. The table summarises the issues, options and proposals. Chapter and topic Issue Option/proposal Chapter 2 – Tax invoice requirements Aligning GST invoicing requirements with changes in business practices and technology. Remove some of the requirements or make them more flexible. Chapter 3 – Cryptocurrencies Cryptocurrencies have an unfavourable GST treatment compared to money or other investment products. Exclude cryptocurrencies from GST and the financial arrangement rules. Income tax will still apply to any profits made when cryptocurrencies are sold or traded. Chapter 4 – Apportionment and adjustment The apportionment and adjustment rules can be complex and difficult to apply. In addition, in some situations they can result in under or over-taxation. A number of different amendments to specific apportionment and adjustment rules are considered. In addition, feedback is sought on further ways in which the rules could be simplified and improved. 6 Chapter and topic Issue Option/proposal Chapter 5 – Domestic legs of the international transport of goods Courier business practices involve sub-contracting part of the journey for an international delivery to other providers. The GST zero-rating rules for international transport do not accommodate these sub-contracting practices. Zero-rating domestic transport services that are supplied to a non-resident transport supplier that has been contracted to provide international transport of goods to or from New Zealand. Chapter 6 – Business conferences and staff training It is impractical for non- resident businesses to register for GST to claim a GST refund for a one- off expense of sending their staff to a conference or training course in New Zealand. Zero-rate conference and staff training services supplied to non- resident businesses. Chapter 7 – Managed funds The GST treatment of different types of management services supplied to managed funds is complex and applies inconsistently. Develop new rules for fund manager and investment manager services. Several alternative options are discussed: 1. Taxable (15% GST). 2. Exempt financial services. 3. Deem a percentage to be exempt (and the remainder taxable). 4. Zero-rating or a reduced input tax credit mechanism. Chapter 8 – Insurance pay-outs to third parties Compliance difficulties from a GST-registered third party unknowingly receiving an insurance pay-out (which they treat as compensation). Three alternative options are discussed: 1. Making the insurer responsible for the GST obligations. 2. Requiring disclosure that the payment is covered by insurance. 3. No law change but provide education and guidance. 7 Chapter and topic Issue Option/proposal Chapter 9 – Compulsory zero- rating of land Some situations have been identified where the current compulsory zero- rating of land rules appear to produce flawed outcomes or the timing of when the relevant provision should apply could be improved. Clarify that section 5(23) applies to place the output tax liability on the purchaser, in cases where a vendor incorrectly zero-rates land. Section 5(23) should apply to standard-rate the supply of land on the date that the original supply was incorrectly zero-rated. Adjustment of second-hand goods input credit in cases where land should have been zero-rated in the taxable period in which it became apparent that the amount of input tax deducted was incorrect. Clarify that section 20(3J), applies from the time of supply of the land. Chapter 10 – Technical and remedial issues Other technical or remedial changes are required to various rules in the GST Act to ensure these rules work as intended. The proposals relate to: • GST grouping rules. • Input credits on goods not physically received yet at the time the GST return is filed. • Second-hand goods input credits on supplies between associated persons. • Providing more flexibility for the Commissioner to approve the end date of a taxable period. • Members of non-statutory boards. • Right to challenge Commissioner’s decision to re- open time-barred GST returns. 1.6 Subject to submissions on this issues paper, the proposals would be included in the next suitable omnibus tax bill. Making a submission 1.7 Submissions are invited on the options and proposals in this issues paper. 1.8 Submissions should include a brief summary of submitter’s major points and recommendations. They should also indicate whether it is acceptable for officials from Inland Revenue to contact submitters to discuss the points raised, if required. 1.9 The closing date for submissions is 9 April 2020. 8 1.10 Submissions can be made: • by email to policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with “GST policy issues” in the subject line; or • by post to: GST policy issues C/- Deputy Commissioner, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue Department P O Box 2198 Wellington 6140 1.11 Submissions may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982, which may result in their publication. The withholding of responses on the grounds of privacy, or for any other reason, will be determined in accordance with that Act. If you consider that any part of your submission should properly be withheld under the Act please clearly indicate this. 9 CHAPTER 2 Tax invoice requirements 2.1 While tax invoices remain a useful tool both for Inland Revenue and businesses to ensure GST compliance and monitor refund claims, the standard requirements for invoices have not changed very much since 1986. Vast changes in business practices and the use of technology since then have given rise to a risk either of non-compliance with the legislation or excessive compliance costs on businesses, suggesting that a review of these requirements is needed. 2.2 As well as modern business practices, international developments make it timely to review GST invoicing requirements. 2.3 In other jurisdictions there is emerging interest in GST (or VAT) adopting some form of split-payment system where a vendor or an intermediary involved in an electronic payment can split the GST off from any payment to the vendor and remit the amount to the revenue authority. 2.4 The New Zealand and Australian governments are also working together to facilitate electronic invoicing (e-invoicing). These changes are intended to facilitate Trans-Tasman trade for small and medium businesses with an ABN or NZBN by allowing data exchange to be used in place of traditional invoices. 2.5 With e-invoicing, businesses will no longer need PDF or paper invoices that have to be scanned, posted or emailed, and entered manually. Instead, the suppliers’ and buyers’ finance systems will “speak” directly to each other, enabling faster delivery, processing and payment of invoices, helping save time and money. Current invoice requirements 2.6 As an integrity measure, the GST Act denies an input tax credit claim unless the supplier has provided the registered person making the claim with a tax invoice and the tax invoice is held by the registered person at the time of making the relevant GST return (see section 20(2)(a)). 2.7 To be a tax invoice, the GST Act requires that documents with consideration exceeding $1,000 must contain: • the words “tax invoice” in a prominent place; • the name and registration number of the supplier; • the name and address of the recipient of the supply; • the date of issue; • a description of the goods and services supplied; • the quantity or volume of the goods and services being supplied; and • the amount of the tax and the pre-tax consideration or the tax-inclusive amount with a statement that it includes GST. 10 2.8 Invoices are not required if the consideration is under $50, and a slightly simplified form of tax invoice can be used where the consideration is between $50 and $1,000. 2.9 The Commissioner does have some authority not to require a tax invoice (section 24(6)). This is where the Commissioner is satisfied that “there are or will be sufficient records available to establish the particulars of any supply or class of supplies, and that it would be impractical to require that a tax invoice be issued.” 2.10 The authority not to require tax invoices to be issued may provide some flexibility in the use of invoices (for example, in allowing data exchange in place of a traditional invoice) but it is not a long-term solution. There is limited guidance about when it would be impractical to issue or obtain a tax invoice, as opposed to simply having relatively high compliance-costs. Options for simplification 2.11 It is proposed that a wider range of ordinary business-to-business information, predominantly electronic information, should be able to be used to support GST output tax and input tax. To achieve this, we are suggesting a number of changes to the GST Act requirements for tax invoices. Required information on the tax invoice 2.12 The current requirement of the name and registration number of the supplier and the name and address of the recipient should remain as key requirements of a tax invoice. The former is needed to identify the taxpayer who supplies the goods and services and is therefore liable for the GST charged. The latter is needed to ensure that the correct person receives any corresponding input tax deduction. 2.13 The requirement to state the GST-exclusive amount of the consideration and the tax or the GST-inclusive amount of the consideration is necessary to identify that the supply has been subject to GST and therefore any related output or input tax. 2.14 On the other hand, the requirement to provide details of the quantity and volume of goods and services supplied could be removed. 2.15 The quantity and volume of goods and services would normally be found in commercial documents and so it seems unnecessary to have this as a set requirement in the GST legislation. There are already general tax record-keeping requirements in the legislation, and these should largely suffice when information is required to support the information in a GST return. Use of electronic invoicing 2.16 With invoices now being largely electronically generated it would make sense to also remove the requirement that a “copied” invoice be marked as “copy only” since the requirement makes little sense in the electronic environment. 2.17 The requirement in section 20(2)(a) that the recipient seeking an input tax claim “hold” a tax invoice has been interpreted by some to suggest that, although hard- copy invoices are not required, a hard copy (for example, in PDF format) must be able to be downloaded. It is questionable whether this requirement is suitable for 11 modern business practices and we are interested in views about whether the wording can be modified by, for example, requiring only that the information required to be kept on a tax invoice be retained. Buyer-created tax invoices 2.18 With the tax system becoming increasingly automated, it seems unnecessary for taxpayers to obtain Inland Revenue approval to use buyer-created tax invoices. A key requirement of this approval is for the parties to demonstrate why it is preferable for the buyer to provide the invoice rather than the supplier. For example, in the dairy industry, this is likely to be because the buyer has better information about what is being purchased (including quantity and price) than the seller. 2.19 Rather than involving Inland Revenue, buyer-created invoices should be based on what is most appropriate for the businesses in question. 1 However, for revenue integrity reasons some requirements should be retained, such as agreements: • between the supplier and the recipient that the recipient should issue the tax invoice along with a shared understanding of the commercial reasons for this; and • that both parties retain a copy of the buyer-created invoice (or the information required to produce the document). Shared invoices 2.20 In some circumstances, shared invoices will be used for more than one supply by more than one supplier. Section 24BA treats a shared invoice that meets the tax invoice requirements as a tax invoice, but only in the limited circumstances of the suppliers being part of the same group of companies or the shared invoice being a practical response to statutory requirements. 2.21 It is proposed that shared invoices should be able to be used in a wider range of circumstances. The proposed new requirements could include: • An agreement between the relevant GST-registered parties that a shared invoice be used. • Requiring the supplier that issues the invoice to retain all the information that would be required to be retained if a separate tax invoice were required for each supply. • Requiring the underlying suppliers to hold the information relevant to their supplies. This seems reasonable given that the information would be generated from the underlying suppliers. • Making clear that the underlying supplier would remain ultimately responsible for the GST, while otherwise allowing the supplier issuing the invoice to pay the tax as their agent. 1 This is consistent with the 2019 recommendation of the Government’s Tax Working Group, that the requirement for taxpayers to seek the approval of the Commissioner to issue buyer-created tax invoices be removed. 12 Tax invoice related penalties 2.22 Knowledge offence penalties can arise if the supplier does not provide a recipient with a tax invoice within 28 days of a request to do so or if the supplier issues more than one tax invoice in relation to the same supply. 2.23 Deeming the issuing of more than one invoice to be an offence, in the same way as the “copy only” requirement, seems outdated for electronic transactions. Historically, the concern was not with issuing an invoice for the same supply more than once, but for claiming more than one input tax deduction in respect of a supply. It is therefore proposed that any penalty (which would generally be placed on the purchaser) be limited to multiple claims for the same supply. Questions for submitters • Do you agree with the proposals outlined in this chapter? • Are there further proposals which should be developed that would simplify or enhance the tax invoice requirements, keeping in mind the likely impact on compliance costs and the implications for Inland Revenue in administering the tax system? 13 CHAPTER 3 Cryptocurrencies 3.1 This chapter discusses proposals to exclude cryptocurrencies (crypto-assets) from GST and the financial arrangement rules to ensure these rules do not impose barriers to developing new products, raising capital or investing through crypto-assets. The tax system strives for neutrality and to minimise distortions. 3.2 Income tax will still apply to any profits made when cryptocurrencies are sold or traded (this is further discussed in paragraphs 3.60–3.62). 3.3 The proposed GST changes would only apply to supplies of crypto-assets. Other services related to crypto-assets, that are not in themselves supplies of crypto-assets such as mining, providing crypto-asset exchange services or providing advice, general business services or computer services will continue to be subject to the existing GST rules. 3.4 GST will continue to apply to supplies of goods and services which are bought using a crypto-asset (the same as if those goods or services had been purchased using money or swapped for another good or service). Crypto-assets are a fast-growing sector 3.5 Crypto-assets are digital assets (commonly known as coins or tokens) that use cryptography to secure transactions and verify the transfer of the coins or tokens. Instead of relying on a financial institution to verify transactions, crypto-asset transactions are confirmed by computers operating on the currency's network. 3.6 At the time of writing, there are currently over 5,000 crypto-assets and the total global market value of all crypto-assets exceeds US$300 billion. 3.7 The use and development of crypto-assets are growing in New Zealand, including investors, exchanges and start-ups. Should different types of crypto-assets have different GST treatments? 3.8 Tax rules in New Zealand and overseas do not contemplate crypto-assets and can be difficult to apply as crypto-assets will often not fit into existing definitions that were designed for other investment products such as currency, shares, debt or equity securities. Because of their innovative nature, they will often also have different features to these other investment products. 3.9 This means that some existing tax rules can be difficult to apply, involve very high compliance costs or may provide policy outcomes for some crypto-assets that lead to over-taxation compared to other alternative investment products. 3.10 More simple and certain tax rules could contribute to the further growth and development of the crypto-asset sector in New Zealand by: 14 • Ensuring New Zealand businesses, investors and crypto-asset users are not disadvantaged from issuing or selling tokens in New Zealand (relative to selling the tokens outside New Zealand or raising capital through other means). • Making it more attractive for businesses to issue their initial coin offerings or other token generating events from New Zealand, which could facilitate increased investment, business growth and technology development in New Zealand. • Making it easier to buy or sell crypto-assets with New Zealand dollars as opposed to having to exchange New Zealand dollars into foreign currencies and incur foreign exchange fees. 3.11 It is intended that crypto-assets should have a similar tax treatment to other investment products or asset classes which are close substitutes for the crypto-asset. It is not intended that crypto-assets would receive a concessionary tax treatment. 3.12 A key question is whether the same tax treatments should be applied to most types of crypto-assets or apply different tax treatments depending on the key features of the particular crypto-asset, such as whether it is a payment token, a utility token, security token, an asset token or a hybrid token with a mix of features. 3.13 Two potential approaches to this issue are discussed. Token classification framework and deeming rules 3.14 One option would be to develop a framework for categorising different types of crypto-assets and use this to create some deeming provisions that apply across all Revenue Acts. For example, rules that deem certain types of crypto-assets to be included in the Revenue Act definitions of securities, or currency, depending on whether the crypto-asset has some particular features. 3.15 This approach could mean: • Crypto-assets deemed to be currency would be subject to income tax on disposal for those who are cash-basis persons and on an accrual basis for those who are not. Currently, supplies of currency are not subject to GST and the exchange of currency is an exempt financial service for GST purposes. • Crypto-assets deemed to be shares would not be financial arrangements for income tax purposes (so would generally be taxed on a realised basis) and would be exempt financial services for GST purposes. • Other types of crypto-assets could be deemed to have a different GST or income tax treatment. 3.16 An advantage of this approach is that it should provide a neutral tax treatment for those crypto-assets which are close substitutes for existing financial products such as currency or shares. 3.17 However, this approach assumes that crypto-assets generally have similar uses or features to existing financial products (which may not be the case), and that the existing tax rules for these other financial products are practical to apply and provide sensible policy outcomes when applied to crypto-assets. 15 3.18 In addition, because of the specific definitions that apply for different tax rules, this approach could still lead to different tax treatments between a crypto-asset and the financial product they are deemed to be for the purposes of the Revenue Acts. For example, a particular crypto-asset could be deemed to be a share, but if it does not provide an interest in a foreign company or partnership, it would still be taxed very differently to other foreign equity investments which will often be foreign companies subject to the FIF rules or partnerships subject to flow-through tax treatment. 3.19 There may also be practical limitations from trying to accurately classify tokens and apply differing tax treatments to different types of token. 3.20 There are over 5,000 crypto-assets – many which have different rights or features. In contrast other investment products, such as a portfolio consisting of shares in listed companies, are much more standardised. There is no universal standard for classifying tokens. This means an investor who buys a lot of different crypto-assets may find it difficult to identify whether a deeming rule in the New Zealand tax legislation applies or not. Some tokens will be hard to classify as they are hybrid. The legal or economic features of a crypto-asset may change as it is developed, leading to a change in tax treatment. For example, some of the proposed features of a particular crypto-asset will not exist yet at the time of investment and may change as the underlying software is developed. Broad definition 3.21 An alternative approach would be to prioritise specific changes to those tax rules and provisions which are identified as creating the most significant policy issues when applied to crypto-assets. 3.22 For example, it appears that the GST and financial arrangement rules lead to significant policy and practical issues when applied to crypto-assets. Some of these issues are explained in the next section. Therefore, there appears to be a case to exclude most types of crypto-asset from the GST and financial arrangement rules by developing a broad definition of crypto-assets for this purpose. Issues with applying GST to crypto-assets 3.23 New Zealand has a broad-based GST system that applies to nearly all goods and services. A service is broadly defined to mean anything which is not goods or money. 3.24 GST does not apply to money or financial services, but the existing definitions of money and financial services were not designed with crypto-assets in mind. It is likely that many crypto-assets have a different GST treatment to money or financial services. 3.25 When a crypto-asset is traded or sold, the GST treatment may vary depending on the specific facts and features of the crypto-asset and the residency of the buyer and seller. The supply of a crypto-asset could be an exempt financial service, subject to 15% GST, or a zero-rated supply to a non-resident. 16 3.26 In this regard, the current GST rules provide an uncertain and variable GST treatment making, using or investing in crypto-assets less attractive than using money or investing in other financial assets. The variable GST treatment may distort decisions around the type of crypto-assets a business may choose to develop and issue, whether they issue the token in New Zealand or offshore, and what type of tokens New Zealand investors choose to buy or sell. 3.27 The final issue is that, because of the complexity of the GST treatment and the limited information available about the specific features of a crypto-asset and the residency of the seller or purchaser, the current GST rules can be difficult to apply or impractical to comply with. Issues from applying financial arrangement rules to crypto-assets 3.28 Financial arrangements are broadly defined, and this broad definition means that some types of crypto-assets are likely to be financial arrangements under the current rules. 3.29 Many security, asset, or utility tokens could be considered financial arrangements between the holder who provides money and another person who provides money or money’s worth in the future. Payment tokens such as bitcoin are unlikely to be financial arrangements as they do not involve an arrangement between two persons. 3.30 Requiring the financial arrangement rules to be applied to some crypto-assets would lead to accrual-based taxation on large unrealised gains and losses from crypto- asset values, which can be very volatile. It could also bias investment decisions about which types of crypto-assets New Zealand investors may prefer to invest in, if some tokens are only taxed on realised gains or losses when they are sold or exchanged for other tokens, and others that are subject to tax on accrued gains or losses. 3.31 If they apply to a crypto-asset, the financial arrangements rules would require the person to convert the value of their crypto-asset into NZD, spread income and expenditure over the term of the arrangement and undertake a base price adjustment on maturity. 3.32 From an income tax policy perspective, it seems more appropriate and practical to tax crypto-assets at the time they are sold (or exchanged for other tokens) rather than on accrued gains or losses. 3.33 Traders who have a business of dealing in crypto-assets should be taxed under the trading stock rules the same way that share traders are. 3.34 Some crypto-assets may have features that make them economically equivalent to debt arrangements – for example a token that is issued at $1 of value (in money, other tokens or services) and can be redeemed for $1.20 of value in two years’ time. Such tokens should continue to be taxed under the financial arrangement rules. This could be achieved by excluding such tokens from the definition of crypto-assets which qualify as excepted financial arrangements. 17 How should a crypto-asset be defined? 3.35 It is proposed that a broad definition of crypto-assets be developed which captures nearly all the crypto-assets that are used or invested in. 3.36 This broad definition would then be used to remove crypto-asset from both the GST rules (by making crypto-assets an exempt supply) and the financial arrangement rules (by making a “crypto-asset” a new type of excepted financial arrangement). 3.37 A crypto-asset could be defined based on a requirement that the token use cryptography and a block chain. 3.38 The proposed definition is broader than the definition of “digital currency” which Australia has legislated to remove GST on certain types of crypto-assets as well as the proposed definition of “digital payment token” which Singapore has developed for the same purpose. 3.39 Australia’s and Singapore’s definitions exclude crypto-assets whose value is pegged to or dependent on a fiat currency (for example, stable coins) as well as tokens that give a right or entitlement to receive something else. This means their definitions exclude utility tokens which can be redeemed for specific goods and services and asset-backed coins which can be redeemed for gold or other specific assets. 3.40 Singapore’s draft guidelines clarify that some “hybrid” utility tokens may still qualify as digital payment tokens so long as they can still potentially be used as a medium of exchange even after they have been used to obtain a product or service. 3.41 Australia’s and Singapore’s definitions are not explicitly limited to crypto-assets as they do not require cryptography or block chain. However, they do exclude tokens that are not generally available to be used without substantial restrictions. This requirement excludes tokens issued on private block chains, currency that can only be redeemed within an online game, or loyalty points that can only be redeemed at certain merchants. 3.42 We consider it could be complex to require a crypto-asset to be generally available without restriction. For example, initial coin offerings are often made to a select group of investors before they later become available on an exchange. In this context a requirement that the coins be “generally available” could lead to the tax treatment for particular crypto-asset changing over time or being uncertain at a particular point in time. 3.43 We welcome submissions on how a crypto-asset should be defined including whether there are other distinguishing features of a crypto-asset which should be included in the definition. How should GST be removed from supplies of crypto-assets? 3.44 There are two main options for removing GST on crypto-assets: • Making all supplies of crypto-assets not subject to GST. Under this option supplies of crypto-assets would have the same GST treatment as supplies of money, which are not subject to GST. 18 • Making supplies of crypto-assets to New Zealand residents exempt from GST and supplies to non-residents zero-rated supplies (subject to GST at 0%). Under this option supplies of crypto-assets would have the same GST treatment as financial services. 3.45 The key difference between these two options is the GST treatment of supplies of crypto-assets to non-residents. To the extent that a GST-registered person makes zero-rated supplies of crypto-assets to non-residents, they would be able to claim GST input credits (a refund on the GST charged on goods and services) in relation to inputs that they use to make these zero-rated supplies. 3.46 Zero-rating of supplies to non-residents could therefore make it more attractive for GST-registered persons to sell crypto-asset to non-residents than New Zealand residents or discourage New Zealanders from using New Zealand-based exchanges. This could hinder the development of the New Zealand dollar market for crypto- assets which would make it more difficult and costly for New Zealand businesses and investors to convert crypto-assets to New Zealand dollars. 3.47 In addition, zero-rating supplies of crypto-assets to non-residents would mean that New Zealand investors who traded more than $60,000 of crypto-assets in a 12-month period on international exchanges would typically be required to register for GST (assuming most of their trades were with non-resident persons), and incur the compliance costs of filing GST returns and returning GST on any other taxable supplies they may make. 3.48 Furthermore, the global nature of crypto-asset markets means that businesses and investors who trade crypto-assets could potentially have a mix of supplies to non- residents and supplies to New Zealand residents. In many cases, it will be impractical to identify if the supply of a crypto-asset is to a resident or a non- resident. 3.49 It is therefore proposed that all supplies of crypto-assets be made not subject to GST, including supplies to non-residents. 3.50 This would ensure New Zealand businesses and investors are not disadvantaged when they sell crypto-assets to other New Zealand residents, which should facilitate the exchange of crypto-assets for New Zealand dollars. It would also reduce compliance costs and would be consistent with the GST treatment of money. In addition, making crypto-assets not subject to GST would be consistent with existing market practices. Input credits for capital raising 3.51 The GST rules were amended in 2017 to allow GST-registered persons to claim input credits for inputs such as legal or advisory services used to raise capital using equity or debt securities (see section 20H of the GST Act). It is proposed that GST- registered businesses that raise funds through issuing security tokens which have features that are similar to debt or equity securities (such as a right to a share of the profits of a project) should also be able to claim input credits on their capital raising costs. 3.52 This would ensure that businesses are not disadvantaged if they choose to raise capital through issuing crypto-assets which are close substitutes for debt or equity 19 securities. These input credits for inputs related to capital raising costs could be claimed regardless of whether the GST-registered person issued the qualifying securities tokens to residents or non-residents. Other services related to crypto-assets 3.53 The proposed changes would only apply to supplies of crypto-assets. 3.54 Although the simple fact of owning a crypto-asset is not itself a financial arrangement, crypto-asset can still be used as part of a financial arrangement (in the same way that money or money’s worth can form part of a financial arrangement). For example, lending funds in the form of crypto-assets and derivatives based on the value of crypto-assets will still be treated as financial arrangements. 3.55 Similarly, for GST purposes, other services related to crypto-assets, that are not in themselves supplies of crypto-assets such as mining, providing crypto-asset exchange services or providing advice, general business services or computer services will continue to be subject to the existing GST rules. 3.56 Under the existing GST rules these services could be either taxable supplies to New Zealand residents subject to 15% GST or zero-rated supplies to non-residents. Because of the global nature of crypto-asset markets, many of these services are likely to be zero-rated supplies to non-residents. 3.57 The intention is that the change in the GST treatment of the supply of crypto-assets should not change the GST treatment of the supply of these other services, even though the service provider may receive crypto-assets as consideration for performing these services. This is consistent with the fact that supplies of goods and services have the same GST treatment regardless of whether the consideration was paid in money or another form of payment (such as barter or crypto-assets). If the GST treatment changed depending on the type of payment received it could create a tax bias for preferring some payment types over others. 3.58 The standard GST rules will therefore continue to apply to supplies of goods and services which are bought using a crypto-asset (the same as if those goods or services had been purchased using money or swapped for another good or service). 3.59 However, the changes proposed above will mean that if a person has received a crypto-asset as a payment for goods or services, they will be able to exchange the crypto-asset for money or another crypto-asset with no GST consequences. Other tax rules will continue to apply to crypto-assets 3.60 Under the proposed changes, crypto-assets would only be excluded from the GST and financial arrangement rules – they would still be subject to other tax rules. 3.61 In particular, a crypto-asset is considered property for income tax purposes. When a person acquires crypto-assets for the purpose of disposal (selling or exchanging it) the proceeds made from selling it are subject to income tax (see section CB 4 of Income Tax Act). Disposal includes swapping one type of crypto-asset for another 20 or exchanging a crypto-asset for New Zealand dollars or another fiat currency such as US dollars or Euro. 3.62 Investors who have a business of dealing in crypto-assets (see section CB 5 of the Income Tax Act 2007) will be subject to income tax each year under the trading stock rules. Application date 3.63 It is proposed that the relevant law changes to exclude crypto-assets from the GST and financial arrangement rules should apply retrospectively from 1 January 2009, the date the first crypto-asset, bitcoin, was launched. 3.64 The proposed application date should ensure all New Zealand traders of crypto- assets are not subject to GST or the financial arrangement rules, regardless of when their purchases or disposals took place. 3.65 It should also mean the proposed new rules would generally align with current and previous tax positions where we understand most of the affected New Zealand taxpayers have generally not applied GST or the financial arrangement rules to determine their tax positions. 3.66 The application date for any changes to the capital raising deduction rules would be from 1 April 2017 as this was the date that the capital raising deduction rule took effect. 3.67 Submissions are sought on whether any variations or savings provisions to the proposed application dates should be provided. For example, a savings provision could be included to preserve tax positions taken based on the GST Act provisions or financial arrangement rules that applied prior to the new amendments. Other tax issues with crypto-assets 3.68 Officials appreciate that some other aspects of the tax rules may also be difficult to apply to investments and transactions involving crypto-assets. While we welcome submissions identifying these issues, this issues paper only proposes excluding crypto-assets from the GST and financial arrangement rules. 3.69 Inland Revenue intends to continue to publish guidance such as answers to commonly asked questions in respect of how other tax rules may apply to crypto- assets. 21 Questions for submitters • Should different types of crypto-assets have different GST treatments, or should a broad definition of crypto-asset be developed to exclude all types from GST? • How should a crypto-asset be defined? • How should GST be removed from supplies of crypto-assets? Should the same GST treatment apply to supplies to residents and non-residents? 23 CHAPTER 4 Apportionment and adjustment 4.1 The apportionment and adjustment rules apply when a GST-registered person uses or intends to use goods and services for both taxable and non-taxable purposes. For example, a contractor that acquires a car for both their contracting business and private travel will only be able to claim input tax credits for the intended taxable use of the car. 4.2 Following acquisition of an asset, the GST-registered person must annually compare the intended taxable use of an asset with the actual taxable use of an asset. If there is a difference the person must make an adjustment to either claim extra input tax credits or pay output tax to reflect the actual taxable use of the asset. 4.3 This chapter discusses a number of issues with the apportionment and adjustment rules and suggests some possible solutions. We would also like feedback on further ways in which the apportionment and adjustment rules could be simplified and improved. Change of use wash-up calculation (non-land assets) 4.4 Section 21FB of the GST Act contains a wash-up calculation that requires a registered person to claim or pay the full input tax credits for an asset when they switch the use of that asset to one hundred percent taxable or non-taxable. 4.5 The rationale for the wash-up calculation is to reduce compliance costs for taxpayers by reducing the number of adjustments they need to perform. 4.6 Without the wash-up calculation the number of adjustments a taxpayer needs to make will depend on the type and value of the asset (see section 21G). For non-land assets a taxpayer must perform two adjustments for assets valued between $5,000 and $10,000, five adjustments for assets valued between $10,000 and $500,000 and ten adjustments for assets valued over $500,000. Alternatively, for non-land assets a taxpayer may choose the relevant number of adjustment periods based on the estimated useful life as determined by the tax depreciation rates determinations set by the Commissioner. For land there is no limit to the number of adjustments required. 4.7 For a change in use to one hundred percent taxable, the wash-up formula entitles a taxpayer to a full input tax deduction less any actual deduction already claimed for that asset. For a change in use to one hundred percent non-taxable, the wash-up formula requires a taxpayer to pay as output tax an amount equal to the actual deduction claimed for that asset. The terms “full input deduction” and “actual deduction” are defined by paragraphs 21FB(a) and (b) respectively. 4.8 In order for an asset to be subject to the wash-up rule its use must be changed to one hundred percent taxable or non-taxable and this total taxable or non-taxable use remain unchanged for an unbroken period of the remainder of the adjustment period 24 in which the change in use occurred, and the entirety of the following adjustment period. Example 1 On 1 April 2016 Fernanda, a GST-registered plumber, acquires a van for $34,500, intending to use it 50% for taxable and 50% for non-taxable purposes. As such, Fernanda claims $2,250 in input credits on acquisition. Halfway through her first adjustment period, Fernanda switches the taxable use of the van to 0%. Therefore, in Fernanda’s first adjustment the actual taxable use of the van was only 25% and Fernanda must pay output tax of $1,125. If the taxable use of the van remains at 0% for all of the next adjustment period Fernanda must perform the wash-up calculation. As such, Fernanda will be required to return as output tax the remaining input credits she had claimed for the van ($1,125). 4.9 This section considers a number of issues with the change of use wash-up calculation for non-land assets. Issues with the wash-up calculation for land are discussed later in this chapter. Issue 1: Wash-up adjustments are disproportionately large 4.10 For non-land assets the wash-up calculation results in adjustments that are disproportionately large. This is because the wash-up calculation does not take into account any business or private consumption of the asset that has occurred prior to the wash-up being performed. In addition, the wash-up calculation does not take into account any change in value of an asset that may have occurred. 4.11 For assets that have had a change in use to one hundred percent taxable, the wash- up requires the taxpayer to claim all the input tax (less any input tax already claimed) for the asset. The concern is that taxpayers can effectively use and “consume” an asset for private purposes over a period of years and then enjoy full input tax recovery upon a subsequent change to full taxable use. Therefore, the wash-up calculation does not tax the non-taxable usage prior to the change to full taxable use. Example 2 Leigh, a GST-registered fisherman, purchases a boat for $1,150,000 (including GST) on 1 April 2017. Leigh uses the boat equally for both private use and his taxable fishing activities. As such Leigh can claim $75,000 as an input tax credit. On 1 April 2023 Leigh switches the use of his boat to being used solely for his taxable activity of fishing. At the end of his 7th adjustment period on 31 March 2024 Leigh performs an adjustment under section 21A and claims $10,714.29 of input tax credits. After the end of his 8th adjustment period on 31 March 2025 Leigh can perform the wash-up calculation under section 21FB and claim $64,285.71 of GST in input tax credits. This gives Leigh a total deduction of $150,000 despite 50% of the boat’s use for the first six years Leigh owned it being non-taxable. If the wash-up rule did not exist Leigh would have instead only been able to claim the following input tax deductions after switching to 100% taxable use: 25 7th adjustment: $10,714.29 8th adjustment: $8,035.71 9th adjustment: $6,250 Final adjustment: $5,000 Total inputs claimed: $105,000 This is because over the ten years in which adjustments were required only 70% of the use of the boat was taxable. 4.12 Conversely for assets that have had a change in use to one hundred percent non- taxable, the taxpayer is required to pay as output tax all the input tax they have claimed for the asset. As the wash-up calculation does not take into account prior taxable use, it therefore results in over-taxation of assets that are switched to one hundred percent non-taxable use. Issue 2: Wash-up can only be used for changes of use to one hundred percent or zero percent taxable 4.13 Section 21FB only applies to a complete change of use to either one hundred percent taxable or one hundred percent non-taxable use. However, if a registered person permanently changes their use of an asset to something other than one hundred percent taxable or one hundred percent non-taxable, they are required to perform the full number of yearly adjustments as required under section 21G. Example 3 On 1 April 2017 Claire, a GST-registered florist, purchases a van for $23,000 (including GST). Claire’s use of this van is 75% taxable as she mainly uses it for her taxable activity but does also use it for private purposes. As such, Claire claims an input tax deduction of $2,250. On 1 April 2019 Claire permanently switches the use of the van to 50% taxable. Claire will need to make yearly adjustments for the next three years to account for this change of use. 4.14 Discussions with business groups have indicated that allowing the wash-up to be performed after a permanent change in use to something other than one hundred taxable or non-taxable would reduce compliance costs. Issue 3: Usual adjustment provisions not switched off following wash-up calculation 4.15 Section 21(2) of the GST Act provides an exception from the requirement to make an adjustment if one or more exceptions apply. However, there is no exception from the requirement to make an adjustment for goods and services that have been subject to the wash-up calculation under section 21FB. 4.16 As such, it appears that a registered person is required to continue to perform adjustments for goods and services that have had a complete change of use and have been subject to the wash-up under section 21FB. 4.17 We are proposing to introduce an exception to the requirement to perform adjustments when the wash-up has been performed. 26 Proposal: New wash-up formula 4.18 To address the first two issues above we propose changing the formula for the change in use wash-up calculation for non-land assets. The proposed new formula is: Time remaining × (Full input tax deduction × Current use - Actual deduction) Total time 4.19 This formula would apply for both changes to 100% taxable use or 100% non- taxable use. It would also apply for any permanent change of use to something between 0% and 100% taxable. 4.20 Full input tax deduction and actual deduction would both have their current meanings. 4.21 Current use would be the percentage taxable use of the asset since the change of use. 4.22 Total time would be defined as the total amount of time from acquisition of the asset until the end of the last adjustment period that would be required under section 21G in the absence of the wash-up. Time remaining would be calculated by subtracting from total time the amount of time from acquisition of the asset until the end of the adjustment period in which the change of use occurred. 4.23 As with the existing formula, the proposed wash-up formula would apply if the use has been changed and remains unchanged for the remainder of the adjustment period in which the change of use occurred, and the adjustment period following the period in which the change of use occurred. 4.24 Under the proposed formula, the result under the wash-up is the same as if the person had instead used the standard change in use provisions for the remaining adjustment periods (ignoring the restrictions to performing adjustments under section 21(2)). This is illustrated in examples 4–6. Example 4: Change to 100% non-taxable On 1 April 2017 Caroline, a GST-registered electrician, purchases a van for $46,000 (including GST). Caroline’s use of this van is seventy five percent taxable as she mainly uses it for her taxable activity but does also use it for private purposes. As such, Caroline claims an input tax deduction of $4,500. On 1 April 2019 Caroline switches the use of the van to one hundred percent non-taxable as she has now purchased a new vehicle for use in her taxable activity. At the end of her 3rd adjustment period on 31 March 2020 Caroline’s actual taxable use of the asset was fifty percent so she is required to return $1,500 as output tax. After the end of her 4th adjustment period Caroline is able to perform the wash-up calculation and return $1,200: 2 years × ($6,000 × 0% - $3,000) 5 years = -$1,200 This brings the total amount of inputs Caroline has claimed for the van to $1,800. This is equal to the amount of inputs she would have been able to claim under the standard change of use rules (ignoring the restrictions on performing adjustments under section 21(2)). This is because over the five years in which adjustments were required, 30% of the use of the van was taxable. 27 Example 5: Change to 50% taxable On 1 January 2018 David bought a vintage car for $230,000 (including GST). David is initially not registered for GST. However, on 1 February 2019 he registers for GST and begins renting out the car for weddings and special events while still using it privately. David’s taxable use of the car from this point forward is 50%. Under section 21B David’s first adjustment period will end on 31 March 2019. David calculates that his taxable use of the car for this adjustment period was 6.67 % (50% taxable use for two months and 0% taxable use for 13 months). As such he claims $2,000 in input tax. After the end of his second adjustment period David is able to perform the wash-up calculation and claims an additional $9,904.76 of input tax: 48 months × ($30,000 × 50% - $2,000) 63 months = $9,904.76 This brings the total amount of inputs David has claimed for the car to $11,904.76. This is equal to the amount of inputs he would have been able to claim under the standard change of use rules. Example 6: Change to 100% taxable Consider example 2 with Leigh. At the end of his 8th adjustment period on 31 March 2025 Leigh can perform the wash-up calculation. Under the proposed formula he can claim an additional $19,285.71 in input tax credits: 3 years × ($150,000 × 100% - $85,714.29) 10 years = $19,285.71 This gives Leigh a total deduction of $105,000, equal to his total deduction under the standard change in use rules. 4.25 We are seeking feedback on the proposal to amend the wash-up formula for non- land assets in the manner described above. Zero-rated supplies of going concerns 4.26 Under section 11(1)(m) of the GST Act, the sale of a going concern from one registered person to another may be zero-rated if the supplier and the recipient agree. 4.27 Issues arise with this rule when the recipient of the going concern intends to use the supply for both taxable and private or exempt purposes. Zero-rating the supply of a going concern means that there is no input tax to apportion. As a result, any exempt or private use of the going concern is not correctly accounted for. 28 Example 7 Shanae has a mobile dog washing business. She enters into an agreement to sell the entire business, including the business’s van to Gordon for $100,000 (plus GST if any). This $100,000 is made up of $50,000 for the van and $50,000 for all other assets. Shanae and Gordon agree to zero-rate the sale of the business as a going concern. Gordon estimates that the private use of the van will be 50%. However, as no GST has been paid Gordon does not need to account for this private use. Alternatively, Shanae and Gordon could have agreed to not zero-rate the supply as a going concern. Gordon would then have been required to pay Shanae $115,000 and Shanae would have had to return $15,000 in output tax. As Gordon will be using the vehicle for 50% private use, he can only claim an input tax deduction of $11,250. 4.28 In contrast, under the zero-rating of land rules any private or exempt use of zero- rated land is effectively taxed. Section 20(3J) requires the purchaser to determine the nominal amount of GST they would have incurred if the supply was standard rated and return as output tax the proportion of this nominal GST relating to private or exempt use. 4.29 We are proposing to introduce a similar provision to section 20(3J) that would apply to zero-rated supplies of going-concerns. In example 7, such a provision would have required Gordon to return $3,750 in GST if he and Shanae had agreed to zero-rate the sale of the business as a going concern. Apportionment of land 4.30 Some apportionment and adjustment issues mainly affect land rather than other assets. This is because land is different from most other assets in that it tends to appreciate in value. Furthermore, it is common for land to be used for a mix of taxable and non-taxable purposes given it is often used privately or for the supply of accommodation in a dwelling. 4.31 Issues with the apportionment and adjustment rules for land are discussed in the next section. Concurrent use of land 4.32 A special apportionment rule in section 21E of the GST Act applies where a GST- registered person is concurrently using the same piece of land with a dwelling for both a taxable (development) and non-taxable (supply of accommodation in a dwelling) purpose. 4.33 The rule applies in the adjustment periods prior to the sale of the property and adjusts the input credits that can be claimed on the property based on the ratio of taxable use to total use. 4.34 This rule was developed in response to issues raised by the Court of Appeal decision in Lundy (2005) 22 NZTC 19 at 637, which involved land being used concurrently for taxable (advertised for sale) and non-taxable (supply of accommodation in a dwelling) purposes. In that case a developer bought houses intending to develop and quickly sell them. The developer was initially unable to find buyers and so rented out the houses until they were able to find a buyer. As the developer was 29 using the land concurrently for both taxable and exempt activities, they could not apportion their inputs based on time or space. Scope of section 21E 4.35 The rule was developed under an assumption that the concurrent use of the land would only be for a short period of time (a few adjustment periods) prior to the sale. 4.36 However, the rule can also apply in situations in which there is a concurrent use of land for a long period. For example, the concurrent use of land rule may apply if a property developer rents out houses but has a well-developed plan to sell them in 20 years. In this situation it may be argued that they are passively using the land for taxable purposes as they are holding it for future sale at the same time as they are actively using the land for the non-taxable use of supplying accommodation in a dwelling. 4.37 Note that section 21E would not necessarily apply even if there is a well-developed plan to sell the land. Whether or not there is concurrent use would depend on all of the facts of an arrangement. 4.38 The concurrent use rule was not intended to apply to situations in which the only taxable use was passively holding the land for future sale. Instead it was targeted at sit uations similar to the Lundy case in which land was actively being advertised for sale or had some other active taxable use whilst simultaneously being used for non- taxable purposes. 4.39 We therefore propose limiting the application of section 21E to not apply in situations where the only taxable use of the land in an adjustment period is holding the land for its eventual sale or development. If the only taxable use of land in an adjustment period is holding the land for its eventual sale or development, then the taxable use of the land during that period would be zero percent. 4.40 We are seeking feedback on the appropriateness of this proposal to limit the scope of section 21E. Concurrent use apportionment formula 4.41 In addition to the scope of the concurrent use rule being broader than intended, the apportionment formula in section 21E(3) appears to be overly generous. 4.42 The apportionment formula in subsection (3) compares the expected consideration for taxable supplies (approximated by the current market value of the property) with the total consideration, where total consideration is the current market value of the property plus any rental income (or imputed rent) that has been received since the registered person purchased the property. This ratio of taxable use to total use is then used to determine the percentage of GST input credits which can be claimed on the property and expenses associated with the property. 4.43 As the market value of the property will generally be significantly more than the rental income received, this formula often allows a high proportion of GST input credits to be claimed. This may provide a registered person with a concurrent use of land a time value of money advantage over someone with a fully-taxable use of the land (that is, a property developer renting out the land as commercial 30 accommodation while advertising it for sale), or someone with a fully non-taxable use of the land (that is, a residential landlord). 4.44 In addition, the existing formula in subsection (3) does not appear to calculate either the extent to which the use of land is taxable, or the extent to which the land holder’s purpose in using the land is taxable. As such, we consider that the apportionment formula in subsection (3) should be amended. Two options for amending the formula are discussed. 4.45 The first option would recognise that, as it is being entirely used for taxable purposes and entirely used for non-taxable purposes, the land is being equally used for both purposes. As such, the taxable use of the land for periods of concurrent use would be fifty percent. This option would appear to be consistent with a time and space apportionment approach. Example 8: Fifty percent taxable use for concurrent use Property Co acquires bare zero-rated land on 1 April 2020 for $1,000,000. They spend the next three years building houses on the land. As such, their use of the land for these three years is 100% taxable. On 1 April 2023 Property Co begins renting out the houses as residential accommodation while advertising the houses for sale. Their taxable use of the land from 1 April 2023 on will be 50% as the land is being used concurrently. On 31 March 2024 Property Co calculates that their taxable use of the land since acquisition was 87.5% (three years of 100% taxable use and one year of 50% taxable use). As such, they make an adjustment and return $18,750 (12.5% of the nominal GST component of the purchase price). 4.46 The second option would attempt to calculate taxable use based on the benefit the registered person receives in using the land concurrently. This would be achieved by comparing, over the period the land is used concurrently, the taxable benefit the owner receives from the land with the total benefit the owner receives from the land. This would be calculated using the formula: Consideration for taxable supply - Cost Total consideration for supply - Cost 4.47 Consideration for taxable supply and total consideration for supply would maintain their current meaning. 4.48 Cost would be the market value of the land at the time the land began to be used concurrently. 31 Example 9: Option 2 formula Develop Co acquires land on 1 April 2020 for $1,150,000 (no GST). They intend to use the land entirely in their taxable activity of property development so claim a second-hand goods input tax deduction of $150,000. Develop Co spends the next two years demolishing the house on the land and constructing an apartment building. As such, their use of the land for these two years is 100% taxable. On 1 April 2022 Develop Co begins renting out the apartments as residential accommodation while advertising the building for sale. As such, from 1 April 2022 they are concurrently using the land. The market value of the land on this date is $2,300,000. Over the next year Develop Co receives 200,000 in rental income and the market value of the land increases to $2,400,000. As such, their taxable use of the land for the last year is calculated as: $2,400,000 - $2,300,000 $2,400,000 + $200,000 - $2,300,000 = 33 1 3 % On 31 March 2023 Develop Co. calculates that their taxable use of the land since acquisition was 77 7/9% (two years of 100% taxable use and one year of 33 1/3% taxable use). As such, they make an adjustment and return $33,333.33 of the input credits they had previously claimed for the land. 4.49 Note that under the second option the proposed formula would not work if the land depreciates in value over the period of concurrent use. In these situations, the taxable use of the land over the period of concurrent use would be zero percent. 4.50 We are seeking feedback on whether the apportionment formula in section 21E(3) should be amended, and if so which of the two options discussed above is more appropriate. We are also seeking feedback on whether there are other options for amending the formula in subsection (3) that would be more appropriate than the two options discussed above. Transitional rules 4.51 There may be some registered persons that own land that section 21E currently applies to but under the proposal to limit the scope of the rule would no longer have a concurrent use of land. This may result in them being required to make large adjustments to return input tax claimed on the land as their taxable use of the land going forward would be zero percent. We are therefore seeking feedback on whether any transitional rules are necessary to limit the impact of the change on these registered persons. 4.52 Any transitional rule would only apply when the registered person’s concurrent use of the land (as currently defined) began prior to 24 February 2020. Disposal of land with a mix of taxable and non-taxable use 4.53 Section 21F applies when a registered person disposes of an asset which they have used for a mix of taxable and non-taxable uses and have therefore only claimed some of the GST they incurred when they acquired the asset. 4.54 Section 21F allows the registered person to claim as an adjustment the proportion of the output tax related to their non-taxable use. However, the amount of the adjustment is capped at the amount of GST paid by the registered person on acquisition of the asset. 32 4.55 For depreciating assets, the final adjustment under section 21F appears to achieve an appropriate result as the net GST returned on disposal of the asset will be equal to the taxable proportion of the asset’s use. This is shown in example 10. Example 10: Depreciating asset Paul purchased a car for $115,000 and 50% of its use is taxable. As such he has claimed an input tax deduction for the car of $7,500. After a few years Paul sells the car for $46,000. He is required to return $6,000 as output tax but can claim an adjustment under section 21F of $3,000 as calculated below: 3 23 × $46,000 × �1 - $7,500 $155,000 � = $3,000 As such, the net GST Paul returns on disposal of the car is only $3,000 (50% of the $6,000 of output tax). This recognises that 50% of Paul’s use of the car was non-taxable. 4.56 However, for land, which often appreciates in value, the final adjustment under section 21F will often produce an inappropriate outcome. 4.57 The amount of the adjustment under section 21F is capped at the unclaimed portion of the GST paid by the registered person on acquisition of the asset. This cap on the adjustment means that, despite any non-taxable use, all the appreciation in value of land is treated as being related to the land’s taxable use. 4.58 Treating all the appreciation in value of land as relating to the taxable use of the land is appropriate in some circumstances. For example, a property developer may use land for some non-taxable purposes (that is, supplying accommodation in a dwelling) before they dispose of it. However, given their taxable activity is property development, the appreciation in the value of the land is likely to primarily relate to their taxable use of the land, rather than any non-taxable use. As such, capping the adjustment under section 21F to the unclaimed portion of the GST paid on acquisition of the land by the property developer is appropriate. 4.59 However, in other situations in which the use of land is both taxable and non- taxable, treating the entire appreciation in value of the land as relating to the taxable use does not appear to be appropriate. When the taxable use of the land does not include adding value to the land, such as having a home office or using a home or bach both privately and for providing short-term commercial accommodation, appreciation in the value of the land relates to both the taxable and non-taxable uses of the land. In these cases, the cap on the adjustment results in the disposal of the land being overtaxed. This is shown in example 11. Example 11: Home office Kelvin purchases a house for $1,150,000 (including GST). He lives in it as his main home, but also has a home office from which he runs his online business of selling biscuits. His taxable use of the house is 20% so he claims an input tax deduction for the house of $30,000. After a few years Kelvin sells the house for $1,265,000. He is required to return $165,000 as output tax but can claim an adjustment under section 21F of $120,000, being the remainder of the input tax he had not previously claimed. As such, the net GST Kelvin returns on disposal of the house is $45,000. This is 27.27% of the output tax on disposal even though Kelvin’s taxable use of the house was only 20%. 33 4.60 We understand that because of the cap on the adjustment in section 21F, some registered persons that have some taxable use of their home or bach are attempting to structure in such a way as to keep their land out of the GST base. Proposal: Removing cap on adjustment for non-developers 4.61 To address the issue discussed above we propose removing the cap on the adjustment in section 21F for land that is disposed of by someone other than a property developer. 4.62 This would be achieved by removing the cap on the adjustment in section 21F for land unless, in the absence of any other taxable supplies the land is used to make, the supply of the land would still be considered as being made in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. Examples 12–14 demonstrate how this would work. Example 12: Home office Consider example 11 with Kelvin. Kelvin’s only taxable activity is his online business of selling biscuits. As such, in the absence of the use of his home for a home office for his online business, the sale of his home would not be considered as being made in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. The cap in section 21F would therefore not apply to the disposal of Kelvin’s home. On disposal of his home Kelvin is required to return $165,000 as output tax but can claim an adjustment for $132,000, recognising his 80% non-taxable use of the home. Example 13: Short-term commercial accommodation Brian and Nita bought a bach in Whangamata for $690,000 that they mainly use privately. However, they also have a taxable use of the bach as they use it for supplying short-term commercial accommodation. Their taxable use of the bach is 40% so they only claim an input tax deduction of $36,000. After a few years they sell the bach for $1,035,000 (including GST). As such they return output tax of $135,000. In the absence of the supplies of short-term commercial accommodation Brian and Nita made from the bach, the supply of the bach would not be considered as being made in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. The cap on adjustments in section 21F would therefore not apply to the disposal of the bach so Brian and Nita claim an adjustment of $81,000. This recognises that 60% of their use of the bach was non-taxable. 34 Example 14: Property developer House Co is a property developer that purchases a house for $2,300,000 that is currently rented out as residential accommodation. Six months later the tenancy ends and they begin renting out the house as short-term commercial accommodation while developing plans and obtaining consent for development work. After six months of using the home for providing short-term commercial accommodation House Co begins the process of demolishing the house, subdividing the land and constructing five new houses on the land. Two years after acquiring the land House Co sells the five new houses for a total price of $5,750,000 (including GST) and returns output tax of $750,000. House Co has a taxable activity of property development and therefore, even in the absence of the supplies of short-term commercial accommodation they made with the land, the supply of the land would still be made in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. As such, the cap on adjustments in section 21F would apply to the disposal of the land. Over the period House Co owned the land their taxable use was seventy 75% so they had claimed an input tax deduction of $225,000. Their adjustment under section 21F would therefore be $75,000. This is the remainder of the input tax they had not previously claimed for the land. 4.63 In removing the cap on section 21F for land (except for property developers) we consider that section 5(18) would no longer be required. The proposal would have a broader impact than section 5(18) as section 5(18) only applies to disposals of dwellings and does not apply to disposals of commercial dwellings or other types of land. Furthermore, section 5(18) could apply to disposals by property developers and we consider this to be inappropriate as, for property developers, increases in the value of the land relate primarily to the taxable use. 4.64 We are seeking feedback on the proposal to remove the cap on adjustments in section 21F for disposals of land by someone other than a property developer. 4.65 At this stage we are not proposing to remove the cap on adjustments for any other appreciating assets. However, we are seeking feedback on whether there are any other situations where the cap on the adjustment should be removed when an asset appreciates in value. Change of use wash-up calculation for land 4.66 As discussed above, the wash-up calculation in section 21FB applies when a registered person changes the use of an asset to one hundred percent taxable or one hundred percent non-taxable. 4.67 As there are no limits to the number of adjustment periods required for land under section 21G, the new formula for the change of use wash-up calculation proposed above would not apply for land. However, there are still some issues with the change of use wash-up calculation for land and these are discussed below. 4.68 For land, the wash-up calculation can result in adjustments that are disproportionately small. This is because the wash-up calculation is based on the cost of an asset rather than its market value and land tends to appreciate in value. This creates a concern that a taxpayer could reduce their output tax liability by switching the use of land to one hundred percent non-taxable and performing the wash-up prior to disposal. 35 4.69 Given the proposed changes to section 21F for non-property developers discussed above, the wash-up calculation in section 21FB may also result in a worse outcome for a person that changes their use of land to one hundred percent taxable, compared to if they had disposed and reacquired the land at its current market value. 4.70 As with non-land assets, the wash-up calculation in section 21FB can only currently be performed when the use of land has been changed to one hundred percent taxable or one hundred percent non-taxable. As such, a person who permanently changes the use of land to something between zero percent and one hundred percent taxable would need to perform yearly adjustments until they dispose of the land. This creates additional compliance costs. Option 1: Deemed disposal and reacquisition 4.71 One option to address the issues discussed above would be for land to be treated as being disposed and reacquired at market value when the change of use wash-up is performed. For ease of compliance, the deemed disposal would be considered a standard rated supply. 4.72 This option could apply for both changes to one hundred percent taxable or non- taxable use and for permanent changes in use to something between zero percent and one hundred percent taxable use. Examples 15–17 illustrate how this would work. Example 15: Change to one hundred percent taxable use On 1 April 2020 Ben purchases a house for $1,150,000 (including GST) that he intends to use both privately as his main home and for supplying short-term commercial accommodation. His intended taxable use of the house is 20% so he claims an input tax deduction of $30,000. On 1 January 2024 Ben switches the use of the house to one hundred percent taxable as he has purchased a new property to live in as his main home. On 31 March 2024 Ben calculates that his taxable use of the land since acquisition has been 25% (3.75 years 20% and 0.25 years 100% taxable use) and performs an adjustment, claiming an additional $7,500 of input tax. On 31 March 2025 Ben can perform the wash-up calculation. He is deemed to dispose of the property and reacquire it at its current market value of $1,285,000 (including GST). As such, he returns output tax of $165,000 but can claim this all back as an input tax deduction. Ben also performs an adjustment under section 21F for his deemed disposal of the land. In the absence of the supplies of commercial accommodation he has made, the disposal would not be in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. As such, the cap on the adjustment in section 21F does not apply and Ben claims an adjustment of $123,750. This is the net effect of performing the change of use wash-up adjustment. 36 Example 16: Change to zero percent taxable use On 1 April 2020 Joanna purchases a house for $690,000 (including GST) that she intends to use both privately as her main home and for a home office that she uses in her taxable activity. Her intended taxable use of the house is 30% so she claims an input tax deduction of $27,000. On 1 October 2023 Joanna switches the use of the house to 0% taxable. On 31 March 2024 Joanna calculates that her taxable use of the land since acquisition has been 26.25% (3.5 years 30% and 0.5 years 0% taxable use) and performs an adjustment, returning $3,375 of input tax she had previously claimed. On 31 March 2025 Joanna can perform the wash-up calculation. She is deemed to dispose of the land and reacquire it at its current market value of $920,000 (including GST). She therefore returns output tax of $120,000 but cannot claim any of this back as an input tax deduction. Joanna also performs an adjustment under section 21F for her deemed disposal of the land. As she was not a property developer the cap in section 21F does not apply so Joanna claims an adjustment of $88,500 (73.75% of the output tax). The net effect of performing the change of use wash-up adjustment is that Joanna must return $31,500. Example 17: Change to twenty five percent taxable On 1 October 2021 Graeme purchases a bach for $805,000 (including GST). He intends to use the bach equally for both private use and for making supplies of commercial accommodation. As such he claims an input tax deduction of $52,500. On 1 January 2024 Graeme switches the taxable use of the bach to twenty five percent. On 31 March 2024 Graeme calculates his taxable use of the bach since acquisition as 47.5% (2.25 years fifty percent and 0.25 years twenty five percent). As such he performs an adjustment and returns $2,625 of the input tax he had previously claimed. On 31 March 2025 Graeme can perform the wash-up calculation. He is deemed to dispose of the bach for its current market value of $1,035,000 (including GST). He therefore returns output tax of $135,000 but can claim $33,750 of this back as an input tax deduction as his taxable use of the bach going forwards will be twenty five percent. Graeme also performs an adjustment under section 21F for his deemed disposal of the land. As he is not a property developer the cap on section 21F does not apply. Graeme therefore claims an adjustment of $70,875 (52.75% of the output tax). The net effect of performing the change of use wash-up adjustment is that Graeme must return $30,375. 4.73 One concern with this option is that it may impose compliance costs on registered persons in determining the market value of the land when they perform the wash- up calculation. However, the one-off compliance cost of determining the land’s market value may be less than the compliance costs of performing continual yearly adjustments after a permanent change in use. There is also a risk that obtaining an estimate of the land’s market-value could be open to manipulation. 4.74 We are seeking feedback on the appropriateness of this option to make the change in use wash-up for land a deemed disposal and reacquisition at market value. Option 2: Updated formula 4.75 As an alternative, the existing wash-up adjustments for land could be maintained but the calculation amended to allow it to be used for permanent changes in use to 37 something other than one hundred percent taxable or non-taxable. This would be achieved by replacing both of the current formulas with this formula: Full input tax deduction × Current use - Actual deduction 4.76 Current use would be the percentage taxable use of the land since the change of use occurred. 4.77 This proposed formula would not address the concerns that the wash-up calculation for land can result in adjustments that are disproportionately small. However, to address the fiscal risk from someone reducing their output tax on disposal by performing the wash-up adjustment, a special adjustment rule would apply when land that has been subject to the wash-up after a permanent decrease in its taxable use is disposed of within five years of the permanent change of use occurring. This special rule would not apply when land is disposed of after the wash-up has been performed following a permanent increase in the land’s taxable use. 4.78 This rule would require the actual taxable use of the land since acquisition to be calculated and an adjustment made to claim input tax in line with this percentage. The supply of the land would then be a taxable supply (even if the use of the land had changed to zero percent) and section 21F would apply to the disposal of the land. Examples 18–19 demonstrate how this would work. Example 18: Change to zero percent taxable use Consider example 16 with Joanna. On 31 March 2025 Joanna performs the wash-up calculation and returns the $23,625 of input tax she had previously claimed. On 30 September 2027 Joanna sells the house for $1,150,000. As this is within five years of the permanent change of use to 0% taxable use the supply of the house is treated as a taxable supply and Joanna must return output tax of $150,000. Joanna calculates her actual taxable use of the land since acquisition as 14% (3.5 years 30% and four years 0% taxable use). As such, Joanna claims $12,600 in input tax for the land. She then claims an additional adjustment under section 21F of $129,000, being eighty six percent of the output tax. Example 19: Change to twenty five percent taxable Consider example 17 with Graeme. On 31 March 2025 Graeme can perform the wash-up calculation and returns $23,625 of the input tax he had previously claimed: $105,000 × 25% − $49,875 = $23,625 Graeme sells the house on 1 January 2028 for $1,265,000 (including GST) and returns output tax of $165,000. As the disposal is only four years after the permanent change in use to 25% taxable use, the special adjustment rule would apply. Graeme calculates his taxable use of the property since acquisition as 34% (2.25 years 50% and four years 25% taxable use). As such he claims an additional $9,450 input tax for the property. He also claims an adjustment under section 21F of $108,900 (66% of the output tax). 38 4.79 The special adjustment rule would also apply if a person ceases being a registered person within five years of the permanent change of use occurring. 4.80 We are seeking feedback on the appropriateness of the proposed new formula under this option. We are also seeking feedback on the proposed special adjustment rule to address the fiscal risk from someone reducing their output tax by performing the wash-up after a permanent decrease in the taxable use of land. Zero-rated land 4.81 If either the existing wash-up calculation is maintained or the proposed calculation under option 2 is adopted a minor amendment would need to be made to the definition of “actual deduction”. 4.82 For the purposes of the wash-up calculation, “actual deduction” is defined in section 21FB(3)(b) as the “amount of deduction already claimed, taking into account adjustments made up to the end of the adjustment period referred to in subsection 1(c)(ii)”. This definition does not take into account any nominal deduction received for zero-rated land. In contrast, the definition of “full input tax deduction” does include the nominal GST component chargeable under section 20(3J)(a)(i). 4.83 We propose to update the definition of “actual deduction” to include a nominal deduction for the proportion of the nominal GST component not returned as output tax on acquisition of zero-rated land. Other ways to simplify the apportionment and adjustment rules 4.84 We have also heard from many stakeholders that the apportionment rules can be complex and difficult to apply. As such, we are considering ways in which the apportionment and adjustment rules could be simplified. 4.85 Some possible ways in which the rules could be simplified are discussed below. We are interested in feedback on whether these ideas have merit and are worth exploring further. We also welcome submissions on any other ways the apportionment and adjustment rules could be simplified. Understanding which rule is applicable 4.86 We understand that it may not always be easy for a registered person to determine which particular apportionment or adjustment rule applies to them. To assist in navigating these rules a signposting provision could be added at the beginning of the apportionment and adjustment section of the GST Act. 4.87 Alternatively, Inland Revenue could provide additional guidance material to assist taxpayers and their agents navigate the apportionment and adjustment rules. De minimis thresholds for minor taxable use 4.88 The sale of an asset that has been used in a person’s taxable activity will generally be a taxable supply. This means that very minor taxable use of a good or service can make the eventual disposal of that asset a taxable supply. 39 4.89 A threshold for minor taxable use of an asset could be established, for example ten percent. If the taxable use of the asset is below this threshold and no input tax deductions have been claimed in relation to the asset, the disposal of the asset would not be considered as being made in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. 4.90 A de minimis threshold for minor taxable use would mean that, when the taxable use of an asset is below this threshold a registered person could choose not to claim any input tax and would therefore not be required to perform any adjustments. Accuracy of apportionment and adjustments 4.91 The current apportionment and adjustment rules require precise calculations of the taxable use of a good or service. However, the rules could instead require the taxable use of an asset be calculated to a certain level of accuracy, for example the nearest five percent. 4.92 This would mean that if the intended taxable use of an asset was 50%, but it is determined that during the first adjustment period the actual taxable use was 52% or 49% no adjustment would be required. Conversely, if the actual taxable use was 53% the taxable use of the asset would be considered 55% and an adjustment would be required. 4.93 We note that for high-value assets it is more important for apportionment to be accurate. Therefore, it may only be appropriate to allow taxable use to be calculated to a certain level of accuracy for assets acquired for less than a particular amount. 4.94 There are also some thresholds under which adjustments are not required. For example, adjustments are not required for goods and services under $5,000 (excluding GST), or if the difference between the percentage intended use and percentage actual use is less than 10 percentage points and the amount of the adjustment does not exceed $1,000. These thresholds could be amended to reduce the instances of adjustments being required. Questions for submitters • Do you support the proposed new wash-up calculation for non-land assets that have had a permanent change in use? • Do you support the proposal to limit the application of section 21E so it does not apply in situations where the only taxable use of the land in an adjustment period is holding the land for its eventual sale or development? • Should the apportionment formula in section 21E be amended and if so which of the two proposed formulae is more appropriate? • Would any transitional rules be necessary if the scope of section 21E was limited? • For disposals of land that has had a mix of taxable and non-taxable use, do you support the proposal to remove the cap on the final adjustment for non-developers? • Should the wash-up calculation for land that has had a permanent change of use be amended and if so which of the two proposed options do you support? • How can the apportionment and adjustment rules be amended more generally to make them simpler and easier to apply? 41 CHAPTER 5 Domestic legs of the international transport of goods Background 5.1 The GST Act zero-rates services provided to transport goods to and from New Zealand. Furthermore, in certain circumstances, the transport of goods within New Zealand as part of the international transport of goods may also be zero-rated. This is because exported goods are zero-rated, and the value of transport services is already included in the cost of imported goods which are subject to 15% GST. 5.2 However, the rules around when domestic transport services that form part of the international transport of goods may be zero-rated do not align with common commercial practices. It is now common commercial practice for an international courier contracted to supply the international transport of goods to or from New Zealand (the primary transport supplier) to subcontract to a New Zealand-based courier company to supply the domestic transport services – instead of establishing their own courier company in New Zealand to carry out the domestic portion of the courier service. 5.3 For the domestic transport services to be zero-rated, the requirement that the primary transport supplier must also supply the domestic portion of the international transport of goods for the domestic transport services is applied strictly. That means that if a New Zealand-based courier is subcontracted by the international transporter to provide domestic transport services as part of the international transport of goods service, the New Zealand-based courier must charge GST on this supply, even if they are associated with, or a wholly owned subsidiary of, the international transport supplier. Example 20 Jason’s Amazing Shipping Experience (JASE), an international courier company, has a New Zealand-based subsidiary called Kim Couriers. JASE is hired to transport goods from Sydney to Greymouth. JASE delivers the goods from Sydney to Christchurch and contracts Kim Couriers to deliver the goods from Christchurch to Greymouth. Despite being associated JASE and Kim Couriers are considered to be different suppliers. Therefore, the domestic transportation services supplied by Kim Couriers to JASE should be subject to GST at the standard rate. Issues Non-compliance 5.4 The current rules have led to significant non-compliance within the goods transportation industry. Officials understand that many goods transporters are incorrectly zero-rating their domestic services, even though they do not qualify under the GST rules. 42 5.5 Much of this non-compliance is due to a lack of understanding of the requirement that for the domestic transportation leg to be zero-rated it must be supplied by the exact same supplier as the international transportation. We understand that some couriers erroneously consider the same supplier requirement to be met if an associated or sub-contracted courier supplies the domestic transportation services. 5.6 We also understand that there can be significant commercial pressure for suppliers of domestic transport services to erroneously zero-rate their supply, especially when the recipient of the supply of the domestic transport service is not registered for GST. Naturally, the current rules create a bias towards the international transport supplier of the international transport services also supplying the domestic transport services. This can lead to commercial pressure on domestic courier companies to zero-rate their supplies of domestic transportation services provided as part of the international transport of goods. Tax cascades 5.7 The current rules may create tax cascades when a business that is not registered for GST (such as an offshore courier company) is charged GST by a domestic courier undertaking the domestic leg of the transportation. Any GST charged to a non- registered business by a supplier of the domestic leg of the international transport of goods cannot be refunded by Inland Revenue. Consequently, this GST will become embedded in the price charged for the international transport of the goods and ultimately will become embedded in the price of the goods. Example 21 Brett’s Golf Emporium, a GST-registered golf store from Hamilton, purchases a large order of golf clubs from Luecker Golfing Supplies, a golf equipment manufacturer based in Chicago. Brett’s Golf Emporium hires JASE, an international courier company that is not registered for GST, to transport the golf clubs from Chicago to Hamilton. JASE subcontracts the domestic leg of the transportation to Kim Couriers, JASE’s New Zealand subsidiary. Kim Couriers is registered for GST so charges JASE $115 (including GST) for its supply of domestic transport services. As JASE is not registered for GST, they are unable to recover the $15 GST charged to them by Kim Couriers. The total price charged by JASE to Brett’s Golf Emporium is $215. This price includes the $15 of GST charged to JASE by Kim Couriers. Despite Brett’s Golf Emporium being registered for GST they are unable to reclaim this $15 of GST that is embedded in the price of the international transport of the golf clubs. This unrecoverable GST will therefore become embedded in the price of the golf clubs sold by Brett’s Golf Emporium. 5.8 Tax cascades (where a business absorbs the GST cost that is otherwise irrecoverable and passes this additional cost on to its customers as part of the sales price) can be avoided if non-resident businesses chose to register for GST in New Zealand either under section 51 if they have a taxable activity in New Zealand or section 54B if they do not make taxable supplies in New Zealand but do incur GST. Services provided to international postal agencies 5.9 Section 11A(1)(g) of the GST Act zero-rates services supplied to overseas postal organisations for delivery in New Zealand of postal articles mailed from outside New Zealand, regardless of whether parts of the service are provided by the same transport provider. This difference in GST treatment between courier-delivered 43 packages and postal-delivered packages has unintentionally favoured postal- delivered businesses. Possible solution 5.10 We propose allowing domestic transport services supplied to the primary transport supplier contracted to transport goods to or from New Zealand to be zero-rated if the primary transport supplier is a non-resident. This is similar to the approach taken in Australia and Singapore. Example 22: Non-resident courier subcontracts a domestic courier JASE, a non-resident courier company, is contracted to transport goods from Mumbai to Hamilton. JASE transports the goods to Auckland and subcontracts Kim Couriers to provide domestic transport services between Auckland and Hamilton. Under the current rules Kim Couriers must charge GST on its supply to JASE. Under the proposed rules Kim Couriers can zero-rate its supply of domestic transport services as they are part of the international transport of goods and are supplied to the primary transport supplier who is a non-resident. Example 23: Resident courier subcontracts a domestic courier Laura’s Logistics, a resident courier company, is contracted to transport goods from Stewart Island to New York City. Laura’s Logistics subcontracts Pilko’s Post, a domestic courier company based in Stewart Island, to transport the goods from Stewart Island to Bluff. Laura’s Logistics then transports the goods from Bluff to New York City. Despite Laura’s Logistics being the primary transport suppliers, Pilko’s Post would still need to charge GST on its supply to Laura’s Logistics under the proposed rules. This is because Laura’s Logistics is a resident courier company. Why should domestic transport services only be zero-rated if supplied to a non-resident? 5.11 The rationale for only allowing zero-rating of domestic transport services supplied to the primary transport supplier if the international transport supplier is a non- resident is that non-residents are much less likely to be registered for GST. The commercial pressure to zero-rate the domestic transport services and potential for tax cascades from standard rating domestic transport services only arise when the recipient of these services is not registered for GST. 5.12 In addition, only allowing zero-rating when the international transport supplier is non-resident means the supplier of domestic transport services only needs to determine if their supply is part of the international transport of goods if supplied to a non-resident. 5.13 However, we are interested in receiving feedback on whether it would be better to zero-rate all domestic transport services supplied to the primary transport supplier contracted to transport goods to or from New Zealand regardless of the residency of the primary transport supplier. This approach may be simpler for domestic transport providers because rather than determining the residency of the international transport provider, they would need to identify whether the goods delivery service they are undertaking is related to an international transport service. 44 Domestic transport services supplied as part of the international transport of goods 5.14 Consistent with the existing policy intent, we are proposing that if the international transport supplier is contracted to deliver goods from point A outside New Zealand to point B in New Zealand then they can zero-rate their entire supply. Any domestic transport services contractually supplied to the international primary transport supplier between point A and point B can therefore also be zero-rated if the international transport supplier is non-resident. 5.15 Likewise, if the international transport supplier is contracted to deliver goods from point B in New Zealand to point A outside New Zealand then they can zero-rate this entire supply. Any domestic transport services contractually supplied to the international transport supplier between point B and point A can therefore also be zero-rated if the primary transport supplier is non-resident. 5.16 However, we are interested in feedback on whether we need a more prescriptive definition of what constitutes the international transport of goods. For example, Australia has specific rules to determine when domestic transport services have been supplied as part of the international transport of goods. 5.17 In Australia, the transport of imported goods may be zero-rated up to the place of consignment. This is generally where the goods are to be delivered under the international transport supplier’s contract for international transport services. Any domestic transport services supplied to the international transport supplier until the goods reach the place of consignment can therefore be zero-rated if the international transport supplier is a non-resident. 5.18 Likewise, for the international transport of exported goods Australia allows zero- rating from the final place of collection prior to containerisation. This is the location that the goods will be collected under the international transport supplier’s contract of service before the goods are placed into shipping containers. Any domestic transport services provided to the international transport supplier from the final place of collection prior to containerisation can therefore be zero-rated if the international transport supplier is a non-resident. Questions for submitters • Other than subcontracting arrangements, are there any other commercial practices that should be considered? • Should any amendment to the rule be based on whether the international transport provider is a non-resident, or alternatively, zero-rate all domestic transport services where they relate to an international transport service? • Should any amendment include a prescriptive definition of when domestic transport services have been supplied as part of the international transport of goods? 45 CHAPTER 6 Business conferences and staff training 6.1 GST is designed to be a broad-based low rate tax on consumption of goods and services in New Zealand. When GST has been incurred by businesses making taxable supplies, then the business should be able to recover the GST paid on their business expenses, in a cost-effective way. This includes situations where a business sends their staff to a New Zealand conference or training course. 6.2 A business that is registered for GST can claim GST input credits in relation to the GST it pays for its employees to attend a New Zealand conference (see figure 1). Figure 1: Claiming GST for a New Zealand conference NZ business (GST-registered) NZ conference Conference fees ($2,300 per person) Inland Revenue $300 GST paid $300 GST refund Impractical for offshore businesses to claim back GST on conferences and staff training 6.3 However, most offshore business will not be registered for GST in New Zealand so are unable to claim GST input credits in relation to GST on conference or training fees. 6.4 Although it is possible for such offshore businesses to register for GST (under section 54B of the GST Act) in order to claim refunds, in practice the process of registering for GST solely to claim small, irregular GST refunds can impose an undue compliance on offshore businesses (when their only New Zealand expenses are a one-off or occasional expense of attending a conference). 6.5 For some conferences, a large number of offshore businesses may attend and each of these businesses would need to register for GST and file a GST return if they wished to claim a GST refund. This means the current rules are not a practical way for offshore businesses to recover their GST costs when they attend New Zealand conferences. 46 6.6 To mitigate these practical difficulties, Australia and Singapore have made conferences, staff training, and other services provided to offshore businesses “GST-free” or zero-rated for GST (GST applies at 0%). 6.7 The New Zealand conference industry faces a disadvantage in respect of attracting international conferences compared to Australia and other locations such as Singapore which do not charge GST on business conferences or staff training. In contrast, the European Union countries apply VAT/GST at full rates on conference services provided to offshore businesses. Zero-rating GST on conferences and staff training supplied to non-resident businesses 6.8 To address this issue, officials are proposing to zero-rate GST on conferences, conventions and staff training supplied in New Zealand to non-resident businesses. 6.9 Zero-rating GST for conference services provided to offshore businesses would make it relatively more attractive to host large international conferences in New Zealand. 6.10 The proposal could increase the competitiveness of New Zealand training providers that provide staff training courses. We are interested in any market data available on the current size of this market. Design issues 6.11 In order to implement a clear and robust zero-rating rule, a number of design issues would need to be worked through with the affected conference organisers, business training providers and tax advisors. 6.12 The two main design issues are the definition of a non-resident business and the definition of the qualifying conference or staff training services. Non-resident business 6.13 The rationale for the proposed zero-rating rule is to ensure GST does not impose unrecoverable costs on businesses. Therefore, zero-rating should only apply when the service is supplied to a non-resident business. 6.14 In many cases, training and education services will be received by students in a personal capacity (as opposed to a business buying training for its staff). In such circumstances the training represents final consumption in New Zealand rather than a business input, so it should continue to be standard-rated (subject to 15% GST). 6.15 For the purposes of the proposed zero-rating rule a non-resident business could be defined using the existing criterion in section 54B. That criterion refers to a non- resident who is not registered for GST under section 51 and is registered for a consumption tax (GST or VAT) in a country or territory in which they are resident (or is resident in a country or territory without a consumption tax and would have at least $60,000 of taxable supplies if they were resident in New Zealand). In addition, the zero-rating rule would also not apply to non-resident businesses which 47 were already registered for GST under section 54B as these businesses are already able to claim input credits in respect of New Zealand GST costs. 6.16 A key difference between the existing rules in section 54B and a proposed zero- rating rule for conferences, would be that the New Zealand supplier would need to obtain sufficient information to be able to determine both the residency and business status of the conference attendee. Services which qualify for the zero-rating provision 6.17 Singapore’s GST rules zero-rate exhibitions, conventions, staff training or retraining for business or employment. 6.18 Singapore’s rules also zero-rate services which are supplementary to providing the exhibition, convention or staff training (such as organising these events), but specifically exclude “services related to entertainment and accommodation” (such services are subject to the standard rate of GST). 6.19 Officials consider Singapore’s rules provide a clear boundary between business conferences and staff training and private consumption of tourism activities and that similar zero-rating rules could be used in New Zealand. 6.20 It is proposed that the service would have to relate to a business conference or staff training and there would be specific exclusions for accommodation or entertainment. So, for example, conference fees would be zero-rated but hotels and tourism experiences would continue to be standard-rated (subject to 15% GST). 6.21 However, we note that it is industry practice to “bundle” accommodation and other services (such as hospitality) into a conference or convention attendance fee. There could be a greater incentive to bundle other services (such as entertainment) into a conference package, to subject all of the services to zero-rate. 6.22 Officials are keen to receive submissions on the types of services that are typically bundled into a conference or convention fee, to assist officials with the policy development of this proposal. 6.23 Accordingly, most parts of “incentive tours” that businesses use to reward employees with tourism experiences would remain standard-rated. This is consistent with the fact that similar incentives provided to New Zealand employees as rewards for their work would be liable for fringe benefit tax and subject to GST as they represent private consumption. 6.24 It is therefore proposed that the zero-rating would only apply if a non-resident business uses the service for the purpose of carrying on a taxable activity. This should ensure that training provided to an individual in a personal capacity would not qualify for zero-rating. 48 Questions for submitters • What are the costs, benefits and risks from the proposal to zero-rate GST on business conferences and staff training supplied to non-resident businesses? What data is available to assist with estimating these costs and benefits? • How should a non-resident business be defined and identified by the relevant suppliers? • What type of conference and training services should qualify for the proposed zero- rating? How should these be defined to provide certainty and reduce the risk of private consumption such as tourism activities becoming zero-rated? 49 CHAPTER 7 Managed funds 7.1 This chapter discusses policy options for changing the GST treatment of manager and investment manager services supplied to managed funds. There are differing GST treatments for management services supplied to managed funds 7.2 The current GST treatment of different types of management services supplied to managed funds is complex and inconsistent. 7.3 Consider for example, a KiwiSaver scheme that invests into many underlying funds that specialise in different investments such as United States shares or New Zealand fixed interest. Each of these funds has a manager and investment managers. The KiwiSaver scheme will buy services from a KiwiSaver manager, and for each underlying fund they invest into they will be charged for services provided by managers and investment managers. 7.4 There is a specific GST exemption for the “management of a retirement scheme”, which would apply to the management services provided by the KiwiSaver manager. However, this exemption does not apply when a retirement scheme invests into a general wholesale fund as the managers and investment managers will be providing their services to the wholesale fund rather than the retirement scheme. 7.5 For services provided to wholesale funds there are a range of differing GST practices: • Some managers and investment managers apply 15% GST to all of their services (as in their view their services are providing “advice” or other types of services that are subject to 15% GST). • Others treat ten percent of their services as being subject to 15% GST and the remaining ninety percent as exempt from GST (because they consider their services are mostly “arranging” the buying and selling of investment products and so should qualify for the GST exemption for financial services). 7.6 Inland Revenue analysed the existing law and publicly consulted on two draft questions we’ve been asked outlining the Commissioner’s considered views on how the current GST Act would apply to unit trust managers and investment managers. 2 The draft views concluded that: • Unit trust manager fees are exempt from GST as the unit trust manager is considered to be arranging financial services. • Investment manager fees are subject to 15% GST in the typical case where the unit trust manager is not required to accept decisions made by an 2 PUB00277aa: Goods and Services Tax – GST treatment of fees payable to manager of a unit trust PUB00277bb: Goods and Services Tax – GST treatment of outsourced services in relation to a unit trust 50 investment manager and the investment manager does not have authority to give instructions to the trustee (who holds the assets of the unit trust). In these cases, the investment manager is considered to be providing advice (which is subject to 15% GST), rather than arranging a financial service (which would qualify as an exempt financial service). • Other outsourced services such as administrative or registry services will typically be subject to 15% GST as they are not financial services. 7.7 Because different types of manager and investment manager services can have complex and differing GST treatments, the current GST rules can distort competition by favouring certain types of managed funds, business structures, or judgements for how the supplier may choose to interpret the GST rules (for example, where one interpretation or position may provide them more favourable outcome than an alternative position). 7.8 The current GST rules can also add costs to managed funds products. These costs include compliance costs of identifying and working out the GST treatment of different types of management services and unrecoverable GST costs to the extent to which a provider of exempt financial services is charged GST on their inputs of non-financial services. 7.9 For these reasons, officials propose developing some special rules for determining the GST treatment of manager and investment manager services. The appropriate GST treatment of these services is not obvious as it depends on the policy objectives of the reform. Policy objectives when considering GST treatment of services supplied to managed funds Limiting the GST exemption for financial services 7.10 GST is a broad-based tax with few exemptions. The GST exemption for financial services means these services are undertaxed compared to other services which creates biases (discussed in the next section) and requires increased taxation on other activities to generate the same amount of Government revenue. From a GST policy perspective, the financial services definition should be as limited as necessary. 7.11 The main reason for the proposed GST exemption for financial services is valuation difficulties. These valuation difficulties arise because some financial services involve a mixture of a savings product and a service. These valuation issues do not arise for managers and investment managers as they charge a separate fee for their services (rather than a fee for a bundled mix of services and investment products). Minimising any significant biases that GST may create 7.12 It is important to ensure that GST treatment of various managed fund fees does not provide a significant competitive advantage for certain types of savings products, managed funds, business structures or larger funds which may be better able to reduce or recover some of their GST costs. 51 7.13 For example, because the GST rules currently provide an exemption for “management of a retirement scheme”, there could be a bias for managed funds to invest into specialist retirement funds, rather than more general funds. This may encourage inefficient arrangements. More generally, the retirement scheme exemptions were introduced in 1985 to ensure that the GST exemption for life insurance did not encourage life insurance to be the preferred long-term savings product compared to retirement schemes. Commercial developments with how life insurance products are used, and how retirement funds invest into and are close substitutes for other types of managed funds mean there is no longer a good policy rationale for having different GST rules apply depending on whether the management service is provided to a retirement scheme, compared to another type of managed fund. 7.14 GST exemptions also create a bias for exempt service providers to provide services in-house as they face unrecoverable GST costs from outsourcing. This bias is undesirable given that outsourcing may be more commercially efficient or more consistent with financial market regulations. Providing certainty of GST treatment 7.15 To minimise compliance costs, potential errors or competitive biases it will be important to develop a clear definition of the manager and investment manager services which qualify for a particular GST treatment. Minimising adjustment costs compared to current commercial practices 7.16 Transitional and compliance costs could be reduced by aligning with existing commercial practices. The difficulty is there are a range of current practices. GST treatment of managed funds in other countries 7.17 Looking at the rules in other countries, there are different ways that other GST and VAT systems treat managed funds and investment management services. Australia and Singapore 7.18 Both Australia and Singapore’s GST rules apply GST at standard rates to all services provided to managed funds. However, both these countries then allow the funds to claim back most of the GST costs of their inputs through a reduced input tax credit mechanism. In Australia reduced input tax credits are available for seventy five percent of the GST costs except for trustee fees where only fifty five percent of the GST cost can be deducted. In Singapore a GST remittance is allowed for qualifying funds – the percentage varies each year but is about ninety percent of the GST charged to the fund. 7.19 The rationale for providing a reduced input tax credit is to reduce the bias to perform the relevant services in-house (as there are GST costs from outsourcing but none from the insourcing). Conceptually, the reduced input tax credit should be set so it is equal to the percentage of the outsourced service provider’s fee that comprises their own wages and profits (as opposed to third party costs). In practice, determining the appropriate percentage is not obvious. 52 European Union countries 7.20 A European Union VAT directive requires European Union member states to exempt the “management of special investment funds as defined by member states”. European Union countries exempt management services provided to funds on the basis that the VAT system should not impose additional VAT costs from investing through managed funds, compared to investing in the underlying shares or bonds directly. Policy options for how GST could apply to manager and investment manager services 7.21 Officials propose amending the GST Act definition of “financial services” to provide a more certain and consistent GST treatment for manager and investment manager services supplied to managed funds. 7.22 Three main options for changing the law are discussed below. We welcome submissions on these or other potential policy options. If the law is changed, Inland Revenue will not finalise or implement its view of the current law (which is currently in draft). Making all management services supplied by investment managers and other fund managers taxable supplies 7.23 This option would involve excluding services provided by fund managers and investment managers from the GST Act definition of financial services. 7.24 This would be consistent with the rationale that the financial services exemption should generally be limited to cases where there are valuation issues. This is not the case for fund managers and investment managers as they usually charge a separate fee for their services (rather than a margin or a bundled combination of services and investment products). 7.25 Applying GST to all services provided by fund managers and investment managers could reduce insourcing biases and simplify GST compliance as they would be able to claim input credits for GST charged on their external costs. 7.26 However, because the services that funds provide to investors would still be exempt from GST, applying GST to the manager’s fees charged to funds would impose an unrecoverable GST cost on funds. These GST costs are likely to lead to higher fees and reduced after-tax returns for retail investors. 7.27 Also, if the existing GST exemption for managers of a retirement scheme was retained, there would be inconsistent GST treatment as managers of retirement schemes would have no GST on their fees whereas other types of fund managers would have 15% GST on their fees. This could create biases for investing through retirement funds rather than other types of managed funds and for retirement schemes to be structured so that they receive manager services directly, rather than indirectly through investing in non-retirement funds. 53 Exempting all management services supplied by investment managers and other fund managers 7.28 This option would broaden the GST Act definition of financial services to include fund management. This would involve expanding the existing exemption for managers of a retirement scheme, so it also applies to managers who provide management services to other types of funds. 7.29 A more general exemption for fund managers and investment managers may be justified on the basis that the financial services exemption already extends to some services which are close substitutes for another type of exempt financial service in order to reduce tax distortions on business or investment decisions. For example, because services provided by a manager of a retirement scheme are specifically exempt from GST, a managed fund may prefer to purchase those services as opposed to services provided by an investment manager, unless investment management services are also exempt. 7.30 On the other hand, a broader financial services exemption that includes all fund manager and investment manager fees would narrow the GST base and lead to greater amounts of financial services being only partially subject to GST (on their taxable inputs), compared to other services (such as financial advice) which are subject to 15% GST. 7.31 This creates a bias because an individual investor seeking financial advice would be charged GST for that advice but a managed fund purchasing investment management services (which may include investment advice) would not be charged GST. However, this bias is unlikely to be significant enough to affect decisions about whether to invest into a managed fund or invest directly into shares or bonds. 7.32 Similarly, Discretionary Investment Management Services (DIMS) services may be disadvantaged if they are required to charge GST on their services and managed funds are not. 7.33 An exemption would impose GST costs for managers and investment managers to the extent to which they purchase inputs such as renting office space, hiring contractors, or procuring data, external advice, administrative services or computer services. 7.34 Depending on how the relevant services are defined an exemption could create boundary issues in determining whether a service was a management service or another type of service. For example, there could be incentives to bundle or reclassify some other types of services as being management services to further reduce GST costs for managed funds. 7.35 Providing an exemption for management services would also lead to policy arguments that other types of services provided to managed funds should also be made exempt from GST in order to further reduce GST costs for managed funds. See paragraphs from 7.58 onward for a further discussion about the GST treatment of other types of services provided to managed funds. 7.36 It would be important to develop a robust and certain definition of the services which qualify for any fund management exemption. European Union case law has found that the “management” of an investment fund has a broad meaning for 54 European Union VAT purposes and can include administrative services and advice. In contrast, New Zealand has made policy decisions that administrative services and advice should be subject to 15% GST and should not qualify as exempt financial services. Legislate that managers and investment managers are deemed to have a certain percentage of taxable (subject to GST at 15%) and exempt supplies 7.37 This approach could be used to partly tax the relevant services. It could provide certainty and consistency which may reduce competitive distortions. 7.38 Depending on the percentage used, it could also potentially align with some existing industry practices (ninety percent exempt, ten percent taxable), although this would represent a major change for other managers who are currently treating their supplies as taxable supplies. 7.39 One of the issues with this approach is that it is not obvious what the appropriate percentage should be. Any legislated percentage could either overcompensate or undercompensate relative to the true nature of the manager’s services unless it was supported by evidence. We are interested in submissions on what percentage could be considered a reasonable approximation of the taxable services provided by managers and investment managers. 7.40 As with an exemption option, a partial exemption option would also mean there was less GST charged on these services compared to other types of services which are subject to GST at 15%. 7.41 This option would also be inconsistent with the fact that the GST Act does not usually apportion output tax on supplies. (The main exception to this is section 10(6) which deems sixty percent of domestic goods and services provided in a commercial dwelling to be taxable supplies if the occupant stays for more than four weeks.) 7.42 If the manager is providing multiple types of services to the fund, a better approach could be to apply the analysis for determining if there is a single or multiple supply as discussed in the Inland Revenue Interpretation Statement IS 18/04 (Goods and services tax – single supply or multiple supplies). Applying this analysis would typically conclude that a service is a single supply if it had a dominant element and the other elements were reasonably incidental. This option of deeming a certain percentage of the supply to be taxable would therefore represent a significant departure from this approach. Zero-rating or a reduced input tax credit mechanism 7.43 Compared to an exemption, zero-rating would further reduce the GST costs associated with providing management services to funds, as the managers and investment managers would still be able to claim back the GST costs of their own inputs. 7.44 A reduced input tax credit mechanism for the managers and investment managers would allow partial recovery of the GST costs on the inputs. 55 7.45 Both options give rise to many of the same disadvantages of the exemption or partial exemption options discussed above – such as the need to carefully define manager and investment manager services to provide certainty as to what services qualify for the special GST treatment. 7.46 However, compared to the other policy options, zero-rating or a reduced input tax mechanism would mean the manager and investment manager services would be substantially undertaxed (compared to both other services and to GST-exempt financial services). It would also create a much more significant precedent. Furthermore, compared to current practices it would have a high fiscal cost for the Government. 7.47 While both Australia and Singapore provide reduced input tax credits for managed funds, these countries also have a narrower definition of financial services than New Zealand that excludes services of “arranging” a financial product. Accordingly, the services provided by managers and investment managers are subject to GST in these countries. 7.48 In Australia, reduced input tax credits are available to all financial service providers, not just managed funds. The policy rationale for providing reduced input tax credits is to reduce the bias that an exemption creates to provide inputs in-house rather than outsource these to other providers. It may also be hard to justify why reduced input credits should only be provided for managed funds or managers of managed funds (which for commercial and regulatory reasons often need to outsource certain services regardless of the GST cost) compared to other financial service providers (where GST may create a bigger bias against outsourcing). 7.49 Even if the GST treatment of manager and investment manager fees generates a significant problem by discouraging outsourcing, it is not obvious what percentage of GST should be recoverable under the reduced input tax credit. Conceptually, it should be the percentage of the outsourced service providers’ fees that comprises their profit and staff wages, but in practice this can differ across service providers and will be difficult to reduce into a single percentage. 7.50 For these reasons, officials consider the case for introducing reduced input tax credits would be more appropriately considered as part of a more fundamental review of the financial services definition that considered the full range of financial services, not just manager and investment manager services. Reduced input tax credits are a logical alternative option to providing an exemption for the service of “arranging” a financial product. 7.51 Providing zero-rating or reduced input tax credits would further reduce the partial GST on non-financial services that retail investors benefit from as a result of investing through managed funds. This would make receiving these services through managed funds further advantaged compared to other services, such as individual investors buying their own research or financial advice which would be subject to 15% GST. 7.52 Finally, either a new zero-rating rule or a reduced input tax credit mechanism would have a significant fiscal cost compared to the current rules where GST partially applies to managed funds. For example, zero-rating would effectively allow GST to be removed on all administrative services provided to managed funds as these 56 would be purchased by a manager who makes zero-rated supplies and is able to claim input credits for these GST costs. Application date 7.53 It is proposed that the potential law change could apply prospectively but with grandparenting of existing contracts for a period (for example, three years) to ease adjustment costs and to enable new contracts to be negotiated. Defining the relevant management and investment management services 7.54 The changes would apply to both management services by a manager and investment services by an investment manager that were provided directly or indirectly to a managed investment scheme or a foreign equivalent. 7.55 The terms “manager”, “investment manager” and “managed investment scheme” could be defined by referencing the existing definitions of these terms in section 6(1) and section 9 of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013. Relevant definitions from Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 investment manager means, in relation to a managed investment scheme, a person to whom a manager of the scheme has contracted the investment of some or all of the scheme property. manager means,— (a) in relation to a registered scheme (other than a restricted scheme), the person designated or appointed as the manager of the scheme: (b) in relation to a restricted scheme, the persons designated or appointed as trustees of the scheme or, if only 1 person is designated or appointed as a trustee of the scheme, that person: (c) in relation to a managed investment scheme if there is no person to whom paragraph (a) or (b) applies or if it is not a registered scheme, a person occupying the position of, and carrying out any of the functions of, the manager set out in section 142: 142 Management and administration functions of manager (1) The manager of a registered scheme is responsible for performing the following functions: (a) offering the managed investment products; and (b) issuing the managed investment products; and (c) managing the scheme property and investments; and (d) administering the scheme. 57 managed investment scheme means a scheme to which each of the following applies: (a) the purpose or effect of the scheme is to enable persons taking part in the scheme to contribute money, or to have money contributed on their behalf, to the scheme as consideration to acquire interests in the scheme; and (b) those interests are rights to participate in, or receive, financial benefits produced principally by the efforts of another person under the scheme (whether those rights are actual, prospective, or contingent, and whether they are enforceable or not); and (c) the holders of those interests do not have day-to-day control over the operation of the scheme (whether or not they have the right to be consulted or to give directions). 7.56 “Foreign equivalents” would include Australian Managed Investment Trusts (AMITs) and other entities subject to the AMIT regulatory regime as well as other foreign funds that are comparable to the relevant New Zealand funds. 7.57 The proposed changes would also apply to “out of fund” fees. Out of fund fees are charged in cases where a fund invests into a second wholesale fund that is managed by another manager, but the management fee of that other manager is invoiced directly to the manager of the first fund. This practice occurs to ensure that there is no duplication of investment management fees. Other outsourced services which are not management services 7.58 Officials do not propose changing the GST treatment of other services provided to managed funds such as accounting, administrative or registry services. These outsourced services are generally subject to GST (taxable supplies) unless they are themselves exempt financial services. 7.59 We consider it is sensible to draw a distinction between providing management services to a fund and providing other types of services. 7.60 Providing a special GST treatment such as an exemption for administrative services provided to managed funds would create a precedent and make it difficult to justify continuing to apply 15% GST to administrative services provided to other financial service providers such as banks or life insurers. 7.61 There is already an existing precedent for exempting the “management” of a retirement scheme. In addition, under the current GST rules three similar types of fund management services (management of a retirement scheme, managers of managed investment schemes and investment managers) can have three different GST treatments which creates more significant uncertainty and biases on how these services are arranged or priced. 58 7.62 The same uncertainties and inconsistent GST treatments should be much less likely to arise for administrative services as there is a clearer position that such services are taxable in the typical cases where they are outsourced (as opposed to being incidental services supplied as part of a much larger, single supply of an exempt financial service). 7.63 The legislative position whereby GST applies to such outsourced administrative inputs was established in 1987 through the decision in Databank Systems Ltd v CIR (1987) 9 NZTC 6,213 which found that Databank was providing computing services to banks rather than financial services. As a result of the Databank proceedings, a clarifying amendment was also made to explicitly exclude “general accounting and record-keeping” services from the definition of financial services. Questions for submitters • What are the pros, cons or practical issues associated with each of the policy options? How well would they achieve the policy objectives? • What types of manger and investment manager services should the proposed policy or law change apply to? What is the clearest way to define the relevant services? • If the law was changed, what transitional issues could arise and what measures could be implemented to enable a smooth transition to the new law? 59 CHAPTER 8 Insurance pay-outs to third parties 8.1 The GST rules require GST-registered recipients of an insurance pay-out to return GST on these pay-outs. When a GST-registered recipient of an insurance pay-out is a third party to the insurance contract, they may not be aware they are receiving a payment which is covered by insurance. As a consequence, they may fail to comply with the rules or may be under-compensated as they did not expect to have to return GST on the payment. 8.2 This chapter discusses some potential options for mitigating this issue. Current GST rules for insurance 8.3 The GST Act includes special rules for applying GST to general (non-life) insurance. Insurers pay GST output tax on premiums they receive and claim GST input credits on the total amount of their pay-outs. 8.4 If the insured party is a GST-registered person who is insuring their taxable activity they can claim deductions for GST input credits in relation to the GST that is charged on their insurance premiums. 8.5 Section 5(13) of the GST Act requires GST to be returned on insurance pay-outs received by GST-registered persons to the extent that it relates to a loss incurred in the course and furtherance of the person’s taxable activity (for example, their business, rather than a private use). It does this by deeming the GST-registered person to have made a taxable supply to an insurer when they receive a payment under a contract of insurance, “whether or not they are a party to the insurance contract”. 8.6 This means that even if the recipient of the insurance pay-out is a third party to the insurance policy, they will still be required to return GST output tax if they are a GST-registered person and the loss is incurred in the course and furtherance of their taxable activity (such as an asset used for their business). 8.7 This deeming rule is not intuitive, as the GST-registered person has not made a sale or supplied any actual goods or services to the insurer. Also, GST does not generally apply to compensation payments. So, if the third party had received a compensation payment that was not covered by insurance, GST would not apply to the payment. 8.8 Problems can arise when the insurance pay-out is made to a third party, rather than the insured person. Intended operation of rules when insurance pay-out is to a GST-registered third party 8.9 A typical scenario involves: 60 • an insured party causes loss to a third party (for example, vehicle or property damage, professional liability, and so on); • the insurer assists the insured party to reach a settlement agreement between the insured party and the third party which specifies a sum to be received by the third party. 8.10 If the insurer makes a payment to an GST-registered insured party who caused the loss in the course and furtherance of their taxable activity, the insured party is liable to return GST under section 5(13) on the payment, and typically the amount of the pay-out would be grossed up to account for this. The insured party then pays the funds to the third party under the settlement agreement and because that payment is a compensation payment it is typically not subject to GST. This is illustrated in figure 2. Figure 2: Pay-out to a GST-registered insured party General insurer Insured business $115,000 insurance pay-o ut Inland Revenue Third -party business Repair businses $100,000 compensation p aym ent (not subject to GST) $15,000 i np u t tax $15,000 i np u t tax $115,000 cost of repairs $15,000 output tax Net GST collected = NIL (GST neutral because all the supplies are B2B) $15,000 output tax 8.11 However, we understand that insurers will usually direct the payment to the third party, rather than the insured party in cases where the insurance policy is covering a loss to the third party. 8.12 The insurer can claim an input tax deduction in relation to the insurance pay-out regardless of whether it pays the insured party or the third party. However, the third party may be unaware of the nature of the payment. 8.13 If the third party knows the settlement payment is an insurance pay-out and correctly applies section 5(13) of the GST Act, they would return GST output tax on the payment. This is illustrated figure 3 which provides the same overall GST outcomes as figure 2. 61 Figure 3: Pay-out to third party who correctly returns GST on the payment General insurer Insured business Inland Revenue Third-party business Repair businses $15,000 input tax $15,000 input tax $115,000 cost of repairs $15,000 output tax $115,000 Insurance pay -out $15,000 output tax Net GST collected = NIL Problems occur when a GST-registered third-party is unaware of source of the payment 8.14 A GST-registered third party may often not know whether the source of the funds is from the insured party or an insurer, as the payment will usually be disbursed from a solicitor’s trust account. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that an insurer may conceal its involvement in the dispute to lower the third party’s expectations of a sizeable settlement. The insurer will benefit where the third party is unaware of the insurer’s involvement and does not require the settlement to be grossed up for GST. This is because the third party may incorrectly assume they are receiving a compensation payment which is not subject to GST and therefore not return any GST on the payment. 8.15 The scenario where the third party does not know they are receiving an insurance payment is illustrated in figure 4, which results in a revenue loss to Inland Revenue and corresponding cost saving to the insurer compared to figures 2 and 3. 62 Figure 4: Pay-out to third-party who does not know the pay-out is covered by insurance General insurer Insured business Inland Revenue Third-party business (unaware that payment is an insurance pay -out and therefore does not return GST) Repair businses $13,000 i np u t tax $115,000 cost of repairs $15,000 output tax $100,000 Insurance pay-o ut Net GST collected = $13,000 revenue loss to Inland Revenue $13,000 cost saving to insurer compared to figures 2 and 3 $15,000 i np u t tax Scale of the problem 8.16 Officials do not have enough information to quantify the magnitude of these issues. 8.17 However, the potential fiscal risk is high given the commercial incentives to negotiate a lower settlement amount. For example, reaching agreement on a settlement amount of $10 million, rather than needing to gross that amount up to a $11.5 million (to offset the GST that is required to be paid by the recipient), could represent a $1.3 million cost saving for the insurer. 8.18 Inland Revenue has dealt with an increasing number of disputes involving section 5(13). Several tax and legal advisors have also raised concerns with us that GST may not be properly considered in negotiated settlements with third parties, leaving the third party undercompensated or at risk of an unexpected GST liability. 8.19 We are interested in submitters’ views about the scale of the problem described above and their experiences with trying to apply the existing requirements. 8.20 In particular, is it obvious when a payment is an insurance payment (subject to GST) or a compensation payment (not subject to GST)? Are the legal advisors that deal with claims or settlements involving insurance generally aware of the existing requirements of section 5(13) of the GST Act? Do they take care to ensure the agreed amount is grossed up to include GST and that GST-registered recipients of insurance payment correctly return output tax as required by section 5(13)? 63 Policy options for improving certainty and compliance with GST on insurance pay- outs 8.21 We have identified three main options for mitigating this issue and providing more certainty for third parties who are negotiating such settlements. Making the insurer responsible for the GST obligations 8.22 We consider the most effective way to address the problem would be to make the insurer (rather than the person receiving the pay-out) responsible for the GST obligations. 8.23 This could be achieved by amending section 5(13) so it operates as a reverse charge on the insurer. This would mean that the insurer, rather than the third party, would be deemed to make a taxable supply and required to pay the GST when the requirements of section 5(13) apply. This is illustrated in figure 5. Figure 5: Pay-out to third party with a reverse charge on insurer General insurer Insured business Inland Revenue Third- party business Repair businses $115,000 cost of repairs $15,000 output tax $100,000 insurance pay-o ut $13,000 output tax $13,000 i np u t tax $15,000 i np u t tax Net GST collected = NIL 8.24 Alternatively, section 20(3)(d) could be amended to deny the insurer an input tax deduction for insurance pay-outs where the current section 5(13) applies to the payment (that is, the payment is to a GST-registered person and relates to a loss incurred in the course and furtherance of that person’s taxable activity). Under this approach, a consequential amendment would be made to repeal section 5(13) so there would no longer be any GST output tax on the recipients of insurance payments. 64 Figure 6: Pay-out to third party with no input credit for insurer General insurer Insured business Inland Revenue Third-party business Repair businses $115,000 cost of repairs $15,000 output tax $100,000 insurance pay-o ut $15,000 i np u t tax Net GST collected = NIL 8.25 Limiting the input deduction under section 20(3)(d) would appear to be simpler than a reverse charge but we invite submissions on which type of amendment would be less costly for insurers to implement. 8.26 Either of the proposed amendments would require the insurer to determine whether the person receiving the pay-out is GST-registered and whether the insurance pay- out relates to a loss incurred in the course or furtherance of their taxable activity (as opposed to a private or exempt activity). 8.27 This would increase compliance costs for insurers as they would need to request information about the recipient’s GST status, and they would need to implement new systems to treat pay-outs differently depending on the GST status of the recipient. 8.28 In cases where a damaged asset is partly used for a taxable and non-taxable activity (such as a residential home with a home office, or a work vehicle with private use) it would also be necessary to determine to what extent the insurance payment relates to a taxable asset. In such cases it could be difficult for the insurer to obtain information from the recipient of the pay-out to correctly account for GST on payment. 8.29 One possible solution to this issue could be to require the insurer to account for the full amount of GST output tax (or not claim any input tax credit) when an insurance payment is made to a GST-registered person (regardless of the extent to which the payment was connected to the registered person’s taxable activity). A corresponding amendment could be introduced to allow a GST-registered person who receives that payment to be able to claim a new type of GST deduction under section 20(3) to the extent to which the insurance payment was made in respect of 65 an asset that was not used by the registered person to make taxable supplies (for example, a private or exempt use). 8.30 We note that non-resident suppliers of remote services (which includes general insurance) are already required to determine if they are supplying services to a GST- registered person as part of that person’s taxable activity (see section 8(4D)). In that case the Commissioner can agree that a supplier can use an alternative method for determining if they are making supplies to a GST-registered person. This type of approach could be used to assist insurers if they were required to determine whether they were making a pay-out to a GST-registered person. 8.31 Australia’s GST rules for general insurance require insurers to distinguish between pay-outs in relation to insurance contracts with GST-registered persons and contracts with unregistered persons. Under Australia’s rules the insurer is only entitled to a GST deduction (called a decreasing adjustment) in cases where the insured party did not claim a GST deduction in respect of the premiums paid on that insurance contract. We would be interested in submitters’ views about any compliance costs that this differing GST treatment of insurance claims creates for Australian insurers. 8.32 Making the insurer responsible for GST could reduce compliance costs on other GST-registered businesses as they would no longer have to return GST on insurance pay-outs, and they could treat insurance pay- outs the same as compensation payments (which are not subject to GST). 8.33 In addition, as discussed above the insurer will know the settlement payment is an insurance payment, whereas a GST-registered third party is often unaware of the nature of the payment. Even if they knew the payment is insurance, they may not be aware of the GST rules (in section 5(13) of the GST Act) which require them to return GST on insurance payments. 8.34 Officials are concerned that this option would impose high compliance costs and systems changes on insurers and welcome submissions explaining these costs. Officials are also interested in working with insurers, legal and tax advisors and affected businesses to develop some alternative options to address the problem. Two of these alternatives are discussed. 8.35 However, if these alternatives are not effective at improving GST compliance and Inland Revenue continues to observe and receive feedback that the commercial incentives to not disclose insurance make complying with GST too difficult, it may become necessary to shift GST obligations onto the insurer if this is the only way to effectively address the fiscal risk and fairness concerns. Requiring disclosure that the payment is covered by insurance 8.36 An alternative option would be to require the insurer to disclose in writing to the third party that the amount of their settlement payment is covered by insurance and that if they are registered for GST, they may be required to return GST on that amount under section 5(13). 8.37 This information would allow the third party to be aware of their GST obligations and consider if the amount of the settlement is sufficient (or if it needs to be grossed up to account for GST). 66 8.38 The timing of the disclosure would need to be considered. In order to be fair to the third party, they would need to know about the GST implications prior to agreeing to the settlement. However, such a disclosure requirement may lead to the agreed settlement amount being significantly higher in those cases where it is covered by insurance. This could have a flow-on effect in increasing the costs for businesses in obtaining public or professional indemnity insurance to cover the risk of potential damages to other GST-registered persons. 8.39 Another consideration is the consequences for the insurer if they fail to disclose the information. One potential consequence would be to shift the GST liability to the insurer (as opposed to the GST-registered person) but this may create uncertainty and disputes about who is liable for the GST. Another possibility would be a separate standalone penalty on insurers who fail to disclose the information, but it may be difficult to set this penalty at the right amount to promote compliance (considering the potential cost savings from non-compliance will vary depending on the amount of the payment). 8.40 Information disclosure requirements could also lead to confusion. For example, a large number of insurance recipients are not registered for GST, but may become prompted by an information disclosure to consider whether or not GST obligations apply to them. This may lead to increased contacts and questions to insurers, advisors or Inland Revenue. One way to mitigate this could be to target the information disclosure requirement so it only applies to those insurance products where the problem is most likely to arise such as commercial property or professional liability insurance. No law change, but provide education and guidance 8.41 The least disruptive option would be to retain the current insurance rules but provide education and guidance for advisors and GST-registered businesses. 8.42 If third party claimants were aware of the potential GST risk they could ask for advice as to who is paying the settlement amount, or the source of the settlement amount, and ask for either a GST gross-up and/or a GST indemnity. 8.43 For example, when negotiating settlement agreements, a third party could include a warranty that the payment they are receiving is not a payment of insurance or require the settlement amount be “plus GST, if any”. Under such an agreement, the third party would be able to require the payment to be grossed up by the insured party in those cases where they discover they must return output tax on an insurance payment under section 5(13) of the GST. 8.44 However, in our view, this option is unlikely to be effective. It relies on the third party (or more likely their tax and legal advisors) being both: • aware and sufficiently concerned about the GST risk; and • being able to obtain information that the insured party (or their insurer) has commercial incentives to not provide (in order to lower the third party’s expectations about the amount of an acceptable settlement). 8.45 Also, just because the settlement agreement includes a “plus GST if any” clause or a GST indemnity it does not mean that the recipient will return GST on insurance payments as they may mistakenly believe that the payment is not subject to GST. 67 If the recipient of an insurance payment fails to return GST, they could be liable for penalties and interest if the error is subsequently identified. The third party could also be exposed in cases where the insured party goes out of business. 8.46 It could be difficult to adequately alert the potentially affected parties (or their advisors) of the issue, particularly as negotiating a large insurance settlement will be an unlikely or rare event for most GST-registered persons. Application date 8.47 Any law change would apply prospectively from a future date after the date the relevant legislation was enacted (which could be in 2021). 8.48 We invite submissions on how much lead time submitters consider could be necessary (for example, following enactment of any new legislation) for the affected parties to prepare their systems in order to comply with the potential legislative options discussed above. 8.49 We also invite submissions on potential compliance costs and systems impacts of the policy options described above and if there are ways to design the proposed rules to mitigate some of these impacts. Questions for submitters • When a damaged third-party receives an insurance or compensation payment is it difficult for them to determine whether or not the payment comes from an insurer? • In what situations does the problem occur and what information is available to assess the potential scale of the problem? • What are the costs, benefits and practical issues associated with the policy options? How much lead time would insurers or other affected parties need to implement these options? 69 CHAPTER 9 Compulsory zero-rating of land 9.1 The GST Act requires a supply that wholly or partly consists of land to be zero- rated if the supply: • is made by a registered person to another registered person who acquires the supply with the intention of using the goods and services for making taxable supplies; and • is not a supply of land intended to be used as a principal place of residence of the recipient of the supply or a person connected with them by blood relationship, marriage, civil union, de facto relationship or adoption. 9.2 This chapter consults on several suggested technical amendments to address situations where the current compulsory zero-rating of land rules appear to produce flawed outcomes or the timing of when the relevant provision applies could be improved. These scenarios include: • Clarifying the relationship between sections 5(23) and 78F where land is incorrectly treated as zero-rated. • Non-taxable supplies of land that have been incorrectly treated as zero-rated. • The date that the deemed supply under section 5(23) should occur on. • The taxable period for the adjustment when a second-hand goods deduction has been incorrectly claimed by purchaser of zero-rated land. • The date of output tax adjustment under section 20(3J) which applies when a person acquires zero-rated land that they intend to use for both taxable and non-taxable purposes. Relationship between sections 5(23) and 78F when land is incorrectly treated as zero- rated 9.3 Where the land zero-rating rules are incorrectly applied to treat a supply as zero- rated, the purchaser of the land is required to return GST on the supply under section 5(23). Section 5(23) provides that if a supply of land is incorrectly zero-rated and this fact is discovered after the date on which the transaction was settled, the recipient of the supply is treated as though they were a supplier making the supply of land on the date of settlement. 9.4 Section 78F requires the recipient of the land to notify the supplier whether at the date of settlement they will be a GST-registered person and are acquiring the land with an intention to make taxable supplies and do not intend to use the land as a principal place of residence for themselves or an associated person. 9.5 It is not clear how section 5(23) interacts with the requirement in section 78F for the recipient of the land to provide information to the supplier. 70 Suggested solution 9.6 We propose making an amendment to clarify that section 5(23) applies to place the output tax liability on the purchaser, in cases where a vendor incorrectly zero-rates land (as a matter of fact), regardless of the information that was provided (or not provided) by the recipient of the land under the section 78F disclosure requirement. 9.7 The policy concern that the business-to-business zero-rating of land rules were trying to address was phoenix fraud by the vendor. The GST liability should be placed on the purchaser whenever a supply of land was incorrectly zero-rated because that still enables Inland Revenue to recover the unpaid GST if the vendor ceases to operate, as the purchaser has a valuable asset (land) and is likely to continue their taxable activity. This approach is also consistent with the original policy proposal for addressing phoenix fraud which was to introduce a reverse charge mechanism on the purchaser (this was later changed to a zero-rating mechanism in response to submissions). 9.8 The proposed amendment would provide certainty that the purchaser is always liable for any GST output tax liability. However, we acknowledge that the proposed approach places a lot of risk on the purchaser. 9.9 In particular, it could lead to unfair outcomes in some cases where a vendor has unilaterally and incorrectly zero-rated the supply contrary to the purchaser’s section 78F information disclosure, either by mistake or by a deliberate act to shift the output tax liability onto the recipient of the land. This may occur because the vendor is “trying to get it right” and thinks that the recipient’s statement is either wrong or is likely to change. It also includes the situation where the vendor simply ignores the recipient’s statement (despite the statement being correct). 9.10 We note that these issues can be resolved through the contracts between the parties. For example, if the contract price is expressed as “plus GST (if any)” the vendor will have nothing to gain from zero-rating the supply, so any incorrect zero-rating will be because they have simply made a mistake. With a plus GST (if any) contract price, the purchaser will have agreed to assume contractual liability to pay an additional amount for any GST. Therefore, if section 5(23) applies, the purchaser will pay the GST to Inland Revenue but will also be eligible for an input tax credit to claim back this additional GST. Non-taxable supply incorrectly treated as zero-rated 9.11 Section 5(23) will achieve the correct result in circumstances where a supply of land has been incorrectly zero-rated as a result of the registration status of the purchaser (that is, the purchaser is not registered for GST or does not acquire the goods and services for the purpose of making taxable supplies). However, an anomalous result arises where a supply is incorrectly treated as zero-rated owing to the vendor’s registration status or by way of oversight as a result of the vendor carrying on both taxable and non-taxable activities. This anomaly is illustrated in example 24. 71 Example 24: Property sold was held in trust unrelated to trust’s taxable activity The M Trust carries on a taxable activity and is GST-registered, but also has property holdings unrelated to the taxable activity which relate to residential accommodation for the beneficiaries. The property is sold for $1 million plus GST if any to Chris who acquires the land to make taxable supplies. Chris does not intend to use the land as a principal place of residence for himself or any person associated with him under section 2A(1)(c) and is not associated with any of the trustees of the M Trust. Matthew, the trustee of M Trust treats the supply of the land as zero-rated. It is discovered after settlement of the transaction that this is an error. Section 5(23) applies to treat Chris as making a supply of the land in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity for $1 million. Chris is therefore required to account to Inland Revenue for output tax of $150,000. As Chris is acquiring the land for the purposes of making taxable supplies, he will be able to claim $150,000 as input tax, meaning that the net cost of the land to him is $1 million. However, the supply should not have been subject to GST at all in the first place. Instead, Chris should have been entitled to a second-hand goods input tax deduction of $130,434.78 (assuming that Chris is not associated with Matthew or any of the other trustees of the M Trust under section 2A(1)). This would have made the net cost of the land to Chris $869,565.22. This position cannot be rectified by re-characterising the transaction correctly. This is because if it is found after settlement that the supply was incorrectly zero-rated, the transaction is not re- characterised; instead, section 5(23) applies to deem a taxable supply made by Chris. 9.12 This issue may also arise when the Commissioner of Inland Revenue cancels the vendor’s registration (after the date of settlement) with retrospective effect to the date of settlement or earlier. In these instances, the transaction may be incorrectly treated by the vendor as zero-rated on the date of settlement (this treatment being incorrect as a consequence of the retrospective deregistration, as the retrospective deregistration would mean the vendor was not a “registered person” on the date of settlement). Suggested solution 9.13 An amendment could be made so that, where it is discovered after the date of settlement that section 11(1)(mb) was incorrectly applied by the vendor and the relevant supply is in fact not a taxable supply, section 5(23) does not apply and the original supply is instead re-characterised to be a non-taxable supply. Date of deemed supply under section 5(23) 9.14 As mentioned above, section 5(23) treats the purchaser as making a taxable supply on the date of settlement. This means the resulting output tax is attributed to the taxable period in which the original supply was made. This can be contrasted with the credit and debit note provisions in section 25, where the liability to pay output tax does not arise until the parties have become aware of the need to adjust the output tax returned and input tax claimed. 9.15 Where the purchaser is acquiring the goods and services for the purpose of making taxable supplies, there is no rule deeming the input tax deduction to also arise in the period in which settlement occurred. The practical effect of this is that the recipient of the supply is required to issue themselves with a tax invoice in respect of the supply they are deemed to make under section 5(23), and then claim an input tax 72 deduction in a later period. The timing difference means that in the period in which settlement occurs, the recipient will have underpaid GST, even though the net effect of the transaction is GST-neutral. Suggested solution 9.16 An amendment could be made so that the recipient of the incorrectly zero-rated supply is treated as making a supply on the date that it becomes apparent that the original supply was incorrectly treated as zero-rated. Taxable period for adjustment when a second-hand goods deduction has been incorrectly claimed by purchaser of zero-rated land 9.17 Section 25AB of the GST Act is designed to ensure that the rules dealing with changes in the consideration for a supply of second-hand goods apply correctly to deductions claimed by a GST-registered purchaser of second-hand goods. 9.18 When the terms of a contract for the supply of goods or services are varied (for example, by a discount being subsequently offered), the supplier may be required to issue a debit or credit note to the recipient if the supply is taxable. This triggers obligations on both the GST-registered supplier and a GST-registered purchaser to correct their tax position. 9.19 This requirement did not work well when a supply of second-hand goods was not a taxable supply. Although a second-hand goods deduction was available for a GST- registered purchaser (to the extent that they used the goods for making taxable supplies), the debit and credit note rules did not clearly apply to correct the purchaser’s GST position where the consideration for the goods changed. 9.20 Section 25AB applies to a supply of second-hand goods to a registered person when the GST-registered purchaser claimed a second-hand goods deduction, and the amount of the claimed deduction exceeds the correct amount as a result of one of the following events: • the supply has been cancelled; • the nature of the supply has been fundamentally varied or altered; • the previously agreed price of the goods changes, whether through the offer of a discount or by other means; • the goods (or part of those goods) supplied have been returned to the supplier; or • the compulsory zero-rating of land rules were incorrectly applied to the supply, so that the supply was not treated as zero-rated when it should have been. 9.21 In these circumstances, section 25AB requires the purchaser of the goods to return the excess amount of the deduction claimed as output tax for the taxable period in which one of the events referred to above occurred. 9.22 Requiring the adjustment to be made in the taxable period in which the event occurred should lead to the correct result where the relevant event is the cancellation 73 of a supply, decrease in the amount of consideration for a supply or the return of goods or services. In these cases, the purchaser should be aware of the occurrence of the relevant event when it happens. 9.23 A problem with this requirement however arises in the following scenario: • A person supplies land to a GST-registered purchaser who intends to use the land for making taxable supplies. The purchaser will not use the land as a principal place of residence for themselves or for a natural person associated with them under section 2A(1)(c). • The vendor is not registered for GST at the date of settlement, but as at that date, has a liability to register for GST. Therefore, in terms of the definition of “registered person” in section 2(1) of the GST Act, the vendor is a “registered person” at the date of settlement. The conditions for zero-rating are therefore met, but the purchaser would not know this at the time of settlement. • Based on the vendor’s representation that they are not GST-registered, the purchaser claims a second-hand goods credit for the acquisition of the land. This means the purchaser underpays the amount of GST they are liable to return for that period. • The Commissioner discovers that the vendor should have been registered and registers the vendor, back dated to before the date of settlement. • Section 25AB therefore requires the purchaser to make an output tax adjustment for underpaid GST (equal to the amount of the second-hand goods deduction claimed on the acquisition of the land). 9.24 The issue is that section 25AB(2) requires the adjustment to be made for the taxable period in which the relevant “event” occurred (which in this case is the incorrect application of the land zero-rating rules to the treatment of the supply, so that it was not zero-rated when it should have been). This would lead to the purchaser incurring debit interest for the excess deduction claimed. 9.25 While in some cases the purchaser may be able to recover these interest costs (along with the amount of the denied second-hand goods deduction) from the vendor, this is not an ideal policy outcome. This result would be particularly problematic in cases where the GST return for the taxable period in which the supply was made was time-barred, resulting in a revenue loss to the Crown. Suggested solution 9.26 The requirement that the GST-registered purchaser make an output tax adjustment for the taxable period in which the event occurred could be replaced with a requirement that the adjustment be made for the taxable period in which it became apparent that the amount of input tax deducted was incorrect. Date of output tax adjustment under section 20(3J) 9.27 If a person acquires zero-rated land that they intend to use for both taxable and non- taxable purposes they must calculate and return the portion of the nominal GST component relating to non-taxable use as output tax. Section 20(3J) requires the 74 recipient of the zero-rated land to calculate and return the output tax for the non- taxable use of the land on “acquisition”. 9.28 It is not clear when acquisition of the land occurs for the purposes of section 20(3J). For instance, acquisition may be viewed as occurring at the time of supply, settlement, unconditional contract or at some other time. Section 20(3J) should therefore be clarified to make it clear exactly when the recipient must calculate and return output tax for the portion of the nominal GST component that relates to non- taxable use. Suggested solution 9.29 Time of supply seems to be an appropriate time in which the recipient should have to return the output tax. If the land was not zero-rated, the supplier would have to return output tax for the taxable period in which the time of supply occurred (assuming they use the invoice or hybrid accounting basis). Therefore, using time of supply as the trigger for when an output tax adjustment is required to be made under section 20(3J) would ensure that output tax is returned at the same time, regardless of whether the land is zero-rated or not. 9.30 Officials suggest that this amendment should apply for supplies made on or after 1 April 2011, being the date that the compulsory zero-rating of land provisions came into force, but submissions are invited on whether application from the date of enactment may be more appropriate. Questions for submitters • What are your views on these issues and the suggested solutions? • Are there other policy or practical issues with the compulsory zero-rating of land rules which officials should consider? 75 CHAPTER 10 Technical and remedial issues 10.1 This chapter seeks feedback on several proposals which involve more minor or technical changes to the GST Act. These proposals relate to: • GST grouping rules; • input credits on goods not physically received yet at the time GST return is filed; • second-hand goods input tax credits on supplies between associated persons; • providing more flexibility for the Commissioner to approve the end date of a taxable period; • members of non-statutory boards; and • challenge rights in relation to a decision of the Commissioner to re-open time- barred GST returns. 10.2 We also welcome submissions with suggestions for other technical amendments or remedial matters which could improve or correct the operation of provisions in the GST Act. GST grouping rules 10.3 The GST grouping rules are intended to reduce distortions that might arise between a single entity, a branch structure and a group structure. For example, by disregarding intra-group taxable supplies, a group of companies is treated in the same way as a single company that might make taxable supplies between different departments or branches. In the case of a single company, the supply would be a “self-supply” and disregarded. The grouping rules ensure that in the case of a group of companies, the supply may similarly be disregarded. 10.4 The GST grouping rules are also intended to reduce compliance costs. For example, the representative member is responsible for filing a single consolidated GST return on behalf of all members in the GST group, which reduces compliance costs for group members who do not all need to file separate GST returns. Also, by disregarding supplies between group members for GST purposes, the cost of accounting for these intra-group supplies is reduced. Clarify how the GST grouping rules relate to the other provisions in the GST Act 10.5 There is currently no legislative guidance on how the grouping rules should interact with the other parts of the GST Act. We note that there are two different interpretations – the first interpretation (the narrow interpretation) is that other provisions are applied before the grouping rules. Under the second interpretation (the wide interpretation), the grouping rules are applied before other provisions. 76 Applying other provisions first (the narrow interpretation) 10.6 Under this approach, by deeming the representative member to make a group member’s supply, the supply is still treated as “made” by the group member and simply attributed to the representative member. Applying the grouping rules first (the wide interpretation) 10.7 By deeming the representative member to make a group member’s supply, the supply is treated as “made” by the representative member. Comment 10.8 These two possible interpretations and some examples of where they produce differing outcomes are further explained in IRRUIP 13 Consequences of GST Group Registration issues paper which was released in April 2019. 10.9 In most cases, it does not matter which interpretation is applied. The outcome and analysis are the same under both interpretations. 10.10 In some cases, the wide interpretation provides an outcome that is more consistent with the purpose of the grouping rules. For example, the wide interpretation is more likely to reduce distortions that might arise between a New Zealand resident single entity, a New Zealand resident entity with an offshore branch, and a group structure with a New Zealand-resident representative member. 10.11 Another case where the wide interpretation helps achieve the policy intent is where a holding company group member is used to raise capital on behalf of another group member which is the operating company. In this case the holding company may only make exempt supplies of financial services, so under the narrow view could be unable to claim input tax deductions for capital raising costs. This is because the taxable supplies of the operating company group member would not be considered when determining if section 20H 3 can be applied by the holding company. Under the wider view, the taxable supplies made by the operating company would be considered, which is consistent with the policy intent of the capital raising deduction rules. Suggested solution 10.12 We consider it would be useful to add a provision to clarify how the GST grouping rules should be applied in relation to the other provisions in the Act. 10.13 Specifically, the new provision could clarify that the GST grouping rules in section 55(7) should be applied prior to the application of other provisions in the Act. This would be consistent with the wide interpretation that is described in IRRUIP 13 Consequences of GST Group Registration. 3 The provision of the GST Act which contains the rules for the treatment of GST incurred in making financial services for raising funds. 77 Allow the representative member to issue invoices on behalf of all group members 10.14 A practical issue that arises from the wide interpretation is whether there is an ability for the representative member to issue tax invoices on behalf of other group members. This is because section 55(7)(h) states that grouping does not affect a registered person’s obligations under section 24. Section 24 requires a registered person to issue tax invoices. 10.15 Requiring each individual group member to issue their own tax invoices in cases where their supplies are deemed to be made by the representative group member would reduce some of the benefits that GST grouping has in reducing compliance costs by allowing GST accounting to be consolidated within the representative member. Suggested solution 10.16 Officials consider an amendment to allow the representative member to be able to issue a tax invoice on behalf of all members, regardless of whether or not those members are registered or unregistered would be appropriate. Input tax credits on goods not physically received yet at the time the GST return is filed 10.17 Section 20(3C) provides that where goods are acquired by a registered person, an input tax deduction is allowed to the extent to which the goods are “used for, or are available for use in” making taxable supplies. 10.18 The issue is whether goods are “available for use” if the registered person has not yet physically acquired those goods by the time they file their GST return. For example, they may have paid for or received an invoice for purchase of the goods, but the goods may not have been delivered to them yet. 10.19 Section 20(3C) was introduced in 2010. The previous rule required the registered person to consider the “principal purpose” of the goods. 10.20 This suggests that from a policy perspective section 20(3C) is intended to limit the deduction to the extent to which the goods will be used to make taxable supplies (as opposed to a non-taxable use such as private use or exempt supplies). Suggested solution 10.21 It was not intended to exclude input tax credits in cases where the person has not yet obtained physical possession of the goods. Therefore, it is proposed that section 20(3C) be amended to clarify that the requirement is met to the extent to which the goods are “used for, or are expected to be used for, or are available for use in,” making taxable supplies. 10.22 We consider this would be a remedial amendment which should apply retrospectively from 1 April 2011, as this is the date from which section 20(3C) first applied. 78 Second-hand goods input tax credits on supplies between associated persons 10.23 Section 3A(3)(a) of the GST Act limits a second-hand goods input tax credit on supplies between associated persons to the lesser of: (i) the tax included in the original cost of the goods to the supplier; and (ii) the tax fraction of the purchase price; and (iii) the tax fraction of the open market value of the supply. 10.24 In many cases the supplier may have purchased an asset for which they were not charged any GST (although GST costs can be embedded in the cost of the asset). As example 25 illustrates this can lead to section 3A(3)(a)(i) denying the ability to claim any second-hand goods input tax credit: Example 25: No ability to claim a second-hand goods input credit for an associated supply A developer sells a property to Sam for $1.15 million, including $150,000 of GST. Sam is not registered for GST (or, if registered does not use the property to make taxable supplies). Two months later Sam sells the property for $1.15 million to John. As this sale is not subject to GST, there is no GST included in the sale price to John. John lives in the property for five years and then sells the property for $1.5 million to his sister, Jasmine who will re-develop the property to use it as the premises for her business of making taxable supplies. Currently, section 3A(3)(a)(i) would limit the second-hand goods input tax credit to the GST included in the original cost to John, which was zero – therefore Jasmine is unable to claim any second-hand goods input tax credit. The correct policy result is that Jasmine should be able to claim a second-hand goods input credit based on the tax fraction (3/23rds) of the original cost to John which would be a $150,000 second- hand goods input credit. Suggested solution 10.25 Officials consider it would be appropriate for an amendment to section 3A(3)(a)(i) so that the second-hand goods input tax credit is limited to the tax fraction (3/23rds) of the original cost of the goods to the supplier. We consider this amendment should apply prospectively from the date of enactment. Providing more flexibility for the Commissioner to approve the end date of a taxable period 10.26 A taxable period generally ends on the last day of a month, but under section 15E(2) a registered person may apply to the Commissioner for approval to have a taxable period ending on a different day, so long as that day is not more than seven days before or after the last day of the month. 10.27 Many businesses like to use a “4-4- 5” accounting period 4 which in some cases could end on a date in the month that is outside the seven days before or after the 4 The 4-4 -5 accounting period divides a year into four quarters of 13 weeks grouped into two four-week periods an d one five-week period. Its advantage over a regular monthly calendar is that the end date of the period is always the same day of the week, which is useful for shift or manufacturing planning. 79 last day of the month. In these situations the Commissioner cannot approve a different taxable period end date under section 15E(2). Therefore, the taxable periods for these businesses’ GST returns may not align with their accounting periods which increases their compliance costs. Suggested solution 10.28 Officials propose removing the requirement in section 15E(2) that the approved date must be within seven days before or after the last day of the month. This would allow the Commissioner to approve a taxable period end date for a broader range of dates, and could better cater for “4-4- 5” accounting periods. Members of non-statutory boards 10.29 Section 6(3) of the GST Act excludes several activities from being taxable activities. Examples of exclusions from the meaning of “taxable activity” include those for employees, directors, Members of Parliament and members of local authorities and statutory bodies. The rationale for these exclusions is to minimise compliance and administration costs as the contracts for these positions would be (at least predominantly) business-to-business, there would be compliance and administration costs for very little revenue if such persons were required to register for GST. 10.30 The issue is that the scope of the exclusion for board members in section 6(3)(c)(iii) appears to be narrower than was intended. 10.31 Section 6(3)(c)(iii) excludes from the meaning of “taxable activity” any engagement, occupation, or employment as a Chairman or member of any local authority or any statutory board, council, committee or other body. 10.32 The question is whether this exclusion is limited to members of statutory boards and other statutory bodies, or whether it equally applies to members of non- statutory bodies. The current view being applied by Inland Revenue is that section 6(3)(c)(iii) only applies to members of statutory bodies. Therefore, members of non-statutory boards are treated differently to members of statutory boards despite the well-documented policy intention to exclude board members more generally from having a taxable activity. Suggested solution 10.33 The exclusion for members of statutory boards and other statutory bodies could be widened so that it clearly applies to members of non-statutory boards. Challenge rights in relation to a decision of the Commissioner to reopen time-barred GST return 10.34 Section 108A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 prohibits the Commissioner from amending a GST assessment to increase the amount assessed if four years have passed from the end of the taxable period in which the return was filed. The Commissioner may however amend a GST assessment at any time if the Commissioner considers the person knowingly or fraudulently failed to disclose all 80 of the material facts that are necessary for determining the amount of GST payable for a taxable period. 10.35 Section 138E(1)(e) of the Tax Administration Act sets out that a right of challenge against a decision made by the Commissioner under section 108A to reassess a time-barred GST assessment is not conferred under Part 8A. However, taxpayers do have the right to challenge a decision made by the Commissioner under section 108 to reopen a time-barred income tax assessment. The consequence of this is that a Commissioner-initiated reassessment for income tax is a “disputable decision”, whereas her decision to reopen for GST is not. A decision by the Commissioner to reopen a time-barred GST assessment can therefore only be challenged by way of judicial review on very limited grounds. 10.36 The reasons for section 108 being a disputable decision arose from the decision in Maxwell v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[1962\] NZLR 683. In Maxwell, the Court of Appeal ruled that under the law as it was then, the decision could not be challenged on the grounds it was incorrect but opined that this was an unsatisfactory state of affairs. Shortly afterwards, the relevant legislation was amended to provide that this type of decision was the then-equivalent of a disputable decision. 10.37 Until very recently Inland Revenue’s view had been that an income tax reassessment under section 108 could only be challenged on essentially judicial review grounds (such as where the Commissioner did not truly hold the requisite opinion, the Commissioner took the wrong grounds into consideration, or the Commissioner misdirected herself as to the relevant law). Under this view, the taxpayer could not challenge whether the returns were in fact fraudulent, wilfully misleading or omitted income. On this basis the difference between a challenge to an income tax reassessment compared with a GST reassessment was simply a technical one as to what form of proceedings (Part 8A challenge or judicial review) would be used to advance the challenge, rather than the grounds on which the challenge could be made. 10.38 However, two cases Edwards v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2016\] NZHC 1795 and Great North Motor Company Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2017\] NZCA 328 have made it clear that a taxpayer may challenge an income tax assessment on the basis that it was time barred and the Commissioner was not permitted to make a reassessment under section 108. In these cases, the Court must review from the beginning whether the return in question was in fact fraudulent, wilfully misleading or omitted income. As noted in the decisions, this outcome is consistent with the scheme of the challenge provisions in the Tax Administration Act and with the Commissioner’s role in the section 108 decision. 10.39 The consequence of this is that there are two very different approaches to challenging a time bar for income tax as opposed to GST. There is no reason why a taxpayer should have much more limited scope to challenge a decision by the Commissioner under section 108A to reopen a GST return based on the Commissioner’s opinion that the taxpayer has, for instance, fraudulently failed to disclose necessary matters in the return. 81 Suggested solution 10.40 Section 108A could be removed from the excluded provisions listed in section 138E(1)(e) of the Tax Administration Act to ensure that challenges to both time bar provisions (sections 108 and 108A) can be made on the same grounds.

The Government is proposing to make changes to the Unclaimed Money Act 1971 (the Act), with the aim of: • making it easier for people to claim amounts held in defunct accounts; and • reducing the administration costs for organisations holding unclaimed money. 2. The Act governs the administration of money held by an entity which cannot be attributed to an owner after a certain period has passed (the length of time varies and is either six or 25 years). 3. Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation April 2021 release offers an opportunity to modernise and simplify the administrative processes which underlie the operation of the Act. Why the Government is considering changing the Act 4. A range of entities can hold unclaimed money. This includes banks, building societies, auctioneers, real estate agents, accountants, and motor vehicle traders. 5. While the Act establishes a process for owners to reclaim their unclaimed money, the Act has become out of date in many areas. For example, the Act requires holders of unclaimed money to maintain a physical register that contains the details of unclaimed money arising over the previous year and to make this register available for inspection at their head office in New Zealand. In the digital age this may now be an onerous requirement for many businesses. 6. Holders of unclaimed money are also required to retain unclaimed money for several years before sending it to Inland Revenue. The proposed changes 7. The Government is considering several proposals that would allow it to more efficiently administer unclaimed money, including: • Reducing the period of time that money must sit in an account before it is deemed unclaimed. Currently this period is either six or 25 years, depending on the nature of the account. • Removing the requirement for unclaimed money holders to: – Hold unclaimed money and associated information for an extended period after the funds become unclaimed money. Instead, unclaimed money could be transferred to Inland Revenue more quickly, or even immediately (this would effectively make Inland Revenue the first point of contact for many unclaimed money claimants). – Keep a register of unclaimed money at their head offices. Instead, this could be held electronically (if a register is still required). 4 – Provide occupation information for owners of unclaimed money. Instead, it would be more useful for holders of unclaimed money to provide IRD numbers and any other information that would improve Inland Revenue’s ability to verify a claimant’s identity. – Make detailed information about unclaimed money publicly available on their register. Instead, disclosure requirements could be reduced. This would improve privacy and reduce the risk of fraudulent claims. • Reviewing the threshold for unclaimed money (currently $100). This threshold could either be raised to reduce compliance costs for unclaimed money holders, or, alternatively, reduced to zero. • Considering a time bar for claiming unclaimed money. Currently there is no time bar in place. This means that claims for unclaimed money can theoretically be made for all periods going back to the first unclaimed money record. • Defining the Act as an Inland Revenue Act under the Tax Administration Act 1994. This would allow Inland Revenue to use the information that it holds to improve its matching ability and reduce its administration costs. • Requiring unclaimed money holders to provide unclaimed money information and funds to Inland Revenue electronically and in a standard format. This would reduce Inland Revenue’s administration costs by improving the matching of unclaimed money with potential owners in Inland Revenue’s systems and reducing the amount of manual processing required. Next steps 8. Inland Revenue officials have identified several unclaimed money holders and are seeking their views on the proposed changes. 9. The Government also welcomes submissions on the proposals from other interested parties. Making a submission 10. The closing date for submissions is 28 February 2020. 11. Send your submission by email to policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with “Unclaimed money” in the subject line. 12. Alternatively, send your submission by post to: Unclaimed money C/- Deputy Commissioner, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 13. We may receive requests about unclaimed money under the Official Information Act 1982, including requests for copies of submissions. Any information withheld will be decided using this Act. Please let us know in your submission if there is anything that you wish to withhold. 5 Question and answer Q. I think I may have unclaimed money owing to me. What do I do? A. Inland Revenue maintains a database of the names of individuals and entities that are owed unclaimed money.

Sensitive 17 March 2020 Minister of Revenue Draft Cabinet paper – COVID-19 – Order in Council to exclude the Wage Subsidy and Leave Payment from the application of GST 1. This report asks you to approve and lodge the attached Cabinet paper with the Cabinet Office by 10am Thursday 19 March for consideration at the Cabinet meeting on Monday 23 March 2020. 2. The Cabinet paper seeks Cabinet’s agreement to an Order in Council which amends the Goods and Services Tax (Grants and Subsidies) Order 1992 to exclude the COVID-19 Wage Subsidy and the COVID-19 Leave Payment from the application of GST. The scope and design of these payments were agreed to by Cabinet on 16 March 2020, and it was noted at the time Cabinet made decisions that the tax implications of these payments would need to be determined, with possible subsequent amendments being necessary. 3. The amendments will enable GST-registered businesses to use the full amount of the payments received under either of the schemes to adjust to the impact of COVID-19 and provide financial support to their employees. 4. In absence of the Order in Council, GST-registered businesses would be required to account for output tax on the payments received. The amendments ensure fairness between businesses that are registered for GST and those that are not, and will minimise compliance costs. These amendments are consistent with the approach taken for the wage subsidies developed in response to the Hurunui/Kaikoura and Canterbury earthquakes. 5. It is proposed that the Order in Council be made as soon as practicable to ensure that the GST treatment of the payments is clear. Furthermore, as the Order in Council cannot have retrospective effect, we propose an amendment be included in the Bill containing tax measures in response to COVID-19 to specify that the Order in Council applies in respect of payments made before the Order in Council comes into force. This will ensure that any payments made between 17 March 2020 and the date the Order in Council comes into force will also not be subject to GST. 6. We have also provided your office with speaking notes for you to take to Cabinet on 23 March 2020 which cover the purpose of, and reasons for, the Order in Council. Fiscal implications 7. The recommendations in this report do not have a revenue or any other fiscal effect. Consultation 8. The Treasury was consulted and agrees with the recommendations in this report. The Ministry of Social Development and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment were informed.

The amendment would exclude the following payments from the application of goods and services tax: 1.1 the COVID-19 Wage Subsidy as referred to in the Cabinet paper titled “COVID- 19 financial support, Paper A: Business Continuity Package: Targeted wage subsidy scheme”; and 1.2 the COVID-19 Leave Payment as referred to in the Cabinet paper titled “COVID- 19: Financial Support Paper B: COVID-19 Leave Payment Scheme”. 2.The design and scope of these payments were both agreed to by Cabinet on 16 March 2020. 3.It also seeks Cabinet’s agreement to amend application dates for certain COVID-19 related tax measures approved by Cabinet on 16 March 2020 (CAB-20-MIN-0103 and CAB-20-MIN-0108 refers). Policy Excluding goods and services tax (GST) from the Wage Subsidy and the Leave Payment 4.The Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 generally treats any government grant or subsidy payment as subject to GST when received by a GST-registered person such as a business. Recognising that this approach might not always be appropriate from a policy perspective, the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 allows certain grants and subsidies to be excluded from the application of GST through an Order in Council which specifically lists the grants and subsidies to which GST should not apply. 5.I propose an Order in Council be made to amend the Goods and Services Tax (Grants and Subsidies) Order 1992 to add the COVID-19 Wage Subsidy and the COVID-19 Leave Payment (“the payments”) to the schedule of grants and subsidies which are not subject to GST. 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-03-30 14:34:19 2. 2 SENSITIVE 6. In absence of the amendments, GST-registered businesses would be required to account for output tax on the payments received. Therefore, the effect of these amendments is to allow GST-registered businesses to use the full amount of the payment received to provide financial support to their employees during self-isolation (in the case of the Leave Payment) and to assist in adjusting to the impact of COVID- 19 (in the case of the Wage Subsidy). It will ensure fairness between businesses that are registered for GST and those that are not, and will minimise compliance costs. 7. This approach is consistent with the approach taken in respect of the subsidies provided to businesses impacted by the Hurunui and Kaikoura earthquakes in 2016, which were also not subject to GST. 8. Finally, I also propose that this GST treatment apply in respect of the payments made under both schemes, which have been available since 17 March 2020. The Order in Council will ensure no payments made from the date it comes into force will be subject to GST. This will provide businesses with immediate certainty regarding the GST treatment of these payments. 9. A further legislative amendment is necessary to ensure that payments made before the Order in Council comes into force will also not be subject to GST. I propose this amendment be included in the bill containing tax measures in response to COVID-19 that was agreed to by Cabinet on 16 March 2020, and which is to be introduced in early April. Amending the application dates for COVID-19 tax measures 10. On 16 March 2020 Cabinet agreed that the provision allowing Inland Revenue to share information with other departments for COVID-19 should apply from the date of enactment (CAB-20-MIN-0103 refers). The information sharing should instead apply from the date of announcement of the payments on 17 March 2020. The information sharing will enable Inland Revenue to disclose employer and employee information to the Ministry of Social Development, and is especially important in limiting the risk of fraud. 11. Cabinet also agreed on 16 March 2020 to increase the low-value asset write-off threshold from $500 to $5,000 for the 2020-21 income year, and then reducing it to $1,000 for the 2021-22 and later income years (CAB-20-MIN-0108 refers). This increase to $5,000 should instead apply for property acquired within 12 months of the announcement date, 17 March 2020. At the end of this 12-month period, the threshold should be reduced to $1,000. This will mean that businesses’ purchasing decisions are treated equally for these purposes rather than being affected by their balance dates. Fiscal cost 12. There is no fiscal cost of the proposal in this paper. GST revenue from the COVID-19 Wage Subsidy and COVID-19 Leave Payment is not built into the revenue forecasts. Consequently, removing GST from the subsidies will have no effect on forecasts. 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-03-30 14:34:19 3 SENSITIVE Timing and 28-day rule 13. A waiver of the 28-day rule is sought because of the urgency of the move, and the power it confers will apply to events before the making of the Order. A waiver of the 28-day rule will enable the Order to take effect on the day of its notification in the Gazette. Compliance 14. The Order in Council complies with the following: 14.1 The principles of the Treaty of Waitangi Not applicable 14.2 The rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993 Not applicable 14.3 The principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993 Not applicable 14.4 Relevant international standards and obligations Not applicable 14.5 The Legislation Guidelines (2018 edition), which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee Compliant Regulations Review Committee 15. Officials believe there are no grounds for the Regulations Review Committee to draw the Order in Council to the attention of the House under Standing Order 319. Certification by Parliamentary Counsel 16. The regulations have been certified by the Parliamentary Counsel Office as being in order for submission to Cabinet, except that they will come into force earlier than the 28 th day after the date of their notification in the Gazette. Impact Analysis 17. The proposal does not require the preparation of a regulatory impact assessment. Proactive Release 18. I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers in whole within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. Consultation 19. Inland Revenue officials have consulted with the Treasury who agreed with the proposal in this paper. Inland Revenue officials have also informed the Ministry of Social Development and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-03-30 14:34:19 5 SENSITIVE Recommendations I recommend that Cabinet: 1. note that on 16 March 2020 Cabinet agreed to the introduction of the COVID-19 Wage Subsidy scheme; 2. note that on 16 March 2020 Cabinet agreed to the introduction of the COVID-19 Leave Payment scheme; 3. note that an Order in Council under the Goods and Services Act 1985 is required to declare that the COVID-19 Wage Subsidy and the COVID-19 Leave Payment (“the payments”) will not be subject to goods and services tax (GST); 4. authorise the submission to the Executive Council of the Goods and Services Tax Grants and Subsidies) Amendment Order 2020; 5. note that applications for the COVID-19 Wage Subsidy scheme and COVID-19 Leave Payment scheme opened on 17 March 2020; 6. agree that the Goods and Services Tax (Grants and Subsidies) Amendment Order 2020 should apply in respect of all payments made under the schemes in recommendations 1 and 2 from the date the Order comes into force; 7. agree that an amendment should be included in the Bill containing tax measures agreed to by Cabinet on 16 March 2020 which ensures that GST does not apply to the payments made between 17 March 2020 and the date the Order comes into force; 8. note that a waiver of the 28-day rule is sought because of the urgency of the move, and the power it confers will apply to events before the making of the Order; and 9. agree to waive the 28-day rule so that the Order can come into force on the day of its notification in the Gazette; 10. note that on 16 March 2020, Cabinet agreed that the provision allowing Inland Revenue to share information for COVID-19 outbreak related purposes should apply from the date of enactment (CAB-20-MIN-0103 refers); 11. agree that Cabinet rescind the decision referred to in recommendation 10 and instead agree to enable Inland Revenue to share information for COVID-19 outbreak related purposes from the date of announcement, 17 March 2020; 12. note that on 16 March 2020, Cabinet agreed that the threshold for low-value asset write-off threshold be increased from $500 to $5,000 for the 2020-21 income year, reducing to $1,000 for the 2021-22 and later income years (CAB-20-MIN-0108 refers); and 2bnpvvfw8u 2020-03-30 14:34:19 6 SENSITIVE 13. agree that Cabinet rescind the decision referred to in recommendation 12 and instead agree to the threshold being $5,000 for property acquired within 12 months of the announcement date (17 March 2020), and at the end of this 12-month period the threshold should be reduced to $1,000.

In Confidence IR2020 /223: Cabinet paper: Use of money interest rates review Page 1 of 7 IN CONFIDENCE 24 April 2020 Minister of Revenue Cabinet paper: Use of money interest rates review Executive summary 1. This report seeks your agreement to adjust the use of money interest (UOMI) rates. UOMI rates are reviewed regularly based on formulae set down in regulations. 2. The current rate of UOMI on underpayments of tax is 8.35% and the rate of UOMI on overpayments of tax is 0.81%. We recommend that the underpayment rate be decreased to 7.00%, and that the overpayment rate be decreased to 0.00%, in line with movements in market rates. Your approval is sought to make these rate changes and for the Parliamentary Counsel Office to draft an Order in Council to set the new rates. 3. There are two options for commencement that officials seek your decision on. The new rates can only come into effect on the day immediately following the due date for a standard instalment of provisional tax. The options for date of commencement are either 8 May 2020 or 29 August 2020. 4. Officials strongly recommend that, given the current COVID-19 situation, the new rates come into force on 8 May 2020. The significant decrease in the underpayment rate from 8.35% to 7.00% will be beneficial for taxpayers that are liable for UOMI but not eligible for the UOMI remission assistance that was recently implemented as a response to COVID-19. 5. If these rate changes occur on 8 May 2020, there will be a positive net fiscal impact of $83 million. This comprises a decrease in revenue of $79 million resulting from the changes in interest charges and payments due to the rate changes, and a decrease in impairment expenditure of $162 million due to less UOMI debt being written off with a lower underpayment rate. 6. For the commencement date to be 8 May 2020, a Cabinet paper will need to be taken directly to Cabinet on Monday 4 May 2020. A draft of this paper is attached in case you want to progress the UOMI rate changes quickly. It recommends that Cabinet approve the Order in Council and authorise its submission to the Executive Council. The paper recommends a waiver of the 28-day rule, which officials consider to be appropriate for progressing the changes quickly with regard to COVID-19. 7. For the paper to be considered by Cabinet at its meeting on Monday 4 May 2020, it needs to be lodged by 10am, Thursday 30 April 2020. 8. If you do not wish to take a paper to Cabinet on 4 May for commencement of the UOMI rate changes on 8 May, then we will provide you with a re-drafted Cabinet paper relevant to a commencement date of 29 August 2020 at a later point in time. 9. Officials have contacted the Parliamentary Counsel Office to advise that draft regulations will need to be prepared in case you wish to proceed with taking a paper to Cabinet on 4 May to change the rates of UOMI. 10. The Treasury has been consulted and agrees with the recommendations in this report, including that a paper changing the rates of UOMI should be taken to Cabinet on 4 May 2020. 11. Officials will liaise with your office regarding a press statement if desired. In Confidence IR2020 /223: Cabinet paper: Use of money interest rates review Page 2 of 7 IN CONFIDENCE 12. The Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers should be proactively released with appropriate redactions within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. 13. A copy of this report should be referred to the Minister of Finance for his information.

Referred/Not referred Paul Fulton Principal Policy Advisor Policy and Strategy Hon Stuart Nash Minister of Revenue / /2020 In Confidence IR2020 /223: Cabinet paper: Use of money interest rates review Page 4 of 7 IN CONFIDENCE Background 24. The use of money interest (UOMI) rates are an important component of the tax compliance rules. By changing in line with underlying market rates, the UOMI rates provide taxpayers with the incentive to pay the right amount of tax at the right time. They apply to all revenue and duties. The UOMI rates are set according to the Taxation (Use of Money Interest Rates Setting Process) Regulations 1997. 25. The rate setting regulations provide that the method for setting the interest rate for underpaid tax is the latest Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) floating first mortgage new customer housing rate plus 250 basis points. The floating first mortgage new customer housing rate series reflects the variable interest rate offered by surveyed institutions to new borrowers for residential property, weighted by each surveyed institution’s total lending outstanding for housing purposes. 26. The floating first mortgage new customer housing rate series is a proxy for a debt that a taxpayer might prioritise over their tax obligations. In the absence of a UOMI charge, a taxpayer wanting to borrow money could simply underpay their tax and effectively use Inland Revenue as a bank rather than borrow from a bank at a commercial interest rate. A conservative margin of 250 basis points is added to the mortgage rate in calculating the UOMI rate on underpayments because the Commissioner does not have information about the likelihood of any individual taxpayer paying the UOMI charged to them (i.e. the taxpayer’s creditworthiness). 27. The rate setting regulations provide that the method for setting the interest rate for overpaid tax is the higher of 0% and the latest RBNZ 90-day bank bill rate less 100 basis points. The 90-day bank bill rate is the monthly average of the daily standard rates and approximates the return a taxpayer might expect on a low-risk investment in the New Zealand Government. Ensuring that the Commissioner pays less interest to the taxpayer on overpaid tax than the taxpayer would receive as a return from a low-risk bond aims to prevent Inland Revenue being used as an investment. 28. The UOMI rates were last changed by Order in Council with effect from 29 August 2019. The current rate of UOMI on underpayments is 8.35% and the current rate of UOMI on overpayments is 0.81%. Principles to be applied in resetting UOMI rates 29. In 2010, the Minister of Revenue agreed that the following principles be applied in setting new UOMI rates (PAD2010/287 refers): 29.1 Adjust both UOMI rates when there has been an increase or decrease of 100 basis points in either the RBNZ floating first mortgage new customer housing rate or the RBNZ 90-day bank bill rate (since the last time the rates were set); 29.2 Adjust both UOMI rates every 12 months when there has been an increase or decrease of 20 basis points in either the RBNZ floating first mortgage new customer housing rate or the RBNZ 90-day bank bill rate (since the last time the rates were set) if there has been no change in the previous 12 months, in order to avoid long-term misalignment of the rates; and 29.3 Apply the adjustment from the next standard provisional tax payment date. 30. Inland Revenue officials are responsible for monitoring the RBNZ floating first mortgage new customer housing rate series and the RBNZ 90-day bank bill rate series throughout the year.

The RBNZ’s survey results for the relevant market interest rates in April 2019 (the month that the rates are currently based on) and March 2020 are as follows: Month ended Floating first mortgage new customer housing rate (%) 90-day bank bill rate (%) April 2019 5.85 1.81 March 2020 4.50 0.71 32. Both sets of results for March 2020 were publicly available by 7 April 2020. They indicate that, since the rates were last set, the floating first mortgage new customer housing rate has decreased by 135 basis points and the 90-day bank bill rate has decreased by 110 basis points. As per the administrative principles set out in paragraph 29.1, adjustments to the rates of UOMI are required since either of the series has moved by at least 100 basis points (both series in this case). 33. Officials recommend that the underpayment rate be decreased to 7.00%, which is the March 2020 floating first mortgage new customer housing rate of 4.50% plus 250 basis points. 34. Officials recommend that the overpayment rate be decreased to 0.00%. The March 2020 90-day bank bill rate of 0.71% less 100 basis points is -0.29%. However, the Taxation (Use of Money Interest Rates Setting Process) Amendment Regulations 2020 came into force on 9 April 2020 in response to the current low interest rate environment. The amendments prevent the rate of UOMI on overpayments from going negative, effectively setting a zero-rate floor. Hence, officials recommend that the overpayment rate be decreased to 0.00% rather than -0.29%. Relationship with COVID-19 35. Inland Revenue has already implemented UOMI-based relief for taxpayers in response to COVID-19 through allowing remission of UOMI for taxpayers that are significantly adversely affected by COVID-19. 36. Some taxpayers may not be able to access this remission and will still be liable for UOMI. The decrease in the underpayment rate from 8.35% to 7.00% constitutes some form of tax relief for taxpayers not eligible for full UOMI remission. 37. Changes to the rates of UOMI are not normally legislated in a short period of time and so a commencement date of 8 May 2020 would not normally be feasible. These changes would normally have come into force on 29 August 2020. However, we recommend you accelerate this process so that the UOMI rate changes can come into force on 8 May 2020 to provide faster relief for taxpayers that are still liable for UOMI on underpayments of tax during COVID-19. 38. This UOMI review is therefore different from normal in that officials request a decision from you on your preferred commencement date. Officials’ preference is to accelerate the process so that the changes come into force on 8 May 2020. This would require you to take the attached paper to Cabinet on 4 May 2020. More details on next steps are provided at the end of this report. In Confidence IR2020 /223: Cabinet paper: Use of money interest rates review Page 6 of 7 IN CONFIDENCE Approval for drafting 39. The UOMI rates are set at regular intervals by regulations and it has become a routine matter to amend them. Paragraph 7.91(d) of the Cabinet Office Manual provides that, where the making of regulations will not involve any further policy considerations, the Minister may authorise drafting without reference to Cabinet. 40. Your approval is sufficient for the Parliamentary Counsel Office to draft the Order in Council. Financial implications 41. UOMI applies to both underpayments and overpayments of tax. Although more is charged by the Commissioner on underpayments than is paid to the taxpayer on overpayments, the charges to underpayments are impaired by 80% in the Crown accounts to reflect that most UOMI charged is never paid and therefore must be written off. This means that a decrease in the underpayment rate also produces a decrease in impairment expenditure. 42. If the commencement date for changes to the UOMI rates is 8 May 2020, then there is a positive net fiscal impact over the forecast period of $83 million. This is because the decrease in tax revenue from changes to the underpayment and overpayment rates is outweighed by a decrease in impairment expenditure (more taxpayers will be able to repay their debt with a lower underpayment rate so less UOMI debt is written off). 43. Over the forecast period, the fiscal saving from paying less on overpayments is $124 million, which is outweighed by the fiscal cost of charging less on underpayments of $203 million. The net effect is $79 million in lower revenue over the forecast period (comprising $3 million less revenue in the 2019/20 fiscal year and $19 million less revenue in each other year), as shown below: $ millions increase (decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2019/20 2020/21 2021/22 2022/23 2023/24 & outyears Crown Revenue and Receipts: Tax Revenue (3.000) (19.000) (19.000) (19.000) (19.000) Total Operating 3.000 19.000 19.000 19.000 19.000 44. The decrease in the underpayment rate results in a decrease in expenditure for impairment of debt and debt write-off costs. Revenue from the underpayment rate is impaired by 80% in the Crown accounts to reflect that most UOMI charged is never paid. The total reduction in impairment expenditure is $162 million over the forecast period. This impact on appropriations is shown below: In Confidence IR2020 /223: Cabinet paper: Use of money interest rates review Page 7 of 7 IN CONFIDENCE $ millions increase (decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2019/20 2020/21 2021/22 2022/23 2023/24 & outyears Non- Departmental Other Expense: Impairment of debt and debt write-offs (funded by Revenue Crown) (6.000) (39.000) (39.000) (39.000) (39.000) Total Operating (6.000) (39.000) (39.000) (39.000) (39.000) 45. The overall effect of the decrease in revenue of $79 million and the decrease in impairment expenditure of $162 million is a positive net fiscal impact of $83 million. 46. These revenue implications are a forecasting change only as they result from an existing policy. There is no impact on the scorecard from the proposed adjustments to the UOMI rates. 47. If the commencement date for changes to the UOMI rates is 29 August 2020, then it is likely that the new rates at that time will be different from the new rates outlined in this report and the attached Cabinet paper. In that case, we will report to you at a future date with an updated Cabinet paper detailing the new rates and their corresponding fiscal impacts. Consultation 48. The Treasury has been consulted in the preparation of this report and agrees with its contents, including Inland Revenue’s recommendation for a commencement date of 8 May 2020. Next steps 49. If you choose for the new UOMI rates to come into force on 8 May 2020, it is proposed that the Order in Council be submitted to the Cabinet Office by 10am, Thursday 30 April 2020 for Cabinet’s meeting and the Executive Council on Monday 4 May 2020. Officials will prepare speaking notes for taking the attached paper directly to Cabinet if you agree to this option. 50. If you choose for the new UOMI rates to come into force on 29 August 2020, the rates outlined in this report will still need to be changed, but it is likely that the new rates will be different from those outlined here once allowing for more up-to-date data. Officials will provide you with an updated Cabinet paper closer to the August commencement date. This option will likely not require a paper to be taken directly to Cabinet since there will be no time pressure. Instead, a paper will likely be taken to the Cabinet Legislation Committee with subsequent approval at Cabinet (the normal process for changes to UOMI rates). 1 IN CONFIDENCE In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet TAXATION (USE OF MONEY INTEREST RATES) AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2020 Proposal 1.This paper seeks Cabinet’s agreement to submit an Order in Council amending the Taxation (Use of Money Interest Rates) Regulations 1998 to the Executive Council. 2.It is proposed to amend the regulations so that the use of money interest (UOMI) rate on underpayments of tax is set at 7.00% and the UOMI rate on overpayments of tax is set at 0.00%. Policy 3.The UOMI rates play an important role in the tax compliance rules. By moving in line with underlying market rates, the UOMI rates provide taxpayers with the incentive to pay the right amount of tax at the right time. The rates apply to all revenue and duties. 4.The Tax Administration Act 1994 provides for the UOMI underpayment and overpayment rates to be set by Order in Council. Once the rates are set, they remain the prescribed UOMI rates unless subsequently changed by Order in Council. The methods for calculating the rates are set out in the Taxation (Use of Money Interest Rates Setting Process) Regulations 1997 (the Regulations). 5.The Regulations provide that the rate of UOMI for underpaid tax should be set at the latest Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) floating first mortgage new customer housing rate plus 250 basis points. The floating first mortgage new customer housing rate reflects the variable interest rate offered by surveyed institutions to new borrowers for residential property, weighted by each surveyed institution’s total lending outstanding for housing purposes. 6.The Regulations provide that the rate of UOMI for overpaid tax should be set at the higher of 0% and the latest RBNZ 90-day bank bill rate less 100 basis points. The 90- day bank bill rate is the monthly average of the daily standard rates. 7.The current UOMI underpayment and overpayment rates are 8.35% and 0.81% respectively. The UOMI rates were last changed by Order in Council with effect from 29 August 2019 and were based on the interest rates for April 2019. 8.The RBNZ interest rates for March 2020 indicate that the floating first mortgage new customer housing rate and the 90-day bank bill rate have changed by 135 basis points and 110 basis points respectively since the rates were last adjusted. I consider that an adjustment of the UOMI rates is necessary to avoid a long-term misalignment. 2. 2 IN CONFIDENCE 9. Therefore, I recommend that the rate of UOMI on underpayments be changed to 7.00% and the rate of UOMI on overpayments be changed to 0.00%. Timing and 28-day rule 10. I propose that Cabinet gives approval to the Order in Council giving effect to the changes in UOMI rates and authorises its submission to the Executive Council at its meeting on 4 May 2020. In order to minimise compliance and administrative costs, it is proposed that the new rates of UOMI come into force on 8 May 2020, the day after the due date for the third standard instalment of provisional tax. 11. To achieve a commencement date of 8 May 2020, I recommend that the 28-day rule be waived for the coming into force of these regulations. I note that the decrease in the rate of UOMI on underpayments of tax may assist some taxpayers through the economic impacts of COVID-19 that are liable for UOMI but not eligible for UOMI remission. If the 28-day rule is not waived, then these changes could only come into force on 29 August 2020 as per the standard provisional tax due dates. This means that taxpayers liable for UOMI would not be able to benefit from the lower underpayment rate in the short term. I recommend that these changes come into force at the earliest possible date and so the 28-day rule should therefore be waived. Compliance 12. The regulations comply with the principles, Acts, guidelines, and requirements set out below as follows: 12.1 the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi; 12.2 the rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993; 12.3 the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993; 12.4 relevant international standards and obligations; and 12.5 the Legislation Guidelines (2018 edition), which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee. Regulations Review Committee 13. There are no anticipated grounds for the Regulations Review Committee to draw the attached regulations to the attention of the house. Certification by Parliamentary Counsel 14. The Parliamentary Counsel Office has certified that the attached regulations are in order for submission to the Executive Council. Impact Analysis 15. A Regulatory Impact Assessment is not required as the proposal is of a minor and routine nature and does not substantially alter existing arrangements. 3 IN CONFIDENCE Financial implications 16. The proposal is estimated to result in a net positive fiscal impact of $83 million over the forecast period with the effective date of 8 May 2020. This is because the decrease in tax revenue from changes to the underpayment and overpayment rates is outweighed by a decrease in impairment expenditure (more taxpayers will be able to repay their tax debt with a lower underpayment rate so less UOMI is written off). 17. Over the forecast period, the fiscal saving from paying less on overpayments is $124 million, which is outweighed by the fiscal cost of charging less on underpayments of $203 million. The net effect is $79 million in lower revenue over the forecast period (comprising $3 million less revenue in the 2019/20 fiscal year and $19 million less revenue in each other year), as shown below: $ millions increase (decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2019/20 2020/21 2021/22 2022/23 2023/24 & outyears Crown Revenue and Receipts: Tax Revenue (3.000) (19.000) (19.000) (19.000) (19.000) Total Operating 3.000 19.000 19.000 19.000 19.000 18.

The overall effect of the decrease in revenue of $79 million and the decrease in impairment expenditure of $162 million is a positive net fiscal impact of $83 million. 4 IN CONFIDENCE Publicity 20. I will issue a media statement once the regulations are made by the Executive Council. 21. Inland Revenue will publish an article about these changes in its Tax Information Bulletin. Proactive release 22. I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers with appropriate redactions within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. Consultation 23. Inland Revenue and the Treasury have been consulted in the preparation of this paper and agree with its recommendations. Recommendations The Minister of Revenue recommends that Cabinet: 1. agree that the use of money interest rate on underpayments of tax be changed to 7.00% from 8.35%; 2. agree that the use of money interest rate on overpayments of tax be changed to 0.00% from 0.81%; 3. agree that the Taxation (Use of Money Interest Rates) Amendment Regulations 2020 give effect to the new rates referred to in recommendations 1 and 2 above; 4. note that a waiver of the 28-day rule is sought: 4.1 so that the regulations can come into force on 8 May 2020; 4.2 on the grounds that this will allow the regulations to be in force for the day immediately following the next standard instalment of provisional tax, which will have the benefit of providing support for some taxpayers to help cushion the economic impacts of COVID-19; 5. agree to waive the 28-day rule so that the regulations can come into force on 8 May 2020; 6. note the following changes as a result of the decision in recommendations 1 and 2 above, with a corresponding impact on the operating balance: 5 IN CONFIDENCE $ millions increase (decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2019/20 2020/21 2021/22 2022/23 2023/24 & outyears Crown Revenue and Receipts: Tax Revenue (3.000) (19.000) (19.000) (19.000) (19.000) Total Operating 3.000 19.000 19.000 19.000 19.000 7. approve the following forecast change in appropriations for Non-Departmental Other Expense as a result of the decision in recommendations 1 and 2 above, with a corresponding impact on the operating balance: $ millions increase (decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2019/20 2020/21 2021/22 2022/23 2023/24 & outyears Non- Departmental Other Expense: Impairment of debt and debt write-offs (funded by Revenue Crown) (6.000) (39.000) (39.000) (39.000) (39.000) Total Operating (6.000) (39.000) (39.000) (39.000) (39.000) 8. authorise the submission to the Executive Council of the Taxation (Use of Money Interest Rates) Amendment Regulations 2020.

In Confidence IR2019/366: Taxation of PIE income: items for inclusion in current tax bill Page 1 of 9 IN CONFIDENCE 22 August 2019 Minister of Revenue Taxation of PIE income: items for inclusion in current tax bill Executive summary 1. This report seeks your decision on the proposed options for allowing refundability of overpaid tax on Portfolio Investment Entity (PIE) income as well as widening Inland Revenue’s ability to provide PIEs with their investor’s prescribed investor rates (PIR) where it holds sufficient information about the investor. 2. This report also seeks your decision on whether you wish to include the proposed legislative changes enabling refundability and provision of PIRs in the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Bill (the KiwiSaver Bill) which was referred to the Finance and Expenditure C ommittee on 23 July 2019. This could be done by recommending the proposed changes in the officials’ report to the Finance and Expenditure Committee on the KiwiSaver Bill in early October. Members of the Committee have indicated in the first reading of the KiwiSaver Bill that they will raise their concern about non-refundability of overpaid tax on PIE income during the select committee process. 3. 4. Previously Inland Revenue officials have reported to you that recent changes to Inland Revenue’s systems and processes since April 2019 have resulted in the identification of around 1.5 million people with incorrect PIRs for their PIE income (IR2019/237 and IR2019/270 refer). Current legislation does not allow for a refund of overpaid PIE tax. However, where PIE tax has been underpaid, the investor has to include their PIE income in their income tax return and it is taxed at the investor’s marginal tax rate, which may be up to 33%, whereas the top PIR is 28%. 5. Officials also provided you with report IR2019/337 on 20 June 2019 scoping possible future policy work on the PIE regime. In response to this report, you requested further work on options to allow a refund of over-paid PIE tax and to simplify the way PIRs are selected or provided. This report outlines the options as a result of this further work. 6. In summary, officials propose that in addition to administrative initiatives Inland Revenue is already undertaking to improve the numbers of investors on the correct PIR, the following legislative changes are adopted to ensure investors in PIEs are taxed at their correct PIR: 6.1 Every PIE investor has their PIE income squared up in a year-end process alongside the income tax square-up using their correct PIR, which is based on the information Inland Revenue holds for the investor’s two previous tax years. Any PIE tax withheld during the tax year will be applied as a tax credit. For most individual investors this will happen automatically, and they will not be required to do anything. For the remaining investors the PIE income information IRD holds will be pre-populated into their income tax profile to be available when they file their tax return. Any resulting over- or underpayment of PIE tax will be offset against the result of the investor’s income tax square up (their residual income tax). This means any overpaid tax on PIE income will result in an income tax refund, increase the investor’s Outside scope In Confidence IR2019/366: Taxation of PIE income: items for inclusion in current tax bill Page 2 of 9 IN CONFIDENCE income tax refund or reduce the investor’s income tax bill. Any underpayment of PIE tax will result in an income tax bill, increase the investor’s income tax bill or reduce the investor’s income tax refund. If the correct PIR was used to withhold tax on the investor’s PIE income, the income tax result of the investor will remain unchanged. Officials recommend that this change apply from the current (2019-20) tax year to enable refundability for the people on lower incomes that should be on a lower PIR if fiscal circumstances permit. Otherwise this change could apply prospectively from 1 April 2020 to the 2020-21 tax year. Officials recommend that this change be included in the KiwiSaver Bill as part of the select committee process. 6.2 The changes allowing for refundability of overpaid PIE tax could apply from the 2019-20 tax year going forward allowing for refundability of PIE tax for the current tax year with an estimated fiscal cost of -$23.2 million. Alternatively, refundability could apply for the following 2020-21 tax year with an immaterial fiscal cost. 6.3 Inland Revenue will provide PIE entities with the correct PIRs for their investors during the tax year for existing PIE investments, and for new PIE investments if sufficient information is available to Inland Revenue. This would significantly reduce the number of investors with a credit or debit outcome of their PIE income square-up at the end of the tax year. Officials recommend that this change apply from 1 April 2020 and be included in the KiwiSaver Bill as part of the select committee process. 7. Next steps 8. If you agree to the recommendations in this report, officials will draft a Cabinet paper for your consideration and referral to the Cabinet Office seeking a decision according to your directions. A draft Cabinet paper could be provided by 6 September 2019 and be referred to Cabinet Office on 19 September 2019 for consideration at the Cabinet meeting of 30 September 2019. 9. Subject to your and Cabinet’s decision, the proposed changes will be included in the officials’ report to the Finance and Expenditure Committee on the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Bill. Officials are due to report to the Committee on this Bill in early October. Recommended action 10. We recommend that you: a) agree that all PIE investors should have their PIE income squared up at the end of the tax year using their correct PIR, which is based on the information Inland Revenue holds for the investor’s two previous tax years, with the result forming part of their income tax outcome for that year. Agreed/Not agreed b) note that recommendation a) could apply from the current 2019-20 tax year with an estimated fiscal cost of -$23.2 million or prospectively from the 2020- 21 tax year with an immaterial fiscal cost.

Previously Inland Revenue officials have reported to you that recent changes to Inland Revenue’s systems and processes since April 2019 have resulted in the identification of around 1.5 million customers with incorrect prescribed investor rates (PIRs) for their PIE income (IR2019/237 and IR2019/270 refer). 12. For the year ended 31 March 2019, it is estimated that approximately: 12.1 550,000 people are on a PIR that is too low and as a result, have underpaid their PIE tax by $42.4 million and therefore have additional income tax to pay at their marginal tax rates of between $45 million to $50 million. The average amount owing is between $82 to $91. 12.2 950,000 people are on a PIR that is too high and have overpaid tax by approximately $42.6 million, the average amount of overpaid tax is $44. These people will have had taxable income of less than $48,000 in at least one of the two previous income years. 13. Where tax on PIE income was underpaid, the PIE income is included in the investor’s personal income tax return and is taxed at the investor’s marginal tax rate with a tax credit for the PIE tax that has already been paid. Overpaid tax on PIE income is full and final and current legislation does not allow for a refund. 14. Fairness concerns have been raised in the media and at the Estimates hearing for Vote Revenue before the Finance and Expenditure Committee in June 2019, in particular in relation to the non-refundability of overpaid tax on PIE income. 15. Officials provided you with report IR2019/337 on 20 June 2019 scoping possible future policy work on the PIE regime. In response to this report, you requested further work on options to allow a refund of over-paid PIE tax and on ways to simplify how PIRs are selected or provided. 16. The KiwiSaver Bill contains a proposed amendment to widen an existing ability to enable Inland Revenue to notify a PIE where it is using an incorrect PIR for an investor and provide an alternative rate that the PIE must then use. More recently fairness concerns around PIE tax non-refundability were also raised at the first reading of the KiwiSaver Bill on 23 July 2019 where members of the Finance and Expenditure Committee have indicated that they intend to raise this matter during the select committee process. Current law 17. Under current legislation a person investing in a multi-rate PIE (most PIEs are multi- rate PIEs) elects a tax rate, referred to as their PIR, which approximates their marginal tax rate based on (the lower of) one of the previous two tax years. However, as opposed to marginal income tax rates which can be up to 33%, PIE rates are capped at 28%. The investor notifies their elected PIR to their PIE providers. The PIE provider pays tax on the investment income based on the PIR the individual has notified. If an investor does not provide their PIE provider with their elected PIR, they default to the highest PIR of 28%. 18. Generally, the tax paid by a PIE based on investors’ PIRs is a final tax for the individual investor, which means the investor does not have to include the PIE income in their tax return. However, where an investor elects a rate that is too low, any PIE tax deducted from PIE income is no longer a full and final tax. In this case the investor has to include the amount of PIE income in their personal income tax return and is taxed on their PIE income at their marginal tax rate of up to 33%, whereas the top PIR is 28%. The investor receives a tax credit for the PIE tax already paid. In Confidence IR2019/366: Taxation of PIE income: items for inclusion in current tax bill Page 5 of 9 IN CONFIDENCE 19. Where an investor has elected a rate that is too high, or they have defaulted to the highest PIR but could have elected a lower PIR, the tax paid remains full and final and the legislation does not allow for a refund of the overpaid amount of PIE tax. 20. Where the Commissioner considers the PIR notified by the investor to be incorrect, the Commissioner currently has the ability to direct a PIE to use a PIR she considers appropriate rather than the rate the investor notified. A proposed legislative change contained in the KiwiSaver Bill widens this ability so that the Commissioner can also provide the appropriate PIR where an investor defaulted onto the 28% PIR rather than notified the incorrect rate. This is proposed to apply from the 1 April 2020. Problem definition 21. As outlined above, there are two main areas of concern: 21.1 a large number of people are on a wrong PIR; and 21.2 currently legislative provisions do not allow for overpaid tax on PIE income to be refunded. 22. As outlined in earlier reports mentioned above, Inland Revenue is working on a range of initiatives to help ensure people are on the correct PIRs for the future. This involves proactively contacting customers who are on an incorrect rate and suggesting they contact their PIE provider to change their rate. Inland Revenue has commenced these initiatives. 23. To further address the above concerns officials have been asked to consider policy options for: 23.1 legislative changes allowing refunds of overpaid PIE tax; and 23.2 legislative changes simplifying the way a PIR is selected or provided. Allowing for refunds of overpaid PIE tax 24. You have asked officials to consider and potentially further develop a legislative change allowing refunds of overpaid PIE tax. 25. Current legislation provides that PIE income is excluded income of the investor. This means it is not included in the investor’s assessable income which is subject to income tax at the investor’s marginal income tax rate (between 10.5% and 33% depending on the investor’s taxable income for the tax year). 26. Instead tax on PIE income is withheld by the PIE provider using the individual PIR their investor has notified. The PIR approximates the investor’s marginal tax rate based on one of the previous two tax years. There are three PIRs: 10.5%, 17.5% and 28%. In some cases, the PIR is concessionary compared with marginal income tax rates. Where the investor has not notified a rate, the default rate of 28% applies. If the investor has notified their PIE provider with the correct PIR or with a rate that is too high, the tax withheld on the PIE income, whether correct or overpaid, is a full and final tax. This means in the current PIE rules there is no legislative ability and mechanism to refund any tax overpaid on PIE income. The people affected by the non-refundability are people with lower income and will have had taxable income of less than $48,000 in at least one of the two previous income years. These people would have been entitled to a lower PIR but cannot receive a refund of overpaid tax on their PIE income. 27. If the investor has notified their PIE provider of a rate that is too low, the investor’s PIE income ceases to be excluded income. This means the PIE income is subject to income tax at the investor’s marginal income tax rate which could be up to 33%, In Confidence IR2019/366: Taxation of PIE income: items for inclusion in current tax bill Page 6 of 9 IN CONFIDENCE whereas the top PIR is 28%. The investor gets a tax credit for the PIE tax that has already been paid in respect of the income. This policy was designed as an incentive for investors to notify the correct PIR. Investors who have notified a rate that is too low have to include their PIE income in their tax return. For individual investors who have notified a rate that is too low and who have their income tax automatically squared up at the end of the tax year, their PIE income is automatically included in their income tax assessment. 28. Officials’ preferred option to achieve refundability of over-withheld PIE income is that all PIE income would be squared up at the end of the tax year using the PIE investor’s correct PIR based on one of the previous two income years. This means that PIE tax would no longer be a full and final tax, but every PIE investor would have their PIE income squared up in a year-end process alongside the income tax square-up using their correct PIR. Any PIE tax withheld during the tax year would be applied as a tax credit. 29. The outcome of the PIE tax square-up would be offset against the person’s income tax outcome (their residual income tax). Any resulting over- or underpayment of PIE tax will be offset against the result of the investor’s income tax square up (their residual income tax). This means any overpaid tax on PIE income will result in an income tax refund, increase the investor’s income tax refund or reduce their tax bill. Any underpayment of PIE tax will result in an income tax bill, increase the investor’s income tax bill or reduce their tax refund. If the correct PIR was used to withhold tax on the investor’s PIE income, the income tax result of the investor will remain unchanged. Officials recommend that this change apply from the current tax year. 30. For most individual investors this square up would happen automatically and they would not be required to do anything. It would be an automated process similar to and alongside the year end auto-calculation process for income tax. The result would be an overall tax bill or refund. For the remaining investors the PIE income information Inland Revenue holds would be pre-populated into their income tax profile to be available when they file their income tax return. For them the PIE income calculation would happen alongside the income tax assessment once they have filed their tax return for the year. 31. The outlined proposal would preserve the current PIR rates based on one of the previous two tax years, including the maximum tax rate for PIEs (including KiwiSaver PIEs) being 28% and the current thresholds for investors in these PIEs. 32. The proposal would mean a change compared to the current treatment for investors who have notified a PIR that is too low, under the current rules they have their marginal tax rates (up to 33%) applied to their PIE income as an incentive to notify the correct PIR. In future it would not be relevant whether a too low or too high PIR has been notified and who has notified the PIR (the investor or Inland Revenue). All PIE income would have the correct PIR applied to it in the year-end square up, regardless of whether it has been correctly, over- or under-withheld during the tax year. Officials consider that the current incentive for an investor to notify the correct PIR may be less relevant in future as Inland Revenue would from 1 April 2020 in most cases provide the PIR to the PIE provider or correct the PIR where it considers it to be incorrect. 33. We indicated in our scoping report dated 21 June 2019 (IR2019/337 refers) that depending on the design of any proposed legislative change, refundability could be complicated to implement. The preferred option outlined above could be implemented from 1 April 2020, applying either from that date going forward or for the current (2019-20) tax year. 34. Other options for achieving refundability were considered but disregarded as being too complex giving some unreasonable outcomes or having wide reaching effects In Confidence IR2019/366: Taxation of PIE income: items for inclusion in current tax bill Page 7 of 9 IN CONFIDENCE on Inland Revenue’s technology platform START, including the system design of the income tax auto-calculation for individuals. Simplifying the way a PIR is selected or provided 35. Inland Revenue can provide the PIR it considers appropriate for an investor directly to a PIE if Inland Revenue thinks the PIR the investor has notified is incorrect. As outlined earlier, the KiwiSaver Bill proposes a legislative change to also allow Inland Revenue to provide the PIE with the investor’s correct PIR where they have not notified a PIR and defaulted onto the 28% rate. 36. To simplify the way PIRs are determined for an investor, officials propose to go a step further and provide Inland Revenue with the ability to proactively provide the PIE with their investors’ PIRs during the tax year for existing investors and for new investors if Inland Revenue holds sufficient information to determine the PIR applicable for the tax year. 37. This would result in most people being on the correct PIR and having correct PIE tax withheld from their PIE income. For example, when a new employee is auto- enrolled in KiwiSaver, Inland Revenue would, upon being notified of the enrolment by the employer, calculate the new employee’s PIR. This would be based on the employee’s previous two years’ income information that Inland Revenue holds and the PIR would be provided to the relevant PIE. Inland Revenue would inform the investor of their calculated PIR and the fact that Inland Revenue has provided it to their PIE provider. 38. There would be some limited circumstances where Inland Revenue is unable to provide a PIR: 38.1 Where Inland Revenue does not hold sufficient information to calculate an individual’s PIR for the tax year. For example, a person required to file a tax return has not filed their return for one of the previous two tax years; 38.2 Inland Revenue would not be aware of a new investor starting to invest in a non-KiwiSaver PIE until tax on the PIE income has been withheld and therefore could not proactively advise the PIR. However, investors in such PIEs are more likely to have a higher income and more likely to be on a 28% PIR, therefore over-taxation is less likely (although still possible). Outside scope In Confidence IR2019/366: Taxation of PIE income: items for inclusion in current tax bill Page 8 of 9 IN CONFIDENCE F inancial implications 45. We estimate that the fiscal impact of squaring up PIE income for all PIE investors (and not just those who are under-taxed) is a revenue loss of approximately - $23.2 million for the 2019-20 tax year, and an immaterial loss in the following years. Timing and accrual accounting might cause the initial amount to be spread over two fiscal years and work is being done to estimate the extent to which the cost will spill over into the second fiscal year. 46. The estimated cost of refunding overpaid PIE tax is based on the overpayment data for the tax year ended 31 March 2019, which is approximately $42.6 million of overpaid tax on PIE income. Subsequent actions were also incorporated. These include Inland Revenue’s initiatives to get more people on the correct rate through information supplied to investors, and media attention. Both of these will have resulted in a large number of investors contacting their PIE providers to change their PIR, particularly investors who have received a tax bill for the 2018-19 tax year. To capture these impacts, we assumed that $20 million of the $42.6 million will be corrected through non-square-up means in the current tax year. This leaves a residual of $22.6 million of overpaid PIE tax, contributing a fiscal cost of -$22.6 million if corrected by way of a square up mechanism at year end. 47. In addition, the proposal is to square up the PIE income of those who underpay PIE tax to their correct PIR, and not to their marginal tax rate as is currently the case. We estimate that this change would cost an additional -$0.6 million as PIR rates are capped at 28%. Outside scope In Confidence IR2019/366: Taxation of PIE income: items for inclusion in current tax bill Page 9 of 9 IN CONFIDENCE 48. For the years following the current income years, Inland Revenue would provide PIEs with the correct PIRs for most of their investors. The fiscal cost directly attributable to additional square up activity would therefore be immaterial. 49. For the years following the current income years, Inland Revenue would provide PIEs with the correct PIRs for most of their investors. This would mean that almost all investors would be on the correct PIR and the fiscal cost would therefore be immaterial. 50. This fiscal cost would need to be charged as a pre-commitment against the 2020 Budget’s operating allowance or funded through the between-Budget Contingency set up at Budget 2019. Administrative implications 51. Implementation and on-going administration costs, estimated at $1.5 million, will be met through baseline funding. Consultation 52. The Treasury has been consulted and agree with the content of this report. Next steps 53.

Attached to this report is a Cabinet paper for your consideration and authorisation. The paper seeks Cabinet’s approval for a number of policy changes for inclusion in the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Bill (the KiwiSaver Bill) which is currently before the Finance and Expenditure Committee. Submissions to the Committee on the KiwiSaver Bill closed on 4 September 2019. 2. The draft Cabinet paper proposes two changes to the PIE regime which you have previously approved for inclusion in the Cabinet paper (IR2019/366 refers). These proposals are: 2.1 to allow for refundability of overpaid PIE tax from the 2020-21 tax year all PIE investors have their PIE income squared up at the end of the tax year. This is done by using their correct prescribed investor rate (PIR), which is based on the information Inland Revenue holds for the investor’s two previous tax years; 2.2 that Inland Revenue provide PIE entities with the correct PIR for their investors during the income year for existing PIE investors and for new investors in PIEs if sufficient information is available to Inland Revenue with application from 1 April 2020; 3. This report also seeks your approval to the following amendments: 3.1 repeal the provisions requiring the withholding of student loan repayments to be deducted from schedular, election day and casual agricultural income with effect from 1 April 2020. This change is as a result of consultation with employers who advise that significant compliance costs would be incurred in implementing this change; 3.2 lowering the $1500 student loan scheme exemption for non-salary and wage income (including schedular, casual agricultural, and election day income) to $500; 3.3 deferring KiwiSaver members being able to change their employee contributions rates through their KiwiSaver scheme provider and Inland Revenue; and 3.4 removing a proposal from the KiwiSaver Bill that would require employers to provide employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) rate information to Inland Revenue and modifying a proposal relating to the provision of KiwiSaver income information to Inland Revenue, so employers would only be required to provide this information for new employees. These changes were previously agreed to by Cabinet. In Confidence IR2019/463: Changes to the PIE regime, student loan scheme and KiwiSaver for inclusion in current Bill Page 2 of 6 IN CONFIDENCE Next steps 4. If you agree to the proposals and the attached draft, we propose that this Cabinet paper be referred to Cabinet Office on 19 September 2019 for the Cabinet Economic Development Committee (DEV) meeting on 26 September 2019 and Cabinet consideration on 30 September 2019. 5. Subject to your approval of the student loans and KiwiSaver changes and Cabinet’s decision the proposals will be included in the officials’ report to the Finance and Expenditure Committee on the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Bill for the Committee’s consideration. Officials are due to report to the Committee on 11 October 2019.

You have previously agreed to two changes to the PIE regime (IR2019/366 refers) that would allow for refundability of overpaid PIE tax an simplify the way a PIR is selected or provided. These changes are that: 9.1 from the 2020-21 tax year all PIE investors should have their PIE income squared up at the end of the tax year using their correct prescribed investor rate (PIR), which is based on the information Inland Revenue holds for the investor’s two previous tax years; and 9.2 Inland Revenue provides PIE entities with the correct PIR for their investors during the income year for existing PIE investors and for new investors in PIEs if sufficient information is available to Inland Revenue with application from 1 April 2020. 10. The attached draft Cabinet paper seeks Cabinet’s approval to include these changes in the KiwiSaver Bill to be considered by the Finance and Expenditure Committee. 11. One of the submissions the Finance and Expenditure Committee has received on the KiwiSaver Bill suggests that a mechanism should be introduced to provide a form of refund for an over-taxed investor. 12. While none of the other submissions received to date raise the point of PIE tax non- refundability, we note that the Committee has indicated that it will accept some late submissions. Any late relevant submission received will not have been considered in the drafting of the attached Cabinet paper. 13. Officials are currently working with the Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue to finalise and review the required regulatory impact assessment which will be provided to your Office at a later point in time. Items for approval in this report 14. Ministerial approval is sought from you on the inclusion of the following changes to policy items in the KiwiSaver Bill. Changes to Student Loan Scheme Repeal requirement to deduct student loan repayments from certain income 15. Recently enacted provisions require student loan repayments to be deducted from schedular, election-day, and casual agricultural income each payday from 1 April 2020. Submissions on the policy proposals to Inland Revenue focussed on the merits of the policy intent, rather than the compliance costs for employers. Also, there were no submissions received on this proposal during the Select Committee process. 16. In preparing for implementing these changes, Inland Revenue has undertaken targeted consultation on the detailed design questions with employers who have advised that significant compliance costs would be incurred in implementing these changes. This cost would be imposed at a time when employers are already facing a large number of changes as a result of earlier Business Transformation releases. Inland Revenue is now reconsidering whether withholding is the right approach for these sources of income or if there are other policy options that could address In Confidence IR2019/463: Changes to the PIE regime, student loan scheme and KiwiSaver for inclusion in current Bill Page 5 of 6 IN CONFIDENCE compliance issues for this group. As a result, officials recommend repealing this change with effect from 1 April 2020. Reducing the exemption limit for non-salary and wage income 17. The student loan scheme currently has a $1500 exemption for non-salary and wage income (including schedular, casual agricultural and election day income) for New Zealand-based borrowers, above the annual repayment threshold. Recent changes to the administration of individuals’ income tax mean that now all taxpayers either file a return or have their income tax return automatically generated. As a result, there is no longer a significant compliance cost for borrowers associated with advising Inland Revenue of their non-salary and wage income. Therefore, officials recommend reducing the exemption limit from $1500 to $500. This would mean that a larger number of borrowers would be required to make repayments and if payments are made, these would reduce the term of the loan. However, if borrowers do not make payments, provisions in the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 currently allow unpaid amounts of less than $334 to be capitalised back onto the loan balance, so no borrowers whose total non-salary and wage income is between $500 and $1,500 will be subject to penalties if they do not make repayments. 18. Inland Revenue officials are in discussions with the Treasury Regulatory Impact Analysis team, regarding meeting regulatory impact analysis requirements. Initial advice is that an exemption applies to repealing the requirement to withhold student loan repayments from schedular, casual agricultural, and election day payments. 19. However, the change to lower the $1,500 exemption for non-salary and wage income to $500 may require a short regulatory impact analysis. Should the requirement for a regulatory impact analysis be confirmed, we will provide the analysis at a later time. KiwiSaver changes 20. You previously agreed to the following changes to the KiwiSaver scheme, that were subsequently agreed to by Cabinet and included in the KiwiSaver Bill: • allowing KiwiSaver members to change their employee contribution rate through their KiwiSaver scheme provider or Inland Revenue (in addition to through their employer, which is the current process); • requiring employers to report employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) rates to Inland Revenue for new employees and where this information has changed; and • requiring employers to report information about the income members KiwiSaver contributions are calculated from 1 for new employees and where this information has changed (IR2019/023, DEV-19-MIN-0038.1 and CAB- 19-MIN-0109 refer). 21. Your approval is now sought to the following modification to these previously agreed to changes: • deferring the change to allow KiwiSaver members to change their employee contribution rate through their KiwiSaver provider and Inland Revenue, until 1 April 2022 or and earlier date to be set by Order in Council; and • rescinding your earlier decision to require employers to provide ESCT rate information to Inland Revenue and modifying the decision relating to the provision of KiwiSaver income information to Inland Revenue, so employers 1 Some amounts that are included as income when calculating PAYE deductions are not treated as income for the purposes of calculating KiwiSaver contributions. In Confidence IR2019/463: Changes to the PIE regime, student loan scheme and KiwiSaver for inclusion in current Bill Page 6 of 6 IN CONFIDENCE would only be required to provide this information to Inland Revenue for new employees. 22. These proposed modifications would respond to concerns about employer compliance costs, that were raised during targeted consultation with stakeholders, as well as submissions to the Finance and Expenditure Committee has received on the KiwiSaver Bill . 23. Three submissions on the KiwiSaver Bill so far raised concerns about the additional employer reporting requirements. In particular, that the compliance costs of requiring employers to report ESCT rates, is likely to outweigh the benefit to Inland Revenue of receiving this information. 24. Seven of the submissions received on the KiwiSaver Bill touch on the proposal to allow employees to change their contribution rate through their KiwiSaver scheme provider or Inland Revenue. Submitters views are mixed, with some noting the change would introduce additional compliance costs for employers, while other submitters support the proposal on the basis it would improve the KiwiSaver member experience. Deferring the application date for this change would allow officials to undertake additional consultation with stakeholders and consider ways to make this change easier for employers to implement. 25. A regulatory impact analysis, entitled Business Transformation related KiwiSaver refinements, was prepared when original Cabinet decisions were made. A modified version of this regulator impact analysis, reflecting the changes recommended in this report, will be provided at a later time. Consultation 26. The Treasury has been consulted and agree with the content of the draft Cabinet paper. Next steps 27. We have drafted the attached Cabinet paper on the basis that you agree to the recommendations in this report. Please advise if there are any changes to the Cabinet paper you wish to make. 28. We suggest the following timeline: Action Date Referral to Cabinet Office 19 September 2019 Cabinet Economic Development Committee meeting 26 September 2019 Cabinet consideration 30 September 2019 29. Officials will include Cabinet’s decision in the officials’ report to the Finance and Expenditure Committee on the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Bill for the Committee’s consideration. Officials are due to report to the Committee on 11 October 2019. In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Economic Development Committee ITEMS FOR INCLUSION IN THE TAXATION (KIWISAVER, STUDENT LOANS, AND REMEDIAL MATTERS) BILL Proposal 1.This paper seeks the Cabinet Economic Development Committee’s agreement to a mendments to the Portfolio Investment Entity (PIE) regime, student loan scheme and to KiwiSaver settings. This paper proposes that the Committee: 1.1 amend the PIE regime to allow for refundability of overpaid tax on PIE income a nd to simplify the way prescribed investor rates (PIRs) are selected or provided; 1.2 repeal the student loan scheme provisions requiring the withholding of student l oan repayments from schedular, election day and casual income and to lower the $1500 exemption threshold for non-salary and wage income to $500; 1.3 defer KiwiSaver members being able to change employee contribution rates t hrough their KiwiSaver scheme provider or Inland Revenue; and 1.4 remove the provision in the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Bill requiring employers to provider employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) rate information to Inland Revenue, and only requiring employers to provide information about income KiwiSaver contributions are calculated from to Inland Revenue for new employees. 2.I propose that these changes be included in the officials’ report to the Finance and Exp enditure Committee on the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Bill for the Committee’s consideration. Officials are due to report to the Committee on this Bill in mid-October. Executive Summary Changes to PIE regime 3.Recent changes to Inland Revenue’s systems and processes since April 2019 have i dentified around 1.5 million people with incorrect PIRs for their PIE income. 4.Where PIE tax has been underpaid, the investor must include their PIE income in t heir income tax return and it is taxed at the investor’s marginal tax rate, which may be up to 33%, whereas the top PIR is 28%. However, legislation does not allow for a refund of overpaid PIE tax. 1 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:01 IN CONFIDENCE 3. 5. To allow overpaid PIE tax to be refunded, I propose that every PIE investor has their PIE income squared up in a year-end process alongside their income tax square-up. Inland Revenue will use investors’ correct PIR, which is based on the information Inland Revenue holds for the investor’s two previous tax years. Any PIE tax withheld during the tax year will be applied as a tax credit. Any resulting over- or underpayment of PIE tax will be offset against the result of the investor’s income tax square up (their residual income tax). I propose that this change apply from the 2020-21 tax year. 6. In addition, I propose to widen Inland Revenue’s ability to provide PIE entities with their investor’s PIRs where it holds sufficient information. Inland Revenue will provide PIE entities with the correct PIRs for their investors during the tax year for existing PIE investments, and for new PIE investments if sufficient information is available to Inland Revenue. This would significantly improve the accuracy of PIE tax paid through the year and reduce the number of investors with a credit or debit outcome of their PIE income square-up at the end of the tax year. I propose that this change apply from 1 April 2020. Student loan scheme changes 7. Recently enacted legislation requires student loan repayments to be deducted from schedular, election-day, and casual agricultural income each payday from 1 April 2020. Submissions on the policy proposal in the discussion document entitled Making Tax Simpler – Better administration of social policy focussed on the merits of the policy design, rather than the compliance costs for employers. Also, there were no submissions received on this proposal during the Select Committee process. 8. In preparing for implementing these changes, Inland Revenue has undertaken targeted consultation with employers who have advised that significant compliance costs would be incurred in implementing these changes. Inland Revenue is now reconsidering whether withholding is the right approach to make it easier for recipients of these sources of income to comply with their obligations. As a result, I recommend repealing this change with effect from 1 April 2020. 9. The student loan scheme currently has a $1500 exemption for non-salary and wage income (including schedular, casual agricultural and election day income) for New Zealand-based borrowers, above the annual repayment threshold. Recent changes to the administration of individuals’ income tax mean that now all taxpayers either file a return or have their income tax return automatically generated. As a result, there is no longer a significant compliance cost for borrowers associated with advising Inland Revenue of their non-salary and wage income. I therefore propose reducing the exemption limit from $1500 to $500 with effect from 1 April 2020. This would mean that a larger number of borrowers would be required to make repayments and if payments are made, these would reduce the term of the loan. Changes to KiwiSaver 10. Cabinet previously agreed to a number of changes to enhance the administration of KiwiSaver as part of Business Transformation Release 4 which have been included in the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans and Remedial Matters) Bill. To ensure 2 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:01 IN CONFIDENCE compliance costs to employers are minimised, I propose the following modifications to these changes: 10.1 deferring the application date of a change requiring employers to start deducting KiwiSaver contributions from employee’s salary or wages based on contribution rate changes advised by Inland Revenue until 1 April 2022 or an earlier date to be set by Order in Council. 10.2 rescinding an earlier Cabinet decision that would require employers to provide ESCT information to Inland Revenue and modify a decision relating to the provision of KiwiSaver income information to Inland Revenue, so employers would only be required to provide this information for new employees. Legislative implications 11. I propose that these changes be included in the officials’ report to the Finance and Expenditure Committee on the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Bill for the Committee’s consideration. Changes to the PIE regime Background 12. Recent changes to Inland Revenue’s systems and processes since April 2019 have resulted in the identification of around 1.5 million people with incorrect PIRs for their PIE income. For the year ended 31 March 2019, it is estimated that approximately: 12.1 550,000 people are on a PIR that is too low and as a result, have underpaid their PIE tax by $42.4 million. These people have additional income tax to pay at their marginal tax rates of between $45 million to $50 million. The average amount owing is between $82 to $91. 12.2 950,000 people are on a PIR that is too high and have overpaid tax by approximately $42.6 million. The average amount of overpaid tax is $44. These people will have had taxable income of less than $48,000 in at least one of the two previous income years. 13. A person investing in a multi-rate PIE (most PIEs are multi-rate PIEs) elects a tax rate, referred to as their PIR, which approximates their marginal tax rate based on (the lower of) one of the previous two tax years. However, as opposed to marginal income tax rates which can be up to 33%, PIE rates are capped at 28%. The investor notifies their elected PIR to their PIE providers. The PIE provider pays tax on the investment income based on the PIR their investor has notified. If an investor does not provide their PIE with their elected PIR, they default to the highest PIR of 28%. 14. Where tax on PIE income was underpaid because the investor has notified a rate that is too low, the PIE income is included in the investor’s personal income tax return and is taxed at the investor’s marginal tax rate. A tax credit is given for the PIE tax that has already been paid. 15. Where an investor has elected a rate that is too high, or they have defaulted to the highest PIR but could have elected a lower PIR, the overpaid tax on their PIE income is currently full and final. Current legislation does not allow for a refund. The people 3 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:01 IN CONFIDENCE affected by the non-refundability are people with lower income and will have had taxable income of less than $48,000 in at least one of the two previous income years. These people would have been entitled to a lower PIR but cannot receive a refund of overpaid tax on their PIE income. 16. One submission the Finance and Expenditure Committee received on the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Bill raises concerns that the Bill as introduced does not contain a proposal that will enable a refund for people who have overpaid PIE tax. It was submitted that a mechanism should be introduced to provide a form of refund for an over-taxed investor. Allowing for refunds of overpaid PIE tax 17. To achieve refundability of over-withheld PIE tax, I propose that all PIE income is squared up at the end of the tax year using the PIE investor’s correct PIR based on the information Inland Revenue holds about the previous two income years. This preserves the current PIR rates based on one of the previous two tax years, including the maximum tax rate for PIEs (including KiwiSaver PIEs) being 28% and the current thresholds for investors in these PIEs. 18. This means that PIE investors would have their PIE income squared up in a year-end process alongside their income tax square-up. Any PIE tax withheld during the tax year would be applied as a tax credit. 19. The outcome of the PIE tax square-up is offset against the result of the investor’s income tax square up (their residual income tax). This means any overpaid tax on PIE income will result in an income tax refund, increase the investor’s income tax refund or reduce their tax bill. Any underpayment of PIE tax will result in an income tax bill, increase the investor’s income tax bill or reduce their tax refund. If the correct PIR was used to withhold tax on the investor’s PIE income, the income tax result of the investor will remain unchanged. 20. For most individual investors this square up would happen automatically and they would not be required to do anything. It would be an automated process similar to and alongside the year-end auto-calculation process for income tax. The result would be an overall tax bill or refund. For the remaining investors the PIE income information Inland Revenue holds would be pre-populated into their income tax profile to be available when they file their income tax return. For them the PIE income calculation would happen alongside the income tax assessment once they have filed their tax return for the year. 21. I propose that this change will apply from the 2020-21 tax year. Simplifying the way a PIR is determined 22. Inland Revenue can already provide the PIR it considers appropriate for an investor directly to a PIE if Inland Revenue thinks the PIR the investor has notified is incorrect. 23. To simplify the way PIRs are determined for an investor in a PIE, I propose to provide Inland Revenue with the ability to proactively provide PIEs with their 4 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:01 IN CONFIDENCE investors’ PIRs during the tax year for existing investors and for new investors if Inland Revenue holds sufficient information to determine the PIR applicable for the tax year. This would result in most people being on the correct PIR and having correct PIE tax withheld from their PIE income. 24. For example, when a new employee is auto-enrolled in KiwiSaver, Inland Revenue would, upon being notified of the enrolment by the employer, calculate the new employee’s PIR. This would be based on the employee’s previous two years’ income information that Inland Revenue holds and the PIR would be provided to the relevant PIE. Inland Revenue would inform the investor of their calculated PIR and the fact that Inland Revenue has provided it to their PIE provider. 25. There are some limited circumstances where Inland Revenue is unable to provide a PIR: 25.1 Where Inland Revenue does not hold sufficient information to calculate an individual’s PIR for the tax year. For example, a person required to file a tax return has not filed their return for one of the previous two tax years; 25.2 Inland Revenue would not be aware of a new investor starting to invest in a non-KiwiSaver PIE until tax on the PIE income has been withheld and therefore could not proactively advise the PIR. However, investors in such PIEs are more likely to have a higher income and more likely to be on a 28% PIR, therefore over-taxation is less likely (although still possible). 26. I propose that this change will apply from 1 April 2020. 27. I have asked officials to start limited consultation with PIE entities on this proposal to allow enough time for them to adjust their systems. Student loan scheme changes Deferring withholding student loan repayments on certain payments 28. Changes to the student loan scheme planned as part of Release 4 of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme in April 2020 would require student loan repayments to be deducted from schedular, election-day, and casual agricultural income each payday. These changes were previously agreed by Cabinet \[SWC-18-MIN-0093 and CAB-18-MIN-0382 refer\]. They were included in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019-20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration and Remedial Matters) Act 2019 which was enacted on 26 June 2019. 29. Submissions on the policy proposals in the Making tax simpler – Better administration of social policy discussion document focussed mainly on the merits of the policy rather than compliance costs. Also, no submissions were received on the proposal as part of the Select Committee process. 30. In preparation for implementing these changes as part of Inland Revenue Business Transformation process, targeted consultation on the detailed design has been undertaken with employers who have advised that significant compliance costs would be incurred in implementing this change. This cost would be imposed at a time when employers are already facing a large number of changes as a result of earlier 5 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:01 IN CONFIDENCE Business Transformation releases. Inland Revenue is now reconsidering whether withholding of student loan repayments is the right approach for these sources of income or if there are other policy options that could minimise compliance issues for this group of borrowers. As a result, I recommend repealing the requirement for employers to deduct student loan repayments from schedular, election-day, and casual agricultural income each payday and instead rely on student loan repayments on these forms of income continuing to be made through the student loan interim payments mechanism (similar to provisional tax payments) during the year. Lowering the $1500 exemption for non-salary and wage income to $500 31. The student loan scheme currently has a $1500 exemption for non-salary and wage income for New Zealand-based borrowers, above the annual repayment threshold. Borrowers who earn less than $1500 of non-salary and wage income (including schedular, casual agricultural, and election day income) in a year are not required to notify Inland Revenue of this income for student loan purposes and do not have to make student loan repayments on it. If a borrower earns more than $1500 of non- salary and wage income, they are required to make repayments on the full amount. 32. This threshold was introduced when most salary and wage earners were not required to file a tax return and recognised the compliance costs associated with borrowers advising Inland Revenue of their income. Following changes to the administration of individual’s income tax, all taxpayers now either file a return or have their income tax automatically squared up at the end of the tax year. As a result, there is no longer a significant compliance cost for borrowers in advising Inland Revenue of their non-salary and wage income. I therefore recommend reducing the exemption limit from $1500 to $500. This would mean that a larger number of borrowers would be required to make repayments and if payments are made, these would reduce the term of the loan. However, if borrowers do not make payments, provisions in the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 allow unpaid amounts of less than $334 to be capitalised back onto the loan balance, so no borrowers whose total non- salary and wage income is between $500 and $1,500 will be subject to penalties if they do not make repayments. KiwiSaver changes 33. Cabinet previously agreed to a number of changes to enhance the administration of KiwiSaver as part of Business Transformation Release 4 \[DEV-19-MIN-0038.1 and CAB-19-MIN-0109 refer\], which have been included in the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans and Remedial Matters) Bill. I propose modifications to two of these changes, to ensure compliance costs to employers are minimised, at a time when they are already facing a number of changes as a result of earlier Business Transformation releases. Changing employee contribution rates 34. Cabinet agreed to allow KiwiSaver members to change their employee contribution rate through their KiwiSaver scheme provider or Inland Revenue (in addition to through their employer, which is the current process), from April 2020. This change would require employers to start deducting KiwiSaver contributions from employee’s salary or wages based on contribution rate changes advised by Inland Revenue. 6 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:01 IN CONFIDENCE 35. Targeted consultation in the lead up to Release 4 has indicated this would create additional compliance cost for employers. Submissions on the proposal to the Finance and Expenditure Committee considering the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Bill have been mixed – with some submitters noting the change would have compliance costs for employers, while others support the change on the basis it would improve the KiwiSaver member experience. Therefore, I propose deferring the application date of this change to 1 April 2022 or an earlier date to be set by Order in Council. This would enable officials to undertake further consultation with stakeholders and investigate approaches to minimise the compliance cost of this change on employers. Changes to KiwiSaver income and ESCT rate information required 36. Cabinet agreed to employers being required to provide the following information to Inland Revenue about new employees or existing employees where the information had changed since the employer last provided it: 36.1 the income amount members’ KiwiSaver contributions are calculated from; 1 and 36.2 an employee’s ESCT rate. 37. Further analysis of incorrect ESCT payments by employers indicates the problem may arise as a result of an employer not determining the correct ESCT rate in the first place rather than calculating the ESCT deduction incorrectly. Therefore, while collection of ESCT rates would make it easier for Inland Revenue to detect potential miscalculations of ESCT deductions, the compliance costs on employers outweigh these benefits. This view is consistent with concerns raised in three submissions to the Finance and Expenditure Commission on the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Bill, that did not support employers being required to report ESCT rates to Inland Revenue. Therefore, I propose that the requirement for employers to report ESCT rates to Inland Revenue should be removed from the bill and not enacted. 38. It is still proposed that employers provide Inland Revenue with information about the income amount members’ KiwiSaver contributions are calculated from for new employees. However, I propose employers should not be required to provide this information to Inland Revenue about existing employee’s where the information has changed since it was last reported. It would be more difficult for employers to provide information to Inland Revenue in this situation, as it could not be incorporated into new employee on-boarding processes. Moreover, as any differences between income for PAYE purposes and for KiwiSaver purposes generally does not change during the course of an employment relationship, collecting this information in relation to new employees only is likely to be sufficient for Inland Revenue to more effectively detect miscalculations of KiwiSaver contributions. 1 Some amounts that are included as income when calculating PAYE deductions are not treated as income for the purposes of calculating KiwiSaver contributions (such amounts include the value of accommodation, a benefit from an employer share scheme or a redundancy payment). 7 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:01 IN CONFIDENCE Consultation 39. The Treasury has been consulted on this paper. 40. The Ministry of Education has been consulted on the proposals relating to the student loan scheme changes and have no concerns regarding the proposals. Financial Implications PIE regime changes 41. The proposals relating to the PIE regime will have no fiscal cost if applied from 1 April 2020 and from the 2020-21 tax year. Enabling Inland Revenue to notify PIE providers of their investors’ PIRs is expected to result in PIE providers using the correct PIR for almost all their investors when withholding tax on their PIE income. The remaining fiscal cost would be immaterial. 42. Implementation and on-going administration costs, estimated at $1.5 million, will be met through baseline funding. Student Loans 43. The first change, to repeal withholding requirements, will not change a borrower’s student loan repayments as it maintains the status quo. The second change, to lower the $1,500 exemption threshold to $500 will have fairly minor positive impacts as repayments amounts are small and no penalties will be imposed on borrows for non-payment. Legislative Implications 44. Implementing these proposals requires changes to the Income Tax Act 2007, the Tax Administration Act 1994, the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 and the KiwiSaver Act 2006. 45. If approved, I propose including the legislative changes resulting from these recommendations in the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Bill which was introduced on 27 June 2019 and referred to the Finance and Expenditure Committee on 23 July 2019. The proposed amendments to give effect to the recommendations would be included in the report back version of the Bill. Impact Analysis Changes to PIE regime 46. The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the Changes to the PIE regimeRIA prepared by Inland Revenue, and considers that the information and analysis summarised in the RIA partially meets the quality assurance criteria. 47. In light of the time constraints on the policy development process that are identified in the Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis section, the reviewer considers that the information in the RIA is as complete as could be expected. However, the time constraint has limited the consultation to KiwiSaver PIEs. Wider public consultation including with other affected PIEs or PIE investors has not been carried out. Consequently, the reviewer cannot be sure that the full range of impacts have been identified or that the proposed option is the best option to address the problem and achieve the desired objectives. 8 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:01 IN CONFIDENCE Student loans 48. The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the Lowering the student loan repayment threshold for non-salary and wage income and repealing withholding changes for student loan income RIA prepared by Inland Revenue, and considers that the information and analysis summarised in the RIA partially meets the quality assurance criteria. 49. In light of the time constraints on the policy development process that are identified in the Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis section, the reviewer considers that the information in the RIA is as complete as could be expected. However, the time constraint has meant that public consultation particularly with affected parties has not been carried out. Consequently, the reviewer cannot be sure that the full range of impacts have been identified or that the preferred option is the best option to address the problem and achieve the desired objectives. KiwiSaver 50. A RIA was prepared to inform the Cabinet decisions made on 21 March 2019. I am now recommending that Cabinet make some changes to the proposal to address feedback that was subsequently received through targeted consultation (focus groups including KiwiSaver employers) and public submissions. Accordingly, the RIA has also been updated to reflect the revised proposal. The revised RIA is attached and the coversheet to this RIA analyses the recommended changes to the original proposal. 51. The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the attached Business Transformation related KiwiSaver refinements RIA prepared by Inland Revenue, and considers that the information and analysis summarised in the RIA meets the quality assurance criteria. Human Rights 52. There are no human rights implications as a result of the proposals in this paper. Gender Implications 53. The proposals in this paper are gender neutral. Disability Perspective 54. There are no specific disability implications as a result of the proposals in this paper. Publicity 55. I propose to announce the changes contained in this cabinet paper once the Finance and Expenditure Committee has reported back the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Bill. Inland Revenue will include details of the new legislation in a Tax Information Bulletinafter the Bill is enacted. Proactive Release 56. I propose to delay the proactive release of this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers until the Finance and Expenditure Committee has reported back the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Bill which is due 24 January 2020. 9 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:01 IN CONFIDENCE Recommendations The Minister of Revenue recommends that the Cabinet Economic Development Committee: 1. agree that all PIE investors should have their PIE income squared up at the end of the tax year using their correct PIR, which is based on the information Inland Revenue holds for the investor’s two previous tax years, with the result forming part of their income tax outcome for that year 2. agree that the amendments recommended in 1 apply from the 2020-21 tax year 3. agree that Inland Revenue should provide PIE entities with the correct PIR for their investors during the income year for existing PIE investors and for new investors in PIEs if sufficient information is available to Inland Revenue with application from 1 April 2020 4. note that on 8 August 2018, the Cabinet Social Wellbeing Committee (SWC) agreed to amendments to require student loan deductions from withholding income \[SWC-18-MIN-0093, paragraph 4\] 5. agree to recommend that Cabinet rescind the decision referred to in recommendation 4; and instead 6. agree to repeal the changes requiring student loan repayments to be deducted from schedular, election-day, and casual agricultural income with effect from 1 April 2020 7. agree that the $1500 student loans scheme exemption for non-salary and wage income for New Zealand-based borrowers, above the annual repayment threshold, be lowered to $500 8. agree that the application date of the change to allow KiwiSaver members to change their employee contributions rate through their KiwiSaver scheme provider or Inland Revenue be deferred until 1 April 2022 or an earlier date to be set by Order in Council. 9. note that on 21 March 2019, the Cabinet Economic Development Committee (DEV) agreed that employers be required to provide the following information to Inland Revenue about new employees and existing employees where this information has changed the income amount members’ contributions are calculated from; and an employee’s employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) rate \[DEV-19-MIN-0038.1 and CAB-19-MIN-0109\] 10. agree to recommend that Cabinet rescind the decision referred to in recommendation 9; and instead 10 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:01 IN CONFIDENCE 11. agree that employers be required to report information to Inland Revenue about the income KiwiSaver members’ contributions are calculated from for new employees 12. agree that the proposed amendments be included in the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Bill for the Finance and Expenditure Committee’s consideration 13. invite the Minister of Revenue to instruct Inland Revenue and Parliamentary Counsel Office to draft legislation to give effect to the policy proposals and their intent contained in this paper 14. note that this Cabinet paper, the associated Cabinet minute, and key advice papers will be proactively released on Inland Revenue’s website once the Finance and Expenditure Committee has reported back the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Bill to Parliament.

This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final decisions to proceed with a policy change to be taken by or on behalf of Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis Timing The system development and testing required to make changes to the Inland Revenue tax administration system START mean that decisions need to be made in advance of the time these changes take effect from. In order for the proposed changes to be able to take effect for the 2019-20 tax year, it is necessary to include any changes in a tax bill at the earliest opportunity. The Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Bill (the KiwiSaver Bill) is currently before the Finance and Expenditure Committee (FEC) and submitters have raised the issue of non-refundability of overpaid PIE tax under the current rules. To ensure that policy decisions are taken, and legislation passed in this timeframe, this has created a constraint on the time available to analyse options. Despite this, officials are confident that the proposed approach would be the most effective option to address the problem definition. Consultation and testing Inland Revenue has undertaken targeted consultation with PIEs (mainly KiwiSaver scheme providers) in relation to a related proposal already in the KiwiSaver Bill. However, as a result of time constraints, wider public consultation has not been carried out. Assumptions underpinning impact analysis Assumptions have been made in estimating the number of people who are likely to change their prescribed investor rates (PIRs) as a result of Inland Revenue’s administrative actions. These assumptions have been based on the amount of PIE tax an investor has over- or underpaid and general behavioural assumptions. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:06 3A. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 2 IN CONFIDENCE Responsible Manager (signature and date): Mike Nutsford Policy Lead Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 18 September 2019 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:06 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 3 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 2 : Pro b le m de fin itio n an d o bjec tiv es 2.1 What is the policy problem or opportunity? The PIE tax rules apply to collective investment vehicles where investors combine resources to make different types of passive investments, for example a managed fund. There are several types of PIEs, each with different tax requirements. In practice most PIEs are multi- rate PIEs. A multi-rate PIE attributes income, losses and tax credits to investors. The tax rate applied to these types of PIEs varies from investor to investor. There are locked-in PIEs where the funds are locked into the scheme (for example all KiwiSaver PIEs and some other locked-in retirement schemes and superannuation funds) and other PIEs that are not locked in. Under current law, a person investing in a multi-rate PIE elects a tax rate, referred to as their PIR, which approximates their marginal tax rate based on (the lower of) one of the previous two tax years. A person’s marginal tax rate is the tax rate that applies to the last dollar they earn. If a person earns more than $70,000 their marginal tax rate would be 33%. However, while marginal income tax rates can be up to 33%, PIE rates are capped at 28%. The investor notifies their elected PIR to their PIE providers. The PIE provider pays tax on the investment income of each investor based on the PIR the investor has notified. If an investor does not provide their PIE with their elected PIR, they default to the highest PIR of 28%. There are three PIRs: 10.5%, 17.5% and 28%. To determine the correct PIR, an investor in a PIE needs to look at what their taxable income and their PIE income were for the last two income years before the tax year in which the PIR is to be applied. If they have considered the two previous income years and would qualify for two different rates, the PIR is the lower rate. The following table outlines how to work out the PIR to be applied to PIE income: Taxable income (in either of the last two income years) was... and the total income Taxable income plus PIE income (in either of the last two income years) was... before the relevant tax year for ... the PIR is ... $0 – $14,000 $0 - $14,000 Either year 10.5% $0 – $14,000 $14,001 - $48,000 Either year 10.5% $48,001 - $70,000 Either year 17.5% $14,001 – $48,000 Up to $48,000 Either year 17.5% $48,001 or more Over $48,000, but under $70,000 Both years 28% Any amount $70,001 or more Both years 28% When the correct PIR has been used or where a too high rate has been used, the income from PIE investment is excluded income 1 , which means it is a final tax and the PIE income does not flow through to the investors’ individual income tax return and assessment. 1 Certain types of income are expressly treated as “excluded income” by specific provisions of the Income Tax Act 2007. Excluded income is omitted from a person’s calculation of income tax for an income year. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:06 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 4 IN CONFIDENCE Therefore, where an investor has elected a rate that is too high, or they have defaulted to the highest PIR but could have elected a lower PIR, the overpaid tax on their PIE income can’t be refunded. To use a PIR below 28% and therefore potentially be affected by the non- refundability, people must have had taxable income of less than $48,000 in at least one of the two previous income years. However, where tax on PIE income has been underpaid because the investor has notified a rate that is too low, the PIE income ceases to be excluded income and is required to be included in the investor’s income. It is taxed at the investor’s marginal tax rate. A tax credit is given for the PIE tax that has already been paid. This is intended to incentivise the investor to notify the correct PIR as they can be subject to a marginal tax rate of up to 33%, while the top PIR is capped at 28%. The difference between the treatment of over- and underpaid PIE tax raises equity concerns, in particular in relation to the non-refundability of overpaid tax on PIE income. Data analysis enabled by Inland Revenue’s new technology platform START estimates that approximately 1.5 million people have used incorrect PIRs for the year ended 31 March 2019. Inland Revenue is working on a range of administrative initiatives to help ensure people are on the correct PIRs. This involves proactively contacting investors who are on an incorrect rate and suggesting they contact their PIE provider to change their rate. Under current legislation Inland Revenue has the power to notify a PIE provider of the PIR that should be used where someone has notified the wrong rate. However, because of the way the legislation is worded, this is limited to people who have notified their PIE provider of their rate as opposed to people who have not provided a rate and therefore have defaulted to a 28% rate. Inland Revenue is unable to determine from the information held in its systems, whether a person on a 28% rate has notified that rate or defaulted to it and therefore cannot notify PIE providers of the PIR for anyone on the 28% rate. Change currently proposed in the KiwiSaver Bill A legislative change proposed in the KiwiSaver Bill, which is currently being considered by the Finance and Expenditure Committee, would allow Inland Revenue, when it holds sufficient information about an investor’s income for the previous two income years, to directly notify the PIE provider of the PIR that should be used in all cases where an incorrect PIR is being used. This proposed change would apply from 1 April 2020. This change will not remove the issue that overpaid PIE tax is not refundable. Inland Revenue advising the PIE provider directly to change to a correct rate where Inland Revenue systems identify that an incorrect PIR is used is expected to significantly reduce the numbers of people on a wrong rate (too high or too low). However, there will still be some situations where an incorrect PIR is used resulting in over- or underpayment of tax. For example, where people who have to provide income information to Inland Revenue have an extension of time to provide that information, they may not be required to provide that additional information until 31 March of the following year. This information could be received too late to allow Inland Revenue to take it into account when providing PIRs to PIE providers. This could mean that their PIR was only based on the earlier of the two relevant previous. If they earned less income in the more recent year, they might be entitled to use a lower PIR 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:06 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 5 IN CONFIDENCE than the one Inland Revenue might be able to provide. Without legislative change Inland Revenue would not be able to provide a refund in those cases. Also, for new members of PIEs , there would have to be one incidence of using a wrong PIR for the new investor, before Inland Revenue could determine that the rate used is incorrect and can notify the PIE of the correct PIR. When an investor exits a PIE, this triggers a calculation and payment of their PIE tax at that time. There is a risk that some investors could exit from their PIE investment before the correct rate had been able to be provided by Inland Revenue and could over- or underpay PIE tax. There is also a small risk that Inland Revenue could provide an incorrect PIR if it held incorrect information. This should only happen when a person has not provided required information. 2.2 Who is affected and how? Inland Revenue Inland Revenue cannot currently refund overpaid PIE tax and has limited ability to provide correct PIRs to PIE providers. PIEs PIEs are not currently provided with correct PIRs by Inland Revenue. They are often not notified of their investors’ PIRs and therefore have to use the 28% default rate. PIE investors PIE investors are currently required to notify their PIE provider of their correct PIR. This requirement is not effective for a large number of PIE investors. Rather than changing PIE investor behaviour, it is more effective to widen Inland Revenue’s ability to directly provide PIRS to PIE providers and for PIE providers to use the provided rate. 2.3 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? No constraints were identified. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:06 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 6 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 3: O p tio n s id e n tifica tio n 3.1 What options have been considered? The following criteria were used to assess the options considered: • Equity: the option should ensure that all PIE investors pay the correct amount of tax on their PIE income. • Sustainability: the option should ensure that the PIE regime is certain and predictable for both PIE providers and investors. The PIE regime should be seen as being fair for investors. • Compliance: compliance cost should be minimised for investors and PIE providers as far as possible. • Administration: implementation and administration costs for Government departments should be minimised as far as possible. Option 1: Status quo Should the proposed legislative change already in the KiwiSaver Bill be enacted, this would enable Inland Revenue to advise PIE providers directly to change to a correct rate where Inland Revenue systems identify that an incorrect PIR is used. This is expected to significantly reduce the number of people on a wrong rate (too high or too low). Some PIE investors would still have incorrect PIE tax deducted before Inland Revenue could determine the PIR used is incorrect and advise the PIE provider of the correct PIR to be used for their investors. The status quo would not remove the issue that some PIE investors would have been on the wrong PIR and may have overpaid PIE tax. Any amount of overpaid PIE tax would continue to not be refundable. The inconsistent treatment of under- and overpaid PIE tax under the current law is not equitable and the difference potentially threatens the sustainability of the PIE tax regime can be thought of as being unfair. The status quo does involve some increase in compliance and administrative costs compared to previous years due to Inland Revenue providing PIRs directly to PIE providers where people are on incorrect PIRs (and notifying people that their PIR has been changed) and the need for PIE providers to process increased numbers of PIR change requests. Option 2: Mirror the existing treatment of underpayment of PIE tax for overpaid PIE tax This option would mirror the existing legislative rules for PIE investors who have notified their PIE provider with a rate for their PIE income which is lower than their correct PIR. This would mean that if an incorrect rate had been used, either lower or higher, the PIE income would cease to be excluded income. The income would then be required to be included in the individual investors’ income tax return. It would be taxed at the investor’s marginal tax rate for the tax year. A tax credit would be given for the PIE tax that has already been paid. This option would in some cases result in an inequitable outcome. This is because while the PIR approximates the investor’s marginal tax rate, it is based on (the lower of) one of the 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:06 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 7 IN CONFIDENCE previous two tax years. In some cases an investor who has their PIE income taxed at their current year’s marginal tax rate because they have overpaid the tax on their PIE income using a too high PIR, may still have a tax bill when their marginal tax rate is higher than both their correct PIR and the rate used. As well as being inequitable, the cases where a person would have to pay more tax at their marginal tax rate when they had been on too high a PIR could also reduce the sustainability of the PIE regime. Potential media coverage of such situations could reduce public and political trust in the PIE regime. This option would be more complex to implement in Inland Revenue’s systems than option 3 due to the need to identify where a person has been on an incorrect rate before making the adjustment to their taxable income. It would therefore have a level of additional administrative cost (this cost hasn’t been estimated). As with all options, there would also be some increase in compliance and administrative costs compared to previous years. This is due to Inland Revenue providing PIRs directly to PIE providers where people are on incorrect PIRs (and notifying people that their PIR has been changed) and the need for PIE providers to process increased numbers of PIR change requests. Option 3: Ability to proactively provide PIRs to PIES effective from 1 April 2020 and a year-end square-up a. with application of the year-end square-up from the 2019-20 tax year b. with application of the year-end square-up from the 2020-21 tax year This option would enable Inland Revenue to pro-actively provide PIRs for all investors to the PIE providers where Inland Revenue holds sufficient information to determine the PIR applicable for the tax year. Inland Revenue would also advise the investors that their PIR had been changed. This would mean that investors would largely be placed on the correct PIR which PIE providers would use to calculate tax during the tax year. There would still be a risk that some investors could exit from their PIE investment before the correct rate had been able to be provided. These investors could under- or overpay PIE tax. There is also a risk that Inland Revenue could possibly provide an incorrect PIR if it held incorrect information. An additional year-end square-up applying the correct PIRs would address any over- or underpayment of PIE tax during the tax year. All PIE income would have the correct PIR applied to it in the year-end square-up, regardless of whether it has been correctly, over- or under-withheld during the tax year. It would not be relevant whether a correct, too low or too high PIR has been notified. This would be a change compared to the current treatment for investors who have notified a PIR that is too low, as their PIE income would no longer be subject to their marginal tax rates, but to their correct PIR. The year-end square-up would involve Inland Revenue taking a person’s PIE income and applying their correct PIR to it to determine the PIE tax payable. The PIE tax that had been deducted would be a tax credit against the PIE tax payable. Any refund due or tax payable would be added to the person’s end of year tax position and would either be refunded, 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:06 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 8 IN CONFIDENCE payable or reduce the person’s tax payable. For most individual investors the square-up would happen automatically and they would not be required to do anything. It would be an automated process similar to and alongside the year end auto-calculation process for income tax. Investors would have additional PIE information added to their income profile information. For investors who are required to file an income tax return, the PIE income information Inland Revenue holds would be pre-populated into their income tax profile to be available when they file their income tax return. For them the PIE income calculation would happen alongside the income tax process once they have filed their tax return for the tax year. While the timing of the PIE square-up would be aligned with that of the general income tax year-end process for each individual, the PIE square-up would be a separate process, using current PIRs and thresholds. That is, a PIE square-up would be undertaken and the difference, if any, would be included in the income tax year-end process. The difference would either increase a person’s refund, reduce tax payable, reduce the refund or increase the amount payable. Refunds would be made directly to the individual investors and not to the PIEs. Similarly, PIE tax payable would be paid by the investor and not out of their PIE funds. The PIE square-up would not affect a person’s provisional tax liability. This is because any PIE tax payable or refundable would be added after the calculation of the person’s residual income tax (which is the basis for a person’s provisional tax liability). The first measure would get most people onto the correct PIR before any PIE tax is deducted during the tax year. In situations where this did not occur the second measure, the year-end square-up, would ensure that the person still only paid the correct amount of PIE tax. The combination of the two measures, therefore, gives the most equitable outcome. This option would preserve the current PIRs based on one of the previous two tax years, including the maximum tax rate for PIEs being 28% and the current thresholds for investors in these PIEs. It would also ensure that all people are taxed at their correct PIR so would give consistent and understandable outcomes. These factors support the sustainability of the PIE regime. This option would involve some initial compliance costs as the PIE providers would have to adjust their systems to be able to receive and apply PIRs from Inland Revenue in more situations than just for corrected PIRs where the rate the investor had notified is incorrect. This is not expected to be materially greater than the additional compliance costs that would be caused under the status quo and option 2 by Inland Revenue providing PIRs directly to PIE providers where people are on incorrect PIRs and notifying people that their PIR has been changed and the need for PIE providers to process increased numbers of PIR change requests. There would be some one-off administrative costs in developing the year end square-up which Inland Revenue will absorb within existing Business Transformation baselines. Option 3 a This sub-option would ensure that these benefits would apply to the current tax year (2019- 20). Inland Revenue’s current efforts to notify people that they are on incorrect PIRs would reduce the number of PIE investors on an incorrect PIR but would still leave a large number 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:06 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 9 IN CONFIDENCE of people on incorrect rates during the 2019-20 tax year. Officials have estimated that approximately 830,000 people would still be on a rate that is too high. The proposed year-end square-up would have a one-off fiscal cost if applied from the 2019- 20 tax year. This is because it would correct the PIE tax position for the 830,000 people estimated to be on a rate that is too high. This sub-option would have immaterial fiscal costs for the following years as the changes already in the KiwiSaver Bill that would allow Inland Revenue to inform PIE providers of the correct PIRs for their investors would mean that almost all PIE investors will be on the correct PIR in the 2020-21 tax year. Option 3 b This sub-option would mean that approximately 830,000 people (who have earnt less than $48,000 of taxable income in one of the two previous income years) would pay too much PIE tax in the 2019-20 tax year without the ability to get the overpaid tax refunded. As such it is less equitable than sub-option 3 a. If the PIR changes are enacted with application from 1 April 2020, Inland Revenue would be able to significantly reduce the number of PIE investors on an incorrect rate for their PIE income during the 2020-21 tax year. This would mean that the application of the year-end square-up to that tax year would not have an effect on many people and therefore would have immaterial fiscal costs. 3.2 Which of these options is the proposed approach? The preferred approach is option 3 a which: • Provides Inland Revenue with the ability to proactively provide PIEs with their investor’s PIRs during the tax year where Inland Revenue holds sufficient information to determine the PIR applicable for the tax year. • Square up all PIE income at the end of the tax year using the PIE investors’ correct PIR based on the information Inland Revenue holds about the previous two income years with application from the 2019-20 tax year. Of the considered options, option 3 a would be most effective in assuring that people are on the correct PIR and refunds of overpaid PIE tax for people on PIRs that were too high are allowed. It is also the most coherent and equitable option as it will ensure that most investors have the correct amount of tax deducted from their PIE income from the start. All investors will pay the correct amount of tax on their PIE income through a year-end square-up process, including those who have over- or under-paid tax during the year. Option 3 b would mean that approximately 830,000 people (who have earnt less than $48,000 of taxable income in one of the two previous income years) would pay too much PIE tax in the 2019-20 tax year without the ability to get the overpaid tax refunded. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:06 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 10 IN CONFIDENCE Option 3 a would address unfairness concerns for the current tax year, however it does have a one-off fiscal cost. It is the option that is the least complex and is therefore easiest to understand for investors, as all PIE income, whether correctly, over-, or undertaxed, has the same year-end process. It is the option that is easiest to implement in Inland Revenue systems. Officials recommend option 3 a as it gives an equitable outcome for PIE investors and has manageable compliance and administrative costs given the benefits being delivered. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:06 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 11 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 4: Imp ac t An a ly s is (Pr opo se d ap pr oa ch) 4.1 Summary table of costs and benefits Affected parties (identify) Comment: nature of cost or benefit (eg ongoing, one-off), evidence and assumption (eg compliance rates), risks Impact $m present value, for monetised impacts; high, medium or low for non- monetised impacts Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties (PIE providers, PIE investors ) PIE providers PIE providers may have to adjust their systems to be able to receive and apply their investors’ PIRs provided by Inland Revenue as opposed to current law where they would only be required to receive PIRs from Inland Revenue for those investors that have notified them with an incorrect rate or have defaulted onto the default PIR and could have elect a lower rate.

Low 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:06 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 14 IN CONFIDENCE 4.2 What other impacts is this approach likely to have? Where an investor in a locked in PIE such as KiwiSaver went back to their PIE provider and asked to be put back on a PIR that was too high, the year-end square up would enable them to get a refund of money that should have remained in their locked-in PIE investment. While this is a cash in hand benefit for the investor it is also a future disadvantage for them as it will reduce their retirement savings and it undermines the reason for their PIE fund being locked- in. Investors may go back and may notify a lower rate than their correct PIR to their PIE provider to receive a time value of money advantage during the year until the end-of-year square-up. Previously investors were incentivised not to notify a rate that is too low, as in those cases the PIE income becomes part of the investor’s income tax assessment and is then taxed at the investor’s marginal tax rate. A person’s marginal tax rate is the tax rate that applies to the last dollar they earn. If a person earns more than $70,000 their marginal tax rate would be 33% (whereas the top PIR is 28%). Notifying a lower PIR than the correct PIR would mean that more money would be paid into the person’s PIE investment but also that they would subsequently have to pay more tax at the end of the year. If the PIE was a locked in PIE, such as KiwiSaver, they would effectively be making a further contribution to their retirement savings as they would have to fund the PIE tax that they would have to pay at the end of the year from their other income. Officials propose to monitor whether people are manipulating the rules to their advantage to determine whether any specific action is required to prevent this. Sec tio n 5: Stak e h old er vie ws 5.1 What do stakeholders think about the problem and the proposed solution? Inland Revenue has undertaken targeted consultation with KiwiSaver PIE providers around the initial proposal to widen the ability to provide PIRs for all PIE investors where Inland Revenue holds sufficient information. PIE providers are generally supportive of the proposal to enable Inland Revenue to provide PIEs with their investor’s correct PIR. As previously stated, this is widening the Commissioner’s existing ability to provide the PIE with their investor’s correct PIR where the investor has notified the PIE with an incorrect rate. However, submissions by PIE providers and their representatives to the Finance and Expenditure Committee in response to the proposal on correcting PIRs already contained in the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Bill highlight the need for sufficient lead in time to allow PIEs to change their systems to incorporate rate changes notified by Inland Revenue. General consultation with PIE investors has not been undertaken. However, the proposals are beneficial to PIE investors as most investors will have tax on their PIE income deducted 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:06 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 15 IN CONFIDENCE using their correct PIR and all investors will have their PIE tax squared for a tax year using their PIR. Media attention in mid-2019 and a Parliamentary petition also raised fairness concerns around the non-refundability of overpaid tax on PIE income. The Parliamentary petition also requests, amongst other points, to place an annual obligation on Inland Revenue to notify all KiwiSaver PIE providers what their members’ PIRs should be. The main concern the petition is trying to address is that many New Zealanders (particularly those auto-enrolled into KiwiSaver) are over-taxed and unaware. At the time this Regulatory Impact Assessment was written, the petition was still open for signatures and had 348 signatures. One submission to the Finance and Expenditure Committee on the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Bill suggests that a mechanism should be introduced to provide a form of refund for an over-taxed PIE investor. The Treasury have been consulted on the proposals and support them. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:06 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 16 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 6: Imp le men ta tio n a n d op er a tio n 6.1 How will the new arrangements be given effect? The proposals would require amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. One submission the Finance and Expenditure Committee received on the KiwiSaver Bill raises concerns that as introduced it does not contain a proposal that will enable a refund for people who have overpaid PIE tax. It was submitted that a mechanism should be introduced to provide a form of refund for an over-taxed investor. Amendments to the KiwiSaver Bill would be proposed in the officials’ report to the Finance and Expenditure Committee for the Committee’s consideration. However, this will not allow for public opportunity to comment. The changes would come into effect from 1 April 2020. This would align with the date the proposal on allowing the Commissioner to correct all PIRs contained in the KiwiSaver Bill as introduced which was timed to align with the transfer of the administration of KiwiSaver from Inland Revenue’s FIRST operating system into its new START operating system. Inland Revenue would proactively advise PIE providers of the correct PIRs for their customers on incorrect PIRs. The PIE providers would need to be able to receive and apply the PIRs and this is likely to mean that PIE providers will need to make systems changes. Inland Revenue has begun discussions with PIE providers about how the correct PIR information could be provided and will work with PIE providers to ensure that the information is passed in a way that can be used by them. The square-up of PIE tax would apply from the 2019-20 tax year and would happen for the first time around June 2020 for individuals who do not have to file a tax return. For all others the PIE tax square-up will happen when they file a tax return and their income tax assessment is completed. The square-up would not require any change to the information that is currently being provided by PIE providers. The Minister of Revenue would make an announcement, on the proposal when the Finance and Expenditure Committee has reported back the KiwiSaver Bill. Inland Revenue would be responsible for the on-going administration of the new arrangements. Aligning implementation of the proposals with Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme and annual income tax refresh, would mean the cost of system changes would be absorbed into existing Business Transformation baselines. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:06 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 17 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 7 : M o n itor in g, ev a lua tio n a n d re v ie w 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? Inland Revenue would monitor the outcomes of the proposals pursuant to the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTTP) to confirm that they match the policy objectives. Inland Revenue already collects data on PIE income and tax paid on that income. This data would be used to assess the effectiveness of the changes. The number of year-end square-ups that gave rise to an amount of PIE tax payable or refundable would show the effectiveness of the proposed changes to get PIE investors on the correct PIRs. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? The final step in the GTTP is the implementation and review stage, which involves post- implementation review of legislation, and the identification of remedial issues. Post- implementation review is expected to occur around 12 months after implementation. In relation to KiwiSaver PIEs, all KiwiSaver scheme providers have an on-going relationship with Inland Revenue, which includes an annual meeting to discuss policy and operational issues that have arisen over the past year. This would provide an opportunity for scheme providers to give feedback about the effectiveness of the proposed approach to providing them with their investor’s PIR. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:06 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 1 IN CONFIDENCE Cover page: revised proposal Summary of revised proposal The original version of the attached impact summary entitled, Business Transformation related KiwiSaver refinements, was prepared to inform Cabinet decisions made on 21 March 2019. The RIA proposed a number of KiwiSaver administrative refinements to form part of Release 4 of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme. Subsequent concerns raised by stakeholders about the employer compliance costs of certain proposals, have resulted in officials revising the impact of these proposals and recommending the following changes: •deferring KiwiSaver members being able to change their contribution rate through their scheme provider or Inland Revenue to 1 April 2022 or an earlier date set by Order in Council; •removing the change requiring employers to report an employee’s employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) rate to Inland Revenue; and •only requiring employers to report to Inland Revenue the income KiwiSaver contributions are calculated from for new employees (the attached regulatory analysis proposed this information be reported for existing employees where it had changed since it was reported, in addition to new employees). All other aspects of the proposed approach remain unchanged, and the re-assessment below relates only to the proposals that officials are recommending changes to. The attached RIA has also been updated to reflect the revised recommendations. Problem definition Stakeholders have raised concerns about employer compliances costs in relation to the proposals to allow KiwiSaver members to change their contribution rate through their scheme provider or Inland Revenue (as this would require employers to apply contribution rates advised by Inland Revenue) and the proposals to require employers to report ESCT rates and KiwiSaver income information to Inland Revenue, for new employees and existing employees where this information has changed. Concerns raised about additional compliance costs on employers hold particular weight at this time, given the number of earlier Business Transformation changes that are currently bedding in with employers (for example payday filing, which became compulsory for employers to comply with from 1 April 2019). Officials have also undertaken further analysis of the issue of incorrect ESCT payments by employers, which has indicated the problem may often arise as a result of an employer not determining the correct ESCT rate in the first place, rather than calculating the ESCT deduction incorrectly. As a result, the benefit of collecting ESCT rate information may not be as significant as officials originally considered it to be. Options considered Option A: proceed with all proposals agreed to by Cabinet on 21 March 2019 Under this option no changes would be made to the proposals previously agreed to by Cabinet. This would be undesirable as it would result in concerns about employer compliance costs not being addressed. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:13 3B. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 2 IN CONFIDENCE Option B: do not proceed with proposals Under this option both the contribution rate change and employer reporting requirement proposals would not be proceeded with. This outcome would be undesirable as it would not address the issues raised in the problem definition in the attached RIA about improving existing information flows to help ensure KiwiSaver members are receiving their correct contribution entitlements and giving members more flexibility about how they change their contribution rate. Removing the proposal to allow members to change their contribution rates through a scheme provider or Inland Revenue, would also not recognise this change has received positive feedback from the KiwiSaver industry and KiwiSaver members. Option C: modify proposals to minimise compliance costs and allow for further stakeholder engagement The application date of the proposal to allowing members to change their contribution rate through their scheme provider or Inland Revenue would be deferred until 1 April 2022 (or an earlier date set by Order in Council). Deferring the application date would enable officials to undertake further consultation with stakeholders to explore concerns raised in more detail and to investigate operational processes that would minimise the compliance cost of this change on employers. The proposal to require employers to report employees’ ESCT rates to Inland Revenue would be removed from the Bill. Based on feedback received about the compliance cost of this change for employers, in addition to the fact further analysis has indicated the root of the problem may not be employers miscalculating ESCT deductions, officials now consider the costs of this change to employers is likely outweigh the benefits to Inland Revenue. Under this option employers would also only be required to report to Inland Revenue the income KiwiSaver contributions are calculated from for new employees (not for existing employee’s where this information has changed since last reported, as was previously proposed). Employer compliance costs would be minimised, as this information would be provided on a “one-off” basis, as part of existing new employee on-boarding processes. While it would still ensure Inland Revenue received the benefit of KiwiSaver income information, which could be used to identify miscalculation of contributions. Proposed approach For the reasons outlined above, the proposed approach is Option C. Stakeholder views The original RIA noted that limited consultation had been a constraint on decision making. The proposal has been revised to incorporate feedback that was subsequently received through targeted consultation (focus groups including employers) and public submissions received by Select Committee. These changes are described in option C above and are expected to reduce compliance costs compared to the original proposal. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:13 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 3 IN CONFIDENCE Impact Summary: Business Transformation related KiwiSaver refinements Sec tio n 1 : G en er a l in fo r ma tion Purpose Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Statement, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final decisions to proceed with policy changes to be taken by or on behalf of Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis Timing To maximise the administrative efficiencies of the proposals, changes need to align with Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation timelines for transferring KiwiSaver into its new administrative system. KiwiSaver is scheduled to be transferred into START on 1 April 2020. To ensure that policy decisions are taken, and legislation passed in this timeframe, this has created a constraint on the time available to analyse options. Despite this, officials are confident that the proposed approach would be the most effective option to address the problem definition. Consultation and testing Inland Revenue has undertaken targeted consultation with KiwiSaver scheme providers. However, as a result of time constraints, wider public consultation was not carried out prior to original Cabinet decisions being made in March 2019. Due to the largely technical administrative nature of the changes proposed, they are unlikely to have generated public interest. Moreover, taken as a whole, the package of options proposed would be beneficial to KiwiSaver members. There would be some compliance costs for employers (they would be required to communicate information they already hold to Inland Revenue, on a one-off basis and apply KiwiSaver employee contribution rates advised by Inland Revenue). Targeted consultation with employers was undertaken subsequent to March 2019 Cabinet decisions being made. Feedback from this consultation has informed officials revising the assessment of certain proposals. Assumptions underpinning impact analysis In relation the proposal to guarantee employer contributions, additional funding is not expected to be required. The primary caveat to this is that it assumes static behaviour. If the introduction of the proposal created a behavioural change amongst employers (that is it results in more unpaid employer contributions), this would increase the fiscal cost of the proposed approach. However, given that levels of employer contribution debt are currently comparable to levels of employee contribution debt (which are already guaranteed), this suggests that the proposal should not have a significant impact on employer’s behaviour. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:13 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 4 IN CONFIDENCE Responsible Manager (signature and date): Chris Gillion Policy Lead Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 12 September 2019 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:13 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 5 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 2 : Pro b le m de finitio n an d o bjec tiv es 2.1 What is the policy problem or opportunity? As part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme, the administration of KiwiSaver is scheduled to be transferred from its current system to its new administration system on 1 April 2020. This provides an opportunity to make refinements to KiwiSaver settings to improve administrative efficiency and enhance members’ experience with the scheme. The following are areas that would assist in achieving these outcomes: • facilitating the faster transfer of contributions from Inland Revenue to KiwiSaver scheme providers (and between scheme providers); and • improving information flows between members, employers, scheme providers and Inland Revenue. Transfer of contributions Part of Inland Revenue’s role as the central administrator for KiwiSaver, involves receiving KiwiSaver employer and employee contributions from employers and then forwarding these contributions on to KiwiSaver scheme providers. A reduction in the time taken to transfer contributions would improve the efficiency of the central administration of KiwiSaver. Payday filing reforms, which become compulsory from 1 April 2019, will result in Inland Revenue having employer information sooner after a payday (within 2 days of a payday for large employers and with 10 days for smaller employers). This will include information about KiwiSaver employee and employer contributions. The reforms will allow KiwiSaver employee contributions to be passed to scheme providers sooner after a member’s payday. This is because current KiwiSaver settings permit the use of Crown funds to pay employee contributions to scheme providers before contribution amounts have been paid to Inland Revenue by employers (effectively creating a Government guarantee of employee contributions). This Government guarantee does not currently extend to employer contributions. To ensure that the benefits of Inland Revenue being in receipt of earlier payday information are fully realised in relation to KiwiSaver, this RIA considers how to enable Inland Revenue to forward employer contribution amounts to scheme providers as soon as payday reporting information from employers has been received, rather than having to wait until the employer has actually paid the amount of the contribution to Inland Revenue (the current state). This RIA also considers other refinements that would facilitate the faster transfer of contributions. Improving information flows Inland Revenue is in the unique position of having on-going contact with KiwiSaver scheme providers and employers. This means Inland Revenue is able to facilitate the flow of information between relevant KiwiSaver parties (employers, providers and members) and also should have access to information to ensure that members are receiving the correct KiwiSaver contribution entitlements. However, in some instances, Inland Revenue does not have access to sufficient information to effectively police the accuracy of contribution 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:13 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 6 IN CONFIDENCE amounts received from employers. This RIA considers refinements that could be made to improve existing KiwiSaver information flows, to help ensure that KiwiSaver members are receiving their correct contribution entitlements. Consideration is also given to how information flows could be utilised to give members increased flexibility (for example whether the application process for changing an employee contribution rate could be simplified for members). 2.2 Who is affected and how? KiwiSaver members Taken as a whole, KiwiSaver members would benefit from the package of proposals – the changes would result in them earning market investment returns on contributions sooner, help ensure they are receiving the correct contribution amounts and give them additional flexibility in respect of how they can change their contribution rate. KiwiSaver scheme providers KiwiSaver scheme providers would benefit from the faster transfer of contributions, as it would result in them having more funds under management. Schemes have also indicated enabling KiwiSaver contribution rates to be changed through providers, would enhance member-provider relationships. Employers Helping to ensure members are receiving correct contribution amounts, would result in employers being required to communicate some additional information they should already hold to Inland Revenue. While the proposal enabling KiwiSaver members to change their contribution rate through their scheme provider or Inland Revenue, would require employers to deduct employee contributions from salary and wages at rates advised by Inland Revenue. These changes would create additional compliance costs for employers. Inland Revenue The proposals would enhance Inland Revenue’s central administration of KiwiSaver and create administrative savings. As implementation of the proposals would be aligned with Business Transformation, there would be no additional implementation costs. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:13 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 7 IN CONFIDENCE 2.3 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making?

The following criteria were used to assess the options considered: • Compliance: compliance costs should be minimised as far as possible. • Administration: administrative costs should be minimised as far as possible. • Equity: the option should ensure that KiwiSaver members are receiving the correct contribution amounts. • Sustainability: the option should be consistent with wider KiwiSaver settings. Option One: Status quo Administration: The status quo would not reduce administrative costs. Compliance: The status quo would not reduce compliance costs. Equity: The status quo results in some KiwiSaver members not receiving employer contributions that other members are receiving (as a result of employers not paying the correct contribution amounts or not paying employer contribution amounts at all). Sustainability: As far as practical, the KiwiSaver regime settings are intended to facilitate administrative efficiency. The problem definition identifies that there are some aspects of the regime that would be more efficient if subject to further refinements. Option Two: build on payday filing reforms This option would build on the improved information available through payday filing reforms to facilitate the faster transfer of employer contributions to scheme providers and to improve the accuracy of contribution entitlements passed to scheme providers. Specifically, it would involve passing employer contribution amounts to scheme providers based on payday information received by employers, before Inland Revenue had received the contribution amount (essentially a Government guarantee, that would align with the existing treatment of employee contributions). Based on the improved information received through payday filing, this option would also align the commencement of interest paid while contributions are held by Inland Revenue with a member’s payday. 1 Administration: This option would increase administrative efficiency, as employer contributions could be passed to scheme providers sooners. However, as it does not include other administrative enhancements to KiwiSaver, savings may not be maximised. Compliance: This option should make it easier for members to reconcile the amounts in their KiwiSaver accounts with the KiwiSaver contributions recorded on their payslips (as employer contributions would be passed in full to KiwiSaver providers sooner after the member payday). Consequently, this should also reduce the level of contacts from members to scheme providers. Equity: This option would ensure that all KiwiSaver members receive the employer 1 Currently, interest on employee contributions commences on the 15 th of the month the amount was deducted from the member’s salary or wages and interest on employer contributions commences on the 1 st of the month the contribution amount was paid to Inland Revenue. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:13 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 9 IN CONFIDENCE contributions amounts they are entitled to. It would also improve the accuracy of interest paid on contributions by Inland Revenue (the current rules result in under and over payment of interest on employee contributions and under payment of interest on employer contributions). However, this option would not address situations where a member’s employer is incorrectly calculating contributions amounts. Sustainability: This option would ensure that the benefit of information obtained via payday filing reforms were fully utilised in the KiwiSaver context. It would also align the treatment of employer contributions with employee contributions and other PAYE deductions (which are guaranteed). Option Three: Additional transfer, information and administrative refinements In addition to the changes proposed under option 2, this option would use the opportunity created by Business Transformation, to make further refinements to KiwiSaver settings. Refinements aimed at facilitating faster transfers would be to reduce the initial KiwiSaver provisional period from 3-months to 2-months (this would mean initial contributions could be transferred to providers a month earlier) and to reduce the period schemes have to send funds and member information, when a member decides to transfer to a new scheme from 35 to 10 days. The later change would only impact non-default providers, as arrangements with default providers already require them to complete transfers in 10-days. Information flows would be utilised to ensure members were receiving their correct contribution amounts, by requiring employers to provide information to Inland Revenue about the income KiwiSaver contributions have been calculated from, 2 in respect of new employees. To recognise that members will have different first points of contact for information on their KiwiSaver account, this option also proposes that members should be able to apply to change their contribution rate through their scheme provider or Inland Revenue (in addition to their employer). Employers would be advised of the employee’s contribution rate change request by Inland Revenue. As a further administrative refinement, is also proposed that the 3-month grace period – that a person who has been incorrectly enrolled in KiwiSaver has to gain New Zealand residence before their account is shut – be removed. This period has not operated as intended and is not utilised by members. The below analysis of this option against the assessment criteria, identifies impacts that are additional to those set out in the analysis of option 2 above. Administration: Reducing the provisional period and removing the 3-month grace period would increase administrative efficiency. Compliance: The option would reduce compliance costs for members looking to change contribution rates. However, this would increase compliance costs for employers, as they would be required to apply contribution rates advised by Inland Revenue. There would also be some additional compliance costs for scheme providers and employers, relating to the proposals to reduce the period schemes have to send funds and information to a new 2 Some amounts that are treated as income for PAYE are exempt for the purposes of calculating KiwiSaver contribution amounts. Examples includes the value of accommodation and a benefit from an employer share scheme. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:13 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 10 IN CONFIDENCE provider when a member transfers schemes and the additional employer information requirements, respectively. Equity: The additional employer information should make it easier for Inland Revenue to identify situations where contribution amounts have been calculated incorrectly. Based on this information it would be possible to follow-up with employers, so these issues could be resolved sooner and would not arise again. Sustainability: This option identifies enhancements to KiwiSaver administrative settings in addition to the changes proposed in option 2 – to maximise improvements to KiwiSaver it would be logical to implement all changes. Implementing a package of changes is also more sustainable in terms of the legislation (as opposed to making singular refinements to KiwiSaver legislative settings on an on-going basis). Other options not considered Aligning payment of KiwiSaver contributions with an employee’s payday As part of the work on the payday filing reforms, consideration was given to the option of employers being required to pay PAYE and other deductions from salary or wages (including KiwiSaver employee and employer contributions) to Inland Revenue to align with an employee’s payday. If employers were required to pay KiwiSaver contribution amounts to Inland Revenue sooner after their employees’ payday, this would facilitate the faster transfer of these contributions to scheme providers. However, the decision was made only to require employers to file information sooner after a member’s payday, as feedback from employers was that requiring them to pay the actual monetary amounts of deductions (including KiwiSaver contributions) in a shorter timeframe would be too onerous comply with. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:13 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 11 IN CONFIDENCE 3.2 Which of these options is the proposed approach? The proposed approach is option 3. This package of refinements is comprised of the following proposals: • the Crown funding the payment of employer contribution amounts passed to KiwiSaver scheme providers until these amounts are received from the employer (essentially a Government guarantee of employer contributions); • changing the date the calculation of interest on employer and employee contributions commences, to align with the pay date a member’s employer has reported; • reducing the KiwiSaver provisional period from 3-months to 2-months; • reducing the maximum period an old scheme provider has to share information and transfer funds to a new provider when a member transfers schemes, from 35-days to 10-days; • allowing members to change contribution rates through their scheme provider or Inland Revenue, rather than only through their employer; • removing the 3-month grace period for members who have been incorrectly automatically enrolled in KiwiSaver, to gain New Zealand residence; and • requiring employers to provide Inland Revenue with information about the income KiwiSaver contributions are calculated from for new employees. Of the options considered this package would be most effective in facilitating the faster transfer of contributions to (and between) KiwiSaver scheme providers, and reducing on- going administrative costs for Inland Revenue. It is also the most coherent and equitable option for KiwiSaver members as it will help ensure members are receiving the correct contribution amounts and these contribution entitlements are being passed to scheme providers. The proposed approach is not incompatible with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:13 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 12 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 4: Imp ac t An a ly s is (Pr o po se d ap p r oach) 4.1 Summary table of costs and benefits 3 A decrease in interest payable on employee contributions would be expected to be offset by an increase in interest on employer contributions for employees with a payday between the 15 th and 23 rd of the month. Affected parties Comment Impact Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties (KiwiSaver members, scheme providers and employers) KiwiSaver members Aligning KiwiSaver interest payments to a member’s payday would result in a reduction in interest paid on employee contributions for some members with paydays after the 15 th of the month. The impact of this would be small given interest is paid at a rate of 0.72% per annum and would be offset by their contributions earning market investment returns sooner and an increase in interest on employer contributions in many cases. 3 Scheme providers Reducing the time scheme providers have to send members’ information and funds to a new provider in scheme transfer situations from 35-days to 10- days would have compliance costs for non-default providers, who are not already required to comply with the 10- day transfer time. Feedback from providers indicates this would be manageable and would align with industry best practice. Employers Employers would need to provide Inland Revenue with information about the income KiwiSaver contributions are calculated from. Compliance costs should be small, as employers would already need to hold this information to accurately calculate contribution amounts and the information would only need to be provided about new employees as part of employee on-boarding processes.

Costs associated with calculating employee contributions from a payday would be negligible (as current under and over payments would broadly offset).

There is the potential that the proposal to guarantee employer contributions could have a behavioural impact on employers - that is employer’s may be less likely to pay employer contributions. (While only $2.6 million in employer contribution debt was written-off for the financial year ending 30 June 2018, approximately $2 billion in employer contributions were passed to KiwiSaver scheme providers during this same year). Current levels of employer and employee contribution debt are broadly comparable (as at 30 June 2018, employer contribution debt since the commencement of KiwiSaver was $18 million, while employee contribution debt was $24 million). This suggests that the existing guarantee of employee contributions has had limited behavioural impact on employers and that introducing a guarantee of employer contributions would also have a minimal behavioural impact. Moreover, Inland Revenue has processes to monitor and recover unpaid amounts of employer contributions from employers, which would remain in place after the introduction of this proposal. These include penalties available under the Tax Administration Act 1994. Sec tio n 5: Stak e h old er vie ws 5.1 What do stakeholders think about the problem and the proposed solution? The Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment and the Treasury have been consulted on the proposals and support them. The proposals also reflect feedback on the operation of the KiwiSaver regime from the Financial Markets Authority. Inland Revenue has undertaken targeted consultation with KiwiSaver scheme providers (in the form of Business Transformation focused co-design workshops). Providers are supportive of the proposals. Consultation with KiwiSaver members was not undertaken prior to original Cabinet decisions in March 2019. On a whole, the package of changes should be beneficial for KiwiSaver members and given the technical nature of the proposed changes, they are unlikely to have generated public interest. Some subsequent consultation has been undertaken with KiwiSaver members, in the form of focus groups. Participants were supportive of the proposals. The original proposed approach included employers being required to provide Inland Revenue with KiwiSaver income information and ESCT rates for new employees and existing employees where this information had changed since it was last provided. It also included KiwiSaver members being able to change their contribution rate through Inland Revenue or their KiwiSaver scheme provider from 1 April 2020. The impacts of the proposals were not tested with employers prior to original Cabinet decisions in March 2019. However, subsequently targeted consultation has been undertaken with employers and payroll providers (in the form of focus groups). Public submissions have also been received through the Select Committee process. Feedback on the above proposals was that the compliance costs on employers were likely to outweigh the benefit to KiwiSaver members and Inland Revenue. Officials have taken this feedback into account by modifying the additional employer information requirements, so that 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:13 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 16 IN CONFIDENCE under the revised approach employers would only be required to provide information about income KiwiSaver contributions are calculated from for new employees (not every time this information changed) and would not be required to report ESCT rates. As a result, the modified reporting requirements could be incorporated into the employee onboarding process, therefore, reducing employer compliance costs. Moreover, the application date for the contribution rate change proposal has been deferred (this change would now apply from 1 April 2022 or an earlier date set by Order in Council). The later application date would enable further consultation with employers and allow time to devise an operational approach that would minimise employer compliance costs. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:13 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 17 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 6: Imp le men ta tio n a n d op er a tio n 6.1 How will the new arrangements be given effect? The proposals would require amendment to the KiwiSaver Act 2006. Amendments would be included in the next available omnibus taxation Bill. To align with the transfer of the administration of KiwiSaver from its current operating system into its new operating system, the changes would come into effect from 1 April 2020. The only exception to this would be the proposal to allow members to change their contribution rate through their KiwiSaver scheme provider or Inland Revenue which would apply from 1 April 2022, or an earlier date set by Order in Council. Inland Revenue would be responsible for the on-going administration of the new arrangements. Aligning implementation of the proposals with Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme, would mean the cost of system changes would be absorbed into Business Transformation. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:13 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 18 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 7 : M o n itor in g, ev a lua tio n a n d re v ie w 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? Inland Revenue would monitor the outcomes of the proposals pursuant to the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTTP) to confirm that they match the policy objectives. Inland Revenue collects KiwiSaver data which could be used to assess the effectiveness of the changes in facilitating the faster transfer of employer contributions and enhancing information flows. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? No formal review is planned. However, the final step in the GTTP is the implementation and review stage, which involves post-implementation review of legislation, and the identification of remedial issues. Post-implementation review is expected to occur around 12 months after implementation. All KiwiSaver scheme providers have an on-going relationship with Inland Revenue, which includes an annual meeting to discuss policy and operational issues that have arisen over the past year. This would provide an opportunity for scheme providers to give feedback about the effectiveness of the proposed approach. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:13 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 1 IN CONFIDENCE Impact Summary: Lowering the student loan repayment threshold for non-salary and wage income and repealing withholding changes for student loan income Sec tio n 1 : G en er a l in fo r ma tion Purpose Inland Revenue is responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Statement, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice have been produced for the purpose of informing key (or in-principle) policy decisions to be taken by Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis The key limitations on the analysis are as follows. T h r e s h o l d ch a n g es In preparation for the transition of Student Loans repayments to IRD’s new systems and process, an issue has been discovered. If not addressed, the issue would affect the integrity of the system and introduce inequity. The administration of Student Loans is due to go live as of April 2020, so it is necessary to address this issue immediately. This urgency has imposed a limitation on analysis. No consultation with external stakeholders The timing around the identification of this issue has meant that no consultation has occurred with borrowers or representative groups. However, only approximately 25 borrowers per year are expected to be affected. Scale of the problem and impact on borrowers The scale of the problem is low. The proposal is limited to borrowers whose total income is above the $19,760 repayment threshold and who have between $500 and $1500 of non- salary and wage income. From information Inland Revenue holds, the total number of borrowers who earned over the loan repayment threshold and had non-salary and wage income between $500 and $1500 was 25 borrowers for the 2018 income year. In terms of the impact on borrowers, the maximum increase in repayment obligations will be $179 per annum. If borrowers pay this amount, then the time it will take them to repay their loan will be reduced slightly. If borrowers do not pay, then the amount will be capitalised back onto their loan and the loan balance and term of the loan will remain the same. No penalties will be imposed for non-payment. Impact of proposals on the student loan valuation The benefits from the proposal will not have a material impact on the student loan valuation None of the limitations materially affect the analysis. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:19 3C.

These issues were not raised previously in public consultations on the policy proposals or in submissions to select committee. This urgency does not materially affect the analysis. Responsible Manager (signature and date): Martin Neylan Principal Policy Advisor Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 18 September 2019 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:19 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 3 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 2 : Pro b le m de fin itio n an d o bjec tiv es 2.1 What is the policy problem or opportunity? T h r e s h o l d ch a n g e s The student loan scheme currently has a $1500 threshold for non-salary and wage income for New Zealand-based borrowers, above the annual repayment threshold. Borrowers who earn $1500 or less of non-salary and wage income (including schedular, casual agricultural, and election day income) in a year are not required to notify Inland Revenue of this income for student loan purposes and do not have to make student loan repayments on it. If a borrower earns more than $1500 of non-salary and wage income, they are required to make repayments on the full amount. This threshold was introduced when most salary and wage earners were not required to file a tax return and recognised the additional compliance costs associated with borrowers advising Inland Revenue of their income for student loan purposes only. However, from 1 April 2019, legislative changes were made to the administration of individual’s income tax. Now all taxpayers either file a return or have their income tax automatically squared up at the end of the tax year based on information from third parties reported during the year or information provided for tax purposes at the end of the year. As a result, there is no longer a significant compliance cost for borrowers in advising Inland Revenue of their non-salary and wage income. Therefore, the current threshold is set at a level that is higher than the compliance costs involved in providing this information to Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme is now moving the repayment of student loans into the new computer systems and processes. This process has highlighted the issue of the $1500 threshold being set at a level that does not reflect the compliance costs involved in providing information to Inland Revenue. It is also an opportune time to reduce the threshold and any changes to the threshold would be included in this transformation process. W i t h h o l d i n g c h a n g e s Legislation currently enacted and due to take effect from 1 April 2020 would require Student loan deductions to be made from schedular, casual agricultural, and election day income each pay day. This change would affect approximately 33,000 borrowers and approximately 11,000 employers. These changes were intended to address non-compliance by some borrowers earning this income. They would impose compliance costs on employers and potentially reduce compliance costs on borrowers. The changes do not affect the borrower’s overall student loan repayment obligations but would have changed the way that these are met. Rather than make two interim payments and have an end-of-year square-up, borrowers would instead have deductions made from their income with an end-of-year square-up. Consultation as part of Inland Revenue’s business transformation programme has indicated that this change would impose significant, unforeseen, compliance costs on employers. These costs vary depending on the size of the employer and the complexity of their systems, but consultation has indicated that these costs are typically relatively large, both initially and on an ongoing basis. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:19 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 4 IN CONFIDENCE 2.2 Who is affected and how? T h r e s h o l d ch a n g e s The proposal is to reduce the threshold would affect borrowers with non-salary and wage income of between $500 and $1500 above the $19,760 repayment threshold. The number of borrowers likely to be affected is 25 borrowers per year. The maximum additional repayment amount resulting from lowering the threshold would be $179 per annum per borrower payable with their end of year tax return. Those borrowers with non-salary and wage income either above $1500 or below $500 would not experience a change in their current treatment. Retaining the current threshold level increases inequity between borrowers with salary and wage income (who make repayments on all income above the repayment threshold) and those with non-salary and wage income (who have an additional $1500 above the $19,760 repayment threshold before repayments apply). This change would mean that approximately 25 affected borrowers each year would be required to make repayments and if payments are made, these would reduce the term of their loans. If the affected borrowers do not make payments, provisions in the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 allow unpaid amounts of less than $334 to be capitalised back onto the loan balance, so no borrowers whose total non-salary and wage income is between $500 and $1,500 will be subject to penalties if they do not make repayments and the debt to the Government will not increase. W i t h h o l d i n g c h a n g e s The change to student loan deductions on schedular, casual agricultural, and election day income would impose compliance costs on employers and seeks to reduce non- compliance by recipients of these payments. Repealing these provisions would avoid these compliance costs being imposed. 2.3 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? The need for a quick response to this issue and the integrity issues mean that only three options are available for consideration – retaining the current $1500 threshold (the status quo), lowering the threshold to zero, or lowering the threshold to $500 (which is the option preferred by officials). Sec tio n 3: O p tio n s id e n tifica tio n 3.1 What options have been considered? 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:19 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 5 IN CONFIDENCE T h r e s h o l d ch a n g e s There were three options considered, namely: to retain the current threshold; to reduce the threshold to zero; or to reduce the threshold to a lower amount of $500. The following criteria have been used to assess the options: • Efficiency • Equity between borrowers • Compliance costs • Economic (maintaining the value of the loan asset) Retaining the existing threshold This option would: Pros • Not result in any change for borrowers or Inland Revenue or require any legislative change Cons • gives an unintended financial benefit to borrowers with non-salary and wage income under the $1500 threshold as they are not required to make loan repayments on this income • treat borrowers under the $1500 threshold differently to other borrowers • the student loan scheme becomes inconsistent with how other taxes are administered • the term of borrowers’ loans would be longer than necessary • the government would carry this student loan debt for longer. Reducing the threshold to zero. These borrowers would pay the increased obligation as part of their end-of-year assessment process. This option would: Pros • remove the financial benefit to borrowers with non-salary and wage income compared to other borrowers • improves loan repayments/reduces the term of the loan • reduces the period the government carries the debt Cons • this option would introduce another inequity as the threshold would be set at a level that is lower than similar compliance cost reduction thresholds used for the administration of income tax (where outstanding amounts of less than $50 are not pursued). • Compliance costs would be incurred by affected borrowers in understanding the changes and making repayments, but these would be similar to the costs incurred by other borrowers with repayment obligations. • Consultation has not occurred with affected borrowers. • Legislative changes are required to give effect to this proposal Reducing the threshold from $1500 to $500 (The preferred option) Reducing the threshold to $500 would equate to $60 of loan repayments. This is very close to the $50 threshold for income tax owed from an automated assessment, where amounts less than $50 owed are written off. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:19 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 6 IN CONFIDENCE These borrowers would pay the increased obligation as part of their end of year assessment process. This option would: Pros • Set the threshold at a level that is similar to other thresholds used to administer income tax (where outstanding amounts are not pursued). • remove the financial benefit to borrowers under the threshold compared to other borrowers • improve equity among borrowers (between those with non-salary and wage income of $1500 or less and other borrowers) • increased equity increases the integrity of the loan scheme. • improve loan repayments/reduce the term of the loan • reduce the period the government carries the debt Cons • Compliance costs would be incurred by affected borrowers in understanding the changes and making repayments, but these would not be material as they would be incurred in complying with their income tax obligations. • Consultation has not occurred with affected borrowers. • Legislative change is required W i t h h o l d i n g c h a n g e s For the changes to the student loan withholding requirements, the option that has been considered is to repeal the provisions, so that these changes do not come into force and that the current arrangements continue. Options briefly considered and rejected were to defer the application date or to make the changes optional for employers. Making the changes optional would create greater complexity and uncertainty for borrowers, employers and Inland Revenue. Deferring the application date would give employers more time to implement the changes but is unlikely to reduce the compliance costs. 3.2 Which of these options is the proposed approach? T h r e s h o l d ch a n g e s The preferred option is to reduce the threshold level to $500. This would increase equity among borrowers and reflect the original intent that borrowers who are not subject to high compliance costs should make loan repayments. W i t h h o l d i n g c h a n g e s For the changes to the student loan withholding requirements, the preferred option is to repeal the provisions as this minimises compliance costs. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:19 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 7 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 4: Imp ac t An a ly s is (Pr o po se d ap p r oa ch) 4.1 Summary table of costs and benefits Affected parties (identify) Comment: nature of cost or benefit (eg ongoing, one-off), evidence and assumption (eg compliance rates), risks Impact $m present value, for monetised impacts; high, medium or low for non- monetised impacts T h r e s h o l d ch a n g e s Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties (borrowers with non-salary and wage income between $500 and $1500) Compliance costs: The ongoing compliance costs are not expected to be material as they would be incurred in complying with income tax obligations. One-off cost may be incurred in understanding the changes. These would be short lived. Financial Impact: The maximum financial impact on the affected borrowers (approximately 25 borrowers per year) is increased repayments of $179 per annum for borrowers who are over the $19,760 repayment threshold. If a borrower is under the repayment threshold, they would not have to make any repayments. As the repayment obligation is based on the borrower’s income, we expect that most would be able to make the additional repayment. If borrowers are unable to make the additional repayments, they would not be subject to any penalties and so would not be made worse off. Nil Low Low Regulators (Inland Revenue) The costs of implementing this change will form part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme and additional costs (above those already funded by Business Transformation) will not be incurred. Nil Wider government N/A Nil Other parties (Student Unions and other representative bodies) One-off cost. There will be costs for representative bodies in updating informational material on this change for students.

Total Monetised Cost Low Non-monetised costs Low Expected benefits of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties (borrowers with non-salary and wage income between $500 and $1500) Borrowers who pay the increased repayment will slightly reduce the term of the loan. Borrowers who do not pay will have the amount added back to their loan. They will not incur any penalties for non- payment and the term of their loan will remain same. Increased equity between borrowers with non-salary and wage income and other borrowers which increases the integrity of the loan scheme. Low Regulators (Inland Revenue) Consistency of loan scheme with way income tax is administered. Low Wider government N/A N/A Other parties N/A N/A Total Monetised Benefit Non-monetised benefits Low Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties (borrowers earning these types of income and their employers) Compliance costs: The changes proposed to be repealed would have imposed compliance costs on employers and potentially reduced compliance costs for borrowers. Repealing these changes would lower compliance costs overall. Financial Impact: As the change preserves current arrangements, there is not expected to be any financial impact Low Nil Regulators (Inland Revenue) As the change preserves current arrangements there should not be significant additional costs to repealing the change.

T h r e s h o l d ch a n g e s Officials have not identified other impacts as a result of the proposal. There is uncertainty around borrower behaviour towards these loan repayments and the extent to which these amounts will be repaid. Some borrowers will pay, some will have their loan repayments amalgamated with other tax obligations, and others will not pay. W i t h h o l d i n g c h a n g e s Removing the withholding requirements is likely to mean that compliance rate for the borrowers effected may remain lower than the wider population of student loan borrowers. Inland Revenue are considering ways that this can be addressed operationally. Non-monetised costs Low Expected benefits of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties (borrowers earning these types of income and their employers) Employers have indicated that there are significant compliance costs to implement the changes, so repealing these changes will mean that they do not face these costs. Medium Regulators (Inland Revenue) N/A N/A Wider government N/A N/A Other parties N/A N/A Total Monetised Benefit Low Non-monetised benefits Medium 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:19 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 10 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 5: Stak e h old er vie ws 5.1 What do stakeholders think about the problem and the proposed solution? T h r e s h o l d ch a n g e s Consultation with representative groups has not occurred to date. Consultation will occur with representative groups as part of Business Transformation stakeholder engagement activities in implementing the changes. W i t h h o l d i n g c h a n g e s The proposal to repeal the earlier withholding changes is a direct response to concerns raised by employers during recent consultation that they would face significant and unforeseen compliance costs unless the previous law changes were repealed before the take effect on 1 April 2020. These issues were not previously identified in earlier public consultation on the policy proposals or in submissions to select committee. Sec tio n 6: Imp le men ta tio n a n d op er a tio n 6.1 How will the new arrangements be given effect? T h r e s h o l d ch a n g e s Lowering the threshold requires a legislative change to the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011. It is intended that this change be included at the Select Committee stage of the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Bill. The change will apply from 1 April 2020, which is the same date that other student loan changes apply from. Inland Revenue will be responsible for the ongoing operation of this threshold. The change will be implemented as part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation Release 4 changes which incorporate the repayment of Student Loans into the new systems and processes. The risks associated with this proposal are being managed as part of the wider risks to do with the Transformation programme. Information on the change will be incorporated with other communications to affected borrowers once the legislation is enacted. W i t h h o l d i n g c h a n g e s Repealing the withholding changes will not require any implementation as this maintains current arrangements. As part of educating employers before release 4, Inland Revenue would ensure that it is clear that these provisions are intended to be repealed so that no employers make changes to their systems to comply with the repealed provisions. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:19 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 11 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 7 : M o n itor in g, ev a lua tio n a n d re v ie w 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored?

This report seeks your approval to give overseas donee status to three New Zealand charities whose purposes are directed at activities outside New Zealand. 2. The charities we recommend be granted overseas donee status are: 2.1 Active Hearts Foundation 2.2 Kiwilink 2.3 Shimshal Trust 3. A description of the charities, and their purposes and activities, is provided in paragraphs 35 to 40 of this report. 4. If you agree to the recommendations in this report, the attached paper to the Cabinet Economic Development Committee should be authorised and lodged with the Cabinet Office before 10 am, Thursday, 7 November 2019. 5. The attached Cabinet paper seeks the Committee’s approval to add the three charities to schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and therefore obtain overseas donee status. These additions would be included in the next available omnibus taxation bill, scheduled for introduction in March 2020, with effect from the 2020–21 income year (starting 1 April 2020). 6. The charities discussed in this report are largely involved in the relief of poverty or improving education outcomes in developing countries. All are registered under the Charities Act 2005. They all have adequate procedures for the accountability of funds applied to projects outside New Zealand and can demonstrate a track record of activity. 7. “Overseas donee status” is used to describe certain New Zealand charities with overseas purposes to which donors are eligible for tax benefits. These benefits include: 7.1 the donation tax credit of 33 1 / 3 % of the value of any monetary donations made by a New Zealand resident individual taxpayer, capped at the amount of their taxable income, and 7.2 tax deductions if the monetary donation is from a company or Māori authority, capped at the amount of their net income. 8. Decisions to grant overseas donee status approvals are assessed against Cabinet criteria, which were set in 1978. The criteria are an extension to the original 1962 policy to use the tax system to support charitable giving. Decisions to grant overseas donee status complement the government’s overseas development objectives. IR2019/573 Cabinet paper: Overseas donee status: New additions for the next available taxation bill Page 2 of 11 IN CONFIDENCE IN CONFIDENCE Financial implications 9. The revenue effect of giving overseas donee status to the charities recommended in this report is outlined in Table 1. The revenue effect is recognised as a forecasting change because it reflects an increase in the cost of the decision to allow donations to New Zealand-based charities with overseas purposes to be eligible for tax benefits. The recommendations in this report have no impact on the Tax Policy Scorecard. 1 Table 1: Financial implications $million – increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2019–20 2020–21 2021–22 2022–23 2023–24 & outyears Crown Revenue and Receipts: Tax Revenue (0.000) (0.095) (0.100) (0.101) (0.103) Operating balance impact 0.000 0.095 0.100 0.101 0.103 Consultation 10.

This report seeks your approval to give overseas donee status to three registered charities and include the required amendments in the next available omnibus taxation bill, scheduled for introduction in March 2020. Policy background Tax benefits for charities with purposes outside New Zealand 21. New Zealand charities that apply a large proportion of their funds for purposes outside New Zealand and that want their monetary donors to be eligible for tax benefits (particularly the donation tax credit) must be given overseas donee status by being listed on schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Being given overseas donee status has no bearing on whether the charity is exempt from income tax. 2 22. Overseas donee status and being listed on schedule 32 means that monetary donations to the charity are eligible for tax benefits. Tax benefits include: 22.1 the donation tax credit of 33 1 / 3 % of the value of any monetary donations made by a New Zealand resident individual taxpayer, capped at the amount of their taxable income; and 22.2 tax deductions if the monetary donation is from a company or Māori authority, capped at the amount of their net income. 23. There are 152 organisations listed in schedule 32. 3 Policy intent 24. Since 1962, the Income Tax Act has provided tax benefits for monetary donations to New Zealand charities (including benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural organisations) whose purposes are largely limited to New Zealand. The Income Tax Act imposes certain statutory limitations on the entity’s purposes and its application of funds, which must relate “wholly or mainly” to purposes in New Zealand. At the time, three charities with overseas purposes were specifically named as exceptions to the rule, and the government acknowledged that charities could be added to the list of names from time to time as comparable cases arise. In 1978, Cabinet developed criteria (see paragraph 28) to support consideration about future additions of New Zealand-based overseas aid organisations to the legislative list. 25. Supporting New Zealand charities through overseas donee status is intended to assist the New Zealand government’s overseas development efforts, where aid objectives are better achieved by charitable non-government organisations (NGOs). The assistance is open-ended and less discretionary than other forms of government assistance 4 because it is delivered through the tax system using the benefits that attach to monetary donations made to the named charities. 26. There are arguments for and against using the tax system to support charitable giving. Broadly, governments may seek to promote charitable giving: 2 This is dealt with elsewhere in the Income Tax Act — sections CW 41 and CW 42. 3 The Taxation (KiwSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Bill proposes to add four more. For reference, Inland Revenue recognises 25,000 organisations with philanthropic, benevolent, or charitable purposes in New Zealand as having donee status (2018 figures). 4 For example, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s New Zealand aid programmes: the New Zealand Partnerships for International Development Fund (Partnerships Fund), the Sustainable Development Fund, the New Zealand Disaster Response Partnership (NZDRP), and the Pacific Island Countries Participation Fund (PIC Fund). IR2019/573 Cabinet paper: Overseas donee status: New additions for the next available taxation bill Page 6 of 11 IN CONFIDENCE IN CONFIDENCE 26.1 to further social objectives – in this particular case, overseas development aid, 26.2 for the wider benefits to society (externalities), which may be over and above the value of the benefit provided via the tax system, and 26.3 because donations can be effective indicators of when extra goods and services should be provided in market conditions that might otherwise not exist – particularly the case in developing countries or when assisting individuals suffering from the results of war or natural disaster. 27. The trade-off for these benefits is the open-ended revenue cost for as long as the charity is on the list of approved donee organisations. Cabinet’s consideration of requests for overseas donee status 28. Since 1978, Cabinet has applied the criteria below, which set the parameters of activities that may be supported by the tax system: The basic criteria for adding an organisation to the list of approved “overseas” charities: (i) the funds of the charity should be principally applied towards: the relief of poverty, hunger, sickness or the ravages of war or natural disaster; or the economy of developing countries\*; or raising the educational standards of a developing country\*; (ii) charities formed for the principal purpose of fostering or administering any religion, cult or political creed should not qualify; \* developing countries recognised by the United Nations. \[CM 78/14/7 refers\] 29. The eligible purposes set out in the criteria are aligned to the government’s overseas development objectives (disaster relief, provision of humanitarian aid, and assisting developing countries) and narrower than the common law meaning of “charitable purpose” and the legislative framework in the Charities Act 2005. Determination of donee status, including overseas donee status, remains the responsibility of Inland Revenue because of the tax benefits that attach to monetary donations. The process does not overlap with the work of the Department of Internal Affairs – Charities Services. 30. Irrespective of whether a charity’s founding documents and activities are charitable, approval for inclusion on schedule 32 is not automatic, and requests are considered on a case-by-case basis. 31. An overarching consideration is that any charity approved for overseas donee status is credible, transparent and accountable. 5 Fiscal impacts and the integrity of the tax system are also relevant considerations. 32. Legislation is used to implement decisions to grant overseas donee status because it is an exception to the policy that tax benefits for donations should be limited to charities with New Zealand purposes. In 2016, the Legislation Design and Advisory 5 Guidelines for using the Cabinet criteria for overseas donee status, endorsed by Cabinet in 2009 – CBC Min (09) 12/2 refers. IR2019/573 Cabinet paper: Overseas donee status: New additions for the next available taxation bill Page 7 of 11 IN CONFIDENCE IN CONFIDENCE Committee provided advice to Inland Revenue confirming that the use of legislation to grant overseas donee status is appropriate. Analysis of requests for overseas donee status 33. Officials look at a number of factors when considering a charity’s request to be added to the list of donee organisations in the Income Tax Act. We look to establish whether the charity is capable of meeting its purposes and is accountable for the funds it collects by: 33.1 reviewing the charity’s governing document (constitution and trust deed) to ensure the activities and purposes are consistent with Cabinet’s criteria, 33.2 requiring the purposes stated in the charity’s governing document to be entirely within the scope of paragraph (i) of the Cabinet criteria and that no personal pecuniary profit can be derived 33.3 looking at the clauses governing the nature and extent of the trustees’ discretionary powers, the winding-up clause, and the trustees’ ability to amend the governing document, 33.4 looking at the charity’s past, current, and proposed activities, 33.5 requesting that the trustees provide us with the charity’s financial statements, 33.6 considering the trustees’ degree of control over the application of the charity’s funds overseas, and procedures in place to ensure accountability for funds, 33.7 considering the planning, monitoring, and evaluation processes used by the trustees regarding the application of the charity’s funds, including how recipients use the funds, as well as the processes used to select beneficiaries and/or projects to support, 33.8 asking whether the charity has a legal presence in New Zealand and if it has registered under the Charities Act 2005, 33.9 considering each request on the basis of other generic tax policy objectives, such as fiscal implications (including risk to the New Zealand tax base), consistency with other current government policy objectives, and the precedent effect, and 33.10 consulting with other government agencies such as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the Department of Internal Affairs – Charities Services, to identify any concerns with the organisation or sensitivities with the countries in which the organisation operates. We also use the New Zealand Police’s vetting service in connection with the charity’s trustees or directors. Charities recommended for overseas donee status 34. The three charities discussed below have purposes that come within the criteria in paragraph 28 and we recommend that they be granted overseas donee status. They all have adequate procedures for the accountability of funds applied to projects and can demonstrate a track record of activity. All the charities discussed in this report are registered under the Charities Act 2005 and have a centre of management in New Zealand. IR2019/573 Cabinet paper: Overseas donee status: New additions for the next available taxation bill Page 8 of 11 IN CONFIDENCE IN CONFIDENCE Active Hearts Foundation 35. Active Hearts Foundation formalised in 2017 the charitable activities of a group of New Zealand trekking guides which were directed at improving living conditions and education outcomes in Nepalese villages in the Himalayas. Key projects to date have involved disaster relief following the 2015, 2018 and 2019 earthquakes, refitting and resourcing school libraries, resourcing community health clinics, and ensuring the resilience of local infrastructure including an irrigation pipeline for food production. 36. 6 Kiwilink 37. Kiwilink was formally established as a charitable trust in August 2018 to separate humanitarian projects formerly undertaken within the Associated Churches of Christ New Zealand and continue to undertake missions with a particular focus on Zimbabwe and Vanuatu. Recent work undertaken by Kiwilink in Zimbabwe includes collaborating with local charities to provide orphan care, student bursaries and the drilling of water boreholes in the Zvishavane region in South Western Zimbabwe. In Vanuatu, the Trust has worked in the relocation of people in the Ambae region displaced by volcanic activity, and the provision of first-aid supplies and a water storage tank at the Noui Noui Hospital. 38. The Trust is seeking overseas donee status to grow its donor base and enable it to continue to contribute to co-ordinated international humanitarian efforts, such as the provision of clean drinking water and facilitating the empowerment of people in the areas of the world the trust works in. Shimshal Trust 39. Shimshal Trust was set up in 2003 to support education outcomes and the relief of poverty for communities and villages in the Northern region of Pakistan (Shimshal). The principal focus of the Trust is to fund scholarships to help local students with promising ability, but no financial support, to attend high school or university. The Trust also provides financial support to community aid and development projects when donor resources allow. 40. The Trust is seeking overseas donee status to deepen sources of New Zealand donor support. For the year 2018, it sponsored 18 students and is committed to those scholarships for the next three years, (this is up from 14 students for the previous financial year). The trustees note that community leadership in the Shimshal region has a progressive stance on education, particularly for girls and women, and the Trust aspires to increase the number of children attaining higher education. Risks with recommended charities 41. In an earlier report ( IR2018/077, dated 20 February 2018), we noted the risks associated with granting donee status, and this is reproduced in the annex. As part of our analysis of the three charities discussed in this report, we have not identified any precedent risks or concerns with their activities and governance. The charities recommended in this report have adequate donor support to carry out their purposes. Notwithstanding, officials note: 6 Note that international donations do not give rise to tax benefits in New Zealand unless the donor has New Zealand taxable income. s 9(2)(b)(ii) IR2019/573 Cabinet paper: Overseas donee status: New additions for the next available taxation bill Page 9 of 11 IN CONFIDENCE IN CONFIDENCE 41.1 Shimshal Trust operates from a very low financial base. It has been able to maintain its activities over period of fifteen years and its trustees are a cohesive group who know the Shimshal region very well. Although the trust supports a small number of students, the outcomes from sponsorship has been successful. Officials therefore do not have any concerns with the purpose of the Trust or its governance or longevity. It is small-scale and effective at what it does. 41.2 Kiwilink was created to undertake humanitarian aid projects and missions previously managed and commissioned by the Associated Churches of Christ New Zealand. The purposes of the new trust are directed to humanitarian purposes and its activities are to be free from discrimination. The deed also imposes prohibitions from carrying out religious purposes. 7 Consultation with other agencies 42. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Pacific and Development Group) and the Department of Internal Affairs – Charities Services have been consulted as part of the preparation of this report. The New Zealand Police’s vetting service was also used in connection with the trustees/officers of the charities recommended in this report. 43. The Treasury has also been consulted in preparing this report and agrees with its recommendations. Charities still under consideration 44. Officials are still analysing requests from seven other charities not discussed in this report. We are waiting for additional information from the trustees and, subject to the timing of the future taxation bill, will report to you again in 2020 about our recommendations. Legislative vehicle and application date 45. Amendments adding the three organisations recommended in this report to the list of donee organisations in the Income Tax Act 2007, should be included in the next omnibus taxation bill, scheduled for introduction in March 2020. The amendments should apply from 1 April 2020. Monetary donations received on and after that date will be eligible for tax benefits. The recommended application date gives the charities certainty for marketing and fund-raising purposes. 46. Inland Revenue’s systems can work with an application date of 1 April 2020, as individuals will be able to claim the donations tax credit for receipted monetary donations as part of Inland Revenue’s 2020–21 return cycle, starting on 1 April 2021. Companies and Māori authorities will be able to recognise deductions for monetary donations made during the 2020–21 income year. Compliance and administrative cost implications 47. No compliance or administrative cost implications arise from the recommendations in this report. The changes in this report have no implications for Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme of work. 7 When considering requests for overseas donee status from charities that are motivated by religious tenets, we recommend changes to the charity’s rules to ensure its works, projects, and activities performed and undertaken outside New Zealand are free from discrimination on the basis of race, gender, religion, or sexual orientation. Our practice is also to recommend they limit their purposes so that they are prohibited from proselytising outside New Zealand.

The estimated financial implications of adding the three charities recommended in this report are shown in Table 2. The financial implications will be treated as a forecasting change and reflects the increasing cost of the decisions in 1962 and 1978 to allow donations to New Zealand-based charitable overseas aid organisations to be eligible for tax benefits. The revenue estimates are based on projections made by the charities about the monetary donations they expect to receive for the forecast period. There is no impact on the Tax Policy Scorecard.

We recommend that the attached Cabinet paper should be proactively released without redaction. The release of the unredacted paper and associated Cabinet minutes should be delayed until the introduction of the proposed March 2020 omnibus taxation bill , which contains the necessary amendments to give effect to the recommendations in this report. Next steps 50. Subject to your decisions about the charities discussed in this report, officials recommend that you approve and lodge the attached paper for the Cabinet Economic Development Committee, seeking its agreement to give overseas donee status to the three charities and adding them to schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act. 51. For the paper to be considered by Cabinet Economic Development Committee at its meeting on 13 November 2019, it needs to be lodged with the Cabinet Office by 10 am, Thursday, 7 November 2019. 52. Speaking notes to support consideration of the paper on 13 November 2019 are attached to this report. 53. The charities will be advised of the outcome of their request for overseas donee status following Cabinet’s consideration. 54. We recommend that you refer a copy of the report and the attached Cabinet paper to the Minister of Finance, for his information. s 9(2)(b)(ii) IR2019/573 Cabinet paper: Overseas donee status: New additions for the next available taxation bill Page 11 of 11 IN CONFIDENCE IN CONFIDENCE Annex Table 3: Risks with giving overseas donee status New Zealand’s reputational risk The integrity of the tax system Precedent risk Political risk The Government faces a reputation risk if the “named” charity’s activities: • are seen to support or encourage criminal or terrorist activities, • involve trafficking of any form (for example, but not limited to, sex, children, or drugs), • are seen to support or encourage sectarian violence, • are seen to support or encourage civil disobedience, and • contravene the prevailing laws of the country in which the donee organisation operates. Schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act is a list of exceptions to the policy that tax benefits for donations should be limited to charities with New Zealand purposes. The tax benefits act as non- discretionary financial support for the named charity. This raises issues regarding: • consistency with the Government’s broad - base, low-rate revenue strategy; • fiscal cost; and • tax schemes that rely on tax benefits for donations. Approvals create expectations in the charitable sector about the way Cabinet’s criteria are interpreted. Charities’ own expectations about government endorsement of their activities. Decisions divert tax revenue that could otherwise be used on domestic spending programmes such as education and health. It is not uncommon for Ministers and Members of Parliament to be lobbied by the trustees of charities seeking to be added to schedule 32. Trustees of charities seeking inclusion on schedule 32 can be former Members of Parliament (or associates thereof). Whether the charity’s overseas purposes align with New Zealanders’ values. How risk is mitigated or treated • Officials review the charity’s deed and operating model. • Consultation with other government agencies. • Recommendations to approve overseas donee status are treated as policy decisions. • Ongoing work item on the tax policy work programme. • Approval process requires decisions at Ministerial and Executive levels. • Legislation is used to ensure Parliament’s endorsement of approvals. IN CONFIDENCE not in scope 1 In Confidence O ffice of the Minister of Revenue C hair, Cabinet Economic Development Committee O verseas Donee Status: New Additions for the Next Available Taxation Bill P roposal 1.This paper seeks the agreement of the Cabinet Economic Development Committee to gr ant overseas donee status to three New Zealand charities who provide charitable activities overseas, with effect from the 2020–21 income year (starting 1 April 2020) . M onetary donations to overseas donee organisations are eligible for tax benefits, such as the donation tax credit . E xecutive Summary 2.I recommend that the three New Zealand charities with overseas charitable purposes discussed in this paper are granted overseas donee status and listed in schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007, with application from the start of the 2020-21 income year. The necessary amendments would be included in the next available taxation bill, scheduled for introduction in March 2020. The charities are discussed in paragraphs 9 to 11. The purposes and activities carried on by the charities listed above fall withi n C abinet’s approval criteria (CM 78/14/7) as described in paragraph 6 and are involv ed i n the relief of poverty, or delivery of humanitarian aid and development. Background 3.New Zealand charities that support activities overseas and want their donors to be eligible for tax benefits (such as the donation tax credit) must be approved for overseas donee status and listed in schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act. Monetary donations t o l isted organisations entitle individual New Zealand taxpayers to a tax credit (donatio n tax credit) of 33 1 / 3 % of the amount donated, up to the level of their taxable income. Companies and Māori authorities are eligible for a deduction for cash donations up to the level of their net income. 4.Generally, the availability of tax benefits to donations is limited to charities with New Z ealand purposes only. Overseas donee status is therefore an established exception for a specific class of charity. Giving overseas donee status requires legislative change by adding the charity to schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act. Advice from the Legislativ e D esign and Advisory Committee in 2016 to the Inland Revenue Department has confirmed that the use of legislation to implement decisions to give overseas donee status is appropriate. There are 152 organisations listed in schedule 32. 5.Decisions to grant overseas donee status complement the Government’s overseas development efforts. 6.Cabinet has established criteria for granting overseas donee status. (i)the funds of the charity should be principally applied towards: 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-18 11:58:34 2. 2 the relief of poverty, hunger, sickness or the ravages of war or natural disaster; or the economy of developing countries\*; or raising the educational standards of a developing country\*; (ii) charities formed for the principal purpose of fostering or administering any religion, cult or political creed should not qualify; \* developing countries recognised by the United Nations. \[CM 78/14/7 refers\] Charities to be Granted Overseas Donee Status 7. I recommend that the charities named in paragraphs 9 to 11 be granted overseas donee status. The purposes of the recommended charities come within the criteria in paragraph 6. All the charities recommended in this paper have adequate procedures for the accountability of funds applied to projects and can demonstrate a track record of activity. All are registered under the Charities Act 2005. 8. The recommended charities are all managed in New Zealand and are seeking overseas donee status to grow their New Zealand donor bases and increase the scope and scale of their in-country activities. Active Hearts Foundation 9. Active Hearts Foundation formalised in 2017 the charitable activities of a group of New Zealand trekking guides, which were directed at improving living conditions and education outcomes in Nepalese villages in the Himalayas. Key projects to date have involved disaster relief following the 2015, 2018 and 2019 earthquakes, refitting and resourcing school libraries, resourcing community health clinics, and ensuring the resilience of local infrastructure including an irrigation pipeline for food production. Kiwilink 10. Kiwilink was formally established as a charitable trust in August 2018 to separate humanitarian projects formerly undertaken within the Associated Churches of Christ New Zealand, and continue to undertake missions with a particular focus on Zimbabwe and Vanuatu. Recent work undertaken by the Trust in Zimbabwe includes collaborating with local charities to provide orphan care, student bursaries, and the drilling of water boreholes in the Zvishavane region in South Western Zimbabwe. In Vanuatu, the Trust has worked on the relocation of people in the Ambae region displaced by volcanic activity, and the provision of first-aid supplies and a water storage tank at the Noui Noui Hospital. Shimshal Trust 11. Shimshal Trust was set up in 2003 to support education outcomes and the relief of poverty for communities and villages in the Northern region of Pakistan (Shimshal). The principal focus of the Trust is to fund scholarships to help local students with promising ability, but no financial support, to attend high school or university. The Trust also provides financial support to community aid and development projects when donor resources allow. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-18 11:58:34 3 Consultation 12. The Treasury, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Pacific and Development Group), and the Department of Internal Affairs – Charities Services have been consulted as part of the preparation of this paper. Consultation with these agencies did not identify any concerns with the charities recommended in this paper. The New Zealand Police’s vetting service was also used for the trustees of the charities recommended in this report. 13. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Pacific and Development Group) notes that it does not have any direct knowledge of the activities carried out by the three charities discussed in this report, and none of the charities are accredited for its various partnership funds. 1 Fiscal Implications 14. The estimated financial implications of granting overseas donee status to the three charities recommended in this report are shown below. The financial implications will be treated as a forecasting change and reflect the increasing cost of the decision to allow donations to New Zealand-based charitable overseas aid organisations to be eligible for tax benefits. The revenue estimates are based on projections made by the charities about the monetary donations they expect to receive for the forecast period. $million – increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2019–20 2020–21 2021–22 2022–23 2023–24 & outyears Crown Revenue and Receipts: Tax Revenue (0.000) (0.095) (0.100) (0.101) (0.103) Operating balance impact 0.000 0.095 0.100 0.101 0.103 Legislative Implications 15. Granting overseas donee status to the named charities will require changes to the Income Tax Act 2007. I recommend that the necessary amendments are included in the next omnibus taxation bill scheduled for introduction in March 2020 with effect from the 2020–21 income year (starting 1 April 2020). Impact Analysis 16. The Regulatory Quality Team at the Treasury has determined that the regulatory decisions sought in this paper are exempt from the requirement to provide a Regulatory Impact Assessment as they have no or minor impacts on businesses, individuals or not- for-profit entities. 1 For example, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s New Zealand aid programmes: the New Zealand Partnerships for International Development Fund (Partnerships Fund), the Sustainable Development Fund, the New Zealand Disaster Response Partnership (NZDRP), and the Pacific Island Countries Participation Fund (PIC Fund). 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-18 11:58:34 4 Human Rights 17. The changes I am recommending in this paper do not have any implications in relation to the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 or the Human Rights Act 1993. Publicity 18. I will make an announcement about the three charities as part of the content of the relevant taxation bill when it is introduced into the House. Inland Revenue will publish details of the new legislation in a Tax Information Bulletin once the tax bill containing the amendments is enacted. Once Cabinet has made its decisions on granting overseas donee status, officials will inform each organisation of the relevant decision. Proactive Release 19. I propose to delay the proactive release of this Cabinet paper, without redaction, and associated Cabinet minutes until the introduction of the proposed omnibus taxation bill which contains the necessary amendments to give effect to the proposal. The expected introduction date for this bill is March 2020. Recommendations The Minister of Revenue recommends that the Cabinet Economic Development Committee: 1. Agree that the following charities are given overseas donee status and listed in schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007: 1.1 Active Hearts Foundation 1.2 Kiwilink 1.3 Shimshal Trust 2. Agree that the charities named in recommendation 1 are given overseas donee status from the 2020–21 and following income years (starting 1 April 2020). 3.

In Confidence IR2019 /351; T2019/2932: GST and telecommunications services – summary of submissions and policy recommendations Page 1 of 13 IN CONFIDENCE 17 September 2019 Minister of Finance Minister of Revenue GST and telecommunications services – summary of submissions and policy recommendations Executive summary 1. This report summarises the feedback received on the recent issues paper GST and telecommunications services. Furthermore, this report seeks your agreement to GST being added at the standard rate of 15% to outbound mobile roaming services received by New Zealand residents travelling overseas (as proposed in the issues paper) and to delay the application date from 1 October 2020 to either 1 October 2021 or, the later of 1 April 2021 or 6 months after enactment. Consultation 2. Submissions on the issues paper were received from Deloitte (on behalf of Spark, Vodafone and 2Degrees), CA ANZ, CTG, EY, KPMG and PwC. Officials have continued to consult with Deloitte and representatives of the telecommunications industry since the close of submissions. 3. PwC supported the proposal. EY supported the proposal in principle but were concerned the benefits would be outweighed by the additional compliance costs. 4. The telecommunications industry, Deloitte, CA ANZ, CTG and KPMG all expressed opposition to the proposal to add GST to outbound roaming services received by New Zealand residents overseas. The telecommunications industry’s preference is for the current rules, in which neither outbound or inbound roaming are subject to GST, to be maintained. 5. A key reason for the opposition is that they considered the proposal to be contrary to the destination principle. Under the destination principle GST should generally apply in the country in which consumption occurs. They consider outbound roaming services to be consumed outside New Zealand. Applying GST to inbound roaming services 6. Given the concerns raised around applying GST to outbound roaming services being inconsistent with the destination principle, officials have also considered options for applying GST to inbound roaming services received by non-residents in New Zealand. 7. Applying GST to the actual inbound roaming services supplied by foreign telecommunications suppliers to non-resident visitors in New Zealand is unlikely to be a practical option. As an alternative, GST could instead be applied to the wholesale roaming services supplied by New Zealand resident telecommunications suppliers to foreign telecommunications suppliers. These services enable the customers of foreign telecommunications suppliers to roam in New Zealand. 8. Applying GST to wholesale roaming charges would embed unrecoverable GST in the price of inbound roaming services. However, the margins charged by foreign telecommunications suppliers for inbound roaming services in New Zealand would In Confidence IR2019 /351; T2019/2932: GST and telecommunications services – summary of submissions and policy recommendations Page 2 of 13 IN CONFIDENCE remain untaxed. This option would also not be consistent with the principle of business neutrality as it would add unrecoverable GST to the price of inbound roaming received by non-residents in New Zealand. Policy recommendations 9. Officials do not consider the status quo to be a principled option as, under a broad- based GST framework, either outbound or inbound roaming services should be subject to New Zealand GST. 10. On balance officials still recommend applying GST to outbound roaming services as it is more consistent with New Zealand’s broad-based GST framework and the principle of business neutrality than applying GST to wholesale roaming services. 11. Furthermore, while there is not yet a consistent approach to the treatment of roaming services internationally, in light of the OECD’s GST/VAT Guidelines and the approach to roaming services taken in Europe (that is to apply GST to outbound roaming), officials consider it likely that applying GST to outbound roaming services may become a more common approach internationally. Application date 12. The issues paper proposed an application date of 1 October 2020. However, the telecommunications industry has indicated that they will not start developing and testing systems changes until the legislation is passed. Assuming the proposals are enacted before the next general election, this means they may have only a month or two to make systems changes following the changes being enacted. Furthermore, there is a risk that if the proposals are not enacted before the next general election, enactment may not occur until closer to March 2021. 13. Given the compliance costs of making systems changes, including the potential opportunity cost of diverting resources from other systems changes, officials recommend delaying application by 12 months to 1 October 2021. Alternatively, application could be delayed to the later of 1 April 2021 or 6 months after enactment. Financial implications 14. Budget 2019 forecast the proposal to increase GST revenue by $26 million per annum. Owing to budget secrecy officials were unable to consult with the telecommunications industry prior to Budget 2019 on this revenue forecast. 15. During consultation, Deloitte and the telecommunications industry provided data that indicates the revenue estimate for the proposal should actually be $7.041 million per annum. Officials consider this to be a more accurate revenue estimate and therefore recommend forecasts be adjusted. 16. There will be a fiscal cost if the application date is delayed, as the timing of the revenue impact will be different to what was agreed to in Budget 2019. A delay to 1 October 2021 will cost $7.041 million and a delay to 1 April 2021 would cost $3.520 million. The foregone revenue would be a charge against the between- Budget Contingency. Next steps 17. Once Ministers make decisions and Cabinet approval is obtained, the proposed changes could be included in the next available tax bill. This bill is currently scheduled for introduction in the first quarter of 2020.

On 8 April 2019 Cabinet agreed as part of Budget 2019 to repeal the special rules in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the GST Act) for telecommunications services and align the GST treatment of most of these services with the treatment of other remote services (refer DEV-19-MIN-0059). Special rules were also proposed for the use of local SIM cards or mobile devices and for specific services such as making a call from a phone booth. 28. The proposal was not intended to change the GST treatment of most telecommunications services. However, the proposed rules would result in outbound roaming services received by New Zealand residents travelling overseas becoming subject to GST at the standard rate of 15%. This contrasts with the status quo in which both outbound and inbound roaming services are not subject to GST. 1 Consultation 29. Following Budget 2019, the issues paper GST on telecommunications services was released on 17 May 2018 to consult on the technical details of the proposal to align the treatment of telecommunications services with the treatment of other remote services. 30. Submissions closed on 28 June and in total 6 submissions were received from Deloitte (on behalf of Vodafone, Spark and 2Degrees), CA ANZ, CTG, KPMG, PwC and EY. Since submissions closed officials have continued to consult with Deloitte and representatives of the telecommunications industry. 31. The consultation process was heavily criticised by submitters and the telecommunications industry and was considered inconsistent with the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP). In particular, it was noted that the proposals were first announced as part of Budget 2019 with no prior consultation on the merits of the proposal. 32. Officials agree that the consultation process was not ideal as Budget secrecy prevented the GTPP being followed. However, the telecommunications industry appears to be appreciative of the further consultation that has been conducted since submissions closed. Support for the proposal 33. PwC expressed support for the proposal as they consider it consistent with the OECD’s International VAT/GST Guidelines. EY expressed in principle support for the proposal but was concerned that the benefits would be outweighed by the compliance costs. Opposition to the proposal 34. The submissions from Deloitte (on behalf of Spark, 2Degrees and Vodafone), CA ANZ, CTG and KPMG were all strongly opposed to the proposal to add GST to outbound roaming services. In further consultation with the telecommunications industry they have regularly expressed their opposition to the proposal and indicated that they will strongly oppose the proposal if it is included in a subsequent Bill, in particular at the select committee stage. 35. The key argument raised in opposition to the proposal was that, as outbound roaming services can only be consumed outside New Zealand, it would be contrary 1 Inbound roaming services may, in certain circumstances, be subject to GST but these circumstances rarely arise. In Confidence IR2019 /351; T2019/2932: GST and telecommunications services – summary of submissions and policy recommendations Page 6 of 13 IN CONFIDENCE to the destination principle to apply New Zealand GST to outbound roaming services received by New Zealand residents overseas. Under the destination principle, GST should generally apply in the jurisdiction in which consumption occurs. 36. In arguing that it is inappropriate to apply GST to outbound roaming the telecommunications industry and some other submitters also argued that roaming services are on-the-spot services and not remote services as a consumer needs to be in the vicinity of a cell tower to receive the service. However, officials consider it is correct to classify roaming services as remote services. 37. Other issues raised in opposition to the proposal included the compliance costs for the telecommunications industry and whether the approach taken to roaming services in Europe should be considered international best practice. The revenue estimate of $26 million per annum was also questioned, with Deloitte and the telecommunications industry subsequently providing data to show the revenue estimate should be approximately $7 million per annum. Alternative options for applying GST to inbound roaming services 38. Given the concerns raised in submissions around applying GST to outbound roaming being inconsistent with the destination principle, officials have considered whether it would instead be more appropriate to apply GST to inbound roaming services. However, on balance officials still consider it more appropriate to apply GST to outbound roaming services as originally proposed in the issues paper. 39. GST could be applied to inbound roaming services in one of two ways. These are: 39.1 Applying GST to the actual inbound roaming services supplied by foreign telecommunications suppliers. This would require foreign telecommunications suppliers to register for GST in New Zealand if the roaming services they supply in New Zealand exceed $60,000 per annum. 39.2 Applying GST to the wholesale roaming services supplied by New Zealand telecommunications suppliers to foreign telecommunications suppliers to enable customers of foreign telecommunications suppliers to roam in New Zealand. This would result in New Zealand GST becoming embedded in the price of inbound roaming services but would not add GST to the actual inbound roaming services. 40. Officials do not consider it practical to apply GST to the actual inbound roaming services. Many telecommunications suppliers sell global or regional roaming packs that allow a consumer to roam in multiple jurisdictions for a single fee. At the time of supply the telecommunication supplier will not know which jurisdiction a consumer will consume the roaming services in. Furthermore, a consumer may consume the roaming services in multiple jurisdictions. If the actual inbound roaming services were subject to GST it would therefore be likely to cause telecommunications suppliers significant issues in attempting to apportion roaming charges between the different jurisdictions in which a customer consumed the roaming service. Wholesale roaming services 41. Given applying GST to the actual inbound roaming services is unlikely to be practical, an alternative way of adding GST to inbound roaming could be to apply GST to the wholesale roaming services supplied by New Zealand telecommunications suppliers to foreign telecommunications suppliers to enable the foreign telecommunications suppliers’ customers to roam in New Zealand. This would result in unrecoverable GST being embedded in the price of roaming services In Confidence IR2019 /351; T2019/2932: GST and telecommunications services – summary of submissions and policy recommendations Page 7 of 13 IN CONFIDENCE received by non-residents travelling in New Zealand. The diagram below illustrates how applying GST to wholesale roaming charges would work. 42. As can be seen in the above diagram, applying GST to the wholesale roaming charges would add GST on to the services NZ Telco supplies to OZ Telco to allow OZ Telco’s customers to roam in New Zealand. There is no GST on the actual supply of roaming to OZ Telco’s customer. However, GST is embedded in the price of the roaming services received by OZ Telco’s customer as OZ Telco is unable to claim an input tax deduction for the GST they paid to NZ Telco. 43. Based on data provided by Deloitte and the telecommunications industry, applying GST to wholesale roaming services would raise $3.8 million in GST revenue per annum. Should GST apply to outbound roaming or wholesale roaming services? 44. There are advantages and disadvantages of applying GST to either outbound roaming services or wholesale roaming services. These advantages and disadvantages are discussed below. 45. On balance officials still recommend applying GST to outbound roaming services. However, applying GST to wholesale roaming services is also considered preferable to the status quo. Destination principle 46. Under the destination principle, GST or VAT should generally apply in the jurisdiction in which consumption occurs. As noted above, the telecommunications industry (and some other submissions) considered it contrary to the destination principle to apply GST to outbound roaming services as, by definition, a New Zealand resident needs to be outside New Zealand to receive roaming services. NZ Telco OZ Telco Customer of OZ telco Connection to NZ Telco’s network Roaming services Wholesale roaming services $11.50 (incl. GST) $15 (no GST) $1.50 GST In Confidence IR2019 /351; T2019/2932: GST and telecommunications services – summary of submissions and policy recommendations Page 8 of 13 IN CONFIDENCE 47. It could be argued that consumption of outbound roaming services occurs in New Zealand as roaming allows a person to maintain their New Zealand mobile number and use their New Zealand mobile plan. However, applying GST to wholesale roaming services does appear to be more consistent with the destination principle. 48. It should be noted that there are circumstances in which it is appropriate to depart from the destination principle. For example, remote services are subject to GST if supplied to a New Zealand resident, regardless of the physical location of the consumer. This means that New Zealand GST would apply if a New Zealand resident downloads a movie while on holiday in Australia. This departure from the destination principle is considered appropriate as the supplier may not know the location of the consumer and therefore the consumer’s residency is considered an appropriate proxy for the most likely place of consumption. 49. As roaming services are a type of remote service it could be argued that the same rationale for departing from the destination principle applies. However, the telecommunications industry has argued that this rationale does not apply as the supplier of outbound roaming services will always know the consumer is outside New Zealand. Broad-based GST framework 50. Under New Zealand’s broad-based GST framework all goods and services should be subject to GST. The question is whether any particular supply of goods and services should be subject to GST in New Zealand or alternatively, another jurisdiction. 51. Under the status quo, neither outbound roaming or inbound roaming services are subject to New Zealand GST. In principle, under the broad-based GST framework, either outbound or inbound roaming services should be subject to New Zealand GST. 52. Applying GST to outbound roaming services would be consistent with this framework as GST would be added to the entire price of outbound roaming services. 53. In contrast, while an improvement on the status quo, applying GST to wholesale roaming services would not be entirely consistent with the broad-based GST framework. Applying GST to wholesale roaming charges would embed GST in the price of inbound roaming services, however, the margin charged by non-resident telecommunications suppliers would remain untaxed. While the margins charged for inbound roaming services are unknown, the difference in revenue estimates for applying GST to outbound roaming services ($7.041 million per annum) and wholesale roaming services ($3.8 million per annum) suggests that these margins form a significant part of the price of inbound roaming services. As such, it is likely that applying GST to wholesale roaming services would result in a significant portion of the price of inbound roaming remaining untaxed. Business neutrality 54. The principle of business neutrality is that GST should be borne by final consumers and should not be a cost to businesses. 55. Applying GST to outbound roaming services would be consistent with this principle as GST-registered businesses that pay GST on outbound roaming services would be able to claim back this GST as an input tax deduction. 56. In contrast, applying GST to wholesale roaming services would not be consistent with the business neutrality principle. Under this option, non-recoverable GST would be embedded in the price of inbound roaming services. As such, this non- In Confidence IR2019 /351; T2019/2932: GST and telecommunications services – summary of submissions and policy recommendations Page 9 of 13 IN CONFIDENCE recoverable embedded GST would be a cost to non-resident businesses that receive roaming services in New Zealand. 57. The telecommunications industry also raised concerns that applying GST to wholesale roaming services would not be consistent with business neutrality as, for this option to work as intended, a rule would be needed to prevent non-resident telecommunications suppliers from claiming back the GST on the wholesale roaming services. International consistency 58. Applying GST to outbound roaming services would be consistent with the approach taken most prominently in the European Union (EU) and United Kingdom. However, it would not be consistent with a number of other jurisdictions that apply GST to wholesale roaming charges. 59. The submission from Deloitte provided a list of 80 jurisdictions that charge GST, VAT or a local sales tax on inbound roaming. We understand that these taxes are generally levied on the wholesale roaming charges rather than the actual inbound roaming services. The list of countries provided by Deloitte included Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Canada, Egypt, Ghana, Indonesia, Japan, Namibia, Panama, Thailand, Vietnam and Zimbabwe. As such, applying GST to wholesale roaming services would be consistent with the approach taken in these countries. 60. As there is no uniform international approach applying GST to either outbound roaming services or wholesale roaming services would result in partial double taxation in certain circumstances. For example, if New Zealand GST applied to outbound roaming then there would be partial double taxation of the roaming services a New Zealand resident receives in Egypt. Conversely, if New Zealand GST applied to wholesale roaming services there would be partial double taxation of the roaming services EU residents receive in New Zealand. In both cases the double taxation is only partial as the margin charged by the telecommunications supplier for the actual roaming services would only be taxed once. 61. The telecommunications industry and submissions from Deloitte, CA ANZ, KPMG and CTG argued that the approach taken to roaming services in Europe should not be considered international best practice. It was noted that a number of features unique to the EU means New Zealand should not necessarily adopt rules consistent with the EU. These include the ease of cross-border travel within Europe and the existence of EU wide rules for mobile roaming in a broader context than VAT. 62. The telecommunications industry argue that, as New Zealand’s telecommunications context is more similar to Australia (where both outbound and inbound roaming are not subject to GST), New Zealand should maintain rules consistent with Australia. However, Australia has not formally considered this issue in recent years. 63. Fo r many (but not all) of the countries on the list provided by Deloitte their GST/VAT rules for telecommunications services pre-date the OECD finalising its guidelines for taxing remote services. It is unclear whether these countries have made a considered decision to maintain their pre-existing rules for telecommunications services or if they have simply not reviewed these rules yet in light of the OECD’s Guidelines. 64. Given the OECD has now finalised its VAT/GST guidelines and the EU has moved to apply GST to outbound roaming services, officials consider it more likely that, going forward, more countries will start applying GST to outbound roaming than wholesale roaming services. In Confidence IR2019 /351; T2019/2932: GST and telecommunications services – summary of submissions and policy recommendations Page 10 of 13 IN CONFIDENCE Compliance costs 65. Both options would impose compliance costs on the telecommunications industry. The billing systems of telecommunications suppliers are complex as they need to operate in real time to ensure a person is correctly charged as they use the network. As such, while changing outbound roaming or wholesale roaming services from a zero-rated supply to a standard rated supply is itself a simple change, the telecommunications suppliers would need to do extensive testing to ensure the change does not cause any issues for their billing systems. 66. Spark, Vodafone and 2Degrees have therefore estimated that the costs of changing and testing their systems to apply GST to outbound roaming services would collectively be approximately $1 million. They have not quantified the cost of changing and testing their systems to apply GST to wholesale roaming charges but consider that these costs are not insignificant. Officials note that the costs associated with changing and testing systems would be a one-off cost for the telecommunications industry under either option. 67. The telecommunications industry has also indicated that changing their billing systems to charge GST on either outbound roaming or wholesale roaming services could require them to divert resources from other systems changes. One systems change the telecommunications industry suggested could be impacted by needing to divert resources was the roll-out of 5G. 68. In addition to the costs of changing and testing systems, both options would impose some additional compliance costs on the telecommunications industry. If GST is applied to outbound roaming telecommunications suppliers would incur costs associated with notifying their customers of the change in the GST treatment of outbound roaming. In contrast, applying GST to wholesale roaming services would require New Zealand telecommunications suppliers to review and potentially re- negotiate their contracts with foreign telecommunications suppliers. Policy recommendations 69. Roaming services are a form of consumption and therefore, under New Zealand’s broad-based GST framework, GST should apply to one of outbound or inbound roaming services. As such, officials do not consider the status quo to be a principled option. 70. On balance officials recommend applying GST to outbound roaming services. While applying GST to outbound roaming services is less consistent with the destination principle, it is more consistent with New Zealand’s broad-based GST framework and the principle of business neutrality. Furthermore, while there is no clear international consensus at this stage, officials consider that, in light of the OECD’s VAT/GST Guidelines and the approach taken by the EU, applying GST to outbound roaming services is more likely to become the common approach worldwide. 71. If Ministers agree to apply GST to outbound roaming services, officials will consult with the industry as to the best way this should be drafted in legislation. 72. Although officials prefer applying GST to outbound roaming services, applying GST to wholesale roaming services is also considered preferable to the status quo. Telecommunications industry’s views 73. The telecommunications industry’s strong preference is for the status quo to be maintained. They note that while it is not a conceptually pure option, the existing rules for telecommunications services have been working well. As such, they do not consider that the amount of revenue that would be collected under either option In Confidence IR2019 /351; T2019/2932: GST and telecommunications services – summary of submissions and policy recommendations Page 11 of 13 IN CONFIDENCE would justify the compliance costs that changing the rules would impose. Furthermore, they consider that applying GST to either outbound roaming services or wholesale roaming services would also be a compromise on GST policy principles. They therefore consider the status quo to be less of a compromise overall when considering a pure GST framework. 74. Out of applying GST to outbound roaming services or wholesale roaming services the industry has expressed a preference for applying GST to wholesale roaming charges as they consider their compliance costs under this option would be lower. Officials also note that, relative to applying GST to outbound roaming services, applying GST to wholesale roaming services would also result in a reduced GST liability for the telecommunications industry. Application date 75. The issues paper proposed a 1 October 2020 application date for the proposal. The next tax bill is scheduled for introduction in the first quarter of 2020 and we understand this bill could be passed before the next general election. As such, a 1 October 2020 application date may be achievable without retrospective application. 76. However, if the bill is not passed before the election the application date would need to be delayed. Depending on post-election legislative priorities, the bill may not end up being passed until nearer to March 2021. 2 77. The telecommunications industry has indicated that they do not intend to start making systems changes to collect GST on outbound roaming services until legislation has been passed. Assuming enactment is achieved before the next general election, this would only give the industry at most 1 or 2 months to make the necessary systems changes. Given the above uncertainty, and the time required to make and test systems changes, the industry has suggested that a delayed application date would be appropriate if the proposal were to proceed. 78. Given these factors, officials recommend that the application date should be delayed. Officials consider a delay of 12 months to 1 October 2021 would be appropriate as this would give the telecommunications industry sufficient time to make systems changes and also minimise any potential opportunity cost from needing to divert resources from other systems changes. A 12-month delay would also mitigate any impacts that may arise if the next tax bill to be introduced to the House is not enacted before the next election. 79. Alternatively, application could be delayed to the later of 1 April 2021 or 6 months after enactment. This would be only a 6-month delay if the bill is enacted by 1 October 2020 but would be a longer delay if the next tax bill is unable to be enacted by then. Financial implications Changes to Budget 2019 forecasts 80. Budget 2019 forecasts estimated the proposal to apply GST to outbound roaming services to increase revenue by $26 million per annum. This estimate was based on the amount of zero-rated supplies made by Spark, Vodafone and 2 Degrees and an assumption that 85% of these zero-rated supplies were roaming services. Due to budget secrecy we were unable to consult with the telecommunications industry on the revenue estimate, so the 85% assumption was based on Inland Revenue’s experience dealing with the industry. 2 The bill will contain annual rates so will need to be passed before 1 April 2021. In Confidence IR2019 /351; T2019/2932: GST and telecommunications services – summary of submissions and policy recommendations Page 12 of 13 IN CONFIDENCE 81. The submission from Deloitte suggested that this estimate had been overstated and would be $7.041 million per annum. This figure was based on Spark, Vodafone and 2Degrees each providing Deloitte with their total amount of outbound roaming supplies per year determined on a transaction by transaction basis ($86.620 million). From this it was calculated that the gross GST that would be collected under the proposal would be $12.993 million. 82. However, GST-registered businesses paying GST on the outbound roaming services they receive would be able to claim back this GST as an input tax deduction. As such, each telecommunications company also provided Deloitte with a split of the roaming services supplied to commercial and consumer accounts respectively. In total $46.940 million of roaming services was supplied to consumer accounts and $39.680 million was supplied to commercial accounts. Deloitte therefore calculated that the net GST that would be collected under the proposal would be $7.041 million. 83. As the estimate provided by Deloitte is based on actual figures on the telecommunications industry’s amount of roaming supplies, officials consider it to be more accurate than the estimate included in Budget 2019. Therefore, forecasts should be adjusted to reflect this change. 84. This change will result in $71.096 million foregone revenue from the proposal over the current forecast period compared to Budget 2019 forecasts. The impact of the forecast adjustment can be shown in the table below: $m – increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue Minister for Revenue 2019/20 2020/21 2021/22 2022/23 2023/24 & Outyears Current Budget 2019 forecasts GST Revenue Revised forecasts GST Revenue - - 19.5000 5.281 26.000 7.041 26.000 7.041 26.000 7.041 Difference impacting total Operating balance - 14.219 18.959 18.959 18.959 85. The above change will be reflected as a forecast adjustment and does not need to be accounted for. Option to delay application date 86. If Ministers decide to delay the application date, there will be a fiscal cost as the timing of the revenue impact will be different to what was agreed to in Budget 2019. 87. Agreeing to delay the application date to 1 October 2021 will have a fiscal cost of $7.041 million compared to the revised forecasts, as shown in the table below.

Agreeing to delay the application date to the later of 1 April 2021 or 6 months after enactment will have a fiscal cost of $3.520 million compared to the revised forecasts as shown in the table below. 3 $m – increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue Minister for Revenue 2019/20 2020/21 2021/22 2022/23 2023/24 & Outyears Revised forecasts GST Revenue 1 April 2021 option GST Revenue - - 5.281 1.761 7.041 7.041 7.041 7.041 7.041 7.041 Difference impacting total Operating balance - 3.520 - - - 89. The foregone revenue due to delaying the application date would be a charge against the between-Budget Contingency. Consultation 90. The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) have been consulted on this report. 91. MFAT advises that applying GST to either outbound roaming or wholesale roaming services is consistent with New Zealand’s international trade obligations. Next steps 92. Any changes to the GST rules for telecommunications services can be included in the next tax bill currently scheduled for introduction in the first quarter of 2020. Once Ministers have made decisions on whether GST should apply to outbound roaming or wholesale roaming services, and whether the application date should be delayed, officials will begin drafting the necessary changes to the GST Act. 93. Cabinet approval will also be required regardless of what decisions are made given the change in forecast revenue figures. This approval could be obtained in either a standalone paper or as part of an omnibus Cabinet paper containing other items for inclusion in the next tax bill. 3 An assumption has been made that under this option the application date would be 1 April 2021. If enactment is not received by 1 October 2020 the forecasts would need to be further adjusted.

This report asks you to approve the attached Cabinet paper and lodge it with the Cabinet Office by 10am Thursday 14 November 2019 for consideration at the Cabinet Economic Development Committee (DEV Committee) meeting on Wednesday 20 November 2019. 2. The Cabinet paper seeks agreement to a number of miscellaneous measures that require changes to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the GST Act). In particular the paper seeks Cabinet’s approval to: 2.1 Confirm the earlier Cabinet decision to apply GST to outbound mobile roaming services (refer DEV-19-MIN-0059). 2.2 Provide more flexibility around how the GST Act is amended to apply GST to outbound mobile roaming services. 2.3 Delay the application date for the changes to the GST rules for telecommunications services to 1 April 2021. 2.4 Allow credit notes to be used to claim back the full amount of GST included in a supply that was incorrectly standard rated (subject to GST at 15%) but should have been zero-rated (subject to GST at 0%) or been exempt. 2.5 Introduce a “time bar” from the date of a supply in which a credit note may be issued. 3. Once Cabinet approval has been obtained the necessary legislative amendments would be included in the next available omnibus taxation bill, currently scheduled for introduction in March 2020. GST and telecommunications services 4. We reported to you on 17 September on consultation and final policy recommendations on the proposed changes to the GST rules for telecommunications services (refer IR2019/351). Since then you and the Minister of Finance have indicated that you have agreed to apply GST to outbound roaming services (as originally proposed) and to delay the application date by six months to 1 April 2021. The Cabinet paper seeks Cabinet’s approval of these decisions. 5. Prior to consultation Cabinet had agreed to apply GST to outbound roaming services by specifically repealing the special GST rules applying to telecommunications services and aligning the treatment of most telecommunications services with the treatment of other remote services (refer DEV-19- MIN -0059). However, through consultation the telecommunications industry indicated that they consider the current special GST rules for telecommunications services to be operating well. Therefore, instead of repealing these special rules, GST could instead be applied to outbound roaming services by introducing a new provision deeming outbound mobile roaming services to be subject to GST at the standard rate of 15%. The Cabinet paper therefore seeks Cabinet’s agreement to provide flexibility around how GST is applied to outbound roaming services. Officials will then further consult with In Confidence IR2019 /569: Cabinet paper – GST amendments for inclusion in the next omnibus taxation bill Page 2 of 4 IN CONFIDENCE tax practitioners and the telecommunications industry on how best to draft the changes to the GST Act. Credit Notes 6. In response to a large GST refund request from a taxpayer, Inland Revenue has recently interpreted how the GST credit note provisions apply in cases where the GST registered business standard rated (applied 15% GST) a supply of goods and services which should in fact have been exempt (e.g. a financial service) or zero- rated (e.g. an export). 7. Inland Revenue’s interpretations of the current law have raised two policy issues. Officials recommend that policy and Cabinet decisions should be sought on these issues prior to public consultation as consulting on the second issue before legislation is introduced may create a fiscal risk. To manage this risk the proposed solution could apply from the date it is announced (for example the date that the bill containing the proposed amendment is introduced). Issue one: Correct amount of GST adjustment 8. Firstly, the recent interpretation provides, from a policy perspective, an incorrect GST adjustment in situations where a supply was standard-rated but should have been exempt or zero-rated. This is because, according to the interpretation, the GST adjustment is limited to the tax fraction (3/23rds) of the adjusted price. 9. For example, consider a supply of $100 plus $15 which was incorrectly charged as GST. The supply should have been exempt or zero-rated (no GST). In this situation, the correct policy outcome would be for the supplier to issue a credit note and make an adjustment for the incorrectly returned $15. The recipient (if GST registered) would then make an adjustment for $15 incorrectly claimed. 10. However, according to the recent interpretation, the GST adjustment is instead limited to the tax fraction (3/23rds) of the price adjustment. Since the price adjustment is $15, the GST adjustment is limited to $1.96 (3/23 x $15) rather than $15. 11. This interpretation would not accommodate common commercial practices whereby GST registered persons issue credit notes to provide a $15 GST adjustment (rather than amending the original return). Although GST registered persons can request approval from Inland Revenue to amend their original GST return to get the correct $15 GST adjustment, this approach is inferior to using a credit note as it involves additional compliance costs and administrative costs for the registered persons. Issue two: Application of the time bar to credit notes 12. The second issue concerns whether the “time bar” is effective at limiting GST refunds which arise due to credit note adjustments. The ability to adjust a GST return to claim a GST refund is “time-barred” which means a GST registered person can only claim a GST refund in respect of GST returns that were filed less than 4 (or in cases of a clear mistake or simple oversight less than 8) years prior to the current date. 13. In contrast, because the credit note is issued on the current date, the time bar may be ineffective in respect of a credit note adjustment. This poses a potentially large fiscal risk as it means a GST registered person may be able to use credit notes to claim large GST refunds if they discovered they had been applying an incorrect GST treatment for a long time (e.g. more than 8 years). This would be contrary to the policy intent of the time bar on GST refunds. In Confidence IR2019 /569: Cabinet paper – GST amendments for inclusion in the next omnibus taxation bill Page 3 of 4 IN CONFIDENCE 14. There is an existing provision that applies a 7 year “time bar” to credit notes that are issued as a result of when a land sale was incorrectly standard-rated less than 7 years ago. 15. A time limit from the date of a supply could also be introduced for other cases where a credit note is used. This time limit could be aligned with the 4 year (or 8 year in cases of a clear mistake or simple oversight) time bar that applies to GST refunds which are made through amendments to GST returns. 16. We recommend including amendments in the next taxation Bill to address both of these GST credit note issues. Financial implications 17. The proposed changes to the credit note provisions would not have any fiscal impacts. Allowing credit notes to be used to claim back the full amount of GST included in a supply that has been incorrectly standard rated aligns with a common commercial practice. Introducing a time bar for credit notes would mitigate a potential fiscal risk but would not increase baselines. 18. As noted in the report on 17 September, delaying the application date of the changes to the GST rules for telecommunications services by six months to 1 April 2021 would have a fiscal cost of $3.520 million. This would be a charge against the tax policy scorecard. Consultation 19. The Treasury has been consulted in the preparation of this report and the attached Cabinet paper. Next steps 20. The attached Cabinet paper will need to be lodged with the Cabinet office by 10am Thursday 14 November for consideration at the DEV Committee meeting on 20 November. Once Cabinet approval has been received officials will begin drafting the necessary changes to the GST Act for inclusion in the next taxation bill, currently scheduled for introduction in March 2020.

In particular, this paper seeks the Committee’s agreement to: 3.1 Confirm the earlier Cabinet decision to apply GST to outbound mobile roaming se rvices (refer DEV-19-MIN-0059). 3.2 Provide flexibility around how the GST Act is amended to apply GST to outbound mobile roaming services. 3.3 Delay the application date for the changes to the GST rules for telecommunications services to 1 April 2021 (from 1 October 2020 as previously agreed by Cabinet (refer DEV-19-MIN-0059)). 3.4 Allow credit notes to be used to claim back the full amount of GST included in a supply that was incorrectly standard rated (subject to GST at 15%) but should have been zero-rated (subject to GST at 0%) or been exempt. 3.5 Introduce a provision to apply a time limit from the date of a supply in which a cre dit note may be issued. GST and telecommunications services Background 4.Currently GST does not apply to either outbound mobile roaming services received b y New Zealand residents travelling overseas or inbound mobile roaming services received by non-residents in New Zealand. As such, on 8 April 2019 Cabinet agreed as part of Budget 2019 to repeal the special rules in the GST Act for telecommunications services and align the GST treatment of most of these services with the treatment of other remote services (refer DEV-19-MIN-0059). These proposed changes to the GST rules for telecommunications services were not 1 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:41:50 3. intended to change the GST treatment of most telecommunications services. However, it would result in outbound mobile roaming services becoming subject to GST at the standard rate of 15%. 5. Special rules were also proposed for particular situations such as a New Zealand resident using a foreign SIM card while travelling overseas and services such as making a call from a phone booth. 6. Cabinet agreed to an application date of 1 October 2020 for the proposed changes. 7. Following Budget 2019, the issues paper GST on telecommunications services was released to consult on the technical details of the proposed rules. 8. Submissions closed on 28 June and in total six submissions were received from Deloitte (on behalf of Vodafone, Spark and 2Degrees), Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand (CA ANZ), the Corporate Taxpayers Group (CTG), KPMG, PwC and EY. Following the close of submissions officials undertook further consultation with Deloitte and representatives of the telecommunications industry. 9. The submissions from Deloitte (on behalf of Vodafone, Spark and 2Degrees), CA ANZ, CTG and KPMG were all strongly opposed to the proposal to add GST to outbound mobile roaming services. The telecommunications industry in particular was strongly opposed to the proposal and argued for maintaining the status quo in which both outbound and inbound mobile roaming services are not subject to GST. The telecommunications industry also indicated that they would strongly oppose the proposal when it was included in a subsequent bill, in particular at the select committee stage. 10. PwC expressed support for the proposal as they considered it consistent with the OECD’s International VAT/GST Guidelines. EY also expressed in principle support for the proposal but was concerned the benefits may be outweighed by the additional compliance costs imposed on the telecommunications industry. Applying GST to outbound roaming services 11. Despite the opposition to the proposal raised through consultation, I still recommend that GST apply at the standard rate of 15% to outbound mobile roaming services received by New Zealand residents travelling overseas. Applying GST to outbound mobile roaming services is consistent with New Zealand’s broad-based GST framework and the OECD’s International VAT/GST Guidelines. 12. Cabinet had earlier agreed to apply GST to outbound mobile roaming services by repealing most of the special GST rules applying to telecommunications services and aligning the treatment of most telecommunications services with the treatment of other remote services (refer DEV-19-MIN-0059). However, through consultation the telecommunications industry has indicated that they consider the special GST rules for telecommunications services to be operating well. Instead of repealing these special GST rules, GST could instead be applied to outbound roaming services by introducing a new provision deeming outbound mobile roaming services to be subject to GST at the standard rate of 15%. 2 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:41:50 13. I therefore recommend that the earlier specific Cabinet decision to repeal most of the special GST rules applying to telecommunications services be rescinded and instead the Committee agree to simply apply GST at the standard rate of 15% to outbound mobile roaming services. This will provide flexibility around how the legislative amendments to apply GST at the standard rate of 15% to outbound roaming services are drafted. Officials will consult with tax practitioners and the telecommunications industry on how best to draft the changes to the GST Act. Application date 14. Cabinet has previously agreed to an application date for the changes to the GST rules for telecommunications services of 1 October 2020. However, the bill containing these changes is currently scheduled for introduction in March 2020. This would mean that there would likely be little or no time between the legislation being enacted and the original application date of 1 October 2020. If the bill is not passed before the next general election, enactment might not occur until after 1 October 2020. 15. A very short time period between the bill being enacted and the application date may not give the telecommunications industry sufficient time to make the necessary systems changes to apply GST to outbound mobile roaming services. Through consultation it was revealed that the billing systems of telecommunications suppliers are complex as they need to operate in real time to ensure a person is correctly charged as they use a telecommunications network. Updating these billing systems to charge GST on outbound mobile roaming services would therefore require telecommunications suppliers to do extensive testing to ensure the change does not cause any issues for their billing systems. Making these changes to their billing systems may also cause telecommunications suppliers to divert resources from other systems changes. 16. Given the factors discussed above, I recommend the application date for the changes to the GST rules for telecommunications services be delayed by six months to 1 April 2021. Financial Implications 17. Owing to more accurate information obtained through consultation, the revenue forecasts for applying GST to outbound mobile roaming services have been adjusted down. Applying GST to outbound mobile roaming services from 1 October 2020 is now estimated to increase GST revenue by $26.404 million over the forecast period as shown below: $m - increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2019/20 2020/21 2021/22 2022/23 2023/24 & Outyears Crown Revenue and Receipts: Tax Revenue -5.281 7.041 7.041 7.041 3 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:41:50 18. In addition, agreeing to delay the application date to 1 April 2021 will have a fiscal cost of $3.520 million in 2020/21. This can be accounted for on the tax policy scorecard as shown below: $m - increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2019/20 2020/21 2021/22 2022/23 2023/24 & Outyears Crown Revenue and Receipts: Tax Revenue - (3.520) --- 19. The tax policy scorecard is an accounting mechanism designed to ensure that the cumulative net revenue impacts of non-significant tax policy changes are considered in aggregate. It acts as a memorandum account attached to the Between-Budget contingency. Credit Notes 20. Credit notes are issued when the price of a supply is reduced after a tax invoice was issued, for example if a refund is provided when faulty goods are returned. Using credit notes for incorrectly standard rated supplies 21. In cases where a GST registered business has incorrectly standard-rated (applied GST at 15%) a supply of goods or services which should in fact have been exempt (e.g. a financial service) or zero-rated (e.g. an export), it is common to use a credit note to correct this, rather than applying to Inland Revenue to approve an amendment to the original GST return. Using a credit note is preferred to applying to Inland Revenue to amend the original return as it reduces compliance and administrative costs for the registered person. 22. I therefore recommend an amendment to clarify that the credit note provision provides the correct amount of GST adjustment in such cases (so the amount of GST adjustment is the same as if the taxpayer had amended their original GST return). Time bar for issuing credit notes 23. The ability to adjust a GST return to claim a GST refund is “time-barred” which means a GST registered person can only claim a GST refund in respect of GST returns that were filed less than 4 (or in cases of a clear mistake or simple oversight less than 8) years prior to the current date. In contrast, because the credit note is issued on the current date, the time bar may be ineffective in respect of a credit note adjustment. This poses a potentially large fiscal risk as it means a GST registered person may be able to use credit notes to claim large GST refunds if they discovered they had been applying an incorrect GST treatment for a long time (e.g. more than 8 years). It would also undermine the policy intent of the time bar on GST refunds. 24. There is an existing provision that applies a 7 year time limit to credit notes that are issued as a result of a land sale being incorrectly standard-rated (subject to GST at 15% when it should have been subject to GST at 0%). 4 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:41:50 25. I recommend inserting a provision to apply a time limit to other cases where a credit note is used. This time limit could be aligned with the 4 year (or 8 year in cases of a clear mistake or simple oversight) time bar that applies to GST refunds which are made through amendments to GST returns. Consultation 26. No public consultation has been undertaken on the proposal to ensure a time limit applies to issuing credit notes as informing taxpayers that the existing time bar for GST refunds may be ineffective in these cases could expose the Government to a significant fiscal risk. In particular, a GST registered person may be able to use credit notes to claim large GST refunds if they discovered they had been applying an incorrect GST treatment for a long time (e.g. more than 8 years). To manage this risk the proposed amendment could apply from the date that the proposed amendment is announced (or introduced in a bill). Financial Implications 27. The proposed changes to the credit note provisions would not have any fiscal impacts. Allowing credit notes to be used to claim back the full amount of GST included in a supply that has been incorrectly standard rated aligns with a common commercial practice. Introducing a time bar for credit notes would mitigate a potential fiscal risk but would not increase baselines. Legislative Implications 28. Implementing the proposals in this paper requires changes to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. 29. If approved, I propose including the legislative changes resulting from these recommendations in the next omnibus taxation bill, currently scheduled for introduction in the first quarter of 2020. Impact Analysis 30. The Impact Analysis Requirements apply to the proposals in this Cabinet paper and, therefore, the following Regulatory Impact Assessments (RIA) have been prepared and are attached to the Cabinet paper: 30.1 Impact Summary: GST and telecommunications services 30.2 Impact Summary: GST refunds using credit notes 31. The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the GST on telecommunications services RIA prepared by Inland Revenue and considers that the information and analysis summarised in it meets the quality assurance criteria. 32. The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the GST refunds using credit notes RIA and considers that the information and analysis summarised in it partially meets the quality criteria of the Regulatory Impact Analysis framework. 33. The Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis section of the RIA notes that no consultation has been undertaken on the specific proposals and the amount of fiscal risk from not changing issue two is unable to be quantified. The first proposal is taxpayer favourable and maintains current operational practice. The second 5 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:41:50 proposal is a base maintenance change consistent with the policy intent and the fiscal impact, although not quantifiable poses a significant risk if not addressed. The reviewer considers that the information in the RIA is as complete as could be expected and identifies the main risks and uncertainties. Human Rights 34. The proposals in this paper do not impinge on rights and freedoms under the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 or the Human Rights Act 1993. Gender Implications 35. There are no gender implications arising from these proposals. Disability Perspective 36. No disability issues arise from these proposals. Publicity 37. I will make an announcement on the contents of the next omnibus taxation bill, including these proposals, when the bill is introduced. A commentary on the Bill will also be released at this time. Inland Revenue will include details of the new legislation in a Tax Information Bulletin after the Bill is enacted. Proactive Release 38. I propose to delay the proactive release of this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers until the introduction of the omnibus taxation bill containing these proposals. The expected introduction date for this bill is March 2020. 39. Drawing attention to the credit note time bar issue before legislation is introduced may create a fiscal risk. 6 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:41:50 Recommendations The Minister of Revenue recommends that the Cabinet Economic Development Committee: Telecommunications services 1. Note that on 8 April 2019 Cabinet agreed to apply GST at the standard rate of 15% to outbound mobile roaming services received by New Zealand residents travelling overseas by making some specific changes to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (refer DEV-19-MIN-0059, recommendations 1.1-1.5); 2. Note that there are ways other than those previously agreed to by Cabinet (refer DEV-19-MIN-0059, recommendations 1.1-1.5) in which the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 could be amended to apply GST at 15% to outbound mobile roaming services; 3. Agree to provide flexibility around how the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 is amended to apply GST at 15% to outbound mobile roaming services by recommending that Cabinet rescind its decision in recommendations 1.1-1.5 of DEV - 19-MIN-0059 and instead simply agree that GST apply at the standard rate of 15% to outbound mobile roaming services; 4. Note that on 8 April 2019 Cabinet agreed to an application date for the proposed changes to the GST rules for telecommunications services of 1 October 2020 (refer DEV-19-MIN-0059); 5. Agree to delay the application date for the proposed changes to the GST rules for telecommunications services by six months to 1 April 2021; 6. Note that agreeing to delay the application date by 6 months to 1 April 2021 would have a fiscal cost of $3.520 million in 2020/21 which can be accounted for on the tax policy scorecard as shown below: $m - increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2019/20 2020/21 2021/22 2022/23 2023/24 & Outyears Crown Revenue and Receipts: Tax Revenue - (3.520) --- Credit Notes 7. Agree to allow credit notes to be used to claim back the full amount of GST included in a supply that was incorrectly standard rated (subject to GST at 15%) but should have been zero-rated (subject to GST at 0%) or been exempt; 8. Agree to apply a time limit from the date of a supply in which a credit note may be issued. This time limit could be aligned with the 4 year (or 8 year in cases of a clear mistake or simple oversight) time bar that applies to GST refunds which are made through amendments to GST returns; 9. Note that there are no fiscal impacts from agreeing to the recommended changes to the rules for credit notes; 7 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:41:50 Legislative vehicle 10. Agree that the legislative amendments to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 required to give effect to the changes recommend in this paper be included in the next omnibus taxation bill currently scheduled for introduction in March 2020; 11. Invite the Minister of Revenue to instruct Inland Revenue to draft the necessary amendments to give effect to the changes recommended in this paper; 12. Agree to delegate authority to the Minister of Revenue to make decisions on the detailed design of the changes recommended in this paper; Proactive Release 13. Note that, to prevent creating a fiscal risk by drawing the public’s attention to the credit note time bar issue, the release on Inland Revenue’s website of this Cabinet paper, the associated Cabinet minute, and key advice papers will be delayed until after the introduction of the omnibus taxation bill containing the changes recommended in this paper.

This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing key policy decisions to be taken by or on behalf of Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis An assumption has been made that applying GST or VAT to outbound mobile roaming services is more likely to become the common approach worldwide. This assumption is based on the OECD finalising in 2017 its International VAT/GST Guidelines (the Guidelines) which set forth internationally agreed standards for the GST/VAT treatment of international transactions and the European Union applying VAT to outbound roaming services received by its residents. Under the Guidelines, remote services (which includes telecommunications services) should generally be subject to GST/VAT in the country that the recipient of the services is normally resident. Quality Assurance Reviewing Agency: Inland Revenue Quality Assurance Assessment: The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the GST on telecommunications services regulatory impact assessment prepared by Inland Revenue and considers that the information and analysis summarised in it meets the quality assurance criteria. Reviewer Comments and Recommendations: The reviewer’s comments on earlier versions of this RIA have been incorporated into this version.

Impact Summary: GST on telecommunications services | 2 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 2 : Pro b le m de fin itio n an d o bjec tiv es 2.1 What is the policy problem or opportunity? Under New Zealand’s current GST rules for telecommunications services both outbound mobile roaming services received by New Zealand residents travelling overseas and inbound mobile roaming services received by non-residents in New Zealand are not subject to GST (or are subject to GST at the rate of 0%). 1 The current rules are inconsistent with New Zealand’s broad-based GST framework, under which one of outbound or inbound mobile roaming services should be subject to GST. As GST is intended to be a tax on final consumption, applying GST to either outbound or inbound mobile roaming services received by GST registered businesses should not have a net revenue benefit. Businesses receiving roaming services should (if GST-registered and using the services for making taxable supplies) be able to claim back the GST incurred on these services as an input tax deduction. The net revenue benefit from applying GST to either outbound or inbound mobile roaming services should therefore only be the GST incurred by final consumers. The OECD released International VAT/GST Guidelines in 2017. Under these Guidelines remote services (including telecommunications services) should generally be subject to GST or VAT in the jurisdiction where the recipient of the service is normally resident. Remote services are services in which there is no necessary connection between the place of performance of the services and the location of the recipient of the services. In light of the OECD’s Guidelines, the European Union (EU) and the United Kingdom (UK) have begun applying VAT to outbound mobile roaming services received by their residents travelling overseas. However, in over 80 other jurisdictions (including Canada, Japan and Singapore) GST, VAT or a local sales tax is added to inbound mobile roaming services, generally by applying these taxes to the wholesale roaming services supplied by local telecommunications suppliers to foreign telecommunications suppliers to enable the supply of inbound mobile roaming services. The GST/VAT rules for telecommunications services in most of these jurisdictions pre-date the OECD finalising its International VAT/GST Guidelines. It is unclear whether these countries have made a considered decision to maintain their pre-existing rules for telecommunications services or if they have simply not reviewed these rules yet in light of the OECD’s Guidelines. Like New Zealand’s current rules, Australia does not apply GST to either outbound or inbound mobile roaming services. The differing treatment of mobile roaming services around the world can result in both double taxation and double non-taxation. For example, the roaming services received by an EU resident travelling in Canada would be subject to GST/VAT in both the EU and Canada. Conversely, the roaming services received by a Canadian resident in the EU would not be 1 Inbound mobile roaming services may, in certain circumstances, be subject to GST but these circumstances rarely arise. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:42:34 Impact Summary: GST on telecommunications services | 3 IN CONFIDENCE subject to GST/VAT in either jurisdiction. On 8 April 2019 Cabinet agreed as part of Budget 2019 to amend the GST rules for telecommunications services to apply GST to outbound mobile roaming services from 1 October 2020 (refer DEV-19-MIN-0059). The issues paper GST and telecommunications services was then released on 17 May 2019 to consult on the detailed design of the proposed changes. This RIA updates the analysis of options following consultation on the issues paper. However, the proposed option is still to apply GST to outbound mobile roaming services. Application date Cabinet has previously agreed to an application date for the proposed changes to the GST rules for telecommunications services of 1 October 2020. However, this application date may not give telecommunications suppliers enough time to make and test the necessary systems changes to apply GST to outbound mobile roaming services. 2.2 Who is affected and how? The affected parties are suppliers of telecommunications services and the consumers of these services. New Zealand telecommunications suppliers will be affected as the proposed options would impact on the GST treatment of their supplies of outbound mobile roaming services. Consumers of telecommunications services will be affected as the price they pay for mobile roaming services may increase depending on whether suppliers pass on the full GST cost, or alter their pricing strategies. 2.3 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? Applying GST to the actual inbound mobile roaming services supplied by foreign telecommunications suppliers to non-residents travelling in New Zealand is unlikely to be a viable option and has therefore not been considered. Many telecommunications suppliers sell global or regional roaming packs that allow a consumer to roam in multiple jurisdictions for a single fee. At the time of supply the telecommunication supplier will not know which jurisdiction a consumer will consume the roaming services in. Furthermore, a consumer may consume the roaming services in multiple jurisdictions. If the actual inbound roaming services were subject to GST it would therefore be likely to cause telecommunications suppliers significant difficulties in attempting to apportion roaming charges between the different jurisdictions in which a customer consumed the roaming service. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:42:34 Impact Summary: GST on telecommunications services | 4 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tion 3: O p tio n s id e n tifica tio n 3.1 What options have been considered? The objective is to maintain New Zealand’s broad-based GST framework by extending the application of GST to more services. The following criteria have been used to assess the options against this objective: • Destination principle: The option should be consistent with the principle that GST or VAT should generally apply in the jurisdiction in which consumption occurs. • Business neutrality: The option should be consistent with the principle that GST should be borne by final consumers and should not be a cost to businesses. • International consistency: The option should give consideration to approaches taken internationally to minimise instances of double taxation or double non-taxation. • Compliance costs – The option should minimise compliance costs for telecommunications suppliers as much as possible. Option 1: Status quo Under the status quo both outbound and inbound roaming services are not subject to GST at 15%. The status quo does not achieve the objective as, under New Zealand’s broad-based GST framework, GST should apply to one of outbound or inbound mobile roaming services. Option 2: Apply GST at 15% to outbound mobile roaming services (proposed option) Under this option, outbound mobile roaming services received by New Zealand residents travelling overseas would become subject to GST at the standard rate of 15%. The gross GST that would be collected under this option is estimated to be $12.993 million per annum. However, GST registered businesses paying GST on the outbound mobile roaming services they receive would be able to claim back this GST as an input tax deduction. It is therefore estimated that this option would increase net GST revenue by $7.041 million per annum. Analysis of option This option would be consistent with the objective of maintaining New Zealand’s broad-based GST framework as it would add GST to the entire outbound mobile roaming services received by New Zealand residents travelling overseas. Applying GST to outbound mobile roaming services is not consistent with the destination principle as to receive mobile roaming services a New Zealand resident must be outside New Zealand. However, there are circumstances in which it is appropriate to depart from the destination principle. The OECD’s Guidelines recommend using a consumer’s usual place of residence for determining which jurisdiction’s GST or VAT applies to a supply of remote services (including telecommunications services) regardless of the physical location of the consumer. For example, if a New Zealand resident downloads a movie while on holiday in Australia, New Zealand GST should apply to the download of the movie. This departure from the destination principle is considered appropriate as often the supplier of a remote service 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:42:34 Impact Summary: GST on telecommunications services | 5 IN CONFIDENCE will not know the actual location of the consumer and therefore the consumer’s residency is considered an appropriate proxy for the most likely place of consumption of remote services. This option would be consistent with the principle of business neutrality as GST-registered business can claim back the GST they incur as an input tax deduction. This option would be consistent with rules in the European Union and the United Kingdom which apply VAT to outbound mobile roaming services received by their residents. However, this option would be inconsistent with the approach taken in over 80 other jurisdictions which add GST, VAT or a local sales tax to inbound mobile roaming services, generally by applying GST to wholesale mobile roaming services. However, the rules in many of these jurisdictions pre-date the OECD finalising its International VAT/GST Guidelines. The option would also be inconsistent with Australia which, like New Zealand’s current rules, does not apply GST to either outbound or inbound roaming services. The telecommunications industry has estimated that this option would impose on the industry compliance costs associated with updating their billing systems of approximately $1 million. They would also incur costs associated with notifying their customers of the change in the GST treatment of outbound roaming services. The compliance costs for this option would be a one-off cost and on-going compliance costs would be comparable to the status quo. Option 3: Apply GST to inbound wholesale mobile roaming services GST could be added to inbound roaming by applying GST to the wholesale mobile roaming services supplied by New Zealand telecommunications suppliers to foreign telecommunications suppliers to enable the foreign telecommunications suppliers’ customers to roam in New Zealand. This would result in unrecoverable GST being embedded in the price of roaming services received by non-residents travelling in New Zealand. The diagram on the following page illustrates how applying GST to wholesale roaming charges would work. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:42:34 Impact Summary: GST on telecommunications services | 6 IN CONFIDENCE As can be seen in the above diagram, applying GST to the wholesale roaming charges would add GST on to the services NZ Telco supplies to OZ Telco to allow OZ Telco’s customers to roam in New Zealand. There is no GST on the actual supply of roaming to OZ Telco’s customer. However, GST is embedded in the price of the roaming services received by OZ Telco’s customer as OZ Telco is unable to claim an input tax deduction for the GST they paid to NZ Telco. It is estimated that this option would increase GST revenue by $3.8 million per annum. As GST would be imposed on the wholesale roaming services rather than the actual inbound mobile roaming services, non-resident businesses consuming inbound mobile roaming services in New Zealand would not be able to claim back the GST embedded in the price of these services. As such, there is no need to consider the difference between gross and net GST revenue under this option. Analysis of option This option partially achieves the objective of maintaining New Zealand’s broad-based GST system as it would add GST to the price of inbound roaming services received by non- residents travelling in New Zealand. However, the margins charged by the suppliers of inbound roaming services would remain untaxed. This option would be consistent with the destination principle. Applying GST to wholesale roaming services is inconsistent with the principle of business neutrality as it would add unrecoverable GST to the price of inbound roaming services received by non-resident businesses in New Zealand. This option is inconsistent with the approach taken in the European Union and United NZ Telco OZ Telco Customer of OZ telco Connection to NZ Telco’s network Roaming services Wholesale roaming services $11.50 (incl. GST) $15 (no GST) $1.50 GST 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:42:34 Impact Summary: GST on telecommunications services | 7 IN CONFIDENCE Kingdom. However, it would be consistent with the approach taken in over 80 other jurisdictions which apply GST or VAT to wholesale roaming services. Like option 2, this option is also inconsistent with the approach taken to mobile roaming services in Australia. The telecommunications industry has not quantified the cost of making systems changes to add GST to wholesale mobile roaming services. However, the industry considers that these costs would not be insignificant. Officials consider that the costs of making systems changes for this option may be similar to the costs of making systems changes for option 2. This option would also impose costs on the New Zealand telecommunications industry related to reviewing and potentially re-negotiating their contracts with foreign telecommunications suppliers. As with option 2, the compliance costs of this option would be one-off costs and on-going compliance costs would be comparable to the status quo. Application date An application date of 1 October 2020 was originally proposed for the proposed changes to the GST rules for telecommunications services. However, it is proposed to delay this application date by six months to 1 April 2021. The bill containing the changes to the GST rules for telecommunications services is scheduled for introduction in March 2020. This would mean that there may be little or no time between the legislation being enacted and the original application date of 1 October 2020. If the bill is not passed before the next general election, enactment might not occur until after 1 October 2020. A very short time period between the bill being enacted and the application date may not give the telecommunications industry sufficient time to make the necessary systems changes to apply GST to outbound mobile roaming services. The billing systems of telecommunications suppliers are complex as they need to operate in real time to ensure a person is correctly charged as they use the network. As such, while changing outbound mobile roaming services from a zero-rated supply to a standard rated supply is itself a simple change, the telecommunications suppliers would need to do extensive testing to ensure the change does not cause any issues for their billing systems. Given, the factors discussed above, delaying the application date by six months to 1 April 2021 is considered appropriate. Delaying the application date by six months would have a fiscal cost of $3.52 million. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:42:34 Impact Summary: GST on telecommunications services | 8 IN CONFIDENCE 3.2 Which of these options is the proposed approach? The proposed approach is to apply GST at the standard rate of 15% to outbound mobile roaming services received by New Zealand residents travelling overseas from 1 April 2021 (option 2 with a six-month delay to the application date previously agreed by Cabinet). While applying GST to outbound mobile roaming services is less consistent with the destination principle than the status quo, it best achieves the objective of maintaining New Zealand’s broad-based GST framework and is more consistent with the principle of business neutrality than applying GST to wholesale roaming services. Furthermore, while there is no clear international consensus at this stage, officials consider that, in light of the OECD’s International VAT/GST Guidelines and the approach taken by the European Union, applying GST to outbound roaming services is more likely to become the common approach worldwide.

We do not anticipate the proposed approach would have any other impacts. We will consult with tax advisors and the telecommunications industry on how best to draft the changes to the GST Act to ensure there are no unintended impacts. The select committee process will also be used to ensure there are no unintended impacts. Sec tio n 5: Stake h old er vie ws 5.1 What do stakeholders think about the problem and the proposed solution? The issues paper GST on telecommunications services was released on 17 May 2019 to consult on the technical details of the proposal to apply GST to outbound mobile roaming services. Submissions closed on 28 June and in total 6 submissions were received. Following the close of submissions officials conducted further consultation with representatives of the telecommunications industry. Support for the proposal Two submissions from accounting firms expressed support for the proposal as they consider it consistent with the OECD’s International VAT/GST Guidelines. However, one of these submissions expressed concerned that the benefits of the proposal would be outweighed by the compliance costs. Opposition to the proposal Four submissions, including one made on behalf of the telecommunications industry, were strongly opposed to the proposal to add GST to outbound roaming services. In further consultation with the telecommunications industry they have regularly expressed their opposition to the proposal. The key argument raised in opposition to the proposal was that, as outbound roaming services can only be consumed outside New Zealand, it would be contrary to the destination principle to apply New Zealand GST to outbound roaming services received by New Zealand residents overseas. Under the destination principle, GST should generally apply in the jurisdiction in which consumption occurs. In arguing that it is inappropriate to apply GST to outbound roaming some submitters also argued that roaming services are on-the-spot services and not remote services as a consumer needs to be in the vicinity of a cell tower to receive the service. In arguing that roaming services are on-the-spot services these submitters were arguing that it would be inappropriate to use a consumer’s usual place of residence to determine which jurisdiction’s GST or VAT applied to a supply of roaming services. However, roaming services should not be considered on-the-spot services as they are not physically performed at a readily identifiable place, 2 and do not require the physical presence of both the person performing the service and the person consuming the service. The New Zealand telecommunications industry’s strong preference is for the status quo to be 2 Telecommunications services tend to have multiple places of performance and it is difficult to identify a single place of performance. The GST rules for telecommunications services were introduced to address this issue. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:42:34 Impact Summary: GST on telecommunications services | 11 IN CONFIDENCE maintained. They note that while it is not a conceptually pure option, the existing rules for telecommunications services have been working well and the consider the status quo to be less of a compromise on a conceptually pure GST system than the proposed option. Furthermore, they do not consider that the increase in GST revenue of $7.041 million per annum would justify the one-off compliance costs of approximately $1 million from making changes to their billing systems. Application date The telecommunications industry suggested a delayed application date would be appropriate given the time required to make and test systems changes. They are therefore likely to welcome the delayed application date of 1 April 2021. Sec tion 6: Imp le men ta tio n a n d op er a tio n 6.1 How will the new arrangements be given effect? Following Cabinet approval, the necessary amendments to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 will be included in an omnibus tax bill currently scheduled for introduction in March 2020. The proposals are intended to apply to supplies of telecommunications services from 1 April 2021. Inland Revenue will be responsible for the on-going administration of the new arrangements. Inland Revenue officials have assessed the magnitude of these administrative impacts and consider that they would be comparable to the status quo. Guidance on how the proposed approach would work would be provided in bill commentary published at introduction of the legislation and a Tax Information Bulletin published after enactment. Sec tio n 7 : M o n itor in g, ev a lua tio n a n d re v ie w 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? Inland Revenue will monitor the outcomes to confirm that they match the policy objectives. Officials from Inland Revenue expect that, once the proposals are enacted, affected telecommunications suppliers and their tax advisors will raise with them any concerns they have with how the rules are working in practice. Any necessary changes identified as a result would be recommended for addition to the Government's tax policy work programme. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? The review will be the monitoring described in section 7.1 above. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:42:34 Impact Summary: GST refunds using credit notes | 1 IN CONFIDENCE Impact Summary: GST refunds using credit notes Section 1: General information Purpose Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA), except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing key policy decisions to be taken by or on behalf of Cabinet . Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis Number of affected parties and potential future fiscal risks are unknown The potential future fiscal risk that the time bar may be ineffective for GST refunds made using credit notes is unknown as it depends on the scale of the particula r issue that gave rise to the refund (e.g. changing interpretations or errors by the affected businesses that have n ot yet been identi fied) and number of past years affected. Therefore, it is not possible to estimate these amounts – although in some potential cases they could be in the tens of millions of GST revenue. L imited consultation with affected parties Issue one: Cor rect amount of GST adjustment A draft interpretation of the current law on the first issue is currently being consulted on and the initial feedback that has been received supports the proposed policy change as it would align the law with common business practices. S ome submissions were received on a similar proposal in 2012 (see section 5.1 below for more detail ) which have been used to inform this RIA. H owever, there has been no specific consultation on the proposed changes. Issue two: Application of the time bar to credit notes Th e second issue has not been consulted on with external parties as informing external parties that the time bar may be ineffective could expose the Government to a sig nificant fiscal risk. A GST registered person may be able to use credit notes to claim large GST refunds if they discovered they had been applying an incorrect GST treatment for a long time (e.g. more than 8 years). Co nsultation will occur once the bill is introduced and during the Select Committee stage of the bill. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:43:16 5. Impact Summary: GST refunds using credit notes | 2 IN CONFIDENCE Quality Assurance Reviewing Agency: Inland Revenue Quality Assurance Assessment: The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the GST refunds using credit notes RIA and considers that the information and analysis summarised in it partially meets the quality criteria of the Regulatory Impact Analysis framework. The Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis section of the RIA notes that no consultation has been undertaken on the specific proposals and the amount of fiscal risk from not changing issue two is unable to be quantified. The first proposal is taxpayer favourable and maintains current operational practice. The second proposal is a base maintenance change consistent with the policy intent and the fiscal impact, although not quantifiable poses a significant risk if not addressed. The reviewer considers that the information in the RIA is as complete as could be expected and identifies the main risks and uncertainties. Reviewer Comments and Recommendations: Comments from the review of earlier versions of this RIA have been incorporated into this version. Responsible Manager (signature and date): Graeme Morrison Policy Lead Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 23 October 2019 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:43:16 Impact Summary: GST refunds using credit notes | 3 IN CONFIDENCE Section 2: Problem definition and objectives 2.1 What is the policy problem or opportunity? GST credit notes are issued by a supplier when the price for a supply is reduced after a tax invoice was issued, for example when faulty goods are returned. When a credit note is issued: • the supplier must make an adjustment in their GST return in the period they issued the credit note; and • the recipient (if GST registered), must make an adjustment in their GST return in the period they received the credit note. Through these adjustments, the supplier will effectively be refunded for the GST accounted for on the portion of the supply that was refunded, and the recipient (if GST registered) will be required to repay the GST claimed on the refunded portion of the supply. Inl and Revenue has recently considered how the GST credit note provisions apply in cases where the GST registered business standard-rated (applied 15% GST) to a supply of goods and services which should in fact have been exempt (e.g. a financial service) or zero-rated (e.g. an export). This has raised two policy issues: Issue one: Correct amount of GST adjustment Firstly, from a policy perspective the current law may provide an incorrect amount of GST adjustment in situations where a supply was standard-rated but should have been exempt or zero-rated. This is because, the GST adjustment may be limited to the tax fraction (3/23rds) of the adjusted price. Fo r example, consider a supply of $100 plus $15 of GST which was incorrectly charged. The supply should have been exempt or zero-rated (no GST). In this situation, the correct policy outcome would be for the supplier to issue a credit note and make an adjustment for the incorrectly returned $15. The recipient (if GST registered) would then make an adjustment for $15 incorrectly claimed. However, according to a draft interpretation that Inland Revenue is currently consulting on, the GST adjustment is limited to the tax fraction (3/23rds) of the price adjustment. Since the price adjustment is $15, the GST adjustment is limited to $1.96 (3/23 x $15) rather than $15. This interpretation would not accommodate common commercial practices whereby GST registered persons issue credit notes to provide a $15 GST adjustment (rather than amending the original return). Although GST registered persons can request approval from Inland Revenue to amend their original GST re turn to get the correct $15 GST adjustment, this approach is inferior to using a credit note as it involves additional compliance costs and administrative costs. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:43:16 Impact Summary: GST refunds using credit notes | 4 IN CONFIDENCE Issue two: Application of the time bar to credit notes The second issue concerns whether the “time bar” is effective at limiting GST refunds that arise due to credit note adjustments. The ability to adjust a GST return to claim a GST refund is “time-barred” which means a GST registered person can only claim a GST refund in respect of GST returns that were filed less than 4 (or in cases of a clear mistake or simple oversight less than 8) years prior to the current date. In contrast, because the credit note is issued on the current date, the time bar may be ineffective in respect of a credit note adjustment. This poses a potentially large fiscal risk as it means a GST registered person may be able to use credit notes to claim large GST refunds if they discovered they had been applying an incorrect GST treatment for a long time (e.g. more than 8 years). This would be contrary to the policy intent of the time bar on GST refunds. 2.2 Who is affected and how? The first issue affects some GST registered persons (businesses) which have incorrectly charged 15% GST on a sale of goods and services when that sale should in fact have been exempt or zero-rated (0%). However, GST advisors have informed us it is a common commercial practice to use credit notes to provide the correct amount of GST adjustment in such cases, in which case the proposed law change would simply align with existing practice (and therefore have no impact on compliance costs). The second issue could potentially provide additional GST refunds to some businesses on rare occasions where they made a mistake more than 4 or 8 years ago. However, it was not intended that GST registered persons could receive additional GST refunds from using a credit note instead of adjusting the original GST return. 2.3 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? There are no constraints on the decisions. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:43:16 Impact Summary: GST refunds using credit notes | 5 IN CONFIDENCE Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options have been considered? The following criteria was used to assess the options: • Horizontal equity – the affected parties should be able to achieve the intended policy outcomes and similar outcomes as other groups in similar situations such as those who amend their original GST return. • Certainty – the affected parties should understand how the tax rules operate. • Compliance costs and administration costs should be minimised. • Policy stability / sustainability – the option should be able to be maintained and cope with future developments. Issue one: correct amount of GST adjustment issue Option 1: No law change (status quo) GST registered persons will still be required to request approval from Inland Revenue to amend their original GST return to get the correct GST adjustment, or accept a lower GST adjustment through a credit note. Pros: • Requirement to amend original return may provide IRD with a greater ability to check / approve the refund. • IRD can increase certainty by publishing guidance on how the current law operates. Cons: • Provides the wrong policy outcome as it results in a much lower amount of GST ref und compared to amending the original GST return. • Uncertain and would impose compliance and administration costs as IRD’s draft interpretation does not ali gn with current business practices. • Inconsistent with self-assessment basis of GST. Option 2: Make it easier to make the adjustment through amending the GST return This option would allow the affected GST registered persons to amend their GST returns on a self-assessment basis using Inland Revenue’s systems (MyIR). For example, by allowing the amendment to be made in their GST return for the next period, or by relaxing the requirement to apply to Inland Revenue to approve an amendment to an earlier GST return. Pros: • May provide IRD with a greater ability to check the refund. Cons: • Some additional complexity as to get the correct GST adjustment a different refund mechanism must be used depending on why the GST was incorrect. • Would impose compliance and admin costs as does not align with current business practices. • Requires IRD to make systems and process changes and may require a law change. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:43:16 Impact Summary: GST refunds using credit notes | 6 IN CONFIDENCE Option 3: Law change to clarify the correct amount of GST adjustment (preferred option) This option would involve adding a new provision that ensures that when the affected GST registered per son issues a credit note for a particular supply, it provides the same amount of GST refund compared to amending the original GST return which included the relevant supply. Pros: • Provides the same GST refund amount as amending the original GST return. • Aligns with current business practices. • Provides certainty about the refund amounts when GST credit notes are used. • Reduces compliance and admin costs. Cons: • Requires law change. Issue two: Application of the time bar to credit notes issue Option 1: No law change (status quo) Because the credit note is issued on the current date, the time bar may be ineffective in respect of a credit note adjustment, even though the relevant supply which is adjusted was included in a GST return more than 4 or 8 years ago. Pros: • Allows the business to go back and correct all past mistakes, and claim GST refunds for these, no matter how long ago the mistake occurred. Cons: • Potentially large fiscal risk to the Government and could effectively allow GST refunds for time-barred returns contrary to the policy intent of the time bar. • High compliance and admin costs due to the potentially large refund amounts and the historic nature of the relevant supplies. Option 2: Align with the time bars which apply for GST refunds made through amending the original GST return (preferred option) This would involve applying a time limit from the date of a supply in which a credit note may be issued. The time limit would match the existing 4 year (or 8 year in the case of a clear mistake or simple oversight) time limits for GST refunds which apply when an amendment is made to the original GST return which included the relevant supply. Pros: • Provides the same GST refund amount as amending the original GST return. • Provides certainty that the time bar applies to credit notes. • Reduces compliance and admin costs (consistent set of GST refund rules and likely to align with current practices). Cons: • Limits the ability to claim GST refunds for past mistakes (but still allows a generous 4 or 8 years for this). 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:43:16 Impact Summary: GST refunds using credit notes | 7 IN CONFIDENCE Option 3: Expand an existing provision which provides a 7 year limit for using credit notes when a supply of land has been incorrectly standard-rated Credit notes cannot be issued in relation to supplies of land which were incorrectly standard-rated more than 7 years ago. This 7 year limit could be expanded to prevent a credit note from being issued in respect of other supplies that occurred more th an 7 years ago. Pros: • Aligns with an existing 7 year time limit for credit notes and 7 year record-keeping requirements. • Provides certainty for the time limit that applies to credit notes. Cons: • Can allow a different amount of refund to amending the original GST return (as this has a 4 or 8 year time limit) which could change which refund mechanism is used (and increase administration and compliance costs). • Limits ability to claim GST refunds for past mistakes to 7 years. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:43:16 Impact Summary: GST refunds using credit notes | 8 IN CONFIDENCE 3.2 Which of these options is the proposed approach? Issue one: Correct amount of GST adjustment The preferred option is option 3 – a law change to clarify the correct amount of GST adjustment as it: • Provides the same GST refund amount as amending the original GST return. • Reduces compliance and administration costs by aligning the law with some common current practices of the affected businesses. Issue two: Application of the time bar to credit notes The preferred option is option 2 - align with the time bars which apply for GST refunds made through amending the original GST return because it: • Provides the same GST refund amount as amending the original GST return. • Reduces compliance and admin costs (consistent set of GST refund rules and likely to align with current practices). • Should be a sustainable policy as it means credit notes cannot be used to undermine the policy intent of the existing time bars for GST refunds and also removes the risk of a potentially large, unintended fiscal cost to the Government. The proposed options are compatible with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:43:16 Impact Summary: GST refunds using credit notes | 9 IN CONFIDENCE Section 4: Impact Analysis (Proposed approach) 4.1 Summary table of costs and benefits Affected parties Comment: Impact Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties (Some GST registered businesses which have incorrectly charged 15% GST) Issue two: Lose the potential ability to access an unintended windfall of GST refunds in respect of transactions that took place more than 4 or 8 years ago in “time- barred” periods.

No other impacts have been identified from the proposed options. Section 5: Stakeholder views 5.1 What do stakeholders think about the problem and the proposed solution? Issue one: Correct amount of GST adjustment A draft interpretation of the current law on the first issue is currently being consulted on (PUB 00352, Changing GST treatment after reducing the previousl y agreed consideration) and the initial feedback that has been received supports the proposed policy change as it would align the law with common business practices. A similar set of proposed changes to the credit note rules was consulted on as part of 2012 issues paper GST remedial iss ues. However, a decision was made not to proceed with any changes to the credit note rules in 2012. This was because one part of the 2012 proposals suggested that when a credit note was issued in such circumstances it should be necessary to pass on the GST refund to the purchaser. Submissions from private sector GST advisors disagreed with this aspect of the proposal and noted that whether or not a refund should be paid through to the purchaser was a contractual m atter and should not be dictated by the GST Act. The new proposal does not include the aspect which these submitters opposed in 2012. Issue two: Application of the time bar to credit notes The issue of how the time bar applies to credit notes has not been directly consulted on with external parties. Informing external parties that the time bar may be ineffective in such cases could expose the Government to a significant fis cal risk. To manage this risk the proposed option could apply from the date that the bill containing the proposed amen dment is introduced. Despite this, a proposed option which would have addressed the second issue was referenced in the 2012 consultation document GST remedial issues (which asked whether that adjustment should be treated as taking place in the same period as the original supply), but no submissions were received on this option. A decision wa s made not to proceed with any of the proposed changes to the credit note rules in 2012 due to submitter ’s disagreeing with on e aspect of the 2012 credit note proposals that suggested that the refund should be passed onto the purchaser (described above). Further consultation Further consultation on both issues / proposals will occur during the Select Committee stage of any bill containing the proposed amendments. It is expected that some stakeholders will submit against the proposal to apply a time bar to credit notes as the proposed law change could potentially limit businesses ability to claim a GST refund for errors they made in their GST returns more than 4 or 8 years ago. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:43:16 Impact Summary: GST refunds using credit notes | 12 IN CONFIDENCE However, it was not intended that GST registered persons could receive additional GST refunds from using a credit note instead of adjusting the original GST return as this would be contrary to the policy intent of the time bar on GST refunds. Most of the affected businesses have been applying the time bar on GST refunds to credit notes (and this has also been Inland Revenue’s operational practice). This means the proposed law change to apply a time bar would align with these current practices. In contrast, if the existing law is unchanged it could potentially provide an unintended windfall of large GST refunds in respect of transactions that occurred more than 4 or 8 years ago in “time-barred” periods. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:43:16 Impact Summary: GST refunds using credit notes | 13 IN CONFIDENCE Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements be given effect? The proposals will require amendments to the Goods and Services Act 1985 which could be included in the next available tax omnibus bill expected to be introduced in early 2020. Guidance materials to explain how the amendments would operate will be published when the bill is introduced, in response to submissions raised with the Select Committee and after the bill is enacted. There is a risk that the proposed amendments could have unintended consequences or may not adequately accommodate existing business practices. These risks will be mitigated by aligning the provisions with similar existing rules, consulting GST advisors once the relevant provisions are introduced in a bill and through the monitoring described in section 7.1 below. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:43:16 Impact Summary: GST refunds using credit notes | 14 IN CONFIDENCE Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? As both proposed law changes are expected to align the law with the current practices of most of the affected businesses and Inland Rev enue’s operational practice, they should have minor impacts on compliance and administrative costs. Inland Revenue will monitor if any unintended consequences arise through its usual processes of monitoring GST refunds, and through contacts and feedback from the affected businesses and their GST advisors. Inland Revenue would then consider how best to address specific issues that arise. This could include answering queries, publishing guidance materials, adjusting operational practices, making remedial law changes or reviewing the policy. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? The review will be the monitoring described in section 7.1. above, on an ongoing basis. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:43:16 I N C O N F I D E N C E DEV-19-MIN-0315 Cabinet Economic Development Committee Minute of Decision This document contains information for the New Zealand Cabinet.

In Confidence IR2020 /220: GST on mobile roaming services – Application date in light of COVID-19 Page 1 of 2 IN CONFIDENCE 21 April 2020 Minister of Revenue GST on mobile roaming services – Application date in light of COVID-19 1. In November 2019 Cabinet agreed to apply GST at the standard rate of 15% to outbound mobile roaming services received by New Zealanders travelling overseas with an application date of 1 April 2021 (DEV-19-MIN-0315 refers). However, due to the impacts of COVID-19 this report recommends the application date for the proposal be delayed by 12 months to 1 April 2022. Delaying the application date would have a very low but unquantifiable fiscal cost. Delayed introduction of the next omnibus taxation Bill 2. Owing to more urgent COVID-19 related priorities and the adjournment of Parliament, the introduction of the omnibus taxation Bill containing the proposal to apply GST to outbound mobile roaming services has been delayed and is now scheduled for introduction in June. 3. As previously reported to you, the billing systems of telecommunications suppliers are complex as they need to operate in real time to ensure a person is correctly charged as they use the network (IR2019/351 refers). As such, telecommunications suppliers will need sufficient time to test changes to their billing systems to add GST to outbound mobile roaming services to ensure there are no unintended consequences. 4. The next omnibus taxation Bill contains annual rates for 2020-21 and will therefore need to be enacted before the current application date for the GST on mobile roaming proposal of 1 April 2021. However, there is likely to be at most only a few weeks between enactment and 1 April 2021. This is unlikely to give telecommunications suppliers enough time to make and test changes to their billing systems. The ability of telecommunications suppliers to make the necessary systems changes in time may also be limited if COVID-19 causes reductions in their staff numbers or forces them to make other systems changes. Impact of COVID-19 on international travel 5. COVID-19 is likely to cause a significant decrease in the number of New Zealanders travelling overseas in the short-medium term. As such, it will also likely result in a significant decrease in the consumption of mobile roaming services. 6. Before COVID-19 the proposal to apply GST to outbound mobile roaming services was forecast to raise revenue by $7.041 million per annum. However, the decrease in international travel because of COVID-19 means the amount of revenue that will be raised by the proposal in the short-medium term will be significantly lower. Delaying the application date by 12 months would therefore have no or very little fiscal cost but would provide additional time for telecommunications suppliers to make the necessary systems changes. Fiscal impact 7. The fiscal impact of delaying the application date by 12 months to 1 April 2022 cannot be accurately quantified. The actual fiscal cost would depend on many unknowns such as when a vaccine to COVID-19 is developed, when international In Confidence IR2020/220: GST on mobile roaming services – Application date in light of COVID-19 Page 2 of 2 IN CONFIDENCE borders start re-opening and the impacts COVID-19 will have on New Zealanders ability to afford international travel. 8. While the fiscal impact cannot be quantified, it is forecast that delaying the application date would have only a very small fiscal cost. Consultation 9. The Treasury has been consulted on this report. Recommended action We recommend that you: 10. agree to delay the application date for the GST on outbound mobile roaming services proposal by 12 months to 1 April 2022; Agreed/Not agreed 11. refer a copy of this report to the Minister of Finance for his information.

In Confidence IR2019/554; T2019/3648: Purchase price allocation Page 1 of 5 SENSITIVE 13 November 2019 M inister of Finance Minister of Revenue Purchase price allocation Executive summary 1.This report seeks your approval to undertake public consultation, via an officials’ issues paper, on possible changes to the tax legislation relating to how parties to a sale allocate the global price, for tax purposes, a mong the different assets bein g s old. 2.These changes are one of the revenue-raising measures that form part of a package of business-related tax initiatives in the Government’s Tax Policy Work Programme. The package was discussed at the joint Ministers’ meeting on 5 November 2019. 3.The changes are aimed at increasing the efficiency of the tax system and ensuring that sales of businesses and commercial property (in particular) do not lead to an inappropriate income tax reduction. 4.The Government is currently missing out on an estimated of tax revenue per annum as a result of a gap in the law that allows the buyer and seller to adopt different asset valuations for tax purposes in respect of the same sale transaction. This arbitrage can result in the seller treating the sale proceeds as largely non-taxable and the purchaser increasing the amount they treat as depreciable (or otherwise deductible) . 5.T he issues paper seeks feedback on this issue, and in particular, on a solution that, in broad terms, would require the vendor and purchaser to use the same allocation, based on market values. The paper proposes the idea of a de minimis threshold, to reduce compliance costs. 6.Under the proposal in the issues paper, if the two parties cannot agree on a n a llocation, the purchaser would be required to use the vendor’s allocation. The vendor would be required to disclose their allocation to the purchaser, and if they did not do so on a timely basis, they would have to use the purchaser’s allocation. 7.We have engaged with a variety of private sector stakeholders over the past 18 months with respect to this issue. We plan to meet again with the Corporate Taxpayers Group, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, and New Zealand Law Society prior to the issues paper’s release to update them on progress. 8.If these changes are implemented as proposed in the issues paper, applying to transactions occurring on or after 1 April 2021, we estimate they will raise approximately over the forecast period. This revenue could be use d to i ncrease gross spending in Budget 2020 if final policy decisions to proceed are made by mid to late March 2020. 9.To meet this timeframe, we recommend that you obtain Cabinet’s approval to release the issues paper in mid-December 2019 (before HYEFU on 11 December). We have attached a suggested draft Cabinet paper for Cabinet’s Economic Development Committee’s meeting on 4 December 2019, which would need to be submitted to Cabinet Office by 10am on Thursday 28 November 2019. This would allow the issues paper to be released before HYEFU – there is currently a specifi c f iscal risk for this proposal. I f the issues paper were released after HYEFU, then the s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) In Confidence IR2019/554; T2019/3648: Purchase price allocation Page 2 of 5 SENSITIVE disclosure of the specific fiscal risk at HYEFU would pre-empt the release of the issues paper. 10.Given the tight timeframe for achieving final decisions by the end of March, the draft Cabinet paper also seeks Cabinet’s approval to delegate to you the ability to make final decisions on this issue once feedback has been received. Recommended action 11.We recommend that you: (a)agree to submit the attached draft Cabinet paper seeking Cabinet’s approval to release the issues paper on 10 December to Cabinet’s Economic Development C ommittee in time for its meeting on 4 December 2019; A greed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed ( b)note that if these changes were implemented for transactions occurring from 1 April 2021, they would raise approximately over the forecast period; Noted Noted (c )note that final policy decisions would need to be made by the end of March 202 0 f or the estimated additional revenue to be able to be used to increase gros s s pending in Budget 2020.

Sales of businesses and commercial properties (land, buildings and fit out) tend to be the largest transactions of this kind. The allocation is important in determining the vendor’s tax liability from the sale, and the purchaser’s cost base for calculating depreciation and any taxable gains when they, in turn, come to sell the property. 13.Generally, the allocation must be based on market values, and there is case law that reinforces this, but there is no explicit requirement in tax law for the vendo r and purchaser to use the same market values, except in relation to the trading stock component of a transaction. When trading stock is sold along with other assets, the vendor is required to apportion an amount to the trading stock that reflects it s market price, and the purchaser is required to use that same apportionment . T rading stock is widely defined for this purpose, including anything produced , m anufactured or acquired for the purpose of disposal, as well as livestock, timber, and land whose disposal would produce income. 14.While many purchasers and sellers agree an allocation, many do not as the vendor and purchaser have different incentives when trying to minimise their tax liabilities and benefits. If the parties adopt different allocations, there is generally foregone tax revenue. This issue, therefore, has been identified as a revenue integrity matter and the project is on the tax policy work programme. We have undertaken targeted engagement with key stakeholders on how to address this issue . 15.Y ou have indicated a preference for this work to be progressed so that, if the Government decides to proceed with law reform in this area, the revenue raised could be used to increase gross spending in Budget 2020. 16.Officials reported to you on this issue in November 2018 (T2018/3398; IR2018/755 refers) but the project was put on hold at that time due to uncertainty around w hether or not the taxation of capital gains would be extended. A comprehensive capital gains tax would have removed most of the opportunity for arbitrage between different tax treatments in the allocation of the purchase price and would have made the benefits of this project marginal. 17.Other countries have a variety of specific rules in the area of allocation, based on parties using market values, and requiring varying degrees of consistency. Problem definition 18.Our starting policy framework is that, for revenue integrity reasons, the parties should be adopting the same allocation, based on market values. Generally throughout the Income Tax Act, sales are assumed to be at market value so tha t t here is no transfer of value between the parties which could lead to a reduction in tax revenue. However, the law is currently deficient because, with the exception of trading stock, there is no explicit requirement for the parties to use the same valuation. 19.Since ‘ market value’ is a range of values, both parties can adopt allocations that are quite different while claiming that their respective allocations are tethered to commercial prices. In many cases, the seller uses depreciated tax book values, arguing that they are reflective of market values, but avoiding any depreciation clawback (that is, the requirement to pay back depreciation deductions claimed in respect of an asset that has not, in fact, depreciated as fast as expected). The purchaser on the other hand often allocates a higher cost, to increase depreciation deductions. In Confidence IR2019/554; T2019/3648: Purchase price allocation Page 4 of 5 SENSITIVE 20.The flexibility around what is a ‘market value’ enables the adoption of inconsistent allocations that minimise each party’s tax liability and can only be challenged wit h c onsiderable resource commitment from Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue incurs significant costs trying to match buyers and sellers, investigate their allocations, and obtain valuations to determine whether the parties’ allocations can be challenged as not being in accordance with market values. Experience has shown that it can be very difficult to challenge even widely divergent allocations. 21.Inland Revenue’s compliance work has uncovered a number of sizeable transactions, particularly in relation to commercial property, where there have been differences between the seller’s and purchaser’s valuations sometimes in the tens of millions of dollars. Differences were identified in nearly fifty percent of the investigated cases, amounting in total to around $170 million. In some of these cases, settlements have been agreed. The remainder are either in dispute or have not yet been dealt with given resource constraints. There is no doubt that under current law, many of these discrepancies will not be able to be resolved. Recommended solution 22.The issues paper seeks feedback on a rule that would require the parties’ allocations to be consistent. If that consistency cannot be achieved through the partie s r eaching agreement, the purchaser would be required to use the vendor’s allocation – or vice versa if the vendor does not notify the purchaser of their allocation within a reasonable period of time. 23.The allocations should also be based on market values. There is case law in this area which reinforces the requirement that market values should be used. Otherwise, there is an opportunity for one party to reduce its tax liability, and there may be no or inadequate compensating increase in the other party’s tax liability given its tax status (for example, exempt or in loss), or because of differences in the (marginal) tax rates of the parties. Where a party obtains assets at a genuine bargain price then their relative market value is what is important. 24.Given the breadth of coverage (residential rental properties with chattels would be covered, for example), and to reduce compliance costs, the issues paper explores some options for a de minimis below which the new rules would not apply. The issues paper suggests, for example, that sales in which the total amount allocated by the purchaser to deductible or depreciable items is less than $100,000, the transaction could be excluded from the consistency requirement. 25.For parties involved in transactions of significant value, implementing this approach should involve almost no additional cost, as they are already required to undertake an allocation. It should encourage them to agree on an allocation beforehand, in the sale and purchase agreement or otherwise. 26.When the assets involved are relatively minor, it seems that vendors have often been using the written down book value in their allocations, often to reduce compliance costs. The de minimis should allow that to continue where the revenue at stake is less significant . Fiscal implications 27.If the proposals outlined in the issues paper were to be implemented exactly as proposed, we estimate that tax revenue would increase by approximately over the forecast period. This estimate is based on a sample of known cases, extrapolated out to the total estimated base of depreciable property sold with other assets. As it does not include financial arrangements or revenue from improved compliance with the trading stock rules, it is potentially conservative. However, it s 9(2)(f)(iv) In Confidence IR2019/554; T2019/3648: Purchase price allocation Page 5 of 5 SENSITIVE should also be noted that the methodology to reach this number is complex and relies on a number of assumptions. 28.Any change to the design of the measure following consultation is likely to change these estimates. Systems or technology impacts 29.The proposal does not give rise to significant operational or systems changes, and we consider that it would have low administrative costs for Inland Revenue. Consultation 30.To test out the problem and possible solutions, we have engaged with a variety of private sector stakeholders over the past 18 months. Their involvement and cooperation will be important to the success of any policy change given their clients and members are those most likely to be affected. 31.We have advised stakeholders that their initial suggestion of an operational solution is not likely to be effective, which means that a legislative change seems necessary. Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand has acknowledged that the current law generally does not require consistency in allocations. A key private sector concern with any legislative change is that either the vendor or the purchaser might be given undue power, and that there would therefore be a negative impact on commercial transactions. Therefore, this issue, among others, is discussed in depth in the officials’ issues paper. The recommended solution has included some safeguards to try to reduce these concerns. Sensitive Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Economic Development Committee PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION ISSUES PAPER Proposal 1.This paper seeks the Cabinet Economic Development Committee’s agreement to the relea se of an officials’ issues paper, Purchase price allocation, for public consultation. Executive Summary 2.In September, the Government announced two tax policy initiatives to support the Econom ic Plan – a law change to provide greater deductibility of feasibility and other currently non-deductible expenditure; and public consultation on options to relax the tax loss continuity rules and review the research and development tax loss cash out scheme introduced in 2016. 3.In approving these measures, Cabinet noted these initiatives were part of a package of pro posed business-related tax initiatives in the Government’s Tax Policy Work Programme, including some items that raise revenue (DEV-19-MIN-0255). 4.One of these items is the purchase price allocation initiative. This is an integrity measur e which is aimed at increasing the efficiency of the tax system and ensuring that sales of businesses and commercial property (in particular) do not lead to an inappropriate income tax reduction. The integrity of the tax system was an important theme emphasised by the Tax Working Group and work in this area has been prioritised following the Group’s final report. 5.A number of sizeable transactions, particularly in relation to commercial property, have b een identified by Inland Revenue with differences between the seller’s and the purchaser’s allocations, sometimes in the tens of millions of dollars. This discrepancy is, in effect, an unintended subsidy from the government. 6. The government is currently missing out on an estimated of tax revenue per annum, as a result of a gap in the law that allows the buyer and the seller to adopt different asset valuations for tax purposes in respect of the same sale transaction. This arbitrage can result in the seller treating the sale proceeds as non - taxable capital gains and the purchaser treating the purchase price as dedu ctible/depreciable. 7.The issues paper seeks feedback on possible changes to the tax rules to correct this anomaly. 1 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-12-05 11:06:36 SENSITIVE s 9(2)(f)(iv) 2. 8.The purpose of these proposed changes is to reinforce the integrity of the tax system by requiring the buyer and the seller to ascribe the same value to the assets sold. 9. The estimated revenue raised by these changes (if they were to be adopted) is approximately over the forecast period. 10.I am also seeking Cabinet’s approval to delegate final policy decision-making to the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue. This is to ensure the changes can be implemented for transactions occurring on or after 1 April 2021 and the revenue raised can be used to increase gross spending for Budget 2020, if we decide to proceed with changes to the law following public consultation. Background 11.When a bundle of assets with different tax treatments is sold, both the vendor and th e purchaser need to allocate the global price between the different assets to determine their tax treatment. Sales of businesses and commercial properties (land, buildings and fit out) tend to be the largest transactions of this kind, but sales of residential rental properties are also affected. The allocation is important in determining the vendor’s tax liability from the sale, and the purchaser’s cost base for calculating depreciation and any taxable gains when they in turn come to sell the property. 12.Generally, the allocation must be based on market values, and there is case law that rei nforces this. However, there is no explicit requirement in tax law for the vendor and purchaser to use the same market values, except in relation to the trading stock component of a transaction. When trading stock is sold along with other assets, the vendor is required to apportion an amount to the trading stock that reflects its market price, and the purchaser is required to use that same apportionment. Trading stock is widely defined for this purpose, including anything produced, manufactured or acquired for the purpose of disposal, as well as livestock, timber, and land whose disposal would produce income. Anecdotally it appears that this requirement may not be well understood. The issue 13.If the parties adopt different allocations, the result is usually a loss of tax revenue. Th is issue is on the tax policy work programme, and was referred to as part of a business tax package when Cabinet made a decision to proceed with the feasibility expenditure and loss continuity initiatives earlier in the year. Analysis 14.For revenue integrity reasons, the parties should be using consistent valuations ba sed on market values. Generally, throughout the Income Tax Act, sales are assumed to be at market value so that there is no transfer of value between the parties which could lead to a reduction in tax revenue. 15.In practice, consistent valuations are adopted in many cases. However, since market val ue is a range of values, parties are able to adopt allocations which are quite different, while both claiming that their allocations are tethered to commercial prices. 2 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-12-05 11:06:36 SENSITIVE s 9(2)(f)(iv) In many cases, the seller uses depreciated tax book values for depreciable assets, arguing that they are reflective of market values, but avoiding any depreciation clawback (that is, the requirement to pay back depreciation deductions claimed in respect of an assets that has not, in fact, depreciated as fast as expected). The purchaser on the other hand often allocates a higher cost to the same assets, to increase depreciation deductions. Example A Co. has agreed to sell its assets to B Co. The assets include land and buildings (all non-depreciable), and fit-out and other depreciable property. The total purchase price is $90 million. A Co. will only be taxable on the portion of the sale price attributable to depreciable property (up to the original cost of the property), and not the portion attributable to the land and buildings. A Co. believes the appropriate allocation of the price is: Allocation A Co’s Cost A Co’s Profit A Co’s Tax Land and buildings $ 30m $20m $10m 0 (as a capital gain) Depreciable property $60m $60m 0 0 In contrast, B Co. believes $20 million more should be allocated to depreciable property, and $20 million less to land and buildings, i.e. the land and buildings would be $10 million and the depreciable property $80 million. This would increase B Co’s tax deductions. If they both adopt their separate allocations, A Co. pays no tax and B Co. gets additional depreciation deductions of up to $20m (a tax benefit of $5.6m given a company tax rate of 28%) over time. 16.The lack of an explicit requirement for the vendor and purchaser of a business to adopt a consistent allocation incentivises the parties not to agree on an allocation. Inland Revenue incurs significant costs trying to match buyers and sellers, investigate their allocations, and obtain valuations to determine whether the parties’ allocations can be challenged as departing from market values. Where both parties have a valuation from a registered valuer, challenge is extremely difficult, even if the valuations are significantly different. 17.Inland Revenue’s compliance work has uncovered a number of sizeable t ransactions, particularly in relation to commercial property, where there have been differences between the seller’s and purchaser’s allocations to depreciable property sometimes in the tens of millions of dollars. Differences were identified in nearly fifty percent of the investigated cases, amounting in total to around $130 million. In some of these cases, settlements have been agreed. The remainder are either in dispute or have not yet been dealt with given resource constraints. There is no doubt that under current law, many of these discrepancies will not be able to be resolved. 3 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-12-05 11:06:36 SENSITIVE Issues paper proposal 18.To resolve these issues the issues paper seeks feedback on the following approach: In any transaction involving the sale of assets with different tax treatments, the ven dor and purchaser would be required to use the same allocation of the total purchase price to the different types of assets. If the two parties cannot agree an allocation, the purchaser must use the ven dor’s allocation. The vendor, before filing its tax return for the relevant income year, must disclose its allocation to the purchaser. If the vendor does not provide its allocation to the purchaser in a reasonable amount of time, the purchaser may prepare an allocation, which must then be used by the vendor. The allocation should be based on relative market values or, possibly in rel ation to a vendor allocation, depreciated value or original cost in relation to depreciable property. Given the breadth of coverage (rental properties would be covered, for exa mple), and to reduce compliance costs, there could be a de minimis – e.g. sales in which the total amount allocated by the purchaser to deductible or depreciable items is less than $100,000 could be excluded from the consistency requirement. Consultation 19.The issue has been identified in investigations and disputes over a number of years. An o rganised programme of investigation into large commercial property transactions brought it into focus. The increased profile of the issue within Inland Revenue has flushed out further transactions, and it seems clear that there is a need for action of some kind. 20.To test out the problem and possible solutions, officials engaged with key sta keholders, in particular Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, the Corporate Taxpayers Group, Russell McVeagh, PwC and KPMG. Their involvement and cooperation will be important to the success of any policy change given their clients and members are those most likely to be affected. While these stakeholders would prefer an operational solution, given the time and cost involved, and the need for consistency, officials have advised that a legislative change seems to be a better solution to this issue. Financial Implications 21.There are no direct financial implications of this Cabinet paper. 22. If the proposals outlined in the issues paper were to be implemented exactly as proposed, this is estimated to increase tax revenue by approximately over the forecast period. 23.This estimate is based on a sample of known cases, extrapolated out to the total estimated base of depreciable property sold with other assets. As it does not include financial arrangements, or revenue from improved compliance with the trading stock 4 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-12-05 11:06:36 SENSITIVE s 9(2)(f)(iv) rules, it is potentially conservative. However, it should also be noted that the methodology to reach this number is complex and relies on a number of assumptions. 24.Any changes to the design of the measure following consultation is likely to change t hese estimates. Systems and Administrative Implications 25.The proposal does not give rise to significant operational or systems changes and w ould have low administrative costs for Inland Revenue. Legislative Implications 26.Implementing these proposals would require changes to the Income Tax Act 2007. 27.The issues paper indicates that any legislative changes resulting from the proposals p ut forward in the paper would be included in a tax bill in early-mid 2020. Impact Analysis 28.The issues paper substitutes for a Regulatory Impact Assessment. Inland Revenue’s Q uality Assurance panel has reviewed the issues paper and confirms that it is likely to lead to effective consultation and to support the delivery of Regulatory Impact Analysis that supports subsequent decisions.
