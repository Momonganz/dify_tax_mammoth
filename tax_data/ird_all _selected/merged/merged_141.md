Increased costs and disbursements awarded against Commissioner
==============================================================

2014 case note – CIR ordered to pay increased costs to cover exceeded time allocation, witness expenses, litigation, travel and other expenses.

Case

Trustpower Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

High Court Rules

### Summary

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") was ordered to pay increased costs on the basis that the nature of the proceeding was such that the time required substantially exceeded the standard time allocations, and because the Commissioner's conduct was considered to have contributed unnecessarily to the time or expense of the proceeding. The Commissioner was also ordered to pay disbursements for witness expenses, litigation support services, and various travel and accommodation expenses.

### Impact of decision

Rule 14.12 of the High Court Rules ("HCR") does not restrict claims for witnesses' expenses to that of expert witnesses only.

### Facts

On 12 November 2013, Andrews J found for Trustpower Limited ("the disputant") in the substantive proceeding. Accordingly, the disputant was entitled to claim costs against the Commissioner (_Trustpower Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2013\] NZHC 2970, \[2014\] 2 NZLR 502 (HC)). The disputant claims a total of $1,448,213 (comprising $1,021,631 in costs and $426,582 in disbursements). The Commissioner has accepted liability for, and has paid, a total of $639,967, comprising costs of $477,290 and disbursements of $162,677.

### Decision

#### _Increased costs pursuant to r 14.6(3)(a) of the HCR_

The Commissioner accepted that increased costs are appropriate under r 14.6(3)(a) of the HCR due to the fact that the nature of the proceeding, and the steps in the proceeding, are such that the time required substantially exceeds the time allocated under band C of Schedule 3 of the HCR. However, the Commissioner contended that a smaller increase than that sought by the disputant should be allowed.

_Discovery and Agreed Statements of Facts_

Andrews J accepted the disputant's submission that discovery in this proceeding required a very substantial amount of work, far in excess of the seven days provided for under the scale, and accordingly considered that discovery was clearly a huge and complex task.

Andrews J considered that a realistic and pragmatic approach was required, as an award of costs without uplift would not "reflect the complexity and significance of the proceeding" (r 14.2(b)). Her Honour accordingly concluded that the reasonable time for completing discovery in this proceeding was 70 days, which results in an award of $205,800.

Counsel for the disputant submitted that preparation of the agreed statements of facts was a very involved and extensive process.

Andrews J accepted that the agreed statements of facts were prepared with the Commissioner's knowledge and involvement, that they were of value to the parties and the Court and that preparation thereof is a "step in the proceeding", which is not specifically mentioned in schedule 3 of the HCR and therefore should be allocated a time for that work.

Andrews J concluded that a reasonable time allocation for preparing agreed statements of facts is 40 days, which results in an award of $117,600.

_Preparation for briefs of evidence_  

The disputant sought a time allocation of 39.85 days, being half of the time actually spent, minus the five days allowed under band C of Schedule 3 of the HCR.

Counsel for the Commissioner submitted that no time allocation should be given to the briefs of evidence of Dr Harker and Mr Kedian due to the fact that draft witness statements for each of them had been provided to the Adjudication Unit of Inland Revenue, essentially submitting that the briefs of evidence were duplication.

Concerning the evidence of Dr Harker and Mr Kedian, counsel for the disputant submitted that while the briefs of evidence were consistent with earlier draft statements, substantial further work was required to brief and prepare evidence to respond to the Commissioner's change in position from asserting at the adjudication stage that the disputant was committed to each of the four projects to asserting at trial that the resource consents applied for by the disputant during the feasibility process were stand-alone capital assets.

Andrews J held that there was no duplication of work and that the briefs of evidence of Dr Harker and Mr Kedian required a substantial amount of work, as well as those of Mr Campbell and Mr Palmer, which were necessary for the disputant to meet its burden of proof.

Andrews J accordingly made the following time allocations: Dr Harker, 7 days; Mr Kedian, 7 days; Mr Campbell, 7 days; Mr Palmer, 5 days; and Mr Hagen, 3 days. This is a total of 29 days, which amounts to $85,260.

_Preparation for trial_ 

The disputant sought an order for costs for 53.1 days, being half the time actually spent, less the five days allocated under the scale.

Counsel for the disputant submitted that significant work was required in terms of preparing for trial. She further submitted that the number of documents included in the common bundle, as well as the need to deal with issues raised by the Commissioner's expert witnesses in their briefs of evidence, impacted on the time spent preparing for trial. Counsel for the Commissioner submitted that 20 days was a reasonable allocation for trial preparation.

Andrews J considered that the determinations required in this proceeding were fact-specific and accordingly found, without concluding that the reasonable time allocation for preparation for trial should be arrived at as if there were four trials, that preparation in this case was extensive.

Andrews J held that the nature of the proceeding was such that the time required by the disputant substantially exceeded the time allocated under band C and accordingly awarded 30 days, which amounts to $88,200.

#### **_Increased costs pursuant to r 14.6(3)(b) of the HCR_**

In addition to an order pursuant to r 14.6(3)(a) of the HCR, the disputant also sought an order for increased costs on the grounds that the Commissioner contributed unnecessarily to the time and expense of the proceeding by:

*   taking an overly expansive and undiscriminating approach to the factual matters she chose to put in dispute and failing to accept incontrovertible facts;
*   intending to call evidence as to the resource management consenting processes when the disputant, observing that the issue is fact-specific, informed the Commissioner that an expert witness was unlikely to add any value; and
*   raising novel and un-foreshadowed arguments in the evidence of Mr Hucklesby, which made it necessary for the disputant to call evidence from Mr Freeman, the senior audit partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers ("PwC").

Even though counsel for the Commissioner rejected all of counsel for the disputant's criticisms, Andrews J accepted that the Commissioner's approach warranted an additional uplift. Andrews J held that determination of the central issue as to whether the expenditure on the resource consents was capital or revenue, did not require the Commissioner to put the disputant to proof on the majority of the allegations in the disputant's Statement of Claim. Andrews J further considered that the breadth and extent of discovery was considerably greater than necessary (so too was the common bundle) and accordingly awarded an uplift of 10 per cent on discovery, preparing the agreed statements of facts and briefs of evidence, as well as preparing for trial.

#### **_Disbursements pursuant to r 14.12 of the HCR_**

_Witness expenses_

Mr Freeman gave expert evidence as an auditor and accountant. Counsel for the Commissioner submitted that the claim for reimbursement of his fees should be disallowed because:

1.  Mr Freeman was not required to prepare a brief of evidence; and
2.  Mr Freeman's evidence was unnecessary due to the fact that Mr Hagen was also called by the disputant to give expert accounting evidence.

Andrews J held that Mr Freeman's evidence was reasonably necessary as it was her view that Mr Freeman's evidence focused on establishing the independence of two opinions provided to the disputant concerning issues raised by the Commissioner. This put in issue whether the disputant's accounting treatment of obtaining resource consents was correct. Andrews J allowed the expenses of $48,690.

Mr Kedian, formerly General Manager, Generation, of the disputant, gave extensive factual evidence as to the disputant's business, the feasibility analysis process and the four projects.

Counsel for the Commissioner submitted because r 14.12 of the HCR only allows for expert witnesses' fees to be claimed as a disbursement, Mr Kedian's fees could not be allowed because he was a witness of fact.

Andrews J, referring to _Harper v Beamish_ HC Napier CIV-2009-441-636, 27 March 2012 and _Body Corporate 396711 v Sentinel Management Ltd_ \[2012\] NZHC 2556_,_ held that there was nothing express or implicit in r 14.12 which allows recovery of expert witnesses' fees only. Her Honour also rejected counsel for the Commissioner's submission that Mr Kedian "could readily have been subpoenaed". His evidence was extensive and the Court, as well as the parties, was substantially assisted by it.

_Litigation Support services_ 

The disputant has claimed recovery of $112,268, which counsel for the Commissioner submitted could not be claimed as a disbursement because: 

*   if the work had been done internally, a disbursement could not have been claimed; and
*   charges relating to extracting documents for listing (which cannot be claimed as a disbursement) are different from the process of listing them.

Andrews J concluded that the engagement of PwC was in relation to work that was distinct from that undertaken by the disputant. Her Honour was accordingly satisfied that the disbursement was for the purposes of the proceeding, specific to and reasonably necessary for the conduct of the proceeding, and reasonable in amount. Bearing in mind the award that had already been made, Andrews J concluded that the Commissioner should pay $56,134 of PwC's litigation support.

_Counsel's travel and accommodation expenses_  

Andrews J held that Mr Harley's travel and accommodation expenses were incurred for the purposes of the proceeding, and were specific to, and reasonably necessary for, the conduct of the proceeding. The expenses were also reasonable in amount and her Honour accordingly allowed the disbursement of $35,307.

Indemnity costs awarded to the Commissioner
===========================================

2013 case note – CIR applied for and awarded indemnity costs in a case where the proceeding was determined to be unnecessary.

Case

Redcliffe Forestry Venture Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

High Court Rules

### Summary

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") applied to the Court for indemnity costs in relation to _Redcliffe Forestry Venture Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2011\] 1 NZLR 336 (HC) ("_Redcliffe_") which was heard in the High Court in 2011 where the plaintiffs alleged that the original Trinity judgment of the High Court (which led to the Supreme Court decision in _Ben Nevis Venture Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2008\] NZSC 115, \[2009\] 2 NZLR 289 ("_Ben Nevis_")) should be set aside on the basis that the defendant "presented a false case". The Commissioner sought indemnity costs, increased costs or costs on a 2C basis on the grounds that the plaintiffs' case was vexatious, frivolous or otherwise an abuse of process. The Court determined that the plaintiffs' case was hopeless from the outset and amounted to a collateral attack on the Supreme Court's judgment in _Ben Nevis_ and was unnecessary and improper.

### Impact of decision

The decision confirms that the Court may award indemnity costs where a proceeding is unnecessary.

### Facts

The case concerns a costs judgment made in regard to _Redcliffe_ which was heard in the High Court in 2011. In _Redcliffe_ the plaintiffs alleged that the original Trinity judgment of the High Court which led to the Supreme Court decision in _Ben Nevis_ should be set aside on the basis that the defendant "presented a false case".

The Commissioner succeeded in the substantive case in the High Court and the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court overturned a decision made by the Court of Appeal in favour of the plaintiffs on the procedural ground that the Commissioner should have applied to strike out the statement of claim rather than protest jurisdiction. The Commissioner sought indemnity costs, increased costs or costs on a 2C basis on the grounds that the plaintiffs' case was vexatious, frivolous or otherwise an abuse of process.

### Decision

The Court awarded indemnity costs to the Commissioner.

A Judge has the discretion to award indemnity costs under rule 14.6 of the High Court Rules if the party has acted vexatiously, frivolously, improperly, or unnecessarily in commencing a proceeding.

Rule 14.6(3) states that the Court may award increased costs if the party opposing increased costs has contributed unnecessarily to the time or expense of the proceeding by pursuing an argument that lacks merit.

The Court determined that the plaintiffs' case was hopeless from the outset and amounted to a collateral attack on the Supreme Court's judgment in _Ben Nevis_.

Justice Brewer found that the proceeding was unnecessary and improper. The proceeding was unnecessary because the Supreme Court had already determined the issues at hand. Further, making a collateral attack on the Supreme Court was improper. However, His Honour could not find an evidential basis for saying that the case was frivolous or vexatious.

His Honour dismissed the plaintiff's argument that indemnity costs could not be awarded because no substantive findings were made in the High Court judgment. His Honour found that if a claim was brought to the Court, the Court had no jurisdiction to hear it, and the circumstances behind the making of the claim led to the conclusion that it was unnecessary and improper, then indemnity costs could be awarded.

Indemnity costs awarded
=======================

2010 case note - shows that the CIR when faced with ill-conceived or unmeritorious litigation may apply and can be successful in seeking indemnity costs.

Case

Accent Management Limited v CIR - Costs judgment

Legislative References

Income Tax Acts, High Court Rules

### Summary

The Commissioner was awarded indemnity costs following an unsuccessful judicial review application by the taxpayer.

### Impact of decision

The case illustrates that the Commissioner, when faced with ill-conceived or unmeritorious litigation, may apply and can be successful in seeking indemnity costs.

### Facts

After an unsuccessful High Court challenge (_Accent Management Ltd & Ors v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (2005) 22 NZTC 19,027 ("Trinity")) of the Commissioner's assessments relating to its 1997 and 1998 income tax years, and subsequent unsuccessful appeals to the Court of Appeal (_Accent Management Ltd & Ors v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (2007) 23 NZTC 21,323 (CA) ) and the Supreme Court (_Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2009\] 2 NZLR 289 (SC)), Accent Management Ltd ("Accent") applied for a judicial review of the validity of those same assessments.

In response, the Commissioner applied for a strike-out of Accent's judicial review proceeding together with an application for an order for indemnity costs.

On 12 March 2010, the High Court (Keane J) struck out Accent's judicial review proceeding on the basis that it was an abuse of process and asked both parties for their submissions on the issue of indemnity costs (_Accent Management Limited v The Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ HC AK CIV 2008-404-8649 12 March 2010).

#### The Commissioner's submissions

The Commissioner submitted that indemnity costs were appropriate because Accent's judicial review proceeding was "manifestly wholly unmeritorious as a matter of law", and had been pursued with the ulterior motive to frustrate, or at least delay, Accent's tax liability crystallising in accord with _Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v CIR_.

#### Accent's submissions

Accent submitted that indemnity costs were not appropriate because it had not acted vexatiously, frivolously, improperly or unnecessarily; was not culpable of flagrant misconduct; had not acted either badly or very unreasonably, or with an ulterior motive.

It was further submitted that no safe conclusions could be made about Accent's conduct "in the absence of a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the challenge proceedings".

### Decision

Before reaching its conclusion on the indemnity costs issue, the High Court provided an overview of the three types of costs and the circumstances in which they could be awarded.

In relation to indemnity costs, the High Court confirmed that, pursuant to High Court Rules (HCR) 14.6(4)(a), indemnity costs "are to be imposed only, in the main, where a party has acted ‘vexatiously, frivolously, improperly or unnecessarily in commencing, continuing or defending a proceeding or a step in a proceeding'". The High Court went on to say, citing the Court of Appeal's formulation of different cost types in _Bradbury v Westpac Banking Corp_ \[2009\] 3 NZLR 4, that indemnity costs could be ordered where a party "has behaved either badly or very unreasonably".

To determine whether Accent had acted in a way that warranted an award of indemnity costs, the High Court asked itself two questions. Firstly, whether the case was hopeless from its inception, and secondly whether the party should have known that to be so (_Bradbury v Westpac Banking Corp_).

The High Court concluded, as it had in its earlier strike-out judgment (_Accent Management Limited v The Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ HC AK CIV 2008-404-8649 12 March 2010), that Accent's judicial review proceeding was "wholly unmeritorious and self evidently so from the outset". This was because Accent was advancing the same argument that had been rejected by the Supreme Court; that argument being radically different from the argument that Accent had advanced in the High Court and Court of Appeal previously.

Furthermore, the High Court decided that Accent could not say that the Commissioner hade made his assessments dishonestly or defectively, and that in reality, the judicial review proceeding was a "collateral attack on the assessments and decisions adverse to it" and as such, was an abuse of process.

The High Court chose not to speculate as to Accent's purpose or whether Accent had an ulterior motive in seeking judicial review because the self-evidently, wholly unmeritorious judicial review proceeding justified indemnity costs in any case.

Commercial In Confidence EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Background E1 Inland Revenue (IR) is required by the Tax Administration Act 1994 to protect the integrity of the tax system, including the perceptions of that integrity. To assist with this, in December 2018 IR commissioned Colmar Brunton to undertake research with the objectives of: • identifying the key factors that influence New Zealanders’ trust in IR and the tax system • determining which of these factors can be influenced by IR’s actions and which cannot • understanding how IR’s actions build or erode that trust. E2 Colmar Brunton held interviews and focus groups with New Zealanders to discuss their trust in IR and the tax system. The issues that emerged during these discussions were to then be further tested in an online survey. During the interviews, New Zealanders raised several issues that appeared to affect their trust in IR and the tax system. As one of these issues was a person’s political leanings, a question on this was included in the online survey. The question was approved by IR and read: People often indicate their political affiliation along a spectrum of left and right. Using this divide, where on the spectrum would you place yourself? (from 0 to 10). E3 The media reported on this question being used in a survey of New Zealanders by IR, and publicly queried whether IR’s intention behind the question was politically motivated. IR initially defended the inclusion of the question on political leanings but reconsidered after the media publicly queried whether IR’s motivation for the question was political, and IR’s view is now that it should not have been included in the survey. As a result, IR directed Colmar Brunton to delete the data on political leaning and not report on it, and instigated this review. E4 IR engaged MartinJenkins to conduct this review, asking us to consider and form an opinion on: • whether there is any evidence that including the question on political leanings was in any way politically motivated. • the adequacy of the end-to-end process leading to the approval of the political leanings question. This will include looking at the commission and design of the relevant research, and the procurement, decision-making and review processes for approving the question. • whether the processes supporting the decision to include the political affiliation question in the survey were considered and balanced against the risks to the integrity of the tax system. This includes perceptions of political neutrality. E5 We gathered and considered a wide range of documentation relating to the survey – from conceptualisation to implementation – and interviewed 12 IR employees, and a Group Account Director from Colmar Brunton. We shared a draft report with IR and the interviewees and asked for any corrections to our summary of the facts. 7 Commercial In Confidence Findings Whether the decision to include the question was politically motivated E6 We have found no evidence of political motivation in the use of the question on political leanings or the setting of the questions. We are confident that there was no political motivation at any point, from when the research was conceived to when the survey was implemented. The adequacy of the end-to-end process leading to the approval of the political leanings question and Whether the processes supporting the decision were considered and balanced against the risks to the integrity of the tax system E7 We considered these questions through a range of lenses including IR’s statutory requirements; its ethical framework including the State Services Code of Conduct and IR’s own Code of Conduct; the globally-recognised COSO internal control approach and IR’s adaptation of that, with a particular emphasis on IR’s approach to risk management; the strategic intent of the research and the intended strategic purpose of the question on political leanings; procurement policies and procedures and how they applied in this case; the roles and responsibilities of project sponsors and project managers at IR; the IR delegation framework; and new policies and procedures developed and/or introduced from late 2018. It became obvious that the answers to these two questions are entwined. E8 IR has all the policies and procedures you would expect to find to satisfy the obligations of good practice required of the frameworks outlined above. Another important part of the context is the statements IR has made about the way it wants to work, that is that it aspires to be intelligence- led, customer-centric and agile, meaning decision making is delegated to the lowest possible level, closest to customers. Together, these factors form a coherent approach, that is an empowered environment balanced with appropriate checks and balances. E9 However, the application of the checks and balances to the end-to-end process in this instance was inadequate. Risks to the integrity of the tax system and political neutrality are at the heart of reputational risk for IR. This report uses “reputational risk” as shorthand for both. E10 Throughout the process leading to the approval of the question we have seen a fragmented risk management regime that allowed a risk to become a problem. For example, risks were considered in the paper to the Strategic Governance Board outlining the strategic intent of the research, but this did not include consideration of reputational risk. Risks to the effectiveness of the research were separately considered in designing the research but not reputational risk. Risks to successful procurement were separately considered in the procurement process but not reputational risk. Risk management specialists in IR had no visibility of the research at any point in the process. IR has a sophisticated risk management regime but its application in this case was fragmented and there were gaps. There was no overall coherent consideration of risk. Commercial In Confidence There was no effective leadership or management of risks across the process. At no point was the risk of a perception of lack of political neutrality raised. E11 There was no consideration of the Codes of Conduct through the process. This in itself is not surprising, but it is surprising that the risk to political neutrality – core to the Codes – was never explicitly considered. E12 There was a designated project sponsor for the research but their role was not clear. IR has guidance setting out the roles of project sponsor and project manager for enterprise projects. There appear to be no formal expectations for project sponsors and managers for projects below enterprise level. This research project is not an enterprise level project but had a designated project sponsor. If the guidance for project sponsors for enterprise projects was applied – and there must have been some expectations for the project sponsor designation to have any meaning – then this would include responsibility for quality. This would include all key risks, including to perceptions of a loss of political neutrality. The enterprise level guidance also requires project managers to discuss risks with the project sponsor. E13 The process of finalising the survey questions included a rigorous, question-by-question engagement between IR research experts and Colmar Brunton. The question on political leanings was explicitly checked and quickly confirmed with no risks identified. At no point was this or any other question escalated to managers above or outside the core research team. No manager above or outside the core research team asked whether the questions were consistent with the requirement for political neutrality, whether they negated or created risks to the integrity of the tax system, or to see the questions. E14 The risk management regime, and the Codes of Conduct, explicitly identify perception of a loss of political neutrality as a key risk. The inadequacy of the application of the risk management regime, and the other elements of the control environment, led to this very risk becoming an issue. This case has revealed that the “risk aware” or “risk intelligent” culture envisaged in the risk management framework does not apply universally in IR. Risk management specialists struggle to engage with some business areas, and focus on those business areas that do engage. There is no comprehensive ongoing training of staff in the risk management regime. New staff – including staff new to the Public Service – do not necessarily receive training in the regime, and how it relates to the Codes of Conduct. E15 Other factors may have contributed to the inadequacy of the process, including key staff on leave, new managers being asked to sign off contracts just after they have started, and staff new to the Public Service. Recommendations E16 We recommend that Inland Revenue: a. Remind all staff what it means to be politically neutral in line with State Services Commission guidance, including the need to avoid the perception that IR’s political neutrality has been compromised. 9 Commercial In Confidence b. Review the content relating to political neutrality and the Codes of Conduct used in its induction process. c. Set expectations relating to risk management in induction. d. Clarify what it expects of project sponsors and project managers in projects other than enterprise investment projects. e. Raise the profile of its risk and assurance functions to ensure they have consistently high visibility across IR, and that other parts of IR are consistently receptive to benefitting from these functions. f. Devise a strategy for monitoring and, if possible, measuring risk intelligence across IR so it can be tracked over time. g. Expect project leaders to consider risk in tandem with strategy when leading projects. h. Hold IR’s executives to account for ensuring their areas of responsibility exhibit risk intelligence. i. Defragment risk management by: i. ensuring risk is considered at project level in light of the Enterprise Risk Management Framework. ii. considering an amendment to Commercial & Procurement’s checklist to include confirmation that the business area seeking a procurement has assessed all relevant risks, including reputational risk. j. Hold IR’s executives to account for implementing each component of the Internal Control Framework, with particular attention paid to monitoring and improvement. 11 Commercial In Confidence INTRODUCTION Background to this review 1. Inland Revenue (IR) is required by the Tax Administration Act 1994 to protect the integrity of the tax system, including the perceptions of that integrity. To assist with this, in December 2018, IR commissioned Colmar Brunton to undertake research with the objectives of: • identifying the key factors that influence New Zealanders’ trust in IR and the tax system • determining which of these factors can be influenced by IR’s actions and which cannot • understanding how IR’s actions build or erode that trust. 2. Colmar Brunton held interviews and focus groups with New Zealanders to discuss their trust in IR and the tax system. The issues that emerged during these discussions were then further tested in an online survey. 3. During the interviews, New Zealanders raised several issues that appeared to affect their trust in Inland Revenue and the tax system. As one of these issues was a person’s political leanings, a question on this was included in the online survey. The question, as approved by IR, read: People often indicate their political affiliation along a spectrum of left and right. Using this divide, where on the spectrum would you place yourself? (from 0 to 10). 4. Throughout this report we refer to this as ‘the question on political leanings’. 5. The media reported on IR’s inclusion of the question on political leanings after a Fairfax Media business journalist interviewed IR’s Group Manager, Marketing and Communications. The Group Manager initially defended the inclusion of this question, arguing that it was needed for research and was not included for political purposes. The media publicly queried whether IR’s intention in including the question was politically motivated, and this led to IR reconsidering the question. IR’s view is now that the question should not have been included in the survey. As a result, IR directed Colmar Brunton to delete the data on political leanings and to not report on it. IR also initiated this review. The terms of reference for this review 6. MartinJenkins was asked to consider and form an opinion on: • whether there is any evidence that including the question on political leanings was in any way politically motivated. • the adequacy of the end-to-end process leading to the approval of the political leanings question. This will include looking at the commission and design of the relevant research, and the procurement, decision-making and review processes for approving the question. 12 Commercial In Confidence • whether the processes supporting the decision to include the political affiliation question in the survey were considered and balanced against the risks to the integrity of the tax system. This includes perceptions of political neutrality. 7. Throughout this report we use “reputational risk” to refer to both the risk of political neutrality being compromised and the risk to the integrity of the tax system. The structure of this report 8. This report is structured as follows: • The control environment at Inland Revenue – an outline of the legal and ethical frameworks, internal policies and other components of IR’s control environment • What happened: The events – an outline of the relevant events, from the commissioning of the research, through to the decision to delete the data relating to the question on political leanings, and related events that occurred in response • Findings – our analysis of what happened, including what went wrong • Recommendations – our suggestions for how IR can improve its systems and minimise the risk of similar events occurring in the future. Methodology 9. This review was conducted in phases. First, to help us understand the timeline of events, IR provided MartinJenkins with a range of documents relating to: • preliminary strategic material • the procurement process • the process for finalising the topic guide that shaped the qualitative research and the questions used in the survey. 10. Second, MartinJenkins interviewed 12 IR staff and a Group Account Director from Colmar Brunton. The questions were derived from the material provided to us in the document review. 11. Throughout the interviews we discovered more documents we needed to consider which were subsequently provided to us. These documents helped us understand the control environment at IR. 12. We provided a draft of our report to IR to allow for a check of factual accuracy. We considered comments but retained our right as independent reviewers to address comments (or not) as we saw fit. 13 Commercial In Confidence Context 13. IR is undergoing an extensive, multi-stage business transformation programme which will streamline its processes, policies and online services to make it easier for New Zealanders to pay tax and receive entitlements. 14. IR has also signalled cultural traits which it aspires to demonstrate in its work which complement the business transformation process. IR aims to demonstrate an approach which is customer- centric, intelligence-led and agile. 14 Commercial In Confidence THE CONTROL ENVIRONMENT AT INLAND REVENUE 15. Inland Revenue has checks and balances in place, including to ensure political neutrality. This section describes the frameworks, policies and other components that together make up the control environment – the checks and balances – at Inland Revenue. These include: • IR’s legal framework – the statutory obligations that impact IR’s strategic direction • IR’s ethical framework – the obligations that IR staff have as public servants and that IR has as a State sector organisation • IR’s Internal Control Framework, and the globally recognised COSO framework on which IR’s framework is based • The culture and value statements IR has made about how it wants to work • IR’s risk management approach, both at an enterprise level and throughout a project, and including IR’s procurement policies and how they are applied • The roles and responsibilities of project sponsors and project managers at IR • IR’s delegations framework • New policies and procedures IR has implemented since the media interest in the question on political leanings. IR’s legal framework 16. Trust in the tax system is directly linked to the integrity of the system. Inland Revenue has a legal obligation to protect this integrity: every ‘officer’ of IR must use their best endeavours to protect the integrity of the tax system at all times. 1 17. The ‘tax system’ is defined in the legislation as including the following: • taxpayer perceptions of that integrity • the rights of taxpayers to have their liability determined fairly, impartially, and according to law • the rights of taxpayers to have their individual affairs kept confidential and treated the same as the tax affairs of other taxpayers • the responsibilities of taxpayers to comply with the law • the responsibilities of those administering the law to maintain the confidentiality of the affairs of taxpayers 1 Tax Administration Act 1994, section 6(1). http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1994/0166/383.0/DLM348343.html 15 Commercial In Confidence • the responsibilities of those administering the law to do so fairly, impartially, and according to law. 2 18. Further, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue is also required over time ‘to collect ... the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law’ (given resource constraints and so on). 3 Tax morale – derived from trust in IR – is believed to influence the voluntary payment of tax obligations and therefore the revenue provided to IR. 4 19. The impact of the Tax Administration Act on the strategy behind the research and the setting of the questions is discussed in the ‘Findings’ section of this report. IR’s ethical framework 20. In addition to their legal obligations, IR staff also have ethical obligations as State servants, as set out in the State Services Code of Conduct, the IR Code of Conduct, and the Cabinet Manual. 5 The State Services Code of Conduct 21. The State Services Code of Conduct (formally entitled ‘Standards of Integrity & Conduct’) sets standards of behaviour expected of State servants. 6 The Code itself states four general principles that State servants should adhere to with judgement: • Fair – treat people fairly and with respect • Impartial – maintain political neutrality • Responsible – act lawfully and objectively and using organisational resources carefully and only for intended purposes • Trustworthy – be honest and avoid activities that may harm the reputation of the organisation or the State services. 7 2 Section 6(2). 3 Section 6A. 4 ‘Tax morale’ measures taxpayer perceptions and attitudes towards paying and evading taxes. Research suggests that higher tax morale equates to more willingness to pay tax, and therefore more voluntary compliance with tax obligations. Across the economy, the impact of tax morale could be significant, for example in reducing the size of undeclared transactions that comprise the sharing economy. 5 The ‘public service’ is a subset of the ‘State services’ as defined in the State Sector Act 1988. IR is both part of the public services and the State services. 6 http://www.ssc.govt.nz/code 7 Compliance with the Code obliges state servants to have regard for: • The spirit of service to the community • The obligation that organisations have as part of executive government • The role of the State Services in supporting parliamentary democracy • The value of State servants having a lively interest in political matters. 16 Commercial In Confidence 22. Guidance issued by the State Services Commission explains the obligations on State servants under each of the four principles. 8 These are the main obligations relevant to this report: • State servants should have personal integrity, be committed to organisational responsibilities, and be aware of the extent to which other interests could impact those responsibilities (particularly senior staff). • Avoid any public perception that a department is not politically disinterested, public spirited and politically neutral, so that actions under one government do not affect the department’s ability to work under another government. • Work must not be influenced by personal beliefs, interests, or ethical viewpoints. • State servants should respect the authority of the government of the day. • State servants must act within the scope of the power or discretion conferred on them, and within their delegated authority. They must take an objective, balanced approach to their legislative responsibilities and respect the traditions of liberal democratic government and the rule of law. • An organisation’s resources must only be used for their intended purpose. • Information must be treated with care and used only for proper purposes. • Activities that may harm the reputation of the State services, whether at work or outside work, should be avoided. 23. Notably, organisations have obligations under the Code of Conduct too. For example, agencies should act decisively when a breach occurs. The Inland Revenue Code of Conduct 24. State sector organisations must maintain policies and procedures that enable them to give effect to the standards in the State Sector Code of Conduct. In meeting this requirement, each organisation may develop additional or more detailed provisions for its particular circumstances. This is the process, anticipated in the State Sector Act, by which an organisation will issue its own code of conduct, incorporating the standards in the State Sector Code of Conduct and building on them with detail that is directly relevant to its own work and context. 25. IR has a Code of Conduct dating from 2008 (updated in 2016). It covers both the standards expected of all State servants and expectations specific to IR and the legislation it administers – for example, the Tax Administration Act. It applies to all Inland Revenue employees, whether permanent, temporary, casual and fixed-term (including workers sourced from employment agencies). It also applies to external contractors or consultants working for Inland Revenue. 8 The Code is supported by two sets of guidance: • Implementing the Code of Conduct – Resources for Organisations: http://www.ssc.govt.nz/upload/downloadable\_files/Implementing-the-code-of-conduct-updated-7-Dec-09.pdf • Understanding the code of conduct – Guidance for State servants: http://www.ssc.govt.nz/sites/all/files/UnderstandingtheCode- April2010.pdf 17 Commercial In Confidence “\[F\]or the code of conduct, and a whole bunch of reasons, it is not our job to try and influence political persuasion.” – Deputy Commissioner, Information & Intelligence Services 26. Notably, the IR Code of Conduct includes a ‘decision making checklist’. When making decisions, IR staff are encouraged to ask themselves: • Is it legal? – does it conform to laws and policies? • Is it equitable? – will the decision be the same for everyone else in the same circumstances? • Is it naturally just? – are you being impartial and open-minded? • Is it likely to be misconstrued? – consider the public’s perception of your proposed actions. • Is it open to scrutiny? – are your stated reasons for taking the proposed action your real reasons? • Is it sensible? – in the context of other related decisions. 27. IR staff are advised to discuss difficult decisions with their managers. Similarly, if they believe others are behaving badly they are encouraged to raise this with management. 28. Employee obligations are spelled out in the IR Code of Conduct: • protect the integrity of the tax system at all times, including taxpayer perceptions of that integrity (section 6 of the Tax Administration Act 1994) • maintain the secrecy of all matters relating to the legislation that Inland Revenue administers (section 81 of the Tax Administration Act 1994) • work within the law with honesty, integrity, openness to scrutiny, and concern for the public interest • comply with Inland Revenue’s policies and not do anything which might bring Inland Revenue and the public service into disrepute • respect the rights of colleagues and customers • provide a professional service at all times to the Minister, the public and your colleagues • take all practicable steps to prevent personal injury and illness in the workplace. 29. The IR Code of Conduct also addresses the need to protect the integrity of the tax system, saying: We are ... all required to manage the real and perceived risks to the integrity of the tax system and must ensure that nothing we do creates, or has the potential to create, a threat to the integrity of the tax system or a perception among taxpayers that certain groups in the community somehow receive preferential treatment. 30. Again, where IR staff are in any doubt how to deal with an issue relating to the integrity of the tax system, they must discuss the issue with their manager before taking any action. 18 Commercial In Confidence 31. Provisions in the IR Code of Conduct relating to political neutrality are similar to those in the State Sector Code of Conduct. 32. The IR Code of Conduct notes that breaches may result in disciplinary action against the employee concerned. This can range from warnings, to dismissal in cases of serious misconduct. In some situations the employee could be prosecuted. 33. Examples of breaches that, if proved, may lead to dismissal include: • dishonest, illegal or corrupt behaviour in the workplace • misuse of Inland Revenue property, business tools or funds • knowingly, negligently or carelessly subjecting Inland Revenue assets and resources to undue risks • behaviour that is likely to bring Inland Revenue into disrepute. The Cabinet Manual 34. The Cabinet Manual is the authoritative guide to New Zealand’s system of central government decision making and a primary source of information on constitutional matters. 9 This includes important information on the role of State servants, particularly around the relationship they have with the Executive. 35. The Cabinet Manual provides that members of the public service: • are to act in accordance with the law • are to be imbued with the spirit of service to the community • are (as appropriate) to give free and frank advice to Ministers and others in authority, and, when decisions have been taken, to give effect to those decisions in accordance with their responsibility to the Ministers or others • when legislation so provides, are to act independently in accordance with the terms of that legislation. 36. Further, public servants must meet these obligations in accordance with important principles and values such as political neutrality, fairness, and integrity. In relation to political neutrality, the Cabinet Manual specifies that: \[O\]fficials must be politically neutral in their work, serving the current Minister in such a way that they will equally be able to serve any future holder of the office. This principle of political neutrality is central to the public service’s ability to support the government of the day and any future government. 37. For their part, Ministers must respect the political neutrality of the public service and not ask officials to act in a way that would conflict with the Code of Conduct. 9 https://dpmc.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2017-06/cabinet-manual-2017.pdf 19 Commercial In Confidence 38. The State Services Code of Conduct is referred to in the Cabinet Manual. The Cabinet Manual notes that the State Services Commissioner sets the Code of Conduct and that agencies within the State services must maintain policies and procedures that are consistent with the Code. IR’s formal control framework 39. This section outlines the recognised COSO framework and IR’s formal Internal Control Framework (ICF) which is based on the COSO framework. The COSO framework 40. The COSO framework is a widely adopted, globally recognised internal control framework, developed and maintained by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. It was designed to help organisations establish, assess and enhance their internal control. The framework has five components: • Control environment – the standards, processes and structures that provide the basis for carrying out internal control across an organisation, including its integrity and ethical values, as reinforced by management • Risk assessment – a dynamic and iterative process for identifying and assessing risks to the achievement of objectives, consideration of risks against risk tolerance, and the basis for determining risk management • Control activities – the actions (preventative or detective) established through policies and procedures that help ensure risk mitigation is carried out • Information and communication – communication is the continual, iterative process of providing, sharing, and obtaining necessary information • Monitoring activities – evaluations used to ascertain whether each component of internal control is present and functioning, with the findings shared as appropriate. 41. We have considered the institutional elements that make up the control framework at IR in reference to COSO. IR’s Internal Control Framework 42. Inland Revenue has an Internal Control Framework (ICF), developed in 2008. Former Commissioner, Bob Russell wrote in the Foreword: The Internal Control Framework sets out the principles and identifies the drivers of our control environment. The Internal Control Framework feeds and enhances many of the other frameworks we have and is a key component in providing assurance to Government and the public that we are doing our job well. 43. The ICF is based on COSO. It has five components, each of which has an equivalent in COSO, as shown in the table below. 20 Commercial In Confidence Table 1: Comparison between COSO and IR’s Internal Control Framework COSO ICF Control environment Leadership and culture Risk assessment Goals and objectives Control activities Control activities Information and communication Information and communication Monitoring activities Monitoring and improvement 44. COSO and the ICF essentially cover the same areas of focus but with different labels. The comparison between the frameworks highlights an important point. What COSO terms ‘risk assessment’ (covering the risk to achieving objectives) the ICF terms ‘goals and objectives’ (including the strategy for achieving objectives and the risk management framework). This neatly demonstrates the inseparability of risk and strategy. To achieve objectives, an organisation should have a strategy and a corresponding risk management framework. An organisation’s handling of the interplay between these components of the control framework is vital for its success. IR’s culture and values 45. In COSO terms, the control environment is the standards, processes and structures that provide the basis for carrying out internal control across an organisation, including its integrity and ethical values, as reinforced by management. Inland Revenue’s Internal Control Framework simplifies this, stating that leadership sets the tone by ‘influencing our \[IR’s\] attitude towards control’. The tone from management is reflected in all the documents discussed in this report. However, this section considers the culture and values as stated by IR. 46. IR defines its culture as ‘what’s important to us in how we work’. This is defined as the following three traits: • Customer-centric: together we understand the many influences on each customer, and decide how we will work with them to get the best outcomes for New Zealand. • Intelligence-led: we’re confident we make good decisions based on quality information and analysis. We continually test and learn to know what the best approaches will be. • Agile: we work at pace, pulling together the right people to make good decisions quickly, focusing on the things that matter most. 47. Four values underpin the culture that will enable IR to be customer-centric, intelligence-led and agile: • Trust and integrity: we act with integrity, honesty and professionalism. 21 Commercial In Confidence • Innovating to make a difference: we keep finding new ways to lift our performance and make compliance easier. • Valuing people: we treat each other and our customers with respect. • Working together: we work together and with other organisations to deliver better services and value. Risk management at Inland Revenue 48. As noted above, strategy and risk management are inherently interrelated. This report now turns to the risk management frameworks that Inland Revenue applies: • the Enterprise Risk Management Framework (and the Risk Management Policy included in it) • assurance mapping • the Commercial and Procurement branch risk register and refreshed approach • the risk register in the Procurement Plan • the risk register in the Recommendation to Appoint. Enterprise Risk Management Framework 49. The Enterprise Risk Management Framework (ERMF) sets out the risk management policy and practice at IR. The ERMF is clear from its opening paragraph that: ‘Everyone is responsible for identifying, understanding and actively managing risks that can affect the achievement of IR’s objectives and outcomes’. 50. The ERMF contains the Risk Management Policy. It opens with a Policy Statement noting that: ‘Risk management will inform our decision making to ensure that we deliver our objectives safely’. The table below presents the roles and responsibilities of IR staff in relation to enterprise risk, as set out in the policy. Table 2: Staff roles and responsibilities in relation to enterprise risk, as set out in the Risk Management Policy in the ERMF Role Responsibilities Commissioner • Ultimately accountable and responsible for managing risks to IR Deputy Commissioner, Corporate Integrity and Assurance • Owns the Risk Management Policy 22 Commercial In Confidence Role Responsibilities Executive Leadership Team • Owns the enterprise risks • Provides risk management leadership • Promotes a risk-smart culture Corporate Integrity and Assurance • Provides independent advice and assurance to the Commissioner on the governance and integrity of the tax and social policy systems • Provides the resources to support IR staff to comply with the Policy Manager, Risk Services • Administers the Policy and owns the ERMF Line Management and staff • Comply with and actively support the Policy and ERMF • Accountable and responsible for risks relevant to their role 51. The ERMF commits Inland Revenue to adopting best practice in risk management in order to ensure that: • IR has a current, accurate and comprehensive understanding of its risks • Risk management is embedded within IR’s overall strategic and operational policies and practices. 52. The ERMF also sets out IR’s goals for risk management, namely: • Lead and promote a risk intelligent culture to identify, assess and manage risks • Continuously improve our risk management practices to fit our changing environment • Encourage our people to apply their judgement, insight and experience, supported by evidence. 53. The ERMF includes an operational guideline that steps through the risk management process to ensure that risks are managed in a clear and consistent way across IR. As part of ‘risk identification’, IR staff are encouraged to consider concerns that may impact on: • strategy and governance • people, policy, process and platform • time, cost and quality • data, information and metrics. 54. Appendix A of the ERMF contains an Enterprise Risk Rating Tool that includes a Consequence Assessment Matrix. The Matrix lists ‘negative national media coverage’ as a moderate consequence of a reputational risk. Appendix B includes a Project Risk Rating Tool, which 23 Commercial In Confidence includes a Consequence Assessment Matrix for projects that notes ‘sustained negative national ... traditional media coverage’ as a severe consequence of reputational risk in a project. Assurance mapping: Risk management works in conjunction with assurance 55. Assurance is the process through which risk management controls are reviewed to ensure they are applied effectively. IR has an assurance mapping system to provide a visual representation of the risks and controls in place and how effective they are. The assurance process will identify risks with inadequate assurance coverage, or areas with duplicated assurance coverage. 56. Assurance is considered in three ‘lines’: • First line: controls that have been established by management to mitigate risks • Second line: management’s monitoring that provides assurance the controls are working • Third line: independent reviews that provide assurance the controls are working – for example, internal or external audits. 57. An assurance map for the integrity of the tax system was drafted around 2013. The Manager Internal Audit told us it is now out-of-date and that it has not been seen by most current Deputy Commissioners. How is enterprise risk management applied at IR? 58. A risk management framework is only as good as the extent to which it is implemented, incorporated into day-to-day workflows, considered as part of project oversight, and reinforced by a risk-aware culture. In COSO terms, the control environment needs to be reinforced by control activities; by information and communication about expectations from management; and by monitoring to ensure expectations are being met. This part of our review report considers what we have heard about efforts to embed risk management into the processes and psyche of Inland Revenue. Internal control activities relating to risk 59. The Internal Assurance & Advice unit operates an 18-month rolling plan, targeting risk areas in a dynamic risk environment. The unit works like an internal consultancy. 60. IR has told us that risk management guidance is not included in the induction material provided to new staff. IR recommends that managers discuss risk with new staff. Generally, new staff find out about the ERMF when Corporate Risk & Assurance goes into their business area, they hear about it, or it is a requirement in a template for a particular process. 61. There is a risk management module on LearnIR designed for managers and team leaders. 10 We were told that it needs refreshing and is not mandatory. The module took the place of a wider 10 LearnIR is IR’s online Learning Management System and hosts learning resources, allows IR staff to enrol and attend internal face-to-face or video conference sessions, and keeps a record of courses IR staff have completed or attended. 24 Commercial In Confidence session in the two-day, face-to-face induction IR once had. The Risk Services Manager has had an initial discussion with the team behind LearnIR about having the risk management capability incorporated into other modules (rather than it being isolated in its own module) to reinforce the concept that consideration of risk should be part of a business process. 62. A Quick Guide to Risk Management was distributed to IR staff in 2016 via a desk drop. 63. There is a Risk & Assurance Committee with five independent members. 64. Risk Services – part of Corporate Risk & Assurance – is in the process of revising and refining its quarterly reporting format to IR’s Strategic Governance Board (SGB). They are trialling a ‘risk radar’ approach that identifies the extent of the gap between current risk and target risk. The intention is for this information to prompt the remediation of risk (and therefore investment decisions) or risk acceptance discussions. The Commercial & Procurement branch risk register 65. The Commercial & Procurement branch maintains a risk register. We were told that each risk on the register is assessed in relation to a specific procurement at the outset and managed throughout the procurement process. There are six high-level risks on the register: • Complete or partial failure of supply of critical goods and services including information technology and communications-supported infrastructure, e.g. hardware or operating software • Procurement processes are not undertaken or performed with due regard for policy and probity considerations • Loss of value for money risk • Fraud, bribery and corruption • Insufficient capacity and capability of Commercial & Procurement teams • Risk related to Enterprise Support Services (a new software package). 66. Commercial & Procurement is moving to a new risk assessment approach, represented in a series of bowtie diagrams provided to us. 11 The six high-level risks that underpin the approach are the same as those listed above. Some of the triggers listed for each risk could be indirectly relevant to the review. Breaches of political neutrality (or the perception of a lack of neutrality) are not specifically listed in the new approach but would presumably fall under the risk of insufficient policy and probity considerations. The IR Code of Conduct and Master Services Agreement 67. IR has a Master Services Agreement with Colmar Brunton which specifically states: Maintain reputation: The Service Provider must not engage in any activity of conduct that might, in Inland Revenue’s opinion, damage the reputation or image of Inland Revenue or the Crown. 11 A bowtie diagram (sometimes known as a ‘butterfly’ diagram), shows causal relationships between risk triggers and risks, and risks and consequences. They are named after their shape, and show preventative and corrective controls to manage risk. 25 Commercial In Confidence 68. There is also a generic clause in all of IR’s Master Services Agreements (including that with Colmar Brunton) setting out that suppliers must “comply with all Inland Revenue policies and procedures”. 69. We were told that IR’s Code of Conduct is currently shared directly with some suppliers. Further, IR is developing a new Supplier Code of Conduct which addresses, amongst other things, ethical responsibilities. The research risk register in the Procurement Plan 70. The Procurement Plan included a risk register that listed the following risks to the effectiveness of the research: • Agreeability bias: if customers express more positive sentiment toward IR than they really feel (presumably because they would be on an IR platform) • Timeliness: the risk of delay • Methodology – customer understanding: the risk of customers struggling to understand the difference between ‘IR’ and ‘the tax system’ • Methodology – self-selection risk: the risk that customers who are less trusting will be less likely to engage in the research • Sampling: the risk of having skewed data due to only some types of customers participating in the research • Personnel: the risk that stems from the project lead being on leave for six weeks during the project. 71. Reputational risk to IR was only considered as a subset of the first risk area above: agreeability bias. The Procurement Plan noted that this risk was lessened by the independence of the procured researchers. The risk register in the Recommendation to Appoint 72. The Recommendation to Appoint also contained a risk register. Four of the risks in the Procurement Plan are carried through to the Recommendation to Appoint: timeliness; methodology – customer understanding; methodology – self-selection risk; and sampling. There are also two new risks: • Embedding and activating the insights: the risk of not establishing key relationships with stakeholders in a position to act on the information • Identifying the drivers of trust: the risk of not identifying the drivers of trust in the first phase of the research, creating great difficulty to run additional phases. 73. Reputational risk is not mentioned in the Recommendation to Appoint. 26 Commercial In Confidence Responsibilities of project sponsors and project managers 74. Inland Revenue provided us with its guidance for those sponsoring and managing enterprise projects, in the form of a PowerPoint slide pack used in a workshop for enterprise project sponsors. The survey project that is the subject of this review would not qualify as an ‘enterprise project’. However, given the research had an executive designated as a ‘project sponsor’, it is useful to draw parallels between 1) the defined expectations of a project sponsor and project manager for enterprise projects; and 2) what we could have expected from those performing these roles for the research into trust. 75. According to the guidance, the roles and responsibilities of a project sponsor include: • working with the project manager to ensure risks are proactively managed • providing ‘active leadership’ for the project until completion • providing constructive feedback • fostering ‘close alignment’ between the senior responsible owner (SRO), sponsor, and project manager 12 • supporting the SRO in their accountabilities. 76. As part of proactively managing risk, project sponsors are expected to be able to ‘call out’ risks and propose a change in course, or to stop a project if necessary. They must understand the factors that are likely to drive risk and monitor them. The sponsor is the ‘escalation point’ for difficult issues. Ultimately, they must be able to allocate adequate time to the project. 77. Project managers are tasked with discussing risks and issues with the SRO or sponsor so that they understand the potential impacts. The project management role includes actively managing risks and issues that arise. The project manager must formally review risks and issues regularly. When risks meet a specified level of severity they must be escalated. 78. ‘Management’ must ensure that the SRO, project manager and working committees are very clear about their roles and responsibilities and those of the wider team. 79. The relationships between key actors for enterprise projects at IR as set out in the project sponsor guidance are presented in the diagram and table below. 12 The Senior Responsible Owner (SRO) is the individual responsible for ensuring that a project or change programme meets its objectives and delivers the projected benefits. They should be the owner of the overall business change that the project is supporting. 27 Commercial In Confidence Figure 1: Governance interactions at IR, as depicted in the slide pack for the enterprise project sponsor workshop 28 Commercial In Confidence Table 3: Areas of focus for enterprise project sponsors, as depicted in the slide pack for the enterprise project sponsor workshop 80. The guidance also notes that lessons should be learnt from other projects so that previous pitfalls are avoided and IR can capitalise on ‘good lessons’. The IR Delegations framework 81. Inland Revenue is transforming to become more agile, intelligence-led and customer-centric. This will mean that over time delegations will be exercised through devolved decision making at the lowest possible level. The first step was a new approach to Revenue Delegations and the devolving of selected decisions for the new roles in Customer & Compliance Services – Individuals; Customer & Compliance Services – Business; and Information & Intelligence Services in February 2018. 82. This enables: • faster (more agile) decision making by avoiding the need to seek decisions from more senior staff • decisions to be made at a point closest to customers (customer-centric), drawing on the knowledge of those who work most closely with customers (intelligence-led). 29 Commercial In Confidence 83. However, this new approach also comes with a risk, in that some decisions are made further from senior management. This risk needs to be mitigated by an effective control environment, for example having decisions with significant implications reserved to selected roles. 84. At IR, positions are also assigned a delegation level by human resources. Delegation levels are set out in the Position Matrix. Staff are told to use the Position Matrix to identify the delegation level (and thereby the staff member with that delegation level) that needs to make a particular decision. Delegations generally only apply to particular areas of control. Financial delegations may be made separately. They may also be restrictions on some powers to make decisions. 85. Delegation levels relevant to this review include the following: • Level 4 (and therefore also levels 1, 2 and 3) can approve contracts for service with independent contractors. However, this has a caveat: level 2, 3, and 4 delegation holders should not approve appointments to jobs reporting directly to them. These appointments and salaries should be approved by a delegation holder at the next level up. • Level C financial delegation (or above) would be needed for the expenditure for the value of the Colmar Brunton contract. What IR has changed since the survey? 86. This section considers new policies, procedures and analysis that Inland Revenue has implemented since the survey was released. Some of this work was already in train when media interest in the question on political leanings began and was then adjusted in response. Interim guidance for surveys, interviews and focus groups 87. In direct response to the issues that led to this review, the Deputy Commissioner Intelligence & Insight Services issued Interim guidance for conducting surveys, research interviews or focus groups, effective from 27 February 2019. This guidance has interim status until IR can consider the recommendations from this review and establish new processes if necessary. 88. The guidance includes new steps ‘required’ when conducting surveys and other research. It applies across Inland Revenue – that is, not only to research conducted by the Customer Insight and Evaluation Group. 89. These are the key components of the guidance: • All ‘surveys, etc’ require a business owner or sponsor at Tier 3 or above. • That sponsor is required to approve the questions being asked, ensure that any contract with a provider is clear that IR will own the data created, and ensure there is documentation setting out appropriate data storage, distribution and management. 30 Commercial In Confidence • The full guidance on the content of questions is as follows: o Any question referring in any way to the recipient’s political views is inappropriate. o Questions that meet any of the below criteria are discouraged during this interim period.  Questions referring to the Government e.g. ‘Do you think the Government makes good use of taxpayer money?’  Questions seeking feedback on current policy e.g. ‘Do you think the Student Loan scheme is fair?’, unless the research is being undertaken on behalf of the Government.  Questions that on face value don’t seem relevant to the purpose of the survey ‘e.g. ‘How would you describe your overall life satisfaction?’  Questions that on face value seem frivolous, e.g. ‘Would you feel happier receiving a tax refund or extra fries with your pizza?’ o If the business owner / sponsor believes that a question meeting any of the above criteria should still be included, they must escalate that decision to Mike Cunnington, Deputy Commissioner Intelligence & Insight Services. 90. The guidance tells IR staff: If you have any questions or would like advice on how to conduct research during this period, speak with...Group Lead Customer Insight & Evaluation. Enterprise Risk: failure to preserve political neutrality 91. We were provided with the bowtie diagram for the enterprise risk of failure to preserve Inland Revenue’s political neutrality that was produced after the events leading to this review. IR currently considers the risk of this event to be high (possible likelihood, moderate consequence) but aims to move it to low (possible likelihood, minimal consequence). A number of the triggers for this risk indirectly relate to the research that we are reviewing, but one is directly relevant: ‘IR internal or external communications inadvertently imply and/or are perceived to be politically biased’. 92. The diagram lists two preventative controls for the risk of failure to preserve political neutrality: • Management oversight of third party commissioning, milestone development and delivery and preapproval of output • Quality review mechanisms. Insights and Evaluation Policy 93. IR’s Insights and Evaluation Policy sets out guiding principles and responsibilities intended to ensure that individuals who conduct research for, or on behalf of, IR maintain the highest standards of professional conduct. The policy takes effect from 1 April 2019 and covers all staff, contractors, and other individuals carrying out research activities and research. Work on this new policy started in spring 2018, well before there was media interest in this research, although material on political neutrality was added as a result of the media interest. 31 Commercial In Confidence 94. Much of the policy is not directly relevant to this report – for example, the provisions relating to data storage, record keeping, peer review, and conflicts of interest. However, the policy does have provisions relating to political neutrality that are derived from the guidance described above: All research undertaken by, or on behalf of, Inland Revenue must remain politically neutral. Research should not ask participants about their political affiliations or interests, their views on political parties, or anything that could create a perception of political partiality. 95. The IR Code of Conduct is noted in the Insights and Evaluation Policy as a ‘related’ IR document. 96. The Methodology section of the policy states: ‘Researchers should ensure they use research methods appropriate for each project, and base conclusions on critical analysis of the evidence’. 97. Suspected breaches of the policy should be reported to the Group Lead – Customer Insight and Evaluation so they can be investigated. If a breach involves any employee of IR, they may also have breached the Code of Conduct. In addition to managing suspected breaches, the Group Lead will work with employees to ensure standards are met and will share the policy with individuals wanting to work with (or on behalf of) IR. 98. The owner of the Insights and Evaluation Policy is the Customer Insight and Evaluation Advisory Committee (CIEAC) of IR executives. CIEAC will: • be kept regularly informed by the Group Lead about any breaches of the Insights and Evaluation Policy and actions taken to address these • advise the Commissioner of any significant concerns regarding research or evaluation conducted in contradiction of the policy. Customer Insight & Evaluation Workflow Process 99. The Customer Insight & Evaluation Team unveiled a new workflow process in October 2018, as the process for procuring Colmar Brunton was underway. The process has been refined since then and we were told it is now more embedded. 100. The Workflow Process clarifies responsibility for sign-off at key points. For example: • As part of the project design phase, the scoping document is to be signed off by a level 3 staff member and the Group Lead (and the stakeholder) • As part of the kick-off phase: o the procurement plan and request for proposals, if required, are to be signed off by the Group Lead o ‘research tools’ are to be signed off by a level 3 staff member o ‘instruments’ (questionnaires, topic guides, and so on) are to be signed off by a level 3 staff member or team leader and the internal client o the analysis plan is to be signed off by a level 3 or Group Lead. 32 Commercial In Confidence 101. The Workflow Process includes a list of key times to get senior staff involved, namely: project qualification, project design brainstorm, questionnaire and/or topic guide design, analysis session, story-telling session, and before design of the final output. 102. The new Workflow Process has the benefit of clarifying responsibilities for sign-off at key points. However, it is not clear from the documents we have been provided how and when risk would be considered throughout the process. 33 Commercial In Confidence WHAT HAPPENED: THE EVENTS Figure 2: Illustration of the timeline 34 Commercial In Confidence Overview of the timeline 103. This section sets out the events that comprise the end-to-end process that led to this review being commissioned. 104. The events can be considered in six phases: • Strategic thinking at senior level • Scoping work for a contractor • Procuring Colmar Brunton as the contractor • Refining the work sought from Colmar Brunton • Survey going live and attracting media interest • Actions taken since the survey. 105. An organisation chart showing the relationships between the relevant IR staff is in Appendix 2 of this report. Strategic thinking at senior level 106. IR’s Strategic Governance Board (SGB) considered tax morale and the impact it can have on voluntary compliance in November 2017. At that point the SGB considered a paper titled Trust in the public sector. It was sponsored by the Deputy Commissioner, Policy & Strategy and presented by a manager in the Strategy branch and a Senior Strategist. The paper was intended to consider: • how trust impacts IR’s strategic direction • what would help maintain trust in IR and the revenue system • what IR could do better to influence trust. 107. The Minutes show that SGB agreed that: • SGB would schedule a discussion on a potential ‘Communications Strategy’ for IR and how IR can influence New Zealanders’ perceptions about the tax/revenue system and why it is good to participate in it. This would be led by the then-Deputy Commissioner, Information, Intelligence & Communications with the help of the strategy team. The paper would also address investment requirements and potential outcomes IR would get from this. • As part of the customer segment strategies, new segment leads would consider and incorporate trust data, including demographic differentiation, into the development of customer segment strategies. 108. SGB next considered a paper titled Influencing perceptions of tax on 18 April. The paper was sponsored by the Deputy Commissioner, Information, Intelligence & Communications. Its purpose was to discuss a strategy for influencing New Zealanders’ perceptions of tax and why it is good to participate in the tax system. 35 Commercial In Confidence 109. The Board agreed that: • influencing tax morale is a strategically important part of IR’s activity. Relevant areas of IR should build it into their plans, funding it through their business group budgets • a formal part of the process of considering, costing and implementing new projects and policies is to consider the possible impacts on tax morale • influencing tax morale should be considered as part of the continuing work on the customer segment strategies. Scoping work for a contractor 110. Between April and July, IR staff, including the Group Lead, Customer Insight & Evaluation, a Senior Strategist and an Intelligence & Insight Specialist, scoped work for a contractor to increase IR’s understanding of trust in IR and the tax system, and the flow-on impact on tax morale. This eventually manifested as a draft procurement plan in September. The Request for Quotes (RFQ) was released to a closed panel of suppliers selected from the All of Government Consultancy Panel on 25 September. 111. The RFQ listed the following research objectives for the project: • identify the key factors that influence customers’ overall trust in IR and New Zealand’s tax system • determine which of these can be influenced by IR’s actions and which cannot • understand how IR’s communications and behaviours build or erode customers’ trust and collaborate with us to identify tangible next steps and actions • develop questions for the ongoing monitoring of customers’ trust in IR and the tax system, to provide internal stakeholders with actionable insights and timely indicators of any noteworthy changes. 112. The RFQ indicated IR was open as to the approach to the research but offered initial thoughts on the methodology, seeing it as including the following: • a discovery phase, involving a literature review and stakeholder engagement to capture what is already known • an ‘uncover’ phase involving qualitative and quantitative research methods to find out what the key drivers of trust are for IR customers • a phase determining solutions and next steps, to be led by the provider in close collaboration with IR. Procuring Colmar Brunton as the contractor 113. After the RFQ went to market, Inland Revenue received four tenders from suppliers by the deadline of 8 October. Between 8 and 12 October the tenders were evaluated by a core team of 36 Commercial In Confidence two Intelligence & Insight Specialists and the Group Lead, Customer Insight & Evaluation. Moderation was conducted by the Commercial Manager, Commercial Corporate. 114. On 12 October, Colmar Brunton and one other provider were notified they had been shortlisted. Each presented to IR on 17 October. Between 18 and 30 October, the evaluation panel confirmed and refined its scores of the shortlisted candidates, completed its evaluation, and refined its recommendation to appoint. 115. On 30 October, the Manager, Commercial Corporate endorsed the recommendation to appoint. The Commercial Manager, Commercial Corporate emailed the recommendation to appoint to the Intelligence Leader, Intelligence & Insight for sign off. On 1 November, the Commercial Manager, Commercial Corporate wrote to Colmar Brunton to inform them they were the preferred provider. 116. The RFQ anticipated the following timeline when it went to market: • 22 October – the provider was to be confirmed • 29 October – ‘set up’ meeting with selected provider was to be held and Statement of Work was to commence • 30 October to 27 November – fieldwork was to be undertaken • 29 November – the provider was to meet with the Research Evaluation & Insight Team to discuss findings • 3 December – the provider was to present to key IR stakeholders • 4–7 December – an ongoing monitoring solution was to be developed in collaboration with key IR stakeholders, notably the Research Evaluation & Insight Team. Refining the work sought from Colmar Brunton 117. Through November and December, IR and Colmar Brunton liaised to refine the work programme for the qualitative work that would inform the survey. Colmar Brunton submitted revised pricing on 29 November. 118. Through this process it was agreed that Colmar Brunton would be involved in three pieces of work: • running a series of ethnographic dyads and/or triads 13 to gain an understanding of drivers of trust for particular populations • running a series of focus groups to gain a more general sense of drivers of trust • running an online survey. 13 ‘Dyads’ and ‘triads’ are interviews with groups of two and three interviewees respectively. Interviews of this nature are common in qualitative research. 37 Commercial In Confidence 119. Colmar Brunton began work with the dyads and triads on 7 December. Focus group discussions were held on 31 January 2019. 120. The Statement of Work was signed by Colmar Brunton on 17 December and by IR on 19 December. 14 The timeline in the signed Statement of Work contained the following deliverables in section 3.2: • 5 December – project planning and qualitative topic guide • 20 December – development of draft questionnaire for survey • 24 January 2019 – final questionnaire agreed • 10 February – fieldwork (survey in field) complete • week of 25 February – analysis and story-telling sessions with IR • 8 March – draft report. 121. Between 8 and 24 January, IR and Colmar Brunton discussed the rationale for each of the draft survey questions, agreeing on the specific rationale behind each individual question and the framework for the survey. This was mostly done by email but included a meeting on 17 January. The questions were considered one-by-one and several attracted considerable attention, including some with political themes. However, despite the relatively thorough process, no issues were raised with the question on political leanings. Minor wording changes to the questions continued to be discussed up until 30 January, when IR confirmed it was comfortable with the wording by an email from an Intelligence & Insight Specialist to a Colmar Brunton Group Account Director. The survey goes live and attracts media interest 122. Pre-notification of the survey going live was sent to 40,000 customers on 25 January. A pilot survey was sent by Colmar Brunton on 31 January. The survey went live on 1 February. 123. Media queries began on 5 February. The Group Manager, Marketing & Communications was interviewed by a Fairfax Media business journalist on 7 and 8 February. 124. After a lengthy meeting of relevant IR staff on Saturday 9 February as a result of media queries, the Group Lead, Customer Insight & Evaluation emailed Colmar Brunton asking for the data from the question on political leanings to be deleted. A Colmar Brunton Group Account Director confirmed this would happen when the working week began. On 6 March he confirmed that the data had been deleted from the data download. Colmar Brunton further confirmed on 20 March that the data had been deleted from the original servers so there is no way it could be unarchived’. 125. At 9 am on 11 February the survey was removed from the internet. 14 The Statement of Work was signed after Colmar Brunton began working. This is not unusual, particularly as there is a Master Services Agreement between these parties and there is a need for balance between compliance with processes and getting on with the job. 38 Commercial In Confidence Actions taken since the survey 126. The Deputy Commissioner, Information & Intelligence Services issued Interim guidance for conducting surveys, research interviews or focus groups on 27 February. 39 Commercial In Confidence FINDINGS “\[W\]e said...the question was inappropriate, so something has clearly gone wrong.” – Deputy Commissioner, Information & Intelligence Services The terms of reference 127. MartinJenkins was asked to consider and form an opinion on these three issues: • Whether there is any evidence that including the question on political leanings was in any way politically motivated. • The adequacy of the end-to-end process leading to the approval of the political leanings question. This will include looking at the commission and design of the relevant research, and the procurement, decision-making and review processes for approving the question. • Whether the processes supporting the decision to include the political affiliation question in the survey were considered and balanced against the risks to the integrity of the tax system. This includes perceptions of political neutrality. 128. Our finding on political motivation is presented first. The second and third issues are closely related and we therefore present our findings on them together. Was there political motivation? From the terms of reference: • Whether there is any evidence that including the question on political leanings was in any way politically motivated. Key finding 129. We have found no evidence of political motivation in the use of the question on political leanings or the setting of the questions. We are confident that there was no political motivation at any point, from when the research was conceived to when the survey was implemented. 130. In the following sections we expand on that finding, including on Inland Revenue’s strategic intent in commissioning the survey and the specific purpose of including the question on political leanings. 40 Commercial In Confidence The strategic intent behind the research 131. This section first considers the strategic intent of the research, and the relationship between that intent, Inland Revenue’s objectives and the rationale for the question on political leanings. IR’s broad strategic intent 132. As noted, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has a legal duty to collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law. 15 Further, every IR staff member has an obligation to protect the integrity of the tax system. 133. The integrity of the tax system is directly linked to the trust New Zealanders have in IR, which domestic and international research suggests correlates to ‘tax morale’ – that is, the willingness to pay tax and voluntarily comply with tax obligations. In turn, tax morale directly relates to the net revenue collected by IR and therefore to the fulfilment of the Commissioner’s duty. These relationships are shown below. Figure 3: Integrity contributes to IR’s objective IntegrityTrust Tax morale Voluntary compliance Collection of highest practicable net revenue 134. Inland Revenue’s strategic objectives are set out in an A3 titled IR for the future, which is displayed around IR’s offices. It includes the organisation’s purpose, strategic objectives and cultural values. The strategic objectives include: Grow voluntary compliance by making it easier for people to get it right. 135. The document describes IR’s mission as being achieved when it delivers three specific outcomes, one of which is: Revenue is available to fund government programmes through people meeting payment obligations of their own accord. 15 Tax Administration Act 1994, section 6A(3). 41 Commercial In Confidence The strategy behind the research “We measure tax morale, trust in the tax system every quarter. Some quarters I see it go up, some quarters I see it go down and I have never over five years been able to attribute a reason as to why that is. It is therefore impossible for me to achieve my goal of influencing that trust, the perceptions of the integrity of the tax system because I don’t know what’s causing changes in movement at a public level.” – Group Manager, Marketing & Communications 136. IR’s Request for Quotes set out the objectives for the broader project. The successful provider was to: • identify the key factors that influence customers’ overall trust in Inland Revenue and New Zealand’s tax system • determine which of these can be influenced by Inland Revenue’s actions and which cannot • understand how Inland Revenue’s communications and behaviours build or erode customers’ trust and collaborate with us to identify tangible next steps and actions • develop questions for the ongoing monitoring of customers’ trust in Inland Revenue and the tax system, to provide internal stakeholders with actionable insights and timely indicators of any noteworthy changes. 137. In particular, IR believed it had some understanding of the functional elements of trust but less knowledge of the emotional associations that can underpin customer behaviour and decision- making around tax compliance. This was particularly true for some groups, including Māori and Pacific peoples. 138. As noted above, IR wants to be customer-centric and intelligence-led in the way it operates. The research was intended to directly contribute to this as it aimed to gather intelligence to help IR understand the influences on its customers’ perceptions of trust. 42 Commercial In Confidence The purpose of the question on political leanings “We felt like ... we hadn’t asked about people’s specific political party affiliation, and so we thought it was broad enough and there was a discussion, well actually it is anonymous, it is only being used internally. These were the things that were going through our heads.” – Intelligence & Insight Specialist 139. The set of survey questions was intended to improve Inland Revenue’s understanding of the degree of influence it had over trust. IR and Colmar Brunton worked through the rationale for each question in the survey in January 2019 until IR was comfortable the reason for asking each question was clear. Each question was inspired by what Colmar Brunton had heard about what drove trust in IR and the tax system through the interviews and focus groups it conducted in 2018. 140. Those we interviewed explained how regression analysis could show which factors drove trust the most. Theoretically, the research could have shown that trust in IR and the tax system was almost entirely controlled by factors IR could never influence. Those we interviewed argued that good research practice required IR to identify factors it knew it could not control – and would never try to control – in order to find out how much influence it may be able to have over the remaining factors, and therefore its ability to influence taxpayer perceptions of IR and the tax system. 141. IR knew it could not, and would not seek to, influence political leanings but the question that led to this review was included nonetheless to ascertain the influence this variable had on respondents’ trust in the tax system so IR could consider what influence it had through other variables it could influence. Findings on the strategy behind the research and the question 142. We find that the strategic intent behind the research was consistent with: • Inland Revenue’s broader strategy and legal obligation to protect the integrity of the tax system and to maximise trust in the system, increase voluntary compliance, and collect the greatest amount of revenue within the law • the traits IR seeks to display through its work, such as customer-centricity and intelligence-led actions. 143. However, the inclusion of the question had the perverse effect of undermining the integrity of the tax system by calling into question IR’s political neutrality. This is because risk was not adequately considered in conjunction with strategy. 144. The desire to understand the effect of political leanings on trust is understandable given the objectives of the research and IR’s broader objectives. IR believed it did not have a good understanding of the drivers of trust in IR and the tax system, and the range of factors that influence the drivers of trust over time. This was particularly true for the emotional associations 43 Commercial In Confidence that can underpin customer behaviour and decision-making around tax compliance, especially in regard to Māori and Pacific peoples. IR wanted to understand how much control it had over the drivers of trust, and thereby what it could do to influence trust and gain the benefits of a taxpayer base with greater trust in the tax system and IR. “Personally, I have come from a private sector background...it felt like another time, another place, this was a natural question to include. And I still think... from an integrity of the research point of view we needed to have it in there....” – Intelligence & Insight Specialist 145. The inclusion of the question was consistent with principles that could underpin research in a non-governmental context such as academia, where the political considerations of the Codes of Conduct and so on do not apply. The researchers wanted to use regression analysis to understand which drivers of trust were the strongest and how much control IR had over trust in the system. This meant asking respondents about things IR knew it could not control, to understand how important the things it could control were in affecting trust. “\[I\]t was actually not us trying to understand that particular point, it was actually to remove it from the series of drivers that we might look at.” – Intelligence Leader, Intelligence & Insight on why the question was included 146. We argue throughout this report that strategy and risk management should be intertwined. We understand what IR was trying to achieve through the research and the question, and why it would want to improve its understanding of trust in IR and the tax system. However, this is a case where reputational risk should have been given greater consideration within the strategic context. Had risk been properly considered, IR could potentially have found another way to achieve its strategic objective. Could the research have used an alternative approach? 147. We note that researchers we interviewed told us that there are usually a variety of options to achieve the objectives of research like this. Applying a reputational risk lens would ensure the option selected would not risk ambiguity in the perception of political neutrality. 44 Commercial In Confidence The adequacy of the process and consideration of risk From the terms of reference: • The adequacy of the end-to-end process leading to the approval of the political leanings question. This will include looking at the commission and design of the relevant research, and the procurement, decision-making and review processes for approving the question. • Whether the processes supporting the decision to include the political affiliation question in the survey were considered and balanced against the risks to the integrity of the tax system. This includes perceptions of political neutrality. Key finding 148. While the use of the question on political leanings was not politically motivated, it was clearly unacceptable and its inclusion reflected an inadequate application of internal controls. Our approach 149. In carrying out this review we considered the various frameworks, policies and other components of Inland Revenue’s control environment: these are discussed in detail earlier in this report, under ‘The control environment at Inland Revenue’. 150. In the course of this review it became obvious that the ‘adequacy of the end-to-end process’ was inseparable from consideration of ‘the risks to the integrity of the tax system’. We have therefore set out our findings on those two issues together in this section. Inland Revenue has a sufficient range of policies and procedures 151. IR has all the policies and procedures we would expect of a modern organisation. It has signalled it wants to work in a way that is agile, intelligence-led and customer-centric – all traits of a modern organisation. Delegating decisions to the lowest possible level is consistent with this. It allows decisions to be made quickly (without reverting up to senior leaders), by those who are closest to customers and who therefore know the most about customers through interacting with them. Together these factors form a coherent approach – that is, an empowered environment with what looks like appropriate checks and balances. 45 Commercial In Confidence However, the application of checks and balances was inadequate “You can always improve your controls.” – Deputy Commissioner, Information & Intelligence Services Risk management at IR 152. IR has a sophisticated risk management regime but its application in this case was fragmented. There were gaps, and there was no overall, coherent consideration of risk. There was also a lack of leadership and oversight of risks across the process. At no point was the risk of a perception of a lack of political neutrality raised. Risk management was fragmented 153. Risk was considered at a number of points in the project, including: • the paper to SGB setting out the strategic intent of the review • the design of the research, which considered risks to the integrity of the research (that is, the validity of the findings) • the procurement of the provider, which considered risks to the procurement and successful completion of the work. 154. The reputational risk from compromising the perception of political neutrality was not considered at any of these points. 155. Risk management appears fragmented across the business areas within IR involved in this project. Risk to the perception of political neutrality was only explicitly considered at the enterprise level after the events leading to this review had occurred. Other risks were considered throughout the procurement process but only those risks that would affect the integrity or delivery of the research, not the integrity and reputation of the organisation. A more ‘risk intelligent’ culture and a better control environment could have prevented this. Control activities relating to risk 156. There was a disconnection between the stated expectations of management in various policies (part of the control environment) and the control activities implemented in this case. The ERMF commits IR to adopting best practice to ensure that ‘risk management is embedded within IR’s overall strategic and operational policies and practices’. It sets out IR’s goals for risk management, including promoting a ‘risk intelligent culture’, aiming to ‘continuously improve risk management’. The risk team even predicted the ‘negative national media coverage’ that would follow an incident related to reputational risk. 157. In the terminology of the assurance framework, a number of controls have been established by management to mitigate risks to form the ‘first line’ of assurance. However, the ‘second line’ – 46 Commercial In Confidence management’s monitoring that provides assurance the controls are working – appeared to be missing in this case. In COSO terms (reflected in IR’s Internal Control Framework): • there were difficulties with information and communication • monitoring of risk practice was limited. Risk culture is inconsistent across IR 158. We heard that attitudes to risk management vary across Inland Revenue, with some parts being more risk-aware than others. Some parts do not engage with those attempting to manage enterprise risk. This means the risk specialists effectively have no visibility over what is happening in some of IR’s business areas. With so many risks competing for the attention of the Corporate Risk & Assurance Group, this can become reinforcing. If a business area does not want to engage there are plenty of other things for the Corporate Risk & Assurance Group to focus on. We heard that Deputy Commissioners can help ‘set the tone’ for risk management and set expectations for engagement with Corporate Risk & Assurance for their units. Interviewees implied that some Deputy Commissioners are more engaged in conversations about risk than others. 159. We have met with staff in parts of IR relevant to this review, including Commercial & Procurement. This unit has a unique role to play in two ways: • in overseeing the contract process where IR enters formal relationships with providers • in managing risk, in that some risks (financial risks for example) can be transferred to a provider through a procurement process. However, reputational risk will always remain with the organisation whose reputation is at stake – in this case, Inland Revenue. 160. Commercial & Procurement’s checklist could be amended to include confirmation that the business area concerned (e.g. research) has assessed all relevant risks, including reputational risk. “\[O\]ur plan is based on risk and when I don’t have engagement to discuss such things with managers...I would rather spend my time where it is appreciated.” – Manager Internal Audit Risk is not covered in induction 161. As documented above, risk is not specifically covered in induction. The module on LearnIR targets managers and team leaders only. IR’s Risk Services unit would prefer risk was incorporated into a number of modules to reflect how risk management should be incorporated into day-to-day practice. 47 Commercial In Confidence “I just use any means, honestly, I use any means to get in and push the word out that this \[risk management\] is actually a useful discipline.” – Group Manager, Corporate Risk & Assurance The Codes of Conduct should have provided a check 162. The Codes of Conduct should provide a check against reputational risk in that they unambiguously promote political neutrality in the conduct of the State services. There was no consideration of the Codes of Conduct through the process. This in itself is not surprising, but it is surprising that the risk to political neutrality – which is core to the Codes – was never explicitly considered. In other words, we would have expected a robust risk management framework to have picked this up. 163. The State Services Code of Conduct requires State servants to act impartially, in a politically neutral way. This includes avoiding the public perception that a department is not politically disinterested. It is important State servants have a full understanding of political neutrality. It is not enough to simply avoid influencing State sector work with the political leanings of those doing the work. State servants must avoid even the perception that their work is political in nature. 164. Notably, the IR Code of Conduct includes a decision-making checklist. Staff who are unsure about taking an action should ask, among other things, ‘is it likely to be misconstrued?’ and to ‘consider the public’s perception of ... proposed actions’. Clearly that did not happen in this case. “I felt like I was at all times actually operating within the Code of Conduct.” – Intelligence & Insight Specialist “\[O\]ur thinking around political neutrality was ... framed at not letting our political views influence what we do at work ... I think with hindsight, we should have been thinking about political neutrality in a broader sense ... what might the perception of asking this question be? Would that compromise the view that IR is politically neutral?” – Group Lead, Customer Insight & Evaluation The process for considering the questions should have identified risks 165. The IR researchers on the project engaged with Colmar Brunton to explicitly and rigorously clarify the research rationale for each individual question in the survey. The question on political leanings was explicitly checked and quickly confirmed with no risks identified. No senior managers outside the project team were consulted on this question, or any other. No senior manager asked about 48 Commercial In Confidence reputational risk – or risks to the integrity of the tax system – or to see the questions. The risk of the perception of compromised political neutrality should have been identified in this process. Roles of key project leaders “I wasn’t given guidance on that \[being a project sponsor\] and if there is some formal guidance on that I am still not aware of it.” – Group Manager, Marketing & Communications 166. The expectations of a project sponsor and project manager are not clear for a project of this kind. The guidance we were provided with for this review relates only to enterprise projects. No-one we interviewed could direct us to similar guidance for ‘lower’ level projects (such as research projects) which, as this report demonstrates, can still involve sufficient risk to require oversight. 167. Regardless, this project was not run in accordance with the expectations for enterprise project sponsors and managers. For example, the project manager did not discuss risks with the project sponsor. These titles are meaningless without a set of expectations attached to them. It is reasonable to expect project leaders to be responsible for quality and project risk management. Had the expectations been clear they may have taken a more hands-on approach. Other issues relating to personnel “...we have had a great influx of private sector people and I don’t think that they really understand what working in the public sector means from a risk point of view, from a machinery of government point of view ... they are totally different things.” – Manager Internal Audit 168. The terms of reference have asked us to consider the adequacy of the ‘end-to-end process leading to the approval of the political leanings question’. The process primarily failed because of a break down in the control environment. However, there were also a range of factors relating to the personnel on the project that may have contributed distraction or pressure to the environment, and thereby contributed in some way to the internal controls being inadequately applied. These factors are noted here for completeness. 169. An Intelligence & Insight Specialist was a key staff member from the Customer Insight and Evaluation Team working with procurement on producing the RFQ. That staff member was away for six weeks when the RFQ was planned to be released. This may have contributed to a hold up in releasing the RFQ and IR reviewing the quotes it received, with a flow-on effect of a delay in Colmar Brunton starting its work. 49 Commercial In Confidence 170. The Group Manager, Corporate Risk & Assurance told us IR had five risk managers in six years. Regular turnover of risk managers could affect the degree to which expectations around risk management are embedded within an organisation like IR. 171. The Manager, Commercial Corporate started working at IR the day before receiving the Recommendation to Appoint. They relied on the advice of the Commercial Manager, Commercial Corporate on the process that had been undertaken. The Manager, Commercial Corporate endorsed the Recommendation to Appoint on this basis, and it was forwarded to the Intelligence Leader, Intelligence & Insight for sign-off. 172. At least two key staff had little public sector experience: an Intelligence & Insight Specialist and the Manager, Commercial Corporate. Both have spent much of their careers in the private sector. Other staff we spoke to had spent considerable periods in the private sector, although with some public-sector experience also. The public and private sectors have different operating environments, particularly around the need for political neutrality as detailed in the Codes of Conduct that IR employees are subject to. 173. When key staff are new to a State sector organisation, particularly if they have a private sector background, a robust induction programme is needed to convey the expectations of public servants. As noted above, induction at IR does not include any specific training on risk management, although there is a module on LearnIR for managers and team leaders that, we have been told, is not mandatory and needs refreshing. 50 Commercial In Confidence RECOMMENDATIONS Improve staff understanding of political neutrality 174. We recommend that IR • Remind all staff of what it means to be politically neutral in line with State Services Commission guidance, including the need to avoid the perception that political neutrality has been compromised. Refresh the induction process 175. We recommend that IR: • Review the content relating to political neutrality and the Codes of Conduct used in its induction process • Set expectations relating to risk management in induction. Clarify key project roles 176. We recommend that IR: • Clarify what it expects of project sponsors and project managers in projects other than enterprise investment projects, particularly its expectations around risk management. Improve the control environment 177. We recommend that IR: • Raise the profile of its risk and assurance functions to ensure they have consistently high visibility across IR, and that other parts of IR are consistently receptive to benefitting from these functions. • Devise a means for monitoring and, where possible, measuring risk intelligence across IR so it can be tracked over time. • Expect project leaders to consider risk and strategy together when leading projects. • Hold IR’s executives to account for ensuring their areas of responsibility exhibit risk intelligence. • Defragment risk management by: i. ensuring risk is considered at project level in light of the Enterprise Risk Management Framework. ii. considering an amendment to Commercial & Procurement’s checklist to include confirmation that the business area seeking a procurement has assessed all relevant risks, including reputational risk. 51 Commercial In Confidence • Hold IR’s executives to account for implementing each component of the Internal Control Framework, with particular attention paid to monitoring and improvement so IR can see if the framework is working and ensure the framework remains up-to-date in a continuously changing environment. 52 Commercial In Confidence APPENDIX 1: INLAND REVENUE TERMS OF REFERENCE Independent review into Inland Revenue’s approval of a question about respondents’ political leanings in an online survey 18 February 2019 Background Inland Revenue is required by the Tax Administration Act 1994 to protect the integrity of the tax system, including the perceptions of that integrity. To assist with this, in December 2018, Inland Revenue commissioned Colmar Brunton to undertake research with the objectives of: • identifying the key factors that influence New Zealanders’ trust in Inland Revenue and the tax system • determining which of these factors can be influenced by Inland Revenue’s actions and which cannot, and • understanding how Inland Revenue’s actions build or erode that trust. Following standard research practice, Colmar Brunton held interviews and focus groups with New Zealanders to discuss their trust in Inland Revenue and the tax system. The topics that came up during these discussions would then be further tested in an online survey. During the interviews, New Zealanders raised several issues that appeared to affect their trust in Inland Revenue and the tax system. As one of these issues was a person’s political leanings, a question on this was included in the online survey. The question was approved by Inland Revenue and read: People often indicate their political affiliation along a spectrum of left and right. Using this divide, where on the spectrum would you place yourself? (from 0 to 10). Inland Revenue became concerned at the public perception that the research had been carried out for political purposes. As a result, Inland Revenue directed Colmar Brunton to delete the data on political leaning and not report on it. On reflection, Inland Revenue’s view is that the question on political leanings should not have been included in the survey. 53 Commercial In Confidence Scope of Review The review will: 1. Consider and form an opinion on: • Whether there is any evidence that including the question on political leanings was in any way politically motivated. • The adequacy of the end-to-end process leading to the approval of the political leanings question. This will include looking at the commission and design of the relevant research, and the procurement, decision-making and review processes for approving the question. • Whether the processes supporting the decision to include the political affiliation question in the survey were considered and balanced against the risks to the integrity of the tax system. This includes perceptions of political neutrality. 2. The review will also consider lessons learnt from this issue and make recommendations accordingly. Timeline An interim progress report will be made to the Deputy Commissioner, Policy & Strategy, by Friday 8 March 2019. The review report will be made to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, who will provide it to the State Services Commissioner to support his examination of the circumstances that led to Inland Revenue commissioning a poll of taxpayers, which included a question about their political affiliation along a spectrum of left and right. 54 Commercial In Confidence APPENDIX 2: ORGANISATION CHART FOR RELEVANT STAFF

Indirect income interests in FIFs
=================================

2012 amendments clarify how some exemptions apply to foreign investment funds that are held indirectly through other FIFs or controlled foreign companies.

_Sections EX 50(7B) and EX 58(5) of the Income Tax Act 2007_

Several amendments have been made to the rules enacted in the Taxation (International Investment and Remedial Matters) Act 2012, to clarify how some exemptions apply to FIFs that are held indirectly through other FIFs or CFCs.

### Background

In many cases, a person will own shares in a foreign company which itself owns shares in a second foreign company.

If the shares represent an interest in a CFC, the person is always required to "look through" that CFC to determine if the second foreign company is a CFC (in which case  
the investor would apply the CFC rules), or an attributing interest in a FIF (for which the investor would apply a FIF calculation method).

However if the first company is not a CFC, the requirement to "look through" to the second foreign company depends on whether the person uses the attributable FIF income method for that company and whether an exception to the "look through" rule applies.

If the fair dividend rate, cost, comparative value or deemed rate of return method is used for a FIF, any foreign shares held by that FIF are not subject to the FIF rules (as in most cases the FIF rules only apply to direct interests in foreign companies. (See section EX 29(2).)

If the attributable FIF income method is used for a foreign company, the default position is to "look through" this foreign company and apply the FIF rules to any shares that the company holds in other foreign companies. This is achieved by the formula in sections EX 50(6) and (7).

However, there are several important exceptions to the "look-through" rule in section EX 50(6). These are listed in section EX 50(7B).

### Key features

Several remedial amendments have been made to the "look-through" rule in section EX 50(7B) for calculating additional FIF income from indirect interests in FIFs.

Some amendments have been made to clarify how taxpayers should measure indirect income interests for the purpose of applying the Australian or active income exemptions to such interests.

Other amendments have been made to clarify how taxpayers should apply a modified version of the active business test to a FIF which has non-controlling shareholdings in other foreign companies.

### Detailed analysis

#### Measuring indirect income interests

Section EX 35(a) allows the exemption for certain FIF interests in Australian companies to be applied in cases when a person holds an indirect income interest of 10% or more in an Australian company. If the requirements of section EX 35 are met for the person and their indirect interest in the FIF, the person does not have any attributable FIF income or loss from that FIF.

Section EX 46(3)(a)(ii) allows the attributable FIF income method to be applied in cases when a person holds an indirect income interest of 10% or more in a foreign company.

Sections EX 50(7B)(a)(i), EX 50(7B)(c) and EX 58(5)(b) have been removed. These sections were intended to duplicate the requirements in sections EX 35(a) and EX 46(3)(a)(ii), and highlight that the Australian and active income exemptions could still apply when a person held an indirect income interest of 10% or more.

However, they could have been interpreted more broadly so as to deem the person to directly hold another foreign company's income interest. This meant that a person with a less than 10% indirect income interest could in certain circumstances, be deemed to hold an income interest of 10% or more (for example a person who owns 50% of a company which owns 10% of another company).

This was contrary to the policy intention which was that a person would work out their indirect income interest by multiplying their direct income interest in a foreign company by that foreign company's direct income interest in other foreign companies (this approach is provided by section EX 50(4)).

##### Examples

A person has a direct income interest of 10% in a FIF which holds a 100% direct income interest in a second foreign company. The person would have a 10% indirect income interest in the second foreign company.

A person has a direct income interest of 50% in a FIF which holds a 10% direct income interest in a second foreign company. The person would have a 5% indirect income interest in the second foreign company so the person would not meet the requirements in sections EX 35(a) or EX 46(3)(a)(ii).

A person with an income interest of less than 10% is not generally able to apply the attributable FIF income method.

There is one exception to this. A person may be able to apply the attributable FIF income method to less than a 10% interest in a CFC if the person and the CFC meet the conditions in section EX 46(3)(b).[5](#5)
 The main requirement is that a market value for shares in the CFC is not available except by independent valuation (for example, if the CFC is not listed on a stock exchange). In addition there are some restrictions on the types of investors in the CFC.

There are two other circumstances when a person does not strictly apply the attributable FIF income method to indirect income interests in FIFs, but is instead able to include relevant amounts from these indirect interests in FIFs when applying the active business test to a FIF through which they hold these indirect interests. If the test is still passed with these additional amounts included, the person does not attribute income from any FIFs that were included in the test.

#### Applying the active business test to a consolidated test group

The first case is when a FIF owns more than 50% of another foreign company (that is not a CFC). In this case, the parent FIF and its subsidiaries can be included in the same test group for the purposes of applying the active business test. The test is then applied on a consolidated basis to the test group. If the test group has less than 5% passive income, then no FIF income or loss is attributed to the New Zealand shareholder from any member of that test group.

#### Applying the active business test when a FIF has non-controlling shareholdings in other foreign companies

The second case is when a FIF owns non-controlling interests, such as shares, in other foreign companies. In these cases, the person can choose to apply a modified version of the active business test that includes some additional amounts in the "added passive" and "reported revenue" terms of the calculation. The additional amounts correspond to the amounts that are reported in the FIF's accounts as being derived from shares in the non-controlling interests.

This rule is set out in sections EX 50(7B) and EX 50(7C).

Section EX 50(7B)(b) has been modified to explicitly allow a person to choose to include none, some, or all the FIF's non-controlling interests in foreign companies when applying the modified active business test in section EX 50(7B). Note however, that if a person chooses to exclude an indirect interest from the modified test, they will usually be required to "look through" and apply a FIF calculation method to that indirect interest in a FIF in accordance with section EX 50(6).

New section EX (7C)(b) prevents a person from using the result of the test for a FIF and a group of foreign companies, if the person has used the result of a different test for that FIF and a different grouping of foreign companies. The purpose of this condition is to prevent a taxpayer from manipulating their test results by applying multiple tests to smaller groups consisting of the same parent FIF and only some of that FIF's shares in other companies. Such manipulation could ensure that each test resulted in less than 5% passive income when there would have been more than 5% passive income had the test been applied to a larger group that included all of the foreign shares in the same test.

Both of these changes are illustrated in the following example.

##### Example

A person uses the attributable FIF income method for a FIF that has non-controlling shareholdings in two other companies, company A and company B.

The FIF has $9.3 million of total revenue and no passive income. This means the person does not attribute income from the FIF as the FIF passes the active business test.

The FIF's accounts include profits of $0.3 million from company A and $0.4 million from company B.

The person can apply the modified test in section EX 50(7B) to determine if they need to attribute FIF income from company A or company B.

The person can only include the FIF and each company in one test for the purpose of section EX 50(7B)(b). This means they can apply the test to one of three possible groups. A group comprising the FIF and company A, a group comprising the FIF and company B or a group comprising the FIF and companies A and B.

If the person applies the test to a group comprising the FIF and company A, the result is 3.1% (= 0.3 ÷ 9.6). This is less than 5% so they do not attribute FIF income from company A. However they would still have FIF income from company B as the profit from company B was not included in the test.

If the person applies the test to a group comprising the FIF and company B, the result is 4.1% (= 0.4 ÷ 9.7). This is less than 5% so they do not attribute FIF income from company B. However they would still have FIF income from company A as the profit from company A was not included in the test.

If the person applies the test to the FIF and both companies A and B the result would be 7% (= 0.7 ÷ 1) so they would have FIF income from companies A and B.

Further explanation and examples on how to apply the attributable FIF income method can be found in the _Tax Information Bulletin_, Vol 24, No 6, July 2012.

### Application date

The amendments to sections EX 50(7B), EX 58(5) apply from income years beginning on or after 1 July 2011. This is consistent with the application dates of the international tax reforms in the Taxation (International Investment and Remedial Matters) Act 2012.

* * *

5 Even though the company is a CFC, a person with less than a 10% interest in the CFC (including interests of associated persons) will use the FIF rules rather than the CFC rules to attribute income from the CFC.

Indirect income interests of 10% or more in Australian companies
================================================================

2012 legislation covers indirect income interests of 10% or more in Australian companies and how the exemption is applied to companies held through a FIF or CFC.

_Section EX 35 of the Income Tax Act 2007_

A person who has an income interest of 10% or more in a company that is resident and subject to tax in Australia (and that meets certain other conditions specified in section EX 35) does not attribute any income or loss from that Australian company.

An amendment has been made to clarify how this exemption should be applied to Australian companies that are held indirectly through another foreign investment fund (FIF) or a controlled foreign company (CFC).

### Key features

An amendment has been made to section EX 35(a) so that the reference to "direct income interest" (which is defined under section EX 30) has been replaced with a reference to "income interest calculated under section EX 50(4)".

Under section EX 50(4) a person works out their income interest in a FIF as though that FIF were a CFC.

Under the CFC rules (and the attributable FIF income method) a person's income interest is calculated by adding their direct income interests and any indirect income interests. Direct income interests are measured under section EX 9. They include interests such as shares that the person holds themselves.

Indirect income interests are calculated under section EX 10 by multiplying a person's direct income interest in a CFC by that CFC's direct income interest in a second CFC. For example, if a person owns 50% of CFC 1 and CFC 1 owns 40% of CFC 2, the person's indirect income interest in CFC 2 would be 20% (50% of 40%).

Under section EX 50(4), the same approach also applies to foreign companies that are not CFCs. That is, if a person has a direct income interest in one foreign company and that foreign company has a direct income interest in another company, the person's indirect interest in the second foreign company is calculated by applying the rules in sections EX 8 to EX 11, EX 13, EX 16 and EX 17 and EX 26 as though both companies were CFCs.

This ensures that a person can still meet the requirement in section EX 35(a) of having at least a 10% income interest in an Australian company when their interest is an indirect interest held through another foreign company.

##### Examples

A person has a 50% direct income interest in a foreign company which has a 50% direct income interest in an Australian company. The person's indirect income interest in the Australian company is 25%. The person will satisfy the requirement in section EX 35(a).

A person has a 50% direct income interest in a foreign company which has a 10% direct income interest in an Australian company. The person's indirect income interest in the Australian company is 5%. The person will not satisfy the requirement in section EX 35(a), unless they have some other income interests (direct or indirect) in the Australian company which cause their total income interest to add up to 10% or more.

Note that if a person's interest in an Australian company satisfies the exemption in section EX 35, and that foreign company is not a CFC, the person is not required to apply the FIF rules to any indirect interests in FIFs held by that Australian company. In contrast, if a person has a CFC interest in an Australian company they would be required to look-through and apply FIF rules to any indirect interests in other foreign companies due to section EX 22(3).

##### Example

A person has a 10% direct income interest in an Australian company which has a 50% direct income interest in another foreign company.

If the Australian company is a CFC or a FIF for which the person uses the attributable FIF income method, the person would have a 5% indirect income interest in the other foreign company.

If the Australian company is not a CFC, and the Australian company qualifies for an exemption from the FIF rules (such as the section EX 35 exemption), or the person uses the fair dividend rate, cost, comparative value or deemed rate of return method for the Australian company, the person would not usually be regarded as holding an indirect income interest in the second foreign company.

Further explanation and examples on how to apply the section EX 35 exemption can be found in the _Tax Information Bulletin_, Vol 24, No 6, July 2012.

### Application date

The amendment to section EX 35 applies from income years beginning on or after 1 July 2011. This is consistent with the application dates of the international tax reforms in the Taxation (International Investment and Remedial Matters) Act 2012.

Te tāke moni whiwhi mā ngā kiritaki takitahi a ngā takawaenga Income tax for individual clients of tax agents
=============================================================================================================

We issue 'more information request’ letters from late May until the end of July.

If your client mail is being redirected for income tax this letter will be sent to you. Otherwise, it will go to your client.

Review the information and complete the assessment
--------------------------------------------------

You or your client must review this letter, add any additional income and expenses, and complete the assessment.

You need to complete it in the timeframe, which is 1 of the following:

*   45 days after we issued the letter
*   31 March of the following year if the client has an EOT.

The letter and your 'Unfiled returns report' show the date.

If we do not hear from you in the timeframe, we’ll assume we have the right information and complete the income tax assessment.

After we complete the assessment, you’ll get an income tax assessment notice.

Income tax – reportable income
------------------------------

All linked clients of a tax agent who get ‘reportable income’ will get a letter. Individual income tax return - IR3 filers and clients with no reportable income will not get letters.

Reportable income includes:

*   salary and wages (or other PAYE income)
*   schedular payments
*   Leave Support Scheme (LSS)
*   investment income, such as interest, dividends, or Māori authority distributions
*   employee share scheme benefits
*   income from portfolio investment entities (PIEs)
*   losses carried forward from a previous year.

Any reportable income a third party sends us will show in the letter. 

IR3 filer with only reportable income
-------------------------------------

If a client who used to file an IR3 has only reportable income now, you can still file the IR3 electronically. If you’re filing in myIR, record the income type as $0.00.

Remember to add a cease date in myIR to the other income sources. Go to the 'More' link in your client’s Income tax account, choose 'My income sources' under the 'My income' heading and add a cease date to the other income sources. Once you’ve done this, we will not select the client for an IR3 next year.

If your client qualifies for write-offs that are for qualifying individuals only (not IR3 filers), contact us to have the year’s assessment changed.

If you need to change assessments for clients with only reportable income, you can update their income tax assessment details in myIR. If you update the details before the terminal tax due date, your client will get a new assessment and we will not charge penalties or interest.

If your client received a refund based on the original assessment that is no longer valid, they have until the terminal tax due date to repay it. If they pay by the due date, we will not charge any penalties or interest.

Linking and delinking
---------------------

After we issue a letter, we cannot change the complete-by date. The letter and your 'Unfiled returns report' will confirm the date we need the information by. If you link after we issue the letter, you have 45 days from the issue date to complete it

Delink after we issue the letter, your client has until 31 March of the following year to complete it. If you delink, remind your client to complete their assessment or we will hold it until 31 March next year.

Working for Families assessments
--------------------------------

The Working for Families (WfF) entitlement amount depends on family income. We cannot complete the end of year square-up until after your client’s income tax assessment is done. If they have a partner, their assessment must be completed too. If you need to - send any Adjust your income – IR215 forms before finalisation.

The WfF section of your client list report shows clients who are registered as any of the following:

*   the principal child carer
*   a partner
*   an ex-partner.

To promptly finalise income tax or WfF or both, do 1 of the following:

*   Complete the income tax assessment by confirming the pre-populated information or by providing more information if appropriate.
*   Encourage your client to complete their income tax assessment themselves in myIR.
*   Delink the client before we issue the more information so that we deal with the client directly.

If your clients contact us, we will:

*   direct any questions about the income tax process to you as their tax agent
*   delink them if they ask us to and tell them to let you know.

You must not relink the client without a new Authority to act.

Changing and completing a more information request
--------------------------------------------------

You can update details in myIR and in gateway services.

If you need to file an IR3 for a customer with a pending request, you can use gateway services 

We will replace the pending assessment with the IR3. You should file an IR3 only when you have non-reportable income to add, for example rent or self-employed income.

Where a client has a completed automatically issued income tax assessment, you should 'amend' the assessment, regardless of the income type you’re changing - for example interest or rent. 

If you do not use 'amend', you cannot submit the change. Instead, you’ll get an error message advising of a duplicate assessment. If you get this error message, amend the assessment in myIR.

Your software needs to have 'CALC' functionality to change and confirm reportable income. If you do not have 'CALC', use myIR to complete the assessment. If you do not know if your software has 'amend' or ‘CALC’ ask your software provider.

To make sure that your client receives an IR3 next year, add their other income sources in myIR.

Client contact and bank account details
---------------------------------------

Please ensure you keep client contact details up to date.

### Refunds

We process refunds faster when the bank account information is current. You can manage bank account details in myIR or when you file your client’s IR3.

To add a client bank account, use the 'Update refund bank account' service in myIR. Go to 'More' in the client's income tax account.

If you have written authority to receive client refunds and operate a disbursement account, you can use the refund redirect option. To set up a disbursement account for client refunds, contact your account manager. You must not add your own agency’s bank account to the client's account.

At the end of the tax year, you may need to file an Individual income tax return – IR3, which:

*   tells us about your income for the year and the expenses you’re claiming
*   calculates if you’re due a refund or have tax to pay.

The tax year is from 1 April to 31 March.

IR3 returns are different from income tax assessments where we work out your tax for you, even if we ask you for more information.

Who needs to complete an income tax return
------------------------------------------

You need to complete an individual income tax return at the end of the tax year if you received more than $200 (before tax) in income that we have not been told about, even if this was only for part of the tax year.

Here’s the full list of reasons we may ask you to file an individual income tax return – IR3.

[I’ve been asked to complete an individual income tax return – IR3](/situations/i-have-been-asked-to-complete-an-individual-tax-return-ir3)

### Different return for non-residents

If you are not a New Zealand tax resident, you'll need to file an IR3NR instead.

Completing your return
----------------------

We'll let you know when it's time to complete your return for this year. We’ll either send you an email notification that your return is ready to complete in myIR or a paper return in the post.

Your return will usually be processed faster if you complete it in myIR.

When your return is due
-----------------------

You need to send us your completed return by 7 July unless you have a tax agent or an extension of time.

### Getting more time to file your return

You can apply for an extension of time (EOT) to file your income tax return later than the normal due date. If granted, an extension of time allows you to spread return filing throughout the year. Individuals, trusts or companies can all apply for an extension of time.

After you file
--------------

We’ll send you a notice of assessment to confirm we've got your return. It will show any refund you may be due or tax you need to pay.

If you realised you've made mistakes in your return, please let us know as soon as possible.

Te tāke aowhānui mō te tāngata takitahi International tax for individuals
=========================================================================

What

Work out your tax residency status so you pay the right taxes in New Zealand.

Who

Anyone who earns income from New Zealand or may be a New Zealand tax resident.

Tax residency is different from your immigration status
-------------------------------------------------------

Your immigration status determines whether you can stay in New Zealand and what you can do here.

Your tax residency status determines what taxes you'll pay in New Zealand. You'll either be a:

*   non-resident taxpayer
*   New Zealand tax resident.

Working out your tax residency status
-------------------------------------

You'll need to work out your tax residency status in New Zealand to understand how New Zealand's tax laws apply to you.

[Tax residency status for individuals](/international-tax/individuals/tax-residency-status-for-individuals)

### Non-resident taxpayers

As a non-resident taxpayer, if you're earning income from a [](/api/glossary/item?id={D699D7EA-502F-4FEC-BA1E-B1423F20FA7C})
New Zealand source, you'll generally pay tax to New Zealand.

Examples of income from a New Zealand source are:

*   interest from a New Zealand bank account
*   dividends from a New Zealand company
*   selling a residential property in New Zealand for a profit within a certain period.

If your jurisdiction (country or territory) has a double tax agreement with New Zealand, it may affect how your income is taxed.

There are exemptions for certain types of income in New Zealand's tax legislation.

[Tax for non-resident taxpayers](/international-tax/individuals/tax-for-non-resident-taxpayers)

### New Zealand tax residents 

As a New Zealand tax resident, you'll generally pay tax on your worldwide income to New Zealand.

Examples of worldwide income are:

*   rental income from a property overseas
*   interest from a New Zealand bank account
*   dividends or deemed foreign investment income from a portfolio of overseas shares.

In short, you'll generally pay tax to New Zealand on what you earn in New Zealand and overseas.

Income is still taxable even if you do not bring it into New Zealand and even if the other [jurisdiction](/api/glossary/item?id={80BBC5C0-E325-4556-A6C5-816BFF133775})
 has deducted tax. If you pay tax on the same income in two countries, you'll usually be eligible for a foreign tax credit.

If your jurisdiction has a double tax agreement with New Zealand, it may affect how your income is taxed.

If you're a new tax resident or returning to New Zealand after 10 years, you may be eligible for a 4-year temporary tax exemption on most types of foreign income.

[Tax for New Zealand tax residents](/international-tax/individuals/tax-for-new-zealand-tax-residents)

### Leaving New Zealand

If you're a New Zealand tax resident and leave the country, you'll need to work out whether you've become a non-resident taxpayer. If so, your income tax obligations will change.

If you have a student loan or are a member of KiwiSaver, for example, you'll also need to consider how leaving New Zealand will affect you. The rules and timeframes are different for each social programme, so you'll need to check what applies to your situation.

[Leaving New Zealand](/international-tax/individuals/leaving)

International measures against tax evasion
------------------------------------------

New Zealand has many agreements with other countries and territories to exchange financial account information to combat tax evasion.

*   You may need to tell your financial institution where you're a tax resident. 
*   Penalties will usually apply when you do not declare income.

[Exchange of information](/international-tax/exchange-of-information)

Paying tax in New Zealand
-------------------------

Once you know your tax residency status, you'll be able to sort out what taxes you'll pay in New Zealand.

The guidelines have effect from the 2002/03 income tax year, and will be updated periodically. The Insurance Sector’s approach is to follow FRS 35 where it is consistent with the income tax legislation. Legislation All section references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 (“the Act”) unless otherwise stated. Allowable deductions Section BD 2(1) states: An amount is an allowable deduction of a taxpayer (a) if it is an allowance for depreciation that the taxpayer is entitled to under Part E (Timing of Income and Deductions), or (b) to the extent that it is an expenditure or loss (i) incurred by the taxpayer in deriving the taxpayer’s gross income, or (ii) necessarily incurred by the taxpayer in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving the taxpayer’s gross income, or (iii) allowed as a deduction to the taxpayer under Part C (Income Further Defined), D (Deductions Further Defined), E (Timing of Income and Deductions), F (Apportionment and Recharacterised Transactions), G (Avoidance and Non-Market Transactions), H (Treatment of Net Income of Certain Entities), I (Treatment of Net Losses), L (Credits) or M (Tax Payments). Allocation of gross income Section BD 3 states: BD 3(1) A taxpayer or the Commissioner must allocate each amount of gross income to an income year in accordance with this section. BD 3(2) If an amount of gross income is subject to a timing regime, the amount must be allocated to an income year in accordance with that regime. BD 3(3) An amount of gross income that is not subject to a timing regime must be allocated to the income year in which the amount is derived. BD 3(4) A particular amount of gross income may be allocated only once. Accrual expenditure Section EF 1 (1) states: Where any person has incurred any accrual expenditure – (a) That expenditure is allowed as a deduction when it is incurred in accordance with this Act; and (b) The unexpired portion of that expenditure at the end of an income year shall be included in the gross income of the person for that income year and shall be allowed as a deduction in the following year. Inland Revenue - Industry guidelines 2Inland Revenue - Industry guidelines 3 Section EF 1(5) states: The amount of the unexpired portion (if any) of any amount of accrual expenditure of any person to be taken into account in any income year shall be – (a) Where the expenditure relates to the purchase of goods, the amount of expenditure incurred on goods not used in deriving gross income: (b) Where the expenditure relates to payment for services, the amount of expenditure incurred on services not performed: (c) Subject to subsection (8), where the expenditure is incurred by way of monetary remuneration for services that have been performed, the amount of that expenditure that has not been paid in the income year or within such further period as is specified in subsection (6): (d) Where the expenditure relates to a payment for, or in relation to, a chose in action, the amount that relates to the unexpired part of the period in relation to which the chose is enforceable. Determination E 10 Determination E 10 states: Any person who incurs expenditure that is deductible in the income year commencing on the 1st day of April 1994, or that is deductible in any subsequent income year until this determination is cancelled by the Commissioner, shall not be required to comply with section \[EF 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994\] in respect of that expenditure and that income year where – (a) The expenditure is of a kind described in column (1) of the schedule hereto; and (b) The sum of all of the amounts of unexpired portion of the kind of expenditure does not exceed the amount, if any, specified in relation to that expenditure in column (2) of the schedule hereto; and (c) The length of time between balance date and the subsequent expiry date of the expenditure does not exceed the number of months, if any, specified in relation to that expenditure in column (3) of the schedule hereto; and (d) In relation to expenditure on goods of any of the kinds specified in categories (d) and (k) of the schedule hereto, the goods are in the possession of the person at balance date: Provided that this determination shall not apply to any expenditure to the extent that deduction of the expenditure has been deferred to a subsequent income year for financial reporting purposes: Provided also that, for the purposes of this determination, any expenditure taken into account in calculating the assessable income of a partnership for the purposes of \[section 42 of the Tax Administration Act 1994\], or that should properly be so taken into account, shall be treated as expenditure incurred by the partnership and by no other person. Practice Unearned Premium Reserve The Unearned Premium Reserve (UPR) is the portion of gross premium that relates to the cover of risks beyond the insurer’s balance date, calculated on a daily basis. Alternative calculation methods may be acceptable where the daily basis is not appropriate. Reinsurance premiums and acquisition costs are not required to be netted off against the pre- mium income in the UPR. Inland Revenue - Industry guidelines 2Inland Revenue - Industry guidelines 3 Commentary The gross written premium for an income year would normally not equate with premium income properly attributable to that year because the insurance cover will extend beyond balance date. These amounts should be recognised as gross income over the remaining life of the insurance policies in subsequent income years or periods. Insurers should recognise premium income over the period of a policy based on the pattern of risk to which the insurer is exposed or the period of the policy (or period of indemnity for reinsurance) in accordance with FRS 35. Time apportionment using the “daily” method (or similar actuarial spreading method) is considered appropriate unless there is a marked unevenness in the incidence of risk over the period that leads to a material difference in the recognition of gross income. An alternative approach to recognising gross premium income on a daily basis (or similar actuarial spreading method) may be acceptable taking into account the following factors: • It can be shown that the daily method is not practical or possible, and • The alternative method applied does not produce a result materially different to the daily method, and • The alternative method applied is used for financial reporting purposes. Reinsurance Premiums Reinsurance premiums paid (retrocessions for reinsurers) should be recognised separately as expenditure when applying the deductibility provisions in the Act and are not required to be netted off against premium income or in calculating the UPR. Any unexpired portion of deductible expenditure on reinsurance at the end of an income year is to be included in gross income as accrual expenditure under section EF 1, subject to any exemptions applicable under Determination E 10. Commentary Where reinsurance premiums incurred by an insurer have an unexpired portion of accrual expenditure at the end of an income year, an adjustment is required under section EF 1, subject to any determination of exemption under section EF 1(3) (currently Determination E 10). The specific exemption to the application of section EF 1 in Determination E 10 that may be relevant to reinsurance is in paragraph (e) of the Schedule to the Determination: Insurance premiums under an insurance contract where the unexpired portion in respect of the contract does not exceed $12,000 and the expiry date is within 12 months from balance date. Acquisition Costs Acquisition costs should be recognised separately as expenditure when applying the deductibility provisions in the Act and are not required to be netted off against premium income or in calculating the UPR. Acquisition costs are deductible in the income year in which they are incurred. Any unexpired portion of deductible expenditure at the end of an income year is to be included in gross income as accrual expenditure under section EF 1, subject to Determination E 10. This will mainly relate to services not performed at year end. Inland Revenue - Industry guidelines 4Inland Revenue - Industry guidelines 5 Commentary Acquisition costs incurred by a general insurer in obtaining and recording insurance policies are allowable deductions for income tax purposes. The initial costs incurred in acquiring and issuing policies may include: • Commission or brokerage paid to agents for obtaining the business for the insurer, • Selling and underwriting costs such as risk assessment and advertising, • The administration costs of processing insurance proposals, renewals and the cost of collecting premiums, • Government or local authority charges, levies and contributions which relate directly to policies. Acquisition costs are incurred to derive premium income which is gross income in accordance with the Act and are deductible under section BD 2(1) in the year incurred. There is sufficient nexus between the expenditure associated with the writing of the policies and the gaining of assessable income to satisfy s BD 2(1). The test of whether an item has been “incurred” is the time that the taxpayer becomes definitively committed to the expenditure. Acquisition costs generally relate to services that have been performed before the end of the income year. The deductibility of acquisition costs is not contingent upon events which transpire in a future income year. Acquisition costs are not generally incurred over a period of time but rather are incurred in the year of policy commencement when the business is acquired. Acquisition costs should be deducted in year one when the expenditure is incurred. It is not generally necessary to spread the acquisition costs over the life of the policy. However where acquisition costs are paid in advance, there may be an unexpired portion where the services have not yet been performed. The value of any such unexpired portion will need to be included in gross income under section EF 1, subject to any exemptions applicable under Determination E 10. Outstanding Claims Reserve An insurer may deduct a reasonable estimate of its liability for outstanding claims incurred and not paid at the end of an income year. This may include those claims incurred but not reported (IBNR) where the insured event occurred before the end of that income year. Amounts payable under policies may be satisfied by way of cost reimbursement, cash settlement, goods reinstatement, repairs or alternative make good procedures. Such amounts (policy benefit amounts) and direct claim settlement costs are incurred in the income year in which the insured event occurs. Indirect claim settlement costs constitute ongoing business expenses that are incurred whether or not any particular claim is received by an insurer. Indirect claim settlement costs should not be included in the estimation of the insurer’s outstanding claims reserve or IBNR, but be deducted independently in the income year they are incurred by reference to the contractual arrangements under which they are incurred. Any unexpired portion of direct claim settlement costs at the end of an income year is to be included in gross income as accrual expenditure under section EF 1, subject to any determination of exemption under section EF 1(3) (currently Determination E 10). Claim settlement costs incurred by an insurer for the benefit of the insured or for the benefit of the reinsurer are not subject to Section EF 1. Commentary The outstanding claims reserve calculated in accordance with FRS 35 is deductible under section BD (2)(1) except to the extent indirect claim settlement costs are included. Adjustments may also be required to add back certain amounts of unexpired expenditure under section EF 1. Inland Revenue - Industry guidelines 4Inland Revenue - Industry guidelines 5 Claims costs included in the OCR under FRS 35 may include: • The policy benefit amount required to be paid to or on behalf of the insured including all expenditure of the insured required to be indemnified under the policy, and • Direct claim settlement costs that can be directly associated with individual claims such as legal fees, assessor’s costs and other professional charges, and • Indirect claim settlement costs that are only indirectly associated with individual claims, such as inhouse claims department costs. The policy benefit amount and the direct claim settlement costs are incurred for income tax purposes in the income year in which the insured event occurs. Indirect claim settlement costs that are incurred during the year are deductible under section BD (2)(1) subject to any adjustment required under section EF 1. Indirect claim settlement costs that are not incurred at the end of the income year should not be included in the OCR as these costs cannot be attributed to a particular claim. The insurer incurs these costs regardless of whether a particular claim is actually received. Indirect claim settlement costs involve such general expenses as claims handling, staff salaries, rent and other costs of running and administering an insurer’s claims department. These costs are often referred to as “claims administration costs”. Section EF 1 requires that expenditure incurred and unexpired at the end of an income year is to be included in gross income as accrual expenditure, subject to Determination E 10. Determination E 10 currently provides a general exemption to section EF 1 for services, other than those dealt with specifically in Determination E 10, that do not exceed $12,000 and expire within six months from balance date 1 . In ascertaining whether the threshold in Determination E 10 is exceeded it is necessary to aggregate all expenditure of the kind listed in the exemption. An issue arises as to how the accrual expenditure provisions in section EF 1 apply to amounts accrued by insurers and reinsurers in the OCR. There are three possible interpretations that could be argued. • That section EF 1 applies to all expenditure accrued within the OCR. • That section EF 1 does not apply to expenditure accrued within the OCR. • That section EF 1 applies to expenditure accrued within the OCR, but only to the extent that the expenditure does not form part of the policy benefit amount in respect of a claim. Following the Privy Council decision in Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Mitsubishi Motors New Zealand Limited (1995) 17 NZTC12,351 Inland Revenue issued an interpretation statement 2 that considers the meaning of “incurred”. The statement also considers section EF 1 and its application to warranty expenditure, which provides some guidance on the application of section EF 1 to OCR expenditure. Consistent with the interpretation statement, Inland Revenue considers that section EF 1 does apply to expenditure accrued with the OCR, but only to the extent that the costs do not form part of the policy benefit amount. Section EF 1 does not require the policy benefit amount of an insurance policy to be adjusted. This is considered analogous to expenditure in discharging the obligation under a warranty. Accordingly, section EF 1 does not apply to expenditure on goods, services or choses in action in discharging the policy obligation to the insured whether acquired by the insured and reimbursed or acquired directly by the insurer for the benefit of the insured. 1 Schedule to Determination E 10, paragraph (i). 2 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 10, No.6, Appendix (June 1998). Inland Revenue - Industry guidelines 6Inland Revenue - Industry guidelines 7 However, expenditure on services relating to direct claim settlement costs for the benefit of the insurer is required to be adjusted under section EF 1 where the services have not been performed at balance date (and will not be recovered through reinsurance). Such expenditure is by way of payment for services to the insurer, rather than discharging the obligation under a policy. The following examples illustrate the application of section EF 1. • Where an insurer arranges for repair services on behalf of the insured to place a vehicle in the condition it was in prior to the insured event section EF 1(5) would not apply. This is the payment of a policy benefit. • Where an insurer incurs costs under a policy to defend a claim against the insured person by a third party as in a public indemnity claim, section EF 1 (5) would not apply. This is the payment of a policy benefit. • Where an insurer incurs legal costs to dispute the insured’s policy claim or other costs in investigating or settling a claim, and such costs will not be recovered through reinsurance, it is considered the costs are for services for the benefit of the insurer and section EF 1(5) does apply. These costs are direct claim settlement costs and not the payment of a policy benefit. Section EF 1(5)(b) states that the unexpired portion is the “amount of expenditure incurred on services not performed”. To the extent that the services have not been executed, carried out or otherwise rendered in an income year in which the claim occurred, and the services will be for the benefit of the insurer, the unexpired portion is required to be added back as income under section EF 1(1). In keeping with the Mitsubishi Motors New Zealand Limited 3 case a reasonable estimate of the OCR attributable to the unexpired portion can be made in determining the amount to be added back where it is not otherwise possible on a claim by claim basis. Section DK 5 Outstanding Claims Reserves Section DK 5 sets out the valuation method to be adopted for outstanding claims in relation to insurance to which the provisions of the Accident Insurance Act 1998 apply. The following passages are taken from the Tax Information Bulletin Volume 11, No 1 (January 1999). “Section DK 5 has been inserted into the Income Tax Act 1994 and applies to the outstanding claims reserve of insurers for insurance business written under the Accident Insurance Act 1998. This section provides for a present value approach to valuing the reserve. If the reserves for financial reporting purposes meet certain requirements, the same basis can be used for tax purposes. The value of the reserve at the end of the income year is to be the amount calculated by an actuary and adopted by the insurer for financial reporting purposes. If the reserve has not been determined on this basis, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue can seek the advice of the Government Actuary or any other actuary to determine the amount of the reserve. The amount of the reserve must have regard to generally accepted accounting practice, generally accepted actuarial practice and the present value of expected future payments. 3 Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Mitsubishi Motors New Zealand Limited (1995) 17 NZTC 12,351 Inland Revenue - Industry guidelines 6Inland Revenue - Industry guidelines 7 The result is that in calculating the outstanding claims reserve, future costs of administering and settling claims incurred and other factors, such as prudential margins, can be taken into account, where this is consistent with accounting and actuarial practice. A present-value approach to valuing the reserve is considered to result in a more accurate measure of an insurer’s income in relation to accident insurance. The relevant professional bodies are currently developing accounting and actuarial standards.” Section DK 5 operates as a specific provision that governs the calculation of accident insurance reserves. Accordingly, such reserves are not subject to the accrual expenditure provisions in section EF 1(5). Salvages and other recoveries Current industry practice is to credit net recoveries against claims expenses. At year end the OCR is reduced by amount of expected net recoveries attributable to claims included in the OCR. For tax purposes Inland Revenue considers third party receivables constitute debts subject to the bad debt write off provisions. Salvages are considered to constitute trading stock. However, Inland Revenue accepts that the derivation of any gross income, bad debts written off and the value of any trading stock for salvages are effected through the claim process with adjustments to the OCR. Section EF 1 does not apply to the costs associated with salvages and recoveries as these costs benefit the insured, not the insurer.

[Research & development](/new-legislation/act-articles/research-development "Research & development")

Ineligible expenditure (Schedule 21, Part B)
============================================

List of expenditure ineligible for research and development tax credits.

The following expenditure is ineligible:

*   interest;
*   loss on sale or write-off of depreciable assets (except in one situation);
*   profits on R&D services and property provided by an associate;
*   amounts in excess of market value for leasing property of an associate;
*   depreciation attributable to the time an asset is not used in R&D
*   certain depreciation deductions on assets acquired from an associate;
*   the cost of feedstock other than the net cost referred to in Part A, clause 8;
*   the cost of acquiring core technology (technology used as a basis for further R&D);
*   in-house software development costs exceeding $3 million (unless the cap is increased by Ministerial waiver);
*   expenditure funded from a government grant or any required co-funding;
*   donations;
*   professional fees in determining whether the person, activities or expenditure are eligible;
*   the cost of acquiring intangible assets; and
*   expenditure of an industry research co-operative funded by an ineligible person.

Some of this expenditure (for example, professional fees and donations) would not be eligible in any event, as it would not fall within the list of eligible expenditure in Part A. It has been inserted to make the provisions as clear as possible, and to avoid doubt.

**Interest (clause 1)**

Expenditure incurred under a financial arrangement - essentially, interest - in financing R&D activities is not eligible.

**Depreciation loss on disposal or write-off of assets (clause 2)**

To reduce compliance costs, there is no clawback of credits when depreciable property used in R&D is sold for more than its adjusted tax value. There is generally a corresponding restriction in relation to a loss on disposal of depreciable assets and the write-off when depreciable items are no longer used (sections EE 11(3) to (5) and EE 39). No credit is available in relation to this loss or write-off.

##### Example

ACo purchases an asset for $1 million which is used wholly in R&D for three years. Credits are claimed in relation to that depreciation. The adjusted tax value at the time of sale is $700,000. The asset is sold for $650,000. No credit is available for that $50,000 loss.

**End-result assets to be used for commercial purposes**

As noted earlier, the cost of assets that are the object of the R&D (such as prototypes) do not attract the credit when they are incurred unless their sole intended use is in R&D. If they are to be used in commercial activity, either simultaneously or subsequently to their R&D use, and if the construction of the asset is an R&D activity, the credit may be claimed in relation to depreciation on the asset for the time it is used in R&D.

If the asset is a failure and is written off, the credit can be claimed for the balance of the costs provided the conditions in Part B, clause 2, paragraphs (a) to (c) and Part A, clause 2 are met. In particular, the asset must be wholly or mainly used in the R&D activities and not used after they end, and development costs must not be eligible for the credit in the year they are incurred.

##### Example

ACo is an energy distribution company that is developing an innovative household meter. It instals the meters in 100 households before installing them more widely and plans a monitoring and testing programme over two months. Construction and installation of the test meters is an eligible support activity as the meters are mainly constructed and installed for the SIE R&D activities, and are required for and integral to them. However, if they are satisfactory, they will be left in place and used in ACo's normal business operations. The expenditure in constructing and installing the meters is treated by ACo as capital expenditure for tax and accounting. The materials and labour in constructing the meters are therefore not eligible for the credit as they are incurred. However, depreciation on the meters attracts the credit during the testing period.

One month after the trial begins, ACo finds that the meters are unsuitable. It removes and scraps them. The balance of the construction and installation cost of the meters are eligible for the credit at that stage.

**R&D services and property purchased from an associate (clause 3)**

When R&D is outsourced to an associate of the claimant, or property used in R&D is acquired from an associate, the credit cannot be claimed for any profit margin of the associate in supplying the services or property. The credit is payable on the lesser of the amount paid to the associate (eligible under Part A, clause 9) and the eligible expenditure of the associate incurred in a third-party transaction.

##### Example

ACo contracts its sister company BCo to perform R&D services. BCo obtains all the services and property used to perform the R&D from third parties unassociated with the company (for example, employees and contractors). Unassociated T Co provides core technology to BCo to enable BCo to perform the services. BCo spends $30,000 on the core technology and incurs $50,000 eligible expenditure on performing the R&D services (salary of employees and depreciation on equipment). BCo charges ACo $100,000 for the services. ACo may claim the credit only on $50,000.

**Property leased from an associate (clause 4)**

When property is leased directly or indirectly from an associate at more than market value, the excess over market value is not eligible for the credit.

**Depreciation in excess of time asset used in R&D (clause 5)**

This is the apportionment rule for depreciation on assets used in performing R&D. (See the explanation of Part A, clause 2.)

**Depreciation deduction on property purchased from associate (clause 6)**

Because there is no clawback of credits when depreciable property used in R&D is sold for more than its tax book value, a rule is required to prevent associated entities claiming credits twice for depreciation. Clause 6 therefore provides that when depreciable property is sold to an associate for a price in excess of the vendor's tax book value, the excess over the vendor's tax book value does not attract the credit in the hands of the purchaser. This rule is required even if the sale price is less than the vendor's cost (that is, it is required even though there are restrictions on the associated purchaser's ability to deduct depreciation under section EE 40).

##### Example 1

ACo sells computer equipment used in its R&D to associated BCo for its market value of $1,300. The equipment cost $2,000 and has a tax book value of $1,000. The $300 is not eligible for the credit in the hands of BCo.

**Feedstock expenditure in excess of net expenditure (clause 7)**

This excludes all feedstock expenditure in excess of the sale proceeds or market value of the end product.

While not in current legislation, consideration is being given to restriction of the credit when other property developed in the R&D process is sold.

**Core technology (clause 8)**

Core technology is technology which is used as a basis for further R&D. It may be intellectual property or a tangible asset such as a prototype. Core technology that is acquired or leased from another person is ineligible for the credit. The definition is in substance the same as it is in Australia.

**Cap on certain in-house software development (clause 9)**

This is discussed under sections LH 9 to LH 13 and LH 17 at the end of this report.

**Grants and required co-funding (clauses 10, 11, 12)**

Expenditure funded by a grant from a public authority or local authority or from funds required as a condition of the grant (co-funding) by the public or local authority is ineligible for the tax credit. This is because the R&D project is already subsidised by government.

The rule applies when the co-funding is required from the recipient of the grant or from another party.

"Public authority" and "local authority" are defined in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

##### Example 1

ACo receives an R&D grant of $50,000 from the Foundation for Research Science and Technology. As a condition of the grant, ACo is required to contribute $100,000 of its own funds towards the project. The $150,000 is used to pay for R&D salaries and to purchase items consumed in the R&D. None of it is eligible expenditure.

As part of the R&D activity ACo spends a further $20,000 on items consumed in the R&D activity. This amount is eligible for the credit because neither the grant exclusion nor the required co-funding exclusion applies to it.

As a condition of the grant to ACo, BCo is required to fund $20,000 of salary expenditure on another R&D activity. A tax credit is not available to BCo for its expenditure of $20,000.

**Example**

CCo receives a grant of $40,000 from a local authority for R&D activities. The total expenditure on the activity by CCo will be $120,000, consisting of $90,000 for the purchase of core technology and $30,000 of salary expenditure. The local authority has not stipulated that CCo should apply the funds to the purchase of core technology or to paying salaries. CCo can therefore apply the grant to the purchase of core technology and claim a tax credit in relation to the salary expenditure.

#### Donations (clause 13)

Making donations towards the R&D of others is not eligible. In Australia, making of donations is excluded as an activity.

**Professional fees in determining eligibility (clause 14)**

Fees paid to accountants, lawyers, scientists and others in determining whether claimants, activities and expenditure are eligible and calculating the amount of the claim are not eligible for the credit. This includes payments paid to Inland Revenue for a determination under section 91AAP of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

**Cost of acquiring intangible assets (clause 15)**

The credit is not available for the cost of purchasing, leasing or obtaining the right to use intangible assets. Expenditure on intangibles can be by way of royalties or a lump sum capital cost.

The extent to which they can be included in eligible expenditure requires careful consideration as such assets tend to be the focus of tax avoidance schemes. This policy work will be done once the R&D credit is in effect.

##### Example

ACo acquires a licence to use software in its R&D process. Depreciation on, or licence fees for, the software are not eligible.

The paragraph does not exclude the cost of creating intangible assets from R&D.

**Certain expenditure of an industry research co-operative (clause 16)**

Clause 16 provides that expenditure of an industry research co-operative that is sourced from funds contributed by a person who does not have a business in New Zealand or who is ineligible under section LH 1(2) is not eligible expenditure of the co-operative. This is to prevent co-operatives being used to circumvent the requirements for eligibility.

Industry research co-operatives are discussed in more detail in relation to section LH 16.

Information collection framework
================================

Collecting information is part of Inland Revenue’s day-to-day activity of administering the tax and social policy system. The information we gather includes large volumes of data (bulk data). We know that the gathering and providing of information to us comes at a cost to our external stakeholders.

We recognise that information is important, which is why we treat all our customers' information as confidential, keep it secure and only use it for lawful purposes. You can find out more on our privacy policy page.

[Privacy Policy](https://www.ird.govt.nz/about-this-site/your-privacy/privacy-policy)

How we decide if we should collect customer information 
--------------------------------------------------------

We have developed principles in this framework to help us prepare and review collection proposals by using a consistent approach. Decisions to proceed with a proposal for collection of information that is covered by this framework will be made in accordance with our governance processes and will be approved at an appropriate senior level.

It is important to note that this framework is not intended to be a tool for evaluating information requests about a specific customer, as these are covered by their own policies and procedures.

**This framework will deliver:**

*   increased public trust and confidence in enhanced transparency, accountability and cost/benefit analysis across our decision-making for data collection approaches
*   support for the collection of the right data and information for us to answer important questions for the purposes of carrying out our functions
*   improved due diligence across Inland Revenue's use of our legal powers
*   transparency about resourcing and trade-offs for confident decision-making
*   to the expectations of external stakeholders and make it easier for us to engage on future collection changes and initiatives.

What the framework applies to
-----------------------------

We regularly consider new proposals to collect information from or about multiple customers. These can include proposals to:

*   seek a law change to require new information to be provided to us
*   collect information for developing policy to improve or reform the tax system (under section 17GB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA))
*   collect bulk information in the form of datasets
*   seek a regulation allowing us to regularly collect datasets (under section 17L of the TAA)
*   use new or amended forms or returns.

Collection framework principles
-------------------------------

| Principles | Examples of what Inland Revenue staff will need to think about |
| --- | --- |
| These are the standards that guide our decisions. | These are examples of what Inland Revenue staff will need to think about when using the principles to evaluate a proposal. This is not an exhaustive list. |
| **Authorised by law**  <br>We will always collect information only as allowed by law and where it relates to one or more of the Commissioner's functions. | Consider Inland Revenue's business need that drives the proposal, how the proposal relates to the Commissioner’s functions, and whether a law change is needed and is appropriate.  <br>  <br>Consider whether collection of the information is necessary and what alternatives (if any) exist (including is the information readily accessible from other internal, public or government sources in a form we can readily use). Consider what impact the proposal has on the integrity of the tax system and, in particular, the public perception of the integrity of the tax system. |
| **Whole of Inland Revenue approach**   <br>We will get input from across Inland Revenue (where possible) to consider the merits of the proposed collection. | Consider internal feedback from relevant Inland Revenue business units, including if the collection will deliver the required outcomes, the implications of not collecting the information, and alternatives to the proposed collection. |
| **Compliance costs, benefits and other impacts**   <br>We will think about the impacts (including compliance costs) of the proposal on the information holder, customers whom the information relates to, customers in general and the tax system as a whole when deciding what information (if any) to collect and how to collect it. | Consider the costs and benefits of collection to the information holder, affected customers and Inland Revenue. Based on the nature of the information being collected, consider the intrusiveness of the collection and who it is necessary to collect the information from (for example, all taxpayers or a targeted group). Does the information already exist in a readily accessible form, or will it need to be created to satisfy the request?  Will there be a software cost? Are there different ways the information could be collected (such as by using natural business systems)? Is there a potential benefit to another government agency? Ensure that the appropriate governance groups and senior managers have approved the collection. |
| **Explain and consult**   <br>We will explain why we require information and, where practicable, give external parties an opportunity to comment unless this may affect our enquiries or be in breach of our confidentiality or integrity obligations. | Consider whether relevant external parties (including those with specialist knowledge) will have input into what information should be collected, as well as the method and frequency of collection. What is the earliest appropriate time to consult? If external parties have not had the opportunity to comment, ensure that Inland Revenue explains why we require the information prior to collecting it. |
| **Support the **Crown-**Māori relationship**  <br>We will consider whether the proposal is consistent with our role supporting the Crown in its relationships with Māori under the Treaty of Waitangi (te Tiriti o Waitangi) (section 14 of the Public Service Act 2020). | Consider if the proposal will have an impact on the Crown’s relationship with Māori. Consider whether the proposal requires specific targeted consultation with Māori. |
| **Strategic direction**  <br>We will consider whether the proposal will support Inland Revenue's strategic direction. | Consider whether the proposal will support Inland Revenue's three broad roles (Effective and efficient, Stewardship, Broader contribution (across the public service)), as well as our strategic aspiration to improve oranga for current and future generations. |

[Student Loan Scheme Amendment Act 2007](/new-legislation/act-articles/student-loan-scheme-amendment-act-2007 "Student Loan Scheme Amendment Act 2007")

Information match between Customs and Inland Revenue
====================================================

Information-matching will be undertaken between IR's student loan information and Customs to establish borrowers' entitlement to interest-free student loans.

##### Section 62A of the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992, sections 280G and 280H of the Customs and Excise Act 1996, Schedule 3 of the Privacy Act 1993 and sections 81 and 87 of the Tax Administration Act 1994

Information-matching will be undertaken between Inland Revenue's student loan information and the border-crossing information held by the New Zealand Customs Service to establish borrowers' entitlement to interest-free student loans.

### Background

The introduction of interest-free student loans has increased the financial incentive for borrowers not to advise Inland Revenue of their absence overseas. This is because borrowers who are overseas for 184 days or more are generally not eligible for interest-free student loans, while borrowers remaining in New Zealand are eligible. The government therefore agreed to introduce an information match to help Inland Revenue identify which borrowers are eligible for interest-free loans.

### Key features

The Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 and the Customs and Excise Act 1996 have been amended to allow an information match of student loan borrower information. The Privacy Act has also being amended to make the information match subject to the rules in Part 10 of that Act.

Inland Revenue will provide Customs with the names, aliases, dates of birth and tax file numbers of student loan borrowers. An information match will occur by Customs comparing the name and date of birth information against any arrival and departure information it holds. If Customs has arrival or departure information relating to any borrower, Customs will supply Inland Revenue with the time and date of arrival or departure for that borrower.

Inland Revenue will use the border-crossing information obtained from Customs to determine whether borrowers are eligible for interest-free student loans.

Inland Revenue will also use border-crossing information to help ascertain whether borrowers are based in New Zealand or overseas and whether they are resident or non-resident.

The Commissioner and the Chief Executive of Customs may enter into an agreement to determine the frequency, form and method for the exchange of information.

### Application date

The changes apply on or after 28 March 2007.

He tirowhānui ki te pūrongo mōhiohio Information reporting overview
===================================================================

Online marketplaces who are tax residents in New Zealand must collect and report information about sellers on their platforms who get income from sales. 

Defining key terms
------------------

Online marketplaces are also known as platform operators.

Sellers’ income is also known as [consideration.](/api/glossary/item?id={5686D331-C200-451B-8BD5-0189F18799CA})

Who is affected
---------------

The rules affect:

*   online marketplaces that connect buyers with sellers of relevant services
*   sellers on online marketplaces that get income from relevant services.

The rules apply to all online marketplaces that are New Zealand tax residents.

[Tax residency status for companies](/international-tax/business/tax-residency-status-for-companies)

Relevant services
-----------------

The rules affect:

*   the rental of immovable property (including commercial and residential), such as carparks, short-stay and visitor accommodation
*   personal services, such as ride-sharing, food and beverage delivery, and graphic and web design services.

The rental of immovable property is the actual renting out of that immovable property. Advertising a property is available to rent is not a relevant service.

A personal service is a service involving time or task-based work performed by 1 or more individuals at the request of a buyer.

Reporting to us
---------------

Online marketplaces must register with us for a Digital Platform Information (DPI) account. You can register for a DPI account in myIR.

Using this account, you will need to file reports by 7 February each year.

The report will cover the past calendar year and must include any:

*   platform information
*   reportable seller information
*   immoveable property rental information.

Reporting to sellers
--------------------

By 7 February each year, online marketplaces must send the sellers a copy of the information reported to us.

Exchange of information between countries
-----------------------------------------

In early 2025, online marketplaces must report the information they’ve collected to us. We will then exchange it with other tax authorities who use the OECD exchange framework.

Penalties for online marketplaces
---------------------------------

Penalties may apply if online marketplaces do not meet the requirements set out in the model reporting standard for digital platforms or fail to take reasonable care.

OECD model rules
----------------

We have adopted the model rules developed by the OECD for the sharing and gig economy. Refer to these rules for further guidance.

[Model reporting rules for Digital Platforms (oecd.org)](https://www.oecd.org/en/topics/sub-issues/international-tax-compliance-policies-and-best-practices/model-reporting-rules-for-digital-platforms.html "Model reporting rules for Digital Platforms (oecd.org)")

The optional extended standard for the sale of goods and vehicle rentals has not been implemented but may be considered in the future.

Information-sharing agreement between Inland Revenue and the Department of Internal Affairs - contact details as part of passport renewal or application process
================================================================================================================================================================

Information-sharing agreement with Internal Affairs - contact details from passport renewals or applications for recovery of student loan or child support debt.

The Privacy (Information-Sharing Agreement Between Inland Revenue and Internal Affairs) Order 2013 approves a new information-sharing agreement between Inland Revenue and the Department of Internal Affairs. Under the agreement, Internal Affairs will provide Inland Revenue with all contact details that it has obtained as part of the adult passport application process. The agreement will enable Inland Revenue to match these contact details against those it holds for people in three specific groups:

*   overseas-based student loan borrowers who are in default of their student loan repayments;
*   liable parents living overseas who are in default of their child support payment obligations; and
*   liable parents living overseas who are not in default of their child support payment obligations but whose contact details appear to be out of date.

Any information received by Inland Revenue relating to individuals outside of these three groups will be deleted within 30 days of receipt.

The objective of the information-sharing agreement is to obtain reliable and timely contact information to assist Inland Revenue's efforts to prevent and collect student loan defaults and child support debt from overseas-based borrowers and liable parents living overseas.

The Privacy Act 1993 provides a mechanism for the approval by Order in Council of information-sharing agreements between agencies. This is the first information-sharing agreement approved in accordance with Part 9A of that Act.

#### What information will be shared?

Only contact details supplied in applications for new or renewed adult passports will be shared under the agreement. This includes information necessary to identify and contact the person, and facilitate communication between Inland Revenue and Internal Affairs. This information is shown in the table below.

| Use | Data |
| --- | --- |
| Identifying the person | First name(s)  <br>Surname  <br>Date of birth |
| Contacting the person | Home address  <br>Passport delivery address  <br>Personal home telephone number  <br>Work telephone number  <br>Mobile phone number  <br>E-mail address |
| Communicating with Internal Affairs | Passport number |

From time to time Inland Revenue may need to clarify the data received from Internal Affairs in order to verify the contact details of an individual. In these instances, Inland Revenue will use the passport number, supplied by Internal Affairs under the agreement, to clearly identify the individual.

#### How will the information be used?

Inland Revenue may use the personal information collected under the agreement to compare it with Inland Revenue's records to identify and then contact an individual overseas who is in default of their student loan or child support obligations. The information may also be used to contact a liable parent living overseas whose contact details appear to be out of date.

#### What actions may result from the receipt of the information shared under the agreement?

Once contact is made with an overseas-based borrower in default or a liable parent overseas in default and the individual's identity is confirmed, Inland Revenue can be expected to take steps to recover the overdue payments. This may include:

*   requiring payment of overdue child support liability in full or student loan balance in full;
*   requiring payment of the overdue student loan debt in full;
*   requiring payment of part of the overdue student loan debt or overdue child support liability, with the remainder being paid under an instalment arrangement;
*   requiring payment by instalment arrangement; or
*   taking legal action.

The regulations came into effect on 3 October 2013. [Read the information sharing agreement](/internet/ird/aboutir/agreements/agreements-index.html)

Executive Summary This discussion paper explore s cultu ral perspectives on information-sharing by government departments. Introduction In line with the Government’s aim of ‘New Zealanders being able to complete their transactions with government easily in a digital environment’ (Better Public Services; Result 10 1 ), Inland Revenue (IR) is currently increasing its information-sharing with other government departments. IR was aware that there would be sensitivities around information-sharing by government departments. As part of its policy development, IR began research ing people’ s views on information-sharing (Lips , M., et al., 2010; Litmus , 2011; Inland Revenue & Litmus , 2012; Gregory , V. , 2012; Inland Revenue & Research New Zealand , 2013; Bennett, A., 2013). Methodology This research project was conducted to explore the attitudinal differences for Maori and Pasifika peoples towards increased information-sharing between government agencies. In accordance with the Treaty of Waitangi, this study had particular emphasis on the views of Māori. Participants from the Asian community were also included as this is the other major non-European cultural group in New Zealand. Qualitative interviews were carried out with ten community cultural representatives, 19 IR staff, and nine members of relevant government organisations on cultural perspectives regarding government agencies sharing information (see Appendix for details). Interviewing took place between February and April 2013, and was conducted by a senior researcher and a senior evaluator from IR’s National Research & Evaluation Unit (R&E). Our approach for researching cultural views As preparation for this study, a literature review was conducted on cultural attitudes towards privacy, confidentiality and information. The review found very little in the prior research directly on cultural perspectives addressing privacy and information-sharing . However, the literature on broader ‘cultural attitudes’ did give us an understanding of the vast scope involved when researching ‘culture’ (Durie, 1998; Keown, et al, 2005). This is particularly true when multiple cultures are grouped together under broad headings such as ‘Pasifika’ and ‘Asian’. The review also emphasised the value of allowing participants to decide how they would like to be included in any research. One example of this was the choice of the Kaitakawaenga Māori staff to invite us to a hui, rather than having individual interviews. (Ministry of Social Development, 2008; The Putaiora Writing Group, Undated). The literature noted that people of the same cultural group do not necessarily share the same cultural views , or put their views into practice in the same way (Webster, 2001). This is expressed by Wong (cited in Ip, 1996, p.161) as: ‘No one ever asks for the “Pakeha view” but they expect one single Chinese view or one single Māori view. It’s total rubbish, as if we all need to think the same.’ 1 Result 10 is part of Better Public Services, see www.dia.govt.nz/Better-Public-Services-Measuring-Result-10 4 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Information-sharing between government agencies: Cultural perspectives People also have different views about what they include in the term ‘culture’. We have left it as a fairly loosely defined concept encompassing ‘race and ethnicity’. The interviews we conducted for this study are not intended to fully represent the Māori, Pasifika and Asian cultures. Rather, the aim was to gather a range of informed opinions from people who are experienced in considering cultural perspectives as starting points for discussion. The views stated in this paper can only be taken as being ‘indicative’ for the three cultural groups included in this study. Main research findings The participants in this research project had similar views about the benefits of government information- sharing . They see it as potentially beneficial but also needing strong protocols for privacy, data quality, transparency, and consent. However, our indicative findings are that Māori and Pasifika participants are less comfortable than Asian participants with government information-sharing. Reactions to the concept of information-sharing Participants from all three of the cultural groups we covered generally believed that ‘limited’ information- sharing is beneficial in such things as improving government agency efficiency and streamlin ing government services for customers One concern about information-sharing is that the recent cases of privacy breaches by various New Zealand government departments mean that people doubt the ability of government agencies to promise information privacy. Another concern is that government agencies may hold inaccurate information, and sharing this information would exacerbate the situation. Māori Māori participants talked about information being a part of themselves. It is important for Māori to be able to trust that their information will be treated with care and used as intended. However, Māori fear that informati on may be shared in ways that may seem well-intentioned but are, nevertheless, detrimental and ‘disempowering’ for Māori. Pasifika Pasifika participants were also rather uncomfortable with information-sharing , and this is seen as strongly due to being generally unfamiliar with the systems and processes of the various government agencies. A particular area of concern for Pasifika participants was immigration. Another concern is how information-sharing might impact people on low incomes who supplement their income via illegitimate means. Asian Asian participants were easily the most positive group about the perceived benefits of information-sharing . This positivity seemed partly due to a strong sense of trust in New Zealand government agencies. Nevertheless, Asian participants were still keen on having legislation to limit the extent of information-sharing to some degree. Trust and transparency Transparency and consent are two key factors that participants wish ed to see. That is, participants want ed to know ho w their information would be handled, and they wanted to be informed and, as much as possible, asked for consent before it is shared. Cultural sensitivities and conventions The research found there are a number of culturally-based sensitivities and preferences for how information should be gathered and managed. These ranged from treating hand-written information as taonga (Māori) to 5 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Information-sharing between government agencies: Cultural perspectives having a wide range of potential naming conventions (Pasifika) and having sensitivities around asking direct questions (Asian). 6 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Information-sharing between government agencies: Cultural perspectives Section 2. Implications of this research Before delving into the research findings, it is worth pausing to consider the significance of this research in the minds and hearts of the participants, and how the findings will be used to contribute to Result 10. Reflections from the researchers Given that ‘information privacy’ has been in the news so much recently, and how little idea we had about how people would respond ‘culturally’, we were interested to see how significant this topic would be for people. The answer is complex. This is a topic that concerns the two-way trust relationship between people and the state. At an individual level, negative experiences with government agencies can make people distrust the state, and the conversations covered this. But we also talked about trust in a ‘culture-wide’ sense. That made the conversations both far-reaching (talking about hopes and fears of an entire cultural group) and deep (talking about people’s identity). It also meant that we were talking a lot about intangibles; people’s hopes, concerns, and values. Additionally, there were many unknowns. People we re very uncertain about what information is currently shared, and what positive and negative outcomes will actually happen if information-sharing increases. And , of course, government information-sharing happens beyond people’s reach, inside government agencies, which is another source of uncertainty. We are very grateful that people persevered in giving us their insights and helping us understand their points of view. We have used people’s own words in the paper in an effort to convey the importance of this topic for them. This was a complex undertaking, and we trust this exploratory paper will create new lines of thought and better cultural understanding. 7 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Information-sharing between government agencies: Cultural perspectives Section 3. Benefits of information-sharing Government information-sharing is seen as beneficial but fallible. All cultures see positives in information-sharing Our research incorporated interviews with community cultural representatives, IR staff and representatives from relevant government agencies (see Appendix for details). Everyone we talked to had both positive and negative reactions to the concept of govern ment information-sharing. On the positive side, participants from all three of the main cultural groups we covered generally believed that ‘limited ’ information-sharing is beneficial in that it: Improve s government agency efficiency Streamlin es government services for customers Gives customers better access to entitlements Improves detection and enforcement of fraud and other crimes Makes government staff safer and better equipped to handle the situations they are dealing with Speeds up respon se times for people where urgent assistance is needed Avoids having to collect embarrassing information from people more than once. “\[Domestic violence\] They found out there were many government agencies interacting with those families, and yet none of them shared enough information to see all the red flags. All they saw was one red flag that that this is a risk, but if they all knew there would have been about 20 red flags.” IR staff (Māori) "Now we have this MSD information exchange it’s a much smoother process for someone to come off their benefit and start Working for Families from IRD.” IR staff (Tongan) Participants believe that information-sharing will suit younger people especially . They see youth as having less fear about having their personal information in the public arena, given that youth are seen to already be using social media in this manner. Main concerns are privacy and accuracy The recent cases of privacy breaches by various New Zealand government departments mean that all participants had doubts about government agencies being able to promise information privacy. Interestingly, IR is seen as currently doing better than most government agencies regarding protection of people’s personal information. Therefore, some participants see IR as having a lot to lose if privacy breaches occur through IR increasing its information-sharing. “Inland Revenue is the last of the Mohicans that we can trust.” Community representative (Māori) 7 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Information-sharing between government agencies: Cultural perspectives A second concern for all participants is that they do not believe the information held by government agencies is always correct. This concern is exacerbated by the prospect of government agencies increasing their information-sharing. 8 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Information-sharing between government agencies: Cultural perspectives Section 4. Trust in government Government information-sharing raises deeper considerations such as trust in government. To create trust, information-sharing needs to be transparent and consent-base d. The preceding section on ‘benefits of information-sharing ’ described how, for some participants, there will always be some trust-related concerns even though the purpose of the information-sharing is highly beneficial to the individual, e.g. ‘improve d public service’. Unsurprisingly, these concerns are heightened when the information-sharing is for purposes that have no direct benefit (such as ‘compiling statistics’) or are negatives according to the individual (such as ‘enforcement and compliance’). This section details the trust concerns described by the participants from each cultural group. Māori concerns Māori participants talked about information in a way that differed from the other cultural groups. That is, they described information as being a part of themselves. “It’s not only personal, it has a lot of weight. It’s tapu, it’s sacred, it has its own integrity, its own mana. For me it’s very sensitive.” IR staff (Māori) Flowing on from this perspective, Māori participants expressed a strong view that government agencies do not become owners of information given to them , r ather, they are ‘caretakers’. “Government may consider it owns that information, but the people who provide that information consider they’re sharing their historical family information, their whakapapa their mana. Sharing and allowing it to be cared for and stored by the government of New Zealand.” IR staff (Māori) This view of information means that it is important for Māori to be able to trust that their information will be treated with care and use d as intended. However, trust between Māori and the government is an ongoing issue in New Zealand. “There’s been a hundred years of mistrust. Sometimes it’s not so much military activity taking place against you personally, as the fact you’ve been marginalised socially and economically.” IR staff (Māori) “Some people also see it as a continuation of colonisation, the fact that the tax agency says you have to be identified via an IRD number, and MSD has its own identifier as well.” IR staff (Māori) Arising from these trust concerns, some Māori participants also worry that government agencies will use information-sharing in ways that may seem well-intentioned but are , nevertheless, detrimental and ‘disempowering’ for Māori. For instance, they fear ed that information-sharing could lead to ‘more negative statistics’ about Māori that lack the full social context for these statistics and therefore result in negative outcomes. 9 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Information-sharing between government agencies: Cultural perspectives “Māori are already highly watched and seem to be associated with negative statistics. This could be another process that criminalises Māori.” Community representative (Māori) “Information can be taken out of context and that becomes the truth.” Community representative (Māori) As a result of these trust issues, some Māori participants were not keen to see information-sharing increase. They felt there was ‘enough’ information-sharing at present. “It \[gangs and serious crime\] can be stopped now.... government can already share information under the Terrorism Act.” Community representative (Māori) Pasifika concerns Pasifika participants were also rather un comfortable with information-sharing , and this is seen as strongly due to being generally unfamiliar with the systems and processes of the various government agencies. “They \[Samoans\] are so frustrated, and I think live in fear because they have no idea of the system.” Community representative (Samoan) “Tongans come from a culture back in the islands.... the most important thing is to go out and work and get money to pay the bills and feed the family. I don’t think they see tax as a priority.” IR staff (Tongan) The ‘dawn raids’ of the 1970s on Samoan illegal immigrants were also mentioned as contributing to this lack of trust. “Culturally it’s an insult for Pacific Islanders for Police to turn up at the door and handcuff a person and drag them out of the house and put him on the next plane to the islands.... There are other ways.... We can work it out.” Community representative (Samoan) As a result of these issues, immigration is a particularly sensitive trust issue for Pasifika participants. "Trying to convince them to get an IRD number and not use anyone else’s IRD numbers \[for fruit picking\]. I had all these hands up they were like are you sure you’re not going to pass on this information to Immigration.” IR staff (Tongan) Another concern mentioned by Pasifika participants was the effect information-sharing would have on people on low incomes who supplement their income via illegitimate means. While they generally disagreed with illegitimate income, Pasifika participants in this research felt that there were sometimes more important social considerations. 10 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Information-sharing between government agencies: Cultural perspectives “I know one or two in my church are collecting \[scrap metal for hidden economy income\]. I understand how important that thing is for him and his family .... they don’t really understand what they’re doing.” Community representative (Tongan) “Who’s not paying their PAYE is information we don’t want to share, which churches aren’t complying with IRD.” Community representative (Samoan) And finally, one Pasifika participant believed that, as a whole, Pasifika people are less f amiliar with information technology, which means they are more wary of how it is used by others. "I don’t think that Tongans have actually grasped the concept of the internet.... You’re talking to a 40- year-old or a 50-year-old who’s just been in New Zealand for two years now and were talking to them about ‘oh you can go online and you can go onto www.ird.govt and click on the booklet and download it and print it’ and they’re looking at you thinking what the hell are you talking about.” IR staff (Tongan) Asian participants are the keenest Asian participants were easily the most positive group about the perceived benefits of information-sharing 2 . They were also keen to see information-sharing increase. This positivity seemed partly due to a strong sense of trust in New Zealand government agencies. “New Zealand is one of the most trusted governments in the world. China use any of the information without letting you know, at least New Zealand government tell you.” Community representative (Chinese) “They \[Chinese people\] say New Zealand is a developed country and they expect information to be shared among government departments. They are actually happy about it, it’s efficient.” IR staff (Malaysian) Nevertheless, Asian parti cipants were still keen on having legislation to limit the extent of information-sharing to some degree. “Most governments when they have the power they abuse the power.” Community representative (Chinese) And, as with Pasifika, Asian participants stated that there are those from the Asian community that are not at all familiar with New Zealand government agencies and systems. “We’ve got customers who’ve been working all their life in New Zealand but still don’t have the understanding of how the tax system operates.” IR staff (Indian) 2 This is consistent with the previous study on ‘Real Me’ that found that Indian/Pakistani and Sri Lankan people were more likely to take up the Identity Verification Service. 11 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Information-sharing between government agencies: Cultural perspectives Table 1. Trust factors Trust concerns Positive factors Māori Belief that information-sharing at the current level is adequate, and there is no need to increase it Lack of trust that government agencies would use information-sharing in people’s best interest (e.g. the perception is that, in order to save money, government departments could use the information to incorrectly remove people’s entitlements) Government agencies are seen as caretakers of people’s information rather than owners Kaitakawaenga Māori are seen as creating a direct relationship between Māori and IR Pasifika Past issues regarding how NZ authorities have dealt with illegal immigrants from the Pacific nations have left a strong resistance to interacting with government agencies, particularly if information is going to be passed to Immigration New Zealand Minimal experience of information technology means it is difficult to relate to the concept of information-sharing to see the benefits IR’s Community Compliance Officers are seen as enhancing the relationship between IR and the various cultural groups in the community Asian Members of the Asian community who have English as a second language can misinterpret questions, and be misunderstood themselves, making information collection less reliable. Agencies that subsequently receive that information through information-sharing may incorrectly assume the information is accurate. Good understanding of information- sharing through experience in other countries where e-based government services and information-sharing are commonplace, particularly in Malaysia and South Korea Trust NZ government to act in public interest Table 1 summarises the various trust factors as mentioned by each cultural group in this research. Please note, Table 1 shows the issues that the participants we interviewed felt were related to their own culture. These perceptions are not necessarily widespread thro ughout these cultural groups, nor are they limited solely to people from the given cultural group. Importance of cultural matching between customer and staff to gather information Before any information-sharing takes place, information gathering must happen. Cultural matching between government agency staff and customers is suggested by participants as a means of improving the accuracy of the information gathered. That is, people meeting with people of their own culture, and speaking in their own language. This applies across all three cultural groups in this research. “There’s a degree of comfort for Māori giving that information to Māori....‘I’m giving it to you and actually hold you accountable for making sure that it’s looked after’.” IR staff (Māori) 12 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Information-sharing between government agencies: Cultural perspectives Cultural matching also reduces people’s fear of revealing they have not understood what’s been said, or that they may have ‘negative’ answers to questions. “They \[Samoans\] answer in a way that’s the likable answer.” IR staff (Samoan) “Whakama which is embarrassment and shame.... they will give you the answer that they think you want to hear but they will go away and say I haven’t got a clue what that person said.” IR staff (Māori) All groups felt that cultural matching improves understanding and builds trust at a subliminal level. “Better to speak to one of their own and understand the issue better perhaps.” Community representative (Tongan) “It helps to relieve the fear.” IR staff (Samoan) In addition, some participants also noted that simply taking a less direct approach in conversation can be helpful. “Korean, Japanese or Chinese don’t like direct questions, do this, do this. They might hold back information. The appropriate approach would be to relax those Koreans who have to speak English, talk about their kids and their kids’ education which is big concern for parents, or food, or Gangnam style, which Koreans are very proud of at the moment.” IR staff (Korean) Importance of transparency and consent The trust concerns mentioned here are greatly exacerbated by any sense of being coerced into providing information to government agencies, either to avoid prosecution or as a requirement for entitlements. “If you don’t give us this information you’re not going to get your money or we’re going to prosecute you.... That actually undermines their mana, it’s a personal insult to them it feels like they’re being violated.” IR staff (Māori) Transparency and consent are two key factors that participants wish to see. In particular, participants suggested having public statements (e.g. online) about the information-sharing protocols, and systems to inform people about when their information was going to be shared. “If it’s going to be shared with another department even though it’s under the umbrella of the government I think I have a right to know why.” Community representative (Samoan) “Maybe something as simple as a statement on the website that says here’s how we handle your information. If you get any concerns please contact us.” IR staff (European) 13 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Information-sharing between government agencies: Cultural perspectives “The treaty principles.... participation, protection and partnership.” IR staff (Māori) However, some participants felt that they should be asked for their consent where possible, and particularly for more important matters. “Don’t just take it for granted.” Community representative (Māori) 14 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Information-sharing between government agencies: Cultural perspectives Section 5. Cultural sensitivities and conventions Culturally-specific sensitivities and conventions Participants in this research mentioned a number of culturally-based sensitivities and preferences for how information should be gathered and managed. These are listed in Table 2. Please note, Table 2 shows the topics and conventions that the participants we interviewed felt were important to their own culture. These perceptions are not necessarily widespread throughout these cultural groups, nor are they limited solely to people from the given cultural group. There may also be other cultural issues that were not mentioned in this research. Table 2. Culturally sensitive topics and conventions Culturally sensitive topics Cultural conventions Māori Historic records are part of mana Hand-written information (e.g. can be taonga, particularly something like a deceased relative’s handwriting) Deceased persons’ information Split families’/child care information 3 Parental/adoption information Financial information, particularly if a person is financially struggling\* Property ownership Information that links to other family members Naming conventions; Shortened version of their name English transliterations Pasifika Split families’/child care information Financial information, particularly if a person is financially struggling\* Having information requested by Police Information that links to other family members Naming conventions; Shortened version of their name Use surname as first name Use father’s name as their name Use an English name Use a Noble name from their village Use parents address Women are dominant in Tongan culture, e.g. an aunt can take over the care of her brother’s child ren, but this makes getting accurate child care information difficult 3 ‘Split families/child care’ was mentioned by all three cultural groups. It may well be that this is a universally sensitive topic. 15 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Information-sharing between government agencies: Cultural perspectives Culturally sensitive topics Cultural conventions Asian Personal definition of a ‘dependent child’ may include children of older than 18 Split families’/child care information Child support details Income details Asking direct questions (seems rude) Repeating questions (seems accusatory) Names can be given as surname first \*This sensitivity for Māori and Pasifika regarding financial information was also found by Lips et al 4 . A key feature in Table 2 is the number of cultural conventions that make it difficult to ensure even the most basic record such as someone’s name is correct. "There’s times when they’ve completed a form for me and they’ve crossed out their \[incorrect\] name because they’re so used to writing that name down.... and I’m like ‘um you’ve written this name but on our records we’ve got this name’ and they’re like ‘oh that’s the name that everyone calls me, that’s my name, that’s my other name.’” IR staff (Tongan) Information valuable for Māori whakapapa Māori in this research made a strong plea for more defined information storage and/or transferral protocols, pa rticularly for information that has ceased being usable for government agencies but which is of significance to families and could potentially be lost or destroyed. 4 Lips, M, Eppel, E., Cunninghan, A., Hopkins-Burns, V.

(2010) 16 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Information-sharing between government agencies: Cultural perspectives Section 6. Conclusions This study has explored cultural viewpoints that can be used to inform IR’s information- sharing policies, processes and communications. Differences in cultural views Each participant cultur al group views information-sharing through a different lens. For Māori and Pasifika, government information-sharing is clearly less appealing. For instance, Māori participants consider ; Personal information to be an extension of self and part of mana Government agencies may make decisions based on misleading, ‘surface-level’ information when people’s situations are, in reality , more complex. And Pasifika participants felt that some in their community; Do not have a good understanding of New Zealand government agency processes and therefore there is a sense of inequality Have little familiarity with information technology, therefore, increased use of technology can make them uneasy Feel any dispute with government agencies may threaten their immigration status (where applicable). Participants from the Asian community seemed more comfortable with increased information-sharing , and; Are familiar with information technology and (if born overseas) may have experienced improved efficiencies from government agency information-sharing State that some overseas governments have abused the power of information-sharing , but they regard New Zealand government agencies as considerably more trustworthy, and they expect that strict protocols will be put in place. Sensitive information Amongst all the information types considered to be sensitive, financial information is problematic for all three participant cultural groups. Therefore, IR’s customer information can be considered sensitive as it is gathered for financial/tax purposes. This is compounded where the situation includes child care and support arrangements which are another highly sensitive matter regardless of cultural group. We also found considerable concerns regarding information accuracy. For instance, a person may have a number of versions of their name arising from cultural conventions. However, even though participants exp ressed a range of deep concerns, it seems that, if these concerns can be mitigated through transparency and customer consent, participants do see the potential for information- sharing to improve government agency efficiency and streamline services for customers. 17 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Information-sharing between government agencies: Cultural perspectives Next steps This small-scale exploratory research has provided a range of insights on cultural views of government information-sharing. As specific policies , processes and communications are developed, we recommend that cultural input continues to be included, particularly from Māori and Pasifika customers and stakeholders. 18 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Information-sharing between government agencies: Cultural perspectives Section 7. Appendix Qualitative methodology Qualitative interviews were carried out with community cultural representatives, IR staff, and members of relevant government agencies. They were conducted from February to April 2013 by a senior researcher and a senior evaluator from IR’s National Research & Evaluation Unit. The interviews we conducted for this study are not intended to fully represent the Māori, Pasifika and Asian cultures. Rather, the aim was to gather a range of informed opinions from people who are experienced in considering cultural perspectives as starting points for discussion.

### Notes

1 Housing Shares not yet commenced - MSD’s intention was to improve how it delivers services to customers by expanding the information sharing with Inland Revenue in this area. Due to other Ministry priorities, resources to implement these changes have not yet been prioritised.

2 Estimated (as agreed with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner).

3 Transactions recorded in Inland revenue’s START system that occurred between 16 April and 30 June 2020. Due to data migration as part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation Programme, the whole year could not be reported on.

4 The programme was on hold for most of the year, as MSD staff were diverted to other priority COVID-19 related tasks, resulting in a reduction in proactive information share (records were still received from Inland Revenue). The figure reported for ‘Proactive Information Share - benefits and students’ means ‘Clients with a case or an investigation created'.

Qualitative benefits
--------------------

In the 2020-21 year.

*   The information sharing under this AISA has effectively helped MSD to assess eligibility for Community Services Cards and benefits and identify over-payments. It is also the most effective way for Inland Revenue and MSD to ensure customers receive their correct Working for Families Tax Credit entitlements.
*   There have been no data breaches under the AISA.
*   Data was continually shared through the period. However, it was not reviewed by MSD as a result of resources being diverted to the COVID- 19 response, which impacted both the Commencement Cessation Benefits/Student Match and Proactive Information Share.

Assurance
---------

In the 2020-21 year.

*   MSD and Inland Revenue have received no privacy complaints about the operation of the information sharing under the AISA.
*   There has been no change to the Order in Council.
\[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Policy and Regulatory Stewardship Kaupapa me te Tiaki i ngā Ture PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 New Zealand Information Sheet: Inland Revenue’s high-wealth individuals research project on effective tax rates Introduction Inland Revenue is undertaking research into the effective tax rates of high-wealth New Zealand households. This will involve collecting information from a group of high-wealth households. This information is important to help us assess the fairness of the tax system. Project objectives The goal of the project is to improve the evidence base on which to assess the fairness of the tax system. The project will do this by improving our information on effective tax rates. The project is not making any policy recommendations, but the analysis will inform future tax policy advice.  The project is not directly related to any existing tax provision. No one's taxable income will be reassessed on the basis of the information they provide. Information collected in this project will only be used for the project. A public report on the project is expected to be completed by June 2023. It will not identify any specific individuals, their financial information or their effective tax rate. One reason we are doing this work is that current statistical surveys, such as the Household Economic Survey, are not well suited to collecting information from high-wealth households. As a result, Inland Revenue has decided to collect this important statistical information itself. Approach The project will compare the amount of tax an individual, and their household, pays to a number of different measures of income. This will allow us to estimate a range of effective tax rates for each household – enabling us to take different perspectives on how we assess the fairness of New Zealand’s tax system. Economic income is the broadest measure of income we will use. It is not based on legal concepts but seeks to estimate the increase in resources a person has available to them in a Where will I be able to get more help?

Economic income includes increases in wealth, such as through capital gains, and looks beyond legal or tax concepts of income. Our methodology will be subject to peer review. More information on the methodology will be published in the future. The high-wealth individual population We will collect information from about 400 high-wealth households. The group has been identified by monitoring public information. Households in the population are believed to have a net worth exceeding $20 million. We will measure income on a household basis, where a household is defined as a lead person, (domestic) partner and dependent children aged under 18 (where relevant). This may not include all individuals living in your house. Similar research carried out overseas collects information from households. This is also the approach taken by Stats NZ when collecting information for its Household Economic Survey. Timelines Information will be requested in three phases. November 2021: We will ask you for details of your household members. We require this information because our research is based on household income. January 2022: We will give you a list of entities and business undertakings (such as trusts and companies) that Inland Revenue believes you have an interest in. We will ask you to verify your interest in these entities and provide details of any additional entities you have an interest in. Your partner will be asked to undertake the same exercise. You will also be asked to provide information about the entities your dependent children have an interest in. You will have around six weeks to complete this exercise. May 2022: You and your partner will be asked to provide any further financial information required to estimate the measures of income. Financial information for entities that you have an interest in will also be sought. You will have around three months to respond to this request. For each of these phases, the information will be sought under section 17GB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (the Act). You may ask your authorised tax agent to provide the information on your behalf. What financial information will be requested in May 2022? In May 2022, you and your partner, if any, will each be asked questions about your respective finances. You will also be asked the same questions for your dependent children. These questions will enable us to estimate the economic measures of income. To minimise compliance costs, we will only ask you for information we cannot otherwise obtain (for example, through tax records and public databases). Policy and Regulatory Stewardship Kaupapa me te Tiaki i ngā Ture 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] The questions are likely to cover matters such as: financial information relating to companies, unincorporated businesses and trusts you have an interest in; the value of your financial assets (such as financial or portfolio investments); and your savings. We will also seek information relating to foreign holdings. We will not be asking you to undertake independent valuations of your assets. Information will be required for the 2016–2021 income years. Collecting several years of information provides more consistency by smoothing out annual volatility. We understand that some information we seek may not be available to you. You should use your best endeavours to answer the questions posed as accurately and as fully as possible. Is it compulsory to provide information? It will be compulsory for you to provide the information requested in November, January and May. For these requests, Inland Revenue will be using its newly enacted power in section 17GB of the Act. This gives us express power to request information we consider relevant to “a purpose relating to the development of policy for the improvement or reform of the tax system”. This is consistent with the Commissioner’s statutory duty to provide advice to government, for which the Commissioner has a long and recognised history. Information collected under section 17GB has specific statutory protections that prevent the Commissioner of Inland Revenue from using it in proceedings against you. The consequences for non-compliance with section 17GB are the same as for other information-gathering powers, such as section 17B of the Act. Ultimately, the courts can be involved to ensure the power can be enforced. Inland Revenue hopes this will not be necessary. How will privacy and confidentiality be protected? Inland Revenue is committed to preserving the privacy and confidentiality of all information collected. Our processes for protecting individuals’ personal information will follow the principles of the Privacy Act 2020, as well as our own confidentiality requirements. This project has been discussed with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner, and a Privacy Impact Assessment is being prepared (which we will publish) that will contain more detail on how your information will be treated. We will seek information separately from you and your partner, if any, to preserve privacy (unless your partner directs otherwise). Information will not be shared with other members of your household without consent. Once we have combined the collected information with information we already hold, any identifiable information about you will be removed (that is, the data will be anonymised). The information will not be published in a form that could identify you, your partner or associated entities. Policy and Regulatory Stewardship Kaupapa me te Tiaki i ngā Ture 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Will Inland Revenue share identifiable information with other agencies? Inland Revenue will only share identifiable information with other agencies in very unusual circumstances in accordance with the law. If we received a request to exchange information under a tax treaty that related to any information provided for this project, the New Zealand competent authority would approach the persons concerned directly to collect the information. This would ensure that the most reliable information is made available and provide taxpayers with the opportunity to challenge any such request. In exceptional circumstances, such as serious crime or national security, we may disclose information collected to other New Zealand agencies. There may also be rare occasions where we are legally required to disclose information (such as for a commission of inquiry). How can you assure me the information won’t be used for compliance purposes? Information we collect in the November, January and May requests will only be used for this project (except for the limited circumstances noted above). The information you provide (other than contact details) will be collected and transferred to a database separate from Inland Revenue’s START system. The information will not form part of your tax records. Financial information you provide will only be accessible by a small number of people on the project who are on an approved person list. Access to the data will be monitored and can be audited. The information will not be available to staff working in compliance and investigation areas. Staff working on the project will not share individualised information with any staff not working on the project. Information will only be retained as long as it is required for the project. We will destroy the raw data once the report is published in 2023.

This involves collecting information from a group of high-wealth households. The information is important to help us assess the fairness of the tax system and will contribute to the development of tax policy. You are receiving this information sheet because you are either one of the high-wealth individuals selected to take part in this project or you have been identified as the partner of one of the high-wealth individuals. We will also send a copy to your nominated agent for this project. You have been sent an earlier version of this information sheet. This version includes more detail about the methodology we are using and the information we need from you this year.

It will not make any policy recommendations, but its analysis will inform future tax policy advice. The project is not related to any existing tax provision. The information collected in this project will not be used for any other purpose, and it will be destroyed at the end of the project.

If you do not have ECHO access, but would like it please email: etrproject@ird.govt.nz Policy and Regulatory Stewardship Kaupapa me te Tiaki i ngā Ture 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] One reason we are doing this work is because current statistical surveys, such as the Household Economic Survey, are not well suited to collecting information from high-wealth households. As a result, Inland Revenue has decided to collect this important statistical information itself. Approach and methodology The project will compare the amount of tax paid by an individual and their household to three main measures of income. This will allow us to estimate a range of effective tax rates for each household and take different perspectives on how we assess the fairness of New Zealand’s tax system. Here are the income measures we intend to use.  Taxable income. This uses personal taxable income, as defined in tax law.  Gross-cash income. This adds several non-taxed receipts to personal taxable income. The main receipts added in are realised capital gains for sold assets and regular monetary gifts.  Economic income. This adds both non-taxed receipts and accrued capital gains to personal taxable income. This measure of income will include accrued capital gains on unsold assets, as well as realised capital gains on sold assets. We will calculate estimates of this measure, both with and without including the ‘imputed rental’ for owner occupied houses. Imputed rental is a concept from economic theory. It is an estimate of the income you would receive if you rented your house and represents the value of (or foregone income from) the homeowner living in their home. Economic income is the broadest measure of income we will use. It is not based on legal or tax concepts but seeks to estimate the increase in resources a person has available to them in a given period. Our methodology will be subject to peer review by, among others, an advisory group formed by the Commissioner. This group is called the Methodology Advisory Group and includes about 10 subject matter experts from outside Inland Revenue. The Methodology Advisory Group does not have decision rights over the methodology, but the views of its members are considered for decisions on the final methodology. More information on the methodology is available on the ECHO site. The high-wealth individual population We are collecting information from just under 400 high-wealth households. The group, which includes New Zealand tax residents only, has been identified from tax records and by monitoring public information. Each household is believed to have had a net worth of more than $20 million at some point from 2016 to 2021. We are measuring income on a household basis. We have defined a household as a high- wealth individual, their partner (if they have one) and any dependent children aged under 18. This may not include everyone living in the house. Policy and Regulatory Stewardship Kaupapa me te Tiaki i ngā Ture 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Both the individual initially contacted and their partner, if they have one, will receive separate notices to request their information. This approach is intended to protect each partner’s privacy and because people do not always have access to their partner’s financial information. However, partners can choose to provide the information either individually or in a single joint response. You do not have to consult your partner if you are providing an individual response. Timelines Information is being requested in three phases. November 2021: We asked for information about household members - our research is based on household income. Week of 21 February 2022: We will shortly ask you for a list of the entities (including trusts, partnerships, and companies) you have a significant interest in. The high-wealth individuals originally contacted – but not partners – will also be asked for information on entities held by any dependent children in the household. You and your partner can choose to provide the information either individually or in a single joint response. You will have around six weeks to provide this information. June 2022: You and your partner will each be asked to provide the further financial information we require so we can estimate the measures of income for 2016 to 2021. We may also ask for financial information for entities you have an interest in. You will have around three months to respond to this request. For each of these phases, the information will be requested under section 17GB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (the Act). You may ask a tax agent or representative to provide the information on your behalf. Further guidance will be available from Inland Revenue through a dedicated email address. What entity-related information is being requested in February 2022? You are being asked to identify entities such as the companies, partnerships, and trusts that you have a significant interest in. You will be sent a questionnaire, which has a guide explaining the questions. We are only asking for information about entities with assets or income over a threshold ($1,000,000), and which you have a significant interest in but do not necessarily legally control. For example, in February we will not ask for information about portfolio investments (that is, where your family’s ownership is below 10%) in companies or funds. The information sought will include information on trusts with which you or your family have certain relationships (such as settlor, appointer and/or beneficiary) and where the trust is over the threshold for assets. We will ask for information over the period 2016 to 2021. Policy and Regulatory Stewardship Kaupapa me te Tiaki i ngā Ture 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] What financial information will be requested in June 2022? In June 2022, you and your partner will each be asked specific questions relating to your own individual income and wealth. You may choose to respond individually or jointly, as a household. This information will enable us to estimate the economic measures of income. To minimise compliance costs, we will only ask you for information we cannot find somewhere else (for example, in tax records and public databases). The questions are likely to ask for information such as:  financial information relating to companies, unincorporated businesses and trusts you have an interest in  the value of your financial assets (such as financial or portfolio investments)  real estate that you own. We will not ask you to have your assets independently valued. The information we ask for will be for the 2016 to 2021 income years. Collecting several years of information provides more consistency by smoothing out annual volatility. Is it compulsory to provide information? It is compulsory for you to provide the information we ask for in February and June 2022. For these requests, Inland Revenue is using its power in section 17GB of the Act. This gives us express power to request information we consider relevant to “a purpose relating to the development of policy for the improvement or reform of the tax system”. This is consistent with the Commissioner’s statutory duty to provide advice to government, for which the Commissioner has a long and recognised history.

The consequences for non-compliance with section 17GB are the same as for other information-gathering powers, such as section 17B of the Act. Ultimately, the courts can be involved to ensure the power can be enforced. We hope this will not be necessary. While we understand you may not have all the information we ask for, you should try to answer the questions as fully and accurately as possible or use reasonable estimates where you are uncertain. How will privacy and confidentiality be protected? We will ensure the privacy and confidentiality of all the information we collect is protected.

You are receiving this information sheet because you are either: • one of the high-wealth individuals selected to take part in this project; or • the partner of one of those individuals. We will also send a copy to your nominated agent if you have advised us of one for this project.

A Methodology Advisory Group, made up of 10 subject matter experts from outside Inland Revenue, has been formed to provide input into the methodology. Papers presented to the Methodology Advisory Group can be found on the ECHO (External Collaboration Hub Online) site. Timeline for financial information collection On about 9 June you will receive a request for the further financial information we require to estimate the measures of income we intend to use in our report. In most cases we will only ask for information over the period 2016 to 2021 (the main exception will be for information about inheritances and certain other gifts as discussed below). Estimating income measures for six years provides a better picture of effective tax rates by smoothing out annual income volatility. The information we will ask you to provide is information that Inland Revenue either does not hold as it relates to non-taxable income (such as capital gains or certain trust distributions) or is held in a form that is too aggregated for the project to undertake the analysis. In some cases (such as ownership of residential property or listed shares), we have used public registers to obtain the information we need, and we will therefore only ask for limited information regarding these asset classes. You will have until 24 August 2022 to respond to this request. Where we are asking about trusts and you do not have access to the information, we will ask you to provide us with contact details of a person (e.g., a trustee) who will be able to provide the information. You will be required to do this by 4 July. For partners, each individual will receive a separate notice requesting the information. You may respond separately or jointly. This approach is being taken to protect each person’s confidential information and privacy. What financial information is being requested in June 2022? There will be a Guide to help you understand what information you need to provide. In broad outline the questions will be about your own financial affairs, focussing on: • the aggregated value of your financial or portfolio investments (such as investments in bonds or equities) • the address of your principal family residence • any real estate holdings held for you by nominees • distributions, sale of ownership interests and capital investment information relating to companies and unincorporated businesses (for non-portfolio holdings) • your trust interests and certain financial information relating to those trusts • an estimate of your household’s expenditure on goods and services • some further questions that seek to better understand the sources of economic income of high wealth New Zealanders (such as significant gifts and inheritances). Policy and Regulatory Stewardship Kaupapa me te Tiaki i ngā Ture 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Inheritances and gifts are the only category of information which require you to look at periods earlier than 2016 – 2021. These are a component of economic income but are received infrequently, which is why we ask for the information from a longer period. We realise that it may be difficult to provide fully accurate answers, so you are only required to estimate your gifts and inheritances (rounded to the nearest $1,000,000 per decade). We will not ask you to have your assets or entities independently valued. For the purposes of the project, we will be consistently applying our own valuation methodology. If we have sufficient information concerning your entities’ financial statements (from tax records) for us to undertake internal valuations of those entities, then we will not be seeking it again from you. However, if we have insufficient internal information on your entities, we may need to seek further information from you. We are currently assessing the completeness of the financial information for entities disclosed by you in the entity collection and will assess whether we need to request further financial information. If we do, it will be through a secondary targeted information request in July. We would seek information from you in the first instance but may need to request information from the entity in question if you do not have the information. Is it compulsory to provide information? It is compulsory for you to provide the information we ask for as the information is being requested under section 17GB(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (the Act). The consequences for non-compliance with section 17GB are the same as for other information- gathering powers, such as section 17B of the Act. Information collected under section 17GB(1) has specific statutory protections that prevent the Commissioner of Inland Revenue from using it in proceedings against you. The Commissioner has further decided that the information will not be used for any compliance purposes. Further, the information collected from you for this project will not be retained by Inland Revenue. While we understand you may not have all the information we ask for, you should try to answer the questions as fully and accurately as possible. You may ask your authorised tax agent to provide the information on your behalf. How will privacy and confidentiality be protected? We will ensure the privacy and confidentiality of all the information we collect is protected, and we will not use your information for other Inland Revenue purposes.

Ngā mōhiohio me pūrongo rawa Information that must be reported
==============================================================

Online marketplaces must report information about reportable sellers and themselves. They will need to contact sellers to collect some of this information.

Who are sellers?
----------------

A reportable seller is someone who registers with an online marketplace to offer [relevant services](/api/glossary/item?id={D8C83DF3-A74D-4BE1-80CC-25885ADB9BA4})
. They do not have to be actively selling on the online marketplace. Sellers may be individuals or entities (organisations).

### Active sellers

Active sellers provide relevant services during 1 January to 31 December in any year, or they receive income from relevant services in that time.

### Excluded sellers

Providers of relevant services excluded from the reporting requirements include:

*   businesses that have listed more than 2,000 nights of accommodation in a 12-month period
*   a listed company selling on the online marketplace.

Seller information to report
----------------------------

For each reportable seller, the online marketplace must report the following details:

Sellers who are individuals (sole traders):

*   first name and last name
*   primary address
*   jurisdictions the seller is resident
*   tax identification number (TIN) issued to them, for example an IRD number for New Zealand tax residents, and the jurisdiction that issued it
*   date of birth.

Sellers who are entities (organisations):

*   legal name
*   primary address
*   jurisdictions the seller is resident
*   tax identification number (TIN) issued to them, for example an IRD number for New Zealand tax residents, and the jurisdiction that issued it
*   business registration number, for example an NZBN for New Zealand companies.

Immovable property information to report
----------------------------------------

For both types of sellers, online marketplaces must report the following information for each immovable property that is used as a relevant service:

*   address of each property listing 
*   land registration number (if known)
*   number of days each property listing was rented during the calendar year
*   the type of each property listing using the categories in the XML schema (if known).

Activities and seller income to report
--------------------------------------

Online marketplaces must report on the following for each reportable seller and immovable property:

*   total seller's income or [consideration](/api/glossary/item?id={5686D331-C200-451B-8BD5-0189F18799CA})
     paid or credited
*   number of relevant activities carried out to which that consideration relates
*   fees, commissions or taxes withheld or charged
*   financial account identifier (where available)
*   name of the holder of the financial account where the consideration is paid or credited.

This information must be reported for each quarter of the calendar year.

If multiple parties are jointly registered as sellers, the total consideration should be reported for each seller. If the online marketplace can reliably determine the amount attributable to each seller, only their amount should be reported.

### Sales of goods and personal services in a single transaction

If a transaction involves both the sale of goods and the provision of a personal service and both can be identified separately, then the personal service component should be reported.

Where they cannot be separately identified, then the entire transaction should be reported, unless the personal service component is ancillary to the non-reportable element.

Self-reporting requirements
---------------------------

Online marketplaces must report the following information about themselves:

*   their name
*   their registered office address
*   their TIN
*   business name for each platform for which the online marketplace is reporting.

Reporting on behalf of other online marketplaces
------------------------------------------------

An online marketplace can report the information on behalf of another online marketplace. If you’re not the reporting online marketplace, you will still need to register and file information identifying the online marketplace reporting on your behalf. Keep proof that the required information has been reported.

Reporting to sellers
--------------------

Online marketplaces must provide sellers with a copy of the information reported about them by 7 February.

Jurisdictions for due diligence and reporting
---------------------------------------------

[KiwiSaver](/new-legislation/act-articles/kiwisaver "KiwiSaver")

Initial and confirmed back-dated validation of invalid membership (section 18 and new section 59 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006)
===========================================================================================================================

2007 amendments to KiwiSaver cover initial and confirmed back-dated validation of invalid membership and insert new section 59.

Invalid KiwiSaver enrolments occur in a range of circumstances. This can happen, for example, when people join KiwiSaver who are not entitled to because they do not meet the residency requirements. Alternatively, they could be incorrectly automatically enrolled, perhaps because they are under 18 years of age or over the New Zealand superannuation qualification age. A new subpart 4 (sections 59A to 59D) has been added to Part 2 of the KiwiSaver Act (allocation of people to KiwiSaver Schemes) to provide rules for invalid KiwiSaver enrolments. The relevant sections are treated as coming into force on 1 July 2007.

Section 59A of the KiwiSaver Act describes the circumstances in which an enrolment is treated as invalid and to which the invalid enrolment rules apply. They are when:

*   a person does not meet the requirements of section 6 of the KiwiSaver Act - that is, at the time the person was automatically enrolled or opted in, he or she was not living or normally living in New Zealand [**15**](#15)
     and was not a NewZealand citizen or entitled in terms of the Immigration Act 1987 to be in New Zealand indefinitely; or
*   a person who does not meet the requirements of the automatic enrolment rules has been automatically enrolled - for example, when the person is less than 18 years of age or is a casual employee; or
*   a person who is not entitled to opt in to KiwiSaver does so - for example, because the person is over the New Zealand superannuation qualification age or is already a member of a KiwiSaver scheme.

New section 59B specifies that the Commissioner or the relevant provider must be notified of an invalid enrolment as soon as practicable after it is discovered. The section also provides that, for a period of time, providers are able to treat as valid enrolments that have been identified as invalid as far as the administration of the fund is concerned. The time period for initial back-dated validation begins on the earliest of:

*   the day the Act applied; or
*   the automatic enrolment rules applied; or
*   the opt-in rules applied to the person.

The time period ends on the earliest of:

*   three months after the mistake was discovered by the KiwiSaver provider; or
*   three months after the provider was notified by the Commissioner or other person; or
*   the day that the provider pays the member's accumulation to the Commissioner.

New section 59C allows validation of a member's enrolment by the end of the time period of initial back-dated validation provided in section 59B if the person meets the rules for membership. This means that individuals who subsequently meet the membership criteria will have their membership validated. For individuals who should not be subject to the automatic enrolment rules, enrolment will be validated if they do not opt out and they are eligible to be a member.

This section will apply if at the time during the period specified in new section 59B, persons are eligible to be a member because they meet the requirements of section 6 and are:

*   less than the New Zealand Superannuation qualification age (65 years of age); and
*   have not opted out under the opt-out provisions in section 18, which have been extended to include persons invalidly automatically enrolled - the invalid enrolment will be validated by the Commissioner and the Commissioner must notify the provider of this.

##### Example 4

Sam finished school when he was 17 and started working for a builder. His employer automatically enrolled him into KiwiSaver. Six months later Sam's KiwiSaver provider became aware of the fact that although he was now 18, at the time he was automatically enrolled, he was only 17 years old (and the automatic enrolment rules should not have applied to him), so he had been invalidly enrolled. Sam will be validated as a member and remain enrolled as the opt-out period has expired.

New section 59D contains the refund process that will apply if the time period of initial validation ends and confirmation of backdated validation under section 59C has not occurred. The section sets out what the provider and Commissioner must do.

The provider must pay the member's accumulation to the Commissioner and immediately provide the Commissioner with:

*   notice of the amount of the contributions received by the provider directly and when they were received;
*   the amount paid out under mortgage diversion and when paid; and
*   the amounts of any permitted withdrawals, when they were paid, their type and the amount of any Crown contribution in the permitted withdrawal.

The Commissioner must refund:

*   the person's contributions received by the provider, minus any Crown contribution (such as the member tax credit) and amounts diverted under mortgage diversion or paid out by the provider as a permitted withdrawal; plus
*   any amount held by the Commissioner (but not yet passed to the provider) net of interest.

The total amount of contributions refunded will include interest. Interest is calculated using the formula in section 87. For the purposes of the calculation of interest on refunds arising from invalid KiwiSaver enrolments, "interest period" is defined as beginning on the day the Commissioner or the provider received the contribution and ending on the day the Commissioner pays the refund.

Section 59(D)(4) provides that the refund is to be made to the person, the person's employer, the Crown or any other person that made the contribution. The Commissioner can make the refund in proportion to the best estimate of what they contributed, less amounts diverted under mortgage diversion or paid as a permitted withdrawal.

Section 59(D)(5) provides for the treatment of members' accumulated interest paid to the Commissioner by the provider and any contributions in the holding account. The money is treated as public money, and the Commissioner is required to pay it into the Crown Bank Account.

##### Example 5

After Kate completed her final year of school she started working at her local bakery over the summer before starting university. Kate's employer automatically enrolled her into KiwiSaver. Two months later, Kate became aware that she had been automatically enrolled. As she was only 17 years old (under the age of eligibility for KiwiSaver membership) the enrolment was invalid.

Kate had already turned 18 by the time she became aware that she had been invalidly enrolled. This meant her enrolment could be validated or Kate could choose to apply for opt-out under section 18 (the extension period). An opt-out has to be made in the period that ends three months after the date on which the Commissioner receives the first contribution for Kate.

* * *

**15** Excluding state services personnel serving outside New Zealand, employed on New Zealand terms and conditions and serving in a jurisdiction where offers of KiwiSaver scheme membership are lawful. Before the date of enactment, the requirement was that the member be personally present in New Zealand at the time of enrolment.

Inland Revenue considers updating farmhouse expenses rules
==========================================================

**14 October 2016**

Inland Revenue is looking to bring tax accounting practice regarding farmhouse expenses into line with the law. 

This is all part of a review of out-dated practices and policies. 

The practice of full-time farmers deducting 25% of farmhouse expenses without needing to provide evidence of their business use has been accepted by the department since the 1960s.

Farmers have also been able to deduct 100% of rates bills and interest costs on loans.

Inland Revenue Group Tax Counsel Graham Tubb said this has allowed some farmers to claim deductions for private spending.

Under proposals that go out for consultation today, the farmhouse adjustment will more strictly follow the law so farmers are treated like other businesses.

It’s suggested that farms, where the cost of the farmhouse is less than 20% of the total value of the farm, will still be able to claim a 100% deduction on interest costs.

However, deductions on rates related to the house and general farmhouse expenses would be at a new flat rate of 15% unless the taxpayer can provide evidence to substantiate a higher claim.

“It’s going to be generally business as usual for large farms except the automatic deduction will be based on 15% of farmhouse costs rather than the previous 25%.

“We see the proposed rule changes mostly affecting smaller operations or lifestyle blocks.

“These concessions have been able to be applied even in cases where farming isn’t the household’s main source of income and that’s not in keeping with the intent of the rule.

“Other industries have long had to provide evidence of business use when using their house for work purposes so it’s only fair and equitable that farming gets the same treatment.”

Where the cost of the farmhouse is valued at more than 20% of the total farm’s value, then deductions can only be claimed on expenses attributable to actual business use.

The rules would only affect farms being run by sole traders or in partnership. Those in trusts or companies are subject to different regimes.

“Business deductions certainly remain under these proposals but we’re looking to remove the practice of using the farm to claim for private spending.”

“We have already spoken with Federated Farmers and other industry groups in determining our revised position.  However, we look forward to receiving submissions from farmers and their accountants affected by the change.”

The changes will apply from the start of the 2017-18 year after submissions have been considered.

The consultation document can be read [online](https://www.ird.govt.nz/public-consultation/current/ "Items for public consultation")
 and the deadline for submissions is December 22.

1 Inland Revenue CRS validations (updated draft) Inland Revenue CRS validations (updated draft) From April 2018, New Zealand financial institutions with CRS obligations will register and report to Inland Revenue in myIR. Inland Revenue will be applying the Common Reporting Standard (CRS) validations outlined in this document when receiving CRS disclosures. Virus scan and security threats We will reject files containing viruses or security threats (such as hyperlinks, Java scripts and executable files). CRS schema We will reject files that do not conform to the CRS XSD schema. The CRS schema is available at www.oecd.org/tax/automatic-exchange/common-reporting-standard/ Latin Alphabet We will reject any files that contain characters which are not in the Latin alphabet. Maximum file size We will reject any files that exceed the maximum file size of 350mb (XML upload) or 1000 account records (Excel upload). Invalid sending company The SendingCompanyIN element should contain the IRD number or Customer Identifier for the entity who is submitting the information. This number will be validated against our system. The Sending Company will differ from the Reporting FI if the disclosure is submitted by a Trustee or Service Provider on behalf of the financial institution. Incorrect transmitting or receiving country The value in the TransmittingCountry and ReceivingCountry elements must be NZ. Missing contact information The Contact element must be completed with the contact details that Inland Revenue can use if they have any questions about the information provided. Missing or incorrect message reference IDs The MessageRefId element must be a unique value and must not match any previously submitted MessageRefId values. The MessageRefId value must be provided in the format \[Reporting FI IR number or Customer Identifier\].\[Unique ID\]. For example 123456789.00001 Mismatch between message type and document type indicators The MessageTypeIndic element must match the DocTypeIndic values used throughout the disclosure. For example, a MessageTypeIndic value of 'CRS701' (new data) must only be used with a DocTypeIndic value of 'OECD1' (new data). A MessageTypeIndic value of 'CRS702' (corrected data) must only be used with DocTypeIndic values of 'OECD0' (resent data), 'OECD2' (corrected data) or 'OECD3' (deleted data). Incorrect 'nil report' message type indicator A disclosure with a MessageTypeIndic value of 'CRS703' (no data to report) must not contain any AccountReport elements. June 2018 2 Inland Revenue CRS validations (updated draft) Corresponding message reference ID provided incorrectly The CorrMessageRefId element must not be used for CRS reporting. Reporting period The New Zealand reporting period will always end on the 31st March. Financial institution's residency country code The ReportingFI/ResCountryCode element value must be 'NZ'. Reporting group elements provided incorrectly Only one ReportingFI and ReportingGroup element can be provided in each disclosure. The Sponsor, Intermediary and PoolReport elements must not be used for CRS reporting. Missing or incorrect document reference IDs The DocRefId value must be provided in the format \[ReportingFI IRDNumber\].\[UniqueID\]. For example 123456789.00001. When a DocTypeIndic value of 'OECD1' (new data), 'OECD2' (corrected data) or 'OECD3' (deleted data) is used, then the associated DocRefId must be a unique value and must not match any previously submitted DocRefId values. When a DocTypeIndic value of 'OECD0' (resent data) is used, then the associated DocRefId must match to a DocRefId value in a previously-submitted disclosure. A DocTypeIndic value of 'OECD0' can only be used in the ReportingFI element. Missing or incorrect corresponding document reference IDs When a DocTypeIndic value of 'OECD2' (corrected data) or 'OECD3' (deleted data) is used, then the DocSpec must also contain a CorrDocRefId value. The CorrDocRefId value must match to a DocRefId value in a previously-submitted disclosure and must not have been used to correct a submitted record previously. When a DocTypeIndic value of 'OECD0' (resent data) or 'OECD1' (new data) is used, then the DocSpec must not contain any CorrDocRefId value. Mismatch between document type indicators The DocTypeIndic values used in the AccountReport element must not contradict the DocTypeIndic values used in the ReportingFI element. For example, a ReportingFI DocTypeIndic value of 'OECD0' (resent data) or 'OECD2' (corrected data) must only be used with AccountReport DocTypeIndic values of 'OECD2' (corrected data) or 'OECD3' (deleted data). A ReportingFI DocTypeIndic value of 'OECD1' (new data) must only be used with AccountReport DocTypeIndic values that are also 'OECD1'. A ReportingFI DocTypeIndic value of 'OECD3' (deleted data) must only be used with AccountReport DocTypeIndic values that are also 'OECD3'. Document type indicators used incorrectly When a DocTypeIndic value of 'OECD0' (resent data) or 'OECD3' (deleted data) is used, then none of the corresponding ReportingFI/AccountReport information should have changed from the previous record submitted. Conversely, if a DocTypeIndic value of 'OECD2' (corrected data) is used, then at least one of the ReportingFI/AccountReport element values should have changed from the previously submitted record. Incorrect name type The value 'OECD201' (SMFAliasOrOther) must not be used as a name type attribute. 3 Inland Revenue CRS validations (updated draft) Undocumented accounts reported incorrectly Undocumented accounts must be reported to Inland Revenue by using an individual ResCountryCode value of 'NZ' and an AccountNumber element's UndocumentedAccount attribute of 'TRUE'. The use of a UndocumentedAccount attribute of ‘TRUE’ without a ResCountryCode code value of ‘NZ’ will fail our validations. Undocumented accounts must only be reported for pre-existing individual accounts. Incorrect TIN If a TIN issued by attribute has a value of 'NZ', then the TIN must match to an IRD number within our system. Any TINs and INs that are provided must have an issuedBy attribute so that we know which jurisdiction to report the TIN or IN to. Incomplete address information When using the AddressFix element, the Street, City and Country information must be provided. When using the AddressFree element, the AddressFree and Country information must be provided. Nationality provided incorrectly The Nationality element must not be used for CRS reporting. Birth information provided incorrectly The BirthDate is the only sub-element within the BirthInfo element that may be provided for CRS reporting. The earliest BirthDate value that will be accepted is '1900-01-01'. Incorrect account number types When an account number type attribute is used, then this must match the account number format provided. For example, when the AccountNumber AcctNumberType attribute is 'OECD601' (IBAN), then the AccountNumber value should follow an IBAN format. When the AcctNumberType attribute is 'OECD603' (ISIN) then the AccountNumber value must meet the ISIN format. Reporting financial institution details The identification details for the reporting financial institution should match the details that Inland Revenue holds. The identification number provided must be their IRD number. The country of residence for a financial institution reporting to Inland Revenue must be NZ. Incorrect or missing controlling person information The controlling person element must only be provided when the account holder is an organisation with an AcctHolderType of 'CRS101' (passive NFE with one or more controlling persons). Incorrect account balance The account balance should always be greater than or equal to zero. If the account is closed and the AccountNumber element's ClosedAccount attribute is 'TRUE', then the account balance must be 0.00.

Inland Revenue Department Act 1974
==================================

Archived legislative commentary on the Inland Revenue Department Act 1974 from PIB vol 84 May 1975.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 84, May 1975

[More information about _Public Information Bulletins_.](/about/about-our-publications)

### Inland Revenue Department Act 1974

This Act is a consolidation and updating of the Inland Revenue Department Act 1952 and its amendments. It came into force on 1 January 1975. The new Act is split into three parts. The main features are summarised below.

### Part 1 - Inland Revenue Department

**Sections 3 - 12** provide for the continuation of the Inland Revenue Department and for the appointment of staff ranging from Commissioner of Inland Revenue to any other officer required for the day to day activities of the Department. Some changes of designation have been made. District Commissioners of Taxes and Stamp Duties are now known as "District Commissioners of Inland Revenue". Officers-in-Charge (at Te Aroha, Blenheim, Greymouth and Oamaru) are now known as "District Officers of Inland Revenue".

**Section 13** deals with the obligation of officers of the Department to maintain secrecy on all matters relating to the Inland Revenue Acts, such as the Income Tax Act, the Estate and Gift Duty Act, and the Accident Compensation Act and the New Zealand Superannuation Act.

An officer may only disclose information which comes to his knowledge if it is for the purpose of carrying into effect the powers, duties and functions imposed upon him under these acts.

**Sections 14 and 15** put a requirement of secrecy on various people who have been given information from the Inland Revenue Department. For example members or employees of the Accident Compensation Commission or New Zealand Superannuation Corporation.

**Sections 16 and 17** give the Commissioner and authorised officers power to carry out inspections of books and documents, and the right to require information to be given on request. These provisions are largely in the same form as previously.

**Section 20** provides that confidential information passing between legal practitioners and their clients for the purpose of obtaining legal advice is generally privileged from disclosure.

However details of investment income of solicitors' clients on the same general basis as is obtained from banks, financial organisations and companies is not so privileged.

### Part II - Taxation Review Authority

This provides for the replacement of the Board of Review as from 1 January 1975 by a one-man Taxation Review Authority.

The main features in Part II are -

*   The new Authority will hear the full range of tax and duty appeals that were dealt with by the Board of Review.
*   As with the Board of Review, the hearings are not open to the public and each party to an appeal will bear his own costs.
*   Any decision by an Authority is open to appeal to the Supreme Court on -
    *   a question of law irrespective of the amount of the tax or duty involved,
    *   a question of fact where the amount of tax or duty involved is $1,000 or more.

### Part III - Miscellaneous

The main provisions are -

*   Prescribing of offences under the Act and the appropriate penalties.
*   The power of the Governor General to make Orders in Council.
*   The official abolition of the Board of Review.

### Officers and Employees of Corporate Bodies

Section 2 inserts into the principal Act a new section 47A which provides that an officer or employee of a corporate body who is responsible for furnishing information to the Commissioner commits an offence if he or she fails to do so. The expression "officer" is defined, for the purposes of section 47A, in section 47A(1) as including:

1.  a director, or secretary or other statutory officer of the corporate body;
2.  a receiver or manager of any property of the corporate body;
3.  a liquidator of the corporate body.

Whether or not an officer or employee of a body corporate is responsible for furnishing information on behalf of that body is a question of fact which must be decided on the basis of the facts of each case.

The penalty for this new offence is provided in section 47B(3) of the principal Act.

### Penalties for offences

Section 3 gives effect to the Government's decision to increase the maximum penalties for offences against the Inland Revenue Department Act. The section also inserts into the principal Act a new section 47B which consolidates the penalties for all offences against the principal Act. The new penalties are set out in Appendix II of this Bulletin.

A feature of the new penalties is that the maximum penalties are increased for persons who have been convicted of an offence or offences against the principal Act on a previous occasion. It should be noted that the maximum penalty does not increase with each single offence committed. The increase in penalty occurs only on each occasion on which the person is convicted of one or more offences against the principal Act.

### Example

On a particular occasion a person is convicted of two separate offences for failure to supply information requested in terms of section 17 of the principal Act. As this is the first conviction the maximum penalties are:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Offence committed before 1 July 1986 | $25 for each day of default |
| Offence committed after 1 July 1986 | $2,000 and/or $50 for each day of default |

On a later occasion the same person is convicted of two further offences for failure to supply information requested under section 17. As it is the person's second conviction for offences committed against section 17 since 1 July 1986 the maximum penalty for each of the two later offences is $4,000 and/or $100 for each day of default. The maximum penalty for any subsequent conviction will be $6,000 and/or $150 for each day of default.

### Section 4 — Consequential Amendments

This section removes from the principal Act all other references to penalties as a consequence of the penalties for offences all being consolidated in the new section 47B.

Inland Revenue firmly focused on bright-line – Richard Owen
===========================================================

**19 September 2018**

Any suggestion that Inland Revenue has taken its eye off the ball when it comes to property investors is thoroughly misleading.

Just under 100 Inland Revenue compliance specialists are focussed on making sure property investors are aware of their tax obligations – including the bright-line test.

The Property Compliance Programme was first established back in 2008. Some big changes this year in the way we work saw many of the job titles changed but the focus has stayed the same.

Enforcing the bright-line rule is a priority among those working on property compliance and they’re following a comprehensive strategy designed both to help customers meet their obligations from the start and to catch the cases where no profit is declared from a sale.

We find that in the majority of cases our customers want to get their tax affairs properly in order. Inland Revenue compliance staff aim to make it as easy as possible for customers to comply by focusing on supporting them upfront, before issues arise, rather than just responding to non-compliance when it happens.

Unfortunately, there will still be some customers who ignore those messages and fail to comply. It’s highly likely those people will be picked up in our audit work, which is intensifying over the next year.

**Customer awareness**

The bright-line rules came into effect in October 2015 and we’re finding many customers remain unsure of their obligations. 

Awareness appears to be building all the time. Following the government’s decision to extend the bright-line period from two to five years, Inland Revenue ran social media promotions and newsletter drops pointing to updated information on our website. The marketing was specifically targeted so that customers with a property interest knew about the change.

During the month-long campaign our social media content reached over 200,000 people and approximately 40,000 people visited the bright-line campaign webpages, which has links to all the information they need to know.

**Focus areas**

Property speculation is a centre of attention, especially in and around new developments, infill housing, regional hot spots and properties that have been sold within a short duration. Additional revenue of $117 million was assessed in the 12 months to June 30 2018 as a result of audit activities on property compliance issues.

Bright-line, is of course, an area of particular focus and along with ongoing audit activity, data analytics techniques are being used to identify our bright-line cases early. This allows us to target our interventions to help our customers get it right from the start.

In 2017–18, over $7 million of Resident Land Withholding tax was deducted and paid from properties sold by overseas-based vendors who are subject to the bright-line test.

**Using real time data to help customers comply**

New processes have been developed to allow property transactions to be monitored in real time. This helps compliance staff develop an early reading of trends and hot spots so they can monitor and make initial judgements about whether a customer is complying with tax rules.

Data from Land Information New Zealand help us determine the amount of tax that’s likely to be due. This information is then used to remind property owners so they can understand what to put on their tax return.

The data also reveals the customers who have bought and sold residential properties within two years and have not claimed an exemption on the tax statement provided with the sale. Again, contact is made with these customers to discuss their filing requirements so that they comply with the bright-line obligations voluntarily.

Bringing in the tax revenue from a property transaction is a long game. Depending on the point at which a property is sold, it can be up to three years before Inland Revenue receives the payment. Separating out the revenue that’s collected from a bright-line transaction is difficult to report as currently the taxpayer is only required to list it as amongst ‘other income’ on their tax return.

Compliance with the bright-line rules is improving all the time. We expect this to continue as more customers have greater certainty about their obligations and our property compliance specialists will remain on hand to help them get it right.

Inland Revenue focus on smaller liquor stores
=============================================

**18 June 2024**

Inland Revenue has released insights from its first round of a hidden economy campaign, focused on smaller liquor outlets around the country.  
  
The number of off-licence liquor stores has grown rapidly since 2020 and now sits at about three thousand.   
  
In 2020 the data for these businesses showed:   
\- Total sales =$1.95b;   
\- Taxable profits = $34.7m;   
\- Income tax paid = $11.4m;   
\- $29.4m GST collected.   
  
**The first stage**

In the first stage of this campaign, compliance staff made 220 unannounced visits nationwide, looking for signs of issues such as income suppression, unreported sales, and non-registered staff.  
  
Most of the businesses visited had their tax affairs in order. Unfortunately, we also found businesses that didn’t.  
  
**Insights and Findings**  
  
Inland Revenue wants to learn more about the sector and to improve voluntary compliance. We want to make sure liquor store owners are meeting their employee tax obligations.  
  
During the visits we found more than 100 employees who had PAYE deducted from their wages but none of that had come to IR.  
  
We’ve started investigations because of our visits and 9 outlets have been referred for audit. We’re disappointed that these business owners appeared to be undermining other good businesses by not paying their fair share.   
  
Insights gained from the visits show there are migrant exploitation issues with under the table wages paid and the use of migrant/familial labour who were not registered as workers. There was evidence of poor employee relations in some cases.  
  
There are also high levels of unreported cash sales and poor record-keeping.  
  
Other findings from the campaign included:  
\- Companies with multiple family members and changes of ownership demonstrated less clear money trails.  
\- Some directors appeared to be in name-only, with minimal knowledge of the business or their director responsibilities.  
  
**More to come**  
  
This was a deliberate light touch campaign and only the beginning of a wider look into smaller liquor stores nationwide and how they operate.  
  
More unannounced visits to businesses whose tax affairs may be out of order will be made as IR steps up its compliance work.  
  
To ensure there is a level playing field for all smaller liquor outlets, Inland Revenue will be closely watching these stores over the next 12 months.  
  
Information to help business owners is available at [Getting it right (ird.govt.nz)](https://www.ird.govt.nz/getting-it-right)

Inland Revenue funding used to support compliance
=================================================

**12 July 2024**

Inland Revenue (IR) has outlined how it will be using the $29 million allocated for compliance in this year’s Budget, targeting those people who - due to challenging circumstances or a deliberate decision - have not met their tax obligations.  
  
The Commissioner of Inland Revenue, Peter Mersi, says most people do the right thing.  
  
“About 90% of our customers have no tax debt, and they find meeting their obligations straight forward and easy.   
  
“We know some people have difficulties meeting their tax payments, and we want to help them get back to being fully contributing taxpayers. But for those who deliberately flout the rules, time is running out. We have the tools, data, and analytical capability to identify who is and who isn’t doing the right thing. The funding will mean we will have more people to be across all of these areas.

“We will also have additional people on board to investigate and undertake audits.   
  
“Debt has been rising.  COVID and the subsequent challenging economic conditions have been significant contributing factors, with some businesses suffering cash flow problems choosing to prioritise other payments over tax. But tax obligations must be met, in fairness to everyone.   
  
“So, we’re prioritising our compliance work to follow up outstanding returns, collect overdue debt, and prosecute taxpayers where necessary,” Peter Mersi says. “And of course, we’ll continue to offer help for people to get things right.  
  
**The work ahead**  
  
“We’ll be taking a closer look at a range of areas including the hidden economy, the retail sector and Trust compliance, as well as increasing our audit activity.  
  
“Inland Revenue will also work to reduce systemic risks in areas such as cryptocurrency, Electronic Sales Suppression Tools, organised crime and corporate restructures.  
  
“We plan to increase debt collection from overseas based student loan debtors and people who took out Small Business Cashflow Scheme loans,” Peter Mersi says.  
  
**For example**   
   
**Student loan** overdue debt is a key area of focus and where $4 million of the additional $29 million compliance funding will be used.   
  
Most customers with student loan debt in default are based overseas. Inland Revenue will be increasing compliance in this area, including a new campaign where we will be contacting those overseas based student loan borrowers who own property in New Zealand. If you’ve got an investment property here, you should be meeting your loan repayment obligations.  
  
After working closely with the **construction** industry in recent years to help people understand what they need to do, we'll be increasing our enforcement activity this year.   
  
We’ve been actively encouraging businesses in the construction sector to sort their tax affairs through our Tax Toolbox media campaigns. We’ve also started texting those with high debt to encourage them to get in touch about working things out.  
   
In the first week of July, we started unannounced visits to construction sites. Debt collection and audits are also now getting underway in earnest.   
   
The taxation of **multinationals** is a focus both within New Zealand and in other tax jurisdictions. For both multinationals and corporate restructures, tax issues are complex and the amounts at risk are large. Inland Revenue is therefore increasing audits of multinationals and corporate restructures.   
  
We know there are around 7 million **cryptoasset** transactions, worth nearly $8 billion, by 227,000 New Zealanders.   
  
We’re seeing significant under-reporting of income from some of these people.   
  
Inland Revenue will be progressively approaching these traders to let them know some of the information we have on their business and giving them a final chance to report their income.   
  
**What’s important now**  
  
Peter Mersi wants to “encourage people who have a tax debt to talk to us early to avoid harsher outcomes. 

“We have a range of options to support customers to get back on track and to meet their obligations. For example, people can set up instalment arrangements to pay off their debt over time in manageable amounts, reducing the likelihood of incurring late payment fees.   
  
“At the end of May this year there were just under 90,000 active arrangements across all tax types.   
  
“We also encourage voluntary disclosures. A voluntary disclosure is when a customer reaches out to Inland Revenue, letting us know they’ve made a mistake on their tax return before we find out in some other way,” Peter Mersi says.

Inland Revenue issues guidance on tax avoidance arrangements
============================================================

**01 September 2011**

Inland Revenue has issued a Revenue Alert outlining the circumstances in which diverting personal income into other business structures or entities in order to take advantage of lower tax rates can be considered tax avoidance.

Revenue Alerts are issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to provide information about significant or emerging tax planning issues.

Group Tax Counsel, Assurance, Graham Tubb, said that this Alert provides updated and expanded guidance on this issue following the recent Supreme Court decision in the Penny and Hooper case.

"The use of an incorporated business or one that is managed through a trust does not necessarily constitute tax avoidance. There are also often legitimate reasons why business owners retain a portion of the profits within the entity, such as capital expenditure, and Inland Revenue does not set a person's remuneration level."

"However, a person's income should properly reflect their contribution to a business and their tax liability should reflect their income,'' he said.

"We are focusing on cases where there are clear indicators that someone is deemed to be paying themselves an artificially low salary, and a substantial amount of their income is diverted into a structured arrangement delivering financial and tax benefits to themselves or their family."

"The indicators may involve the operating structure of a business, and whether ownership has been transferred. Other indicators may be profits distributed to other people or associated entities in an artificial or contrived manner, where the outcome of this arrangement is reduction of a person's tax liability."

Mr Tubb said income diversion arrangements can also enable people to reduce child support and student loan repayment obligations and gain Working for Families Tax Credits or student allowances benefits.

"Inland Revenue will continue to focus on more serious cases. Investigators are unlikely to review cases where at least 80% of business income was properly returned as individual income by the people who generated it from their own services.''

"We will look at all aspects of a person's income arrangement to determine whether there is a case of tax avoidance. People should contact their tax agent or advisor if they have any concerns or talk directly to Inland Revenue."

The Revenue Alert is available at [http://www.ird.govt.nz/technical-tax/revenue-alerts/revenue-alert-ra1102.html](technical-tax/revenue-alerts/revenue-alert-ra1102.html)

Inland Revenue issues Revenue Alert about offshore income
=========================================================

**12 October 2011**

Inland Revenue has issued a Revenue Alert advising New Zealand residents that they are required to declare all income from foreign sources.

Revenue Alerts are issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to provide information about significant or emerging tax planning issues.

Group Tax Counsel, Assurance, Graham Tubb said Inland Revenue was aware of New Zealand tax residents who may have taxable offshore income held in an offshore bank account, which is accessible in New Zealand, and this income may not be returned in New Zealand for income tax purposes.

He said that people who conceal income offshore are cheating other New Zealanders by not contributing their share of tax. "They do this by paying less income tax and child support, can decrease their student loan repayment obligation, and may claim a larger entitlement to Working for Families Tax Credit than they should."

"Some people hold credit or debit cards issued by a foreign bank and these cards are being serviced by funds held in an offshore bank account. The types of funds deposited into these bank accounts can include income paid by a non-resident employer, overseas life insurance policies, superannuation schemes, or equity investments held in portfolio accounts," he said.

Mr Tubb warned that if people deliberately divert income into an offshore bank account to evade or avoid the payment of tax, or to claim a greater amount of Working for Families Tax Credits, they may be committing criminal offences under the Tax Administration Act 1994.

"Inland Revenue is working in close collaboration with the revenue authorities of other countries to reduce the use of offshore bank accounts and offshore schemes to misrepresent income or assets and evade tax in this country. We have signed 18 tax information exchange agreements, with more under negotiation. These agreements give us access to key ownership and banking information," he said.

"Failure to declare offshore income or to make appropriate disclosures to Inland Revenue can attract serious penalties. Penalties may be reduced by making a voluntary disclosure.

"Any taxpayer who considers they may be at risk should consult a professional adviser and consider a voluntary disclosure before it is too late," said Mr Tubb.

Inland Revenue issues urgent email scam warning
===============================================

**25 August 2017**

Inland Revenue is warning people about a particularly sophisticated email tax scam circulating today.  
   
We have had around 120 calls in the last 12 hours about this and we are keen to prevent people being taken. So we are circulating the information as quickly and widely as possible. We would very much appreciate the media’s assistance in this.  
   
It is a phishing scam where people get an email that looks like it’s from Inland Revenue and also a form that looks very convincing. The email says the recipient has a tax refund waiting for them and that they need to update their financial information in order to receive their refund.  
   
The email address appears as “Inland Revenue Department” but is actually sent from [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#420b10063a3a3a3a3a0231736c2c38306c3027342b2735)
. The address is false, but looks convincing to the layperson’s eye.  
   
A form comes as an attachment called TaxReturn.HTM. Again it looks convincing but is fake and designed to collect personal and credit card data.  
   
Inland Revenue urges recipients not to open the attachment.  
   
If you have clicked on the form and submitted any personal or credit card data please contact your bank immediately.  We also recommend you contact IDcare ([http://www.idcare.org](http://www.idcare.org)
 or phone 0800 201 415).

Inland Revenue launches Changing For You campaign
=================================================

**12 August 2016**

Inland Revenue has launched an advertising campaign aimed at helping small businesses understand how possible changes to the tax system may affect them, and giving them the opportunity to have their say.

The campaign, called Changing for You comprises press, online and radio advertising, all of which links to a website containing videos about the possible changes, and a channel for comment.

Inland Revenue marketing and communications manager, Andrew Stott, said it was very important for the Department to give its customers every opportunity to see how dealing with tax might change in the coming months and years.

“These will be the biggest changes for a generation and affect every business. For example, how easy it is to set up a business, file returns, and employ staff.

“When you’ve already entered information into your accounting system, why should you need to enter it again for us?  If we already know the right tax code for your employees, why should you have to worry about them getting it wrong?  If you’ve made a mistake in your returns, why can’t you just fix that online?

“These are all areas the changes will address,” he said.

Mr Stott said the Government was already running an effective series of consultations around the policy and law changes being planned to make IR’s transformation possible – under the Making Tax Simpler banner.

“But Changing for You is more about the coalface, what might change in the day-to-day life of business owners.  It complements the policy consultation,” he said.

Mr Stott said Inland Revenue had invested $600,000 in producing and placing the ads across press, online and radio.

“That’s less than one dollar for every person registered for GST in this country. So given the importance and scale of the changes, we think it’s money well spent.

“And in terms of measures of success, we’ll be looking at awareness of the campaign among small businesses, at levels of agreement with what we’re doing in asking for their input, and the number of visits to the Changing for You website.”

The advertisements run from today until the end of September. The [Changing for You website](http://www.changingforyou.ird.govt.nz "Changing for you website")
 will continue beyond that with updates as plans take further shape.

Inland Revenue launches public campaign to explain the biggest tax changes in a generation
==========================================================================================

**05 November 2018**

Today Inland Revenue kicks off a major public information campaign to tell New Zealanders what the biggest changes to the tax system in a generation will mean for them.

Almost every household and business will be affected and the campaign, including print, radio and online advertising, a website, and direct communications to wage and salary earners, will continue well into next year.

Inland Revenue Commissioner Naomi Ferguson says that, subject to Parliament passing all the necessary legislation, the April 2019 tax year will see a fundamental shift in the way New Zealanders interact with the revenue system.

“For the first time, automated tax assessments will see around 1.67 million New Zealanders get a tax refund paid straight into their bank account,” she said.

“About 720,000 of those people will not have had any recent contact with IR, some not for 20-years or more, so it may come as a surprise. That’s why we’re running this campaign – to make sure as many people as possible understand what’s happening.

“And of that 720,000 about 530,000 will be beneficiaries and people who earn less than the minimum wage and have never applied for a tax refund before.

Ms Ferguson said more than 330,000 Working for Families customers would benefit from the new process with IR getting their wage and salary information immediately, allowing IR to adjust payments so customers are always getting the right amount.

“So much of this automation is made possible by the new payday filing process where IR will get your payroll information on your paydays instead of employers having to do a separate report to us once a month. Payday filing is mandatory from 1 April and many have started already. 

“And for investments, the new system will see dividend and interest payments reported to IR more frequently by the banks and others who make the payments, so that taxpayers receiving them don’t have to,” said Ms  Ferguson.

\[embed width="480" height="270" class="leftAlone" thumbnail="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qiRGB4n-Ovk/hqdefault.jpg?r"\]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiRGB4n-Ovk\[/embed\]

Ms Ferguson said that despite a lot of change being introduced, most people would pay and receive the right amounts during the year without having to do anything. “That’s the point of all these changes,” she said, “to make tax easier and more accurate for New Zealanders.

“Come the April 2019 tax year our transformation process will see the ‘big ticket’ items -  GST, provisional tax, income tax, Working for Families and investment, all on the new system.

“The next steps, in the coming two to three, years will see child support, student loans and Kiwisaver bought in as well. We’ve made a lot of progress and will continue to do so.”

Inland Revenue looks at ‘donation’ payments made to a handful of private schools
================================================================================

**23 May 2014**

Inland Revenue has issued a Revenue Alert regarding payments being made to a small number of private schools and private childcare centres. The payments are being re-characterised as donations to charitable trusts, enabling people to make false claims for donations tax credits.

This issue applies to a very small number of private schools and private early childhood care/education facilities, Inland Revenue Group Tax Counsel, Graham Tubb said today.

“This is not about donations paid to state or integrated schools,” he said. “The large majority of people and organisations do the right thing in regard to making donations and claiming tax credits.

“But Inland Revenue is aware of cases where fees paid to private education centres or the charitable trust that owns them, are being characterised incorrectly as donations or gifts.

“A payment of five dollars or more to a charity qualifies for a donation tax credit, but it must be made voluntarily, benefit the particular charity, and provide no material benefit in return.

“The Commissioner’s view of the arrangements identified so far is that such payments are not a gift or a donation. They are a fee that parents or caregivers pay for receiving education or childcare services and the centres often rely on these fees to meet their business costs.”

Mr Tubb said the payments are incorrectly described as donations in order to allow those paying them to claim a donations tax rebate to which they may not be entitled. 

Another outcome of such an arrangement is that the educational centre does not return the GST on the fees.

“It is important that both parties involved in these arrangements understand the rules and that Inland Revenue will take action in cases where they have been broken.

“If a taxpayer has claimed donations tax credit, or taken a position which is incorrect for GST then that position should be corrected. Our message is that we encourage our customers to talk to us or their tax advisor if they are unsure of the rules or make a voluntary disclosure if required.  We have set up an email address -[\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4a182f3c0b262f383e0f2e3f292b3e232524092f243e382f390a23382e642d253c3e642430)
 – for  people to ask for donations tax credit claims to be changed so they can repay any over-claimed tax credits or for the education centres to make voluntary disclosures regarding any unpaid GST. ”

Inland Revenue moves to help investors get tax rate right
=========================================================

**19 June 2019**

Inland Revenue is moving to help make sure investors, including KiwiSavers, get on the correct prescribed investor tax rate (PIR).

Updated estimates show around 550,000 people have underpaid tax on their investments (including KiwiSaver) with an average of $80 to $90 owing per person for the 2019 tax year, says Inland Revenue deputy commissioner, Sharon Thompson.

“This suggests to us that people need support to make sure they choose the right PIR,” she said. “With our new system in place, we’re working on a range of initiatives to help them.”

“From mid-July 2019, we’ll begin proactively contacting customers who are on an incorrect PIR to let them know they need to change it to avoid paying too little or too much tax in the future. They can then contact their investment provider to change their rate.

“And in the future, we’ll contact customers during the year if we identify they are using an incorrect PIR. This will be an on-going process to ensure that customers can get things right from the start.

“Because our new system groups together all the income people have, including wage and salary and investments, we can now see if people are on the right investment tax rate relative to their income level.

“In the past our old system did not do this automatically and we relied on people and their investment providers to make sure they were on the right rate.”

Ms Thompson said IR estimated there were another 950,000 people on a PIR that was too high and had overpaid by an average of $44. Current legislation does not allow for refund of overpayment.

She reiterated Inland Revenue’s decision not to go back over previous years to reassess and recover investment tax that may have been under or over paid.

Ms Thompson said trying to go back over past years and determine incorrect payments based on wrong PIRs would have required significant work not just for Inland Revenue but for individual taxpayers and financial institutions.

“So we made a business decision to look forward and not go back. We’ll be working on how we help people to get their PIR right for the future rather than trying to identify errors people may have made in previous years.

“For the 2019 tax year, an estimated $42 million was overpaid. Current estimates show between $45 and $50 million of investment tax was underpaid, and that will be recovered,” she said.

“But these figures are changing as IR’s new system continues to receive information.”

Inland Revenue preparing for unprecedented demand
=================================================

**25 March 2019**

Inland Revenue is gearing up to take around 1.9 million calls between now and July – a 23 percent increase on the same period last year – as the modernisation of New Zealand’s tax system continues.

With the third stage of the process rolling out over Easter, Inland Revenue has brought in and trained more than 300 temporary workers to help cope with what will be an unprecedented demand, says Inland Revenue Deputy Commissioner Gaye Searancke.

“Our planning is all on track but we know it’s unlikely, given the scale of what we are doing, that we will get through this period without any problems or delays. But our goal is to keep them to a minimum.”

Inland Revenue has also taken action to improve online services in myIR. This followed issues customers experienced last year trying to log in and access the system.

An independent review has found nothing was fundamentally wrong with the technology but it did identify ways to fine tune and improve performance, and also make the service more resilient.

Ms Searancke says last year’s log-in issues can’t be repeated.

“myIR will undoubtedly be under more pressure this year but we have taken action to ensure it will perform better.

“There are a regular series of operational checkpoints in place to keep holding us to account. These help us measure progress and assess readiness, and we continue to pass them.

“No stone is being left unturned. We’ve worked through 90,000 test scenarios to check the system is up to the job our customers expect from it. That’s around 40,000 more than we did ahead of last year’s release.”

Extensive marketing and communications to explain the major changes coming in Release 3 are underway. “This will intensify over the coming weeks but we expect some customers still won’t understand what it all means for them and are likely to call us. That’s why we have more people on board to support our customers,” Ms Searancke says.

“These are the biggest changes to the tax system in a generation and most New Zealanders will benefit. We will receive more information earlier, which allows us to issue automated refunds and offer greater accuracy so fewer people are under or over paying tax.

“Payments, such as Working for Families will also be more accurate, meaning our customers will spend far less time and effort making sure we have the right information.

“These changes will be worth it and we appreciate everyone’s patience and support while we roll them out,” says Gaye Searancke.

Inland Revenue reminder about the end of cheques
================================================

**24 February 2020**

Inland Revenue is reminding customers it will no longer accept cheques from 1 March.

Along with the Accident Compensation Corporation, Kiwibank and New Zealand Post, Inland Revenue is calling time on cheques because of their rapidly declining use, the end of the cheque processing machine’s working life, and unsupported software.

Inland Revenue spokesperson Sharon Thompson says IR is increasingly digital in the way it works, and most customers already choose to pay their taxes electronically.  

“Cheques have been used over many years and we recognise this will be a significant change for some, and one that might take some adjustment. But it’s a change that has to be made,” Sharon Thompson says.

“Since 2016, cheque use generally in New Zealand has dropped by 50 per cent. At Inland Revenue, cheque volumes were rapidly declining year on year. Since our announcement in September 2019, the number of cheques received dropped immediately by 45 per cent.

“We’ve talked with organisations such as Citizens Advice bureau, Grey Power, Age Concern and other stakeholders.

“Inland Revenue has also developed an exception process for people who can’t use any of the available alternative payment options and requests for an exception are worked through on a case by case basis.

“To date we’ve received 160 requests for an exception.  We’ve granted 76 exceptions, turned down 22 (where an alternative payment method was available) with a further 62 to be processed. We hope to have these complete by the end of this week,” Sharon Thompson says.

“Our cheque processing technology is at the end of its life and replacing it, when cheque use is rapidly declining, isn’t a prudent use of taxpayer funds.

“The machine used to scan and process cheques will be decommissioned and IR is looking towards a future of not receiving or issuing any paper cheques,” Sharon Thompson says

”There are plenty of other payment options that are simpler, easier and safer. A myIR account lets you manage all your IR matters securely online.  You can use it to pay IR with a credit or debit card. You can also set up a direct debit to authorise IR to take payments from your nominated bank account.

“Banks also offer a wide range of payment options.  Westpac is still accepting over the counter payments - you don’t have to be a Westpac customer to do that. You will need a barcode however  so IR will be adding a barcode to all letters requesting payment.”

Inland Revenue reveals the numbers behind its huge technology transfer
======================================================================

**10 February 2017**

More than 17,300 customers have successfully used the new Inland Revenue GST system since it went live on Monday, with over 5,500 GST returns successfully processed and new GST registrations coming through also.

Around 240 people from IR and 23 other organisations worked round the clock for almost 100-hours over Waitangi weekend to install the new GST platform. In that time 8.5 million customer records had to be verified and migrated to the new system.

This represented $80 billion of payments history and $32 billion of disbursements.

Inland Revenue’s Deputy Commissioner Transformation, Greg James, says the scale of the effort was extraordinary and it was absolutely vital that it was successful.

“There were some minor hiccups of the kind that you can get with any technical change,” he says, “but it was a huge success and gives us real confidence for the coming stages of Inland Revenue’s transformation.

“More importantly, it’s a major step in making things simpler and easier for our customers."

More information about the improved GST services is available at [www.ird.govt.nz/mygst](www.ird.govt.nz/mygst)
. To find out more about Inland Revenue’s ideas on how tax could get easier for small businesses in the future, visit [www.changingforyou.ird.govt.nz](www.changingforyou.ird.govt.nz)
.

**Transformation by the numbers**

*   97.5 hours of work by 237 people from IR and 23 other organisations including Vodafone, Spark, ASB Bank, Westpac Bank, Accenture, FAST Enterprises, TIMG, XERO, MYOB, Deloitte, Genesys, Assurity, Unisys, Datacom and HPE.
*   More than 350 tasks completed including migrating and verifying:
    *   8.5 million customer records
    *   880,000 GST accounts
    *   8.1 million GST returns
    *   $80 billion of payments history
    *   $32 billion of disbursements history

On Tuesday we could:

*   Handle 115,000 logins to our online services (myIR) including 17,300 logins to the new GST functionality
*   Process 5,535 GST returns via our new online GST service
*   Complete 48 new GST registrations using our new online GST Service
*   Handle 2920 staff logging into the new system
*   Process 7,100 NZBN company record updates automatically meaning over 7,000 companies didn’t have to contact us to update their details
*   Allow 34 immigrants to apply online for IR numbers making their transition to a new country a little bit easier.

[Student Loan Scheme Amendment Act 2007](/new-legislation/act-articles/student-loan-scheme-amendment-act-2007 "Student Loan Scheme Amendment Act 2007")

Inland Revenue's access to Customs' arrival and departure information
=====================================================================

2007 legislation allows IR ad hoc access to any recording system used by Customs to store arrival or departure information.

##### Section 62B of the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 and sections 280G and 280I of the Customs and Excise Act 1996

Inland Revenue will have ad hoc access to any recording system used by Customs to store arrival or departure information.

### Background

Until this change was made, obtaining border-crossing movements of student loan borrowers on an ad hoc basis was a manual process.

### Key features

The Chief Executive of Customs will allow authorised Inland Revenue employees to access information stored in any recording system used by Customs to store arrival or departure information.

Inland Revenue will be able to access the recording system only for the purposes of helping determine which borrowers are eligible for the interest write-off that gives effect to interest-free loans, whether borrowers are based in New Zealand or overseas, are resident or non-resident, and whether they are in New Zealand. Inland Revenue will be required to maintain a record of each time the database is accessed to allow appropriate use of the database to be monitored.

Access to Customs' database will allow Inland Revenue to confirm borrowers' arrival and departure dates on an ad hoc basis - for example, if a borrower challenges the date that the information match shows that he or she left New Zealand. This access will eliminate the current manual process.

### Application date

The changes apply on or after 28 March 2007.

Inland Revenue's Public Rulings Unit
====================================

Article explains the types of advice or items provided by the Public Rulings Unit, how topics are selected and consulted on, and the Unit's role within IR.

This article first appeared in _Taxation Today_ (Issue 18, May 2009) and is reproduced here with the permission of the publisher.

### I. Introduction

The Public Rulings Unit is a division of the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel ("OCTC"), Inland Revenue. The Unit's key function is to determine and disseminate the Commissioner of Inland Revenue's position on various tax issues through the issuing of primarily binding public rulings, interpretation statements and interpretation guidelines. Before the Unit was established as a separate function in 1999, public advice work was provided by the other units making up the OCTC (then known as the Adjudication & Rulings business group). The Unit was established to provide a real focus on, and commitment to, the provision of public rulings and statements, given their important role in clarifying areas of uncertainty and fostering compliance. Since 1999, the Unit has generated many items on a wide range of taxation issues, ranging from, by way of example, the deductibility of feasibility studies expenditure, to whether an agreement for the sale and purchase of property is an "invoice" for GST purposes.[\[1\]](#01)
 These items are the result of significant research, legal analysis and consultative consideration - the overriding aim is to provide greater certainty for taxpayers and their advisors on difficult areas of taxation law and sometimes on general areas of law that impact on taxation outcomes (for example, trust law and company law).

This article explains the types of public advice (referred to in this article as "public items") provided by the Unit, who makes up the Unit, how topics are selected and consulted on, the future of the Unit and its role within Inland Revenue.

### II. Public Items

Public items produced by the Unit currently take four forms:

*   binding public rulings
*   interpretation statements or guidelines
*   "questions we've been asked"[\[2\]](#02)
    
*   various statutory determinations.[\[3\]](#03)
    

#### 1\. Public rulings

A public ruling is an interpretation issued by Inland Revenue to show how a taxation law applies to taxpayers and specific types of arrangements. Taxpayers whose circumstances match those in a ruling may apply it, but are not obliged to do so. A public ruling will relate to a particular arrangement or situation, and will normally only apply for a specified period. It is also important to note that a public ruling is binding on the Commissioner. Therefore, if a taxpayer calculates their tax liability according to an applicable public binding ruling, and the facts of the taxpayer's arrangement are not materially different from the ruling, the Commissioner must assess according to that ruling. For this reason, binding public rulings are the most valuable form of advice provided by Inland Revenue. No other form of advice, written or verbal is strictly binding on the Commissioner. For that reason, it is perhaps worthwhile briefly setting out the statutory framework for binding rulings.

Public rulings are issued by the Commissioner[\[4\]](#04)
 pursuant to Part VA of the Tax Administration Act 1994.[\[5\]](#04)
 Section 91A sets out the purpose of the regime:

*   to provide taxpayers with certainty about the way the Commissioner will apply taxation laws; and
*   help them to meet their obligations under those laws -

by enabling the Commissioner to issue rulings that will bind the Commissioner on the application of those laws.

The section goes on to state: "\[t\]he Part also recognises the importance of collecting the taxes imposed by Parliament and the need for full and accurate disclosure by taxpayers who seek to obtain binding rulings".[\[6\]](#06)

The Commissioner may make at any time a public ruling on how a taxation law applies in relation to any type of person and any type of arrangement[\[7\]](#07)
 The term "taxation law" is a defined one[\[8\]](#08)
, but essentially includes most provisions of the Income Tax Act 2007[\[9\]](#09)
, the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985[\[10\]](#10)
, and the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968. However, the Commissioner cannot issue binding rulings on Inland Revenue's rights or obligations to exercise powers regarding the administration of the tax system. This includes imposing or remitting penalties, inquiries into the correctness of returns or information supplied to it, prosecution, or debt recovery.[\[11\]](#11)

To be a public ruling, the item must contain certain prescribed elements. It must state:

*   that it is a public ruling made under section 91D; and
*   the taxation law or laws on which it is a ruling; and
*   the arrangement to which it applies; and
*   how the taxation law or laws apply to the arrangement; and
*   either the period or tax year for which the ruling applies or, in the case of a ruling issued for an indefinite period, the date or tax year from which the ruling applies.

In this way, a public ruling can be easily identified as such, and distinguished from other written advice provided by Inland Revenue. The making of a public ruling must be gazetted and published[\[12\]](#12)
 It is Inland Revenue's practice to publish public rulings in its monthly _Taxation Information Bulletin_ and on its website.[\[13\]](#13)

Public rulings are only binding on the Commissioner, and not taxpayers. If a public ruling on a taxation law applies to a person and their arrangement, and **the person applies the taxation law in the way stated in the ruling**, the Commissioner must apply the ruling[\[14\]](#14)
 for the period or tax year for which the ruling applies, or in the case of a ruling issued for an indefinite period, indefinitely[\[15\]](#15)
. However, to reflect the fact that rulings are not intended to be binding on taxpayers, this will not be the case where a taxpayer has issued the Commissioner with a notice of proposed adjustment to change the effect of a ruling previously applied by the taxpayer.[\[16\]](#16)

The Commissioner may at any time withdraw a public ruling, but must notify the withdrawal by giving adequate notice in the Gazette. If the Commissioner withdraws a public ruling, the ruling does not apply to any arrangement entered into after the date of the withdrawal. However, the ruling continues to apply to any arrangements to which it previously applied that were entered into before the date of withdrawal for the remainder of the period or tax year specified in the ruling or, in the case of a ruling issued for an indefinite period, for three years after the date of withdrawal.[\[17\]](#17)
 To date there has only been one withdrawal of a public ruling.[\[18\]](#18)

Finally, a binding ruling does not apply from the date a taxation law which is the subject of the ruling is repealed or amended, to the extent the repeal or amendment changes the way the taxation law applies in the ruling.[\[19\]](#19)

As noted previously, public rulings may be issued for a stipulated period, or number of taxation years, or indefinitely. There is no guidance in the legislation as to how long such a period should be, or for how many taxation years, or in what circumstances the Commissioner should issue an indefinite ruling. It has become Inland Revenue's administrative practice generally to issue a ruling for the first time for a period of three calendar or tax years and any second "reissue" for five calendar or tax years. The practice for any subsequent reissue, assuming the law is now quite settled and no substantial changes had to be made when re-considering the issues, is to issue for an indefinite period. In this way the Commissioner can best ensure that rulings are current, comprehensive and accurate. In the case of indefinite rulings, over time the possibility of a law change eroding the application of a binding ruling becomes greater. As an administrative matter, indefinite rulings are reviewed periodically, subject to resources, but Inland Revenue, taxpayers and their advisers' always need to be mindful of the potential overriding effect of subsequent repeals and amendments.

Another administrative practice adopted in relation to each public ruling is to append a quite detailed commentary. The objective is to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in the ruling. Such commentaries are not however binding.

#### 2\. Interpretation statements and interpretation guidelines

An interpretation statement sets out the Commissioner's view on taxation laws in a particular situation or in relation to a certain set of circumstances. It is used where a public ruling cannot be issued or is not considered appropriate (for example where an arrangement cannot be identified or established, as would be required for a public ruling). Effort is made to ensure that an issue is dealt with wherever possible as a binding ruling. However, in some cases it is considered that a more general discussion of the law, its interpretation and scope in an interpretation statement format would be more useful for taxpayers and their advisors.[\[20\]](#20)

An interpretation guideline discusses the Commissioner's approach to the interpretation of areas of law that have tax implications. Interpretation guidelines tend to be more extensive in their length and scope than an interpretation statement, eg, past topics have included guidance on the deductibility of interest on money borrowed. Interpretation statements and guidelines are not binding on the Commissioner.

#### 3\. "Questions we've been asked"

"Questions we've been asked" (QWBAs) are published items setting out the answers to enquiries Inland Revenue has received about specific tax issues, which may be of general interest to taxpayers. These items are normally the shortest of the three types of interpretative item, and generally address specific questions relating to less complex or contentious issues and legislation. They contain less technical analysis when published than other public items, and are not binding on the Commissioner.

#### 4\. Statutory determinations

Until quite recently the Public Rulings Unit was also responsible for issuing general, provisional and special depreciation determinations. It is still responsible for several livestock determinations[\[21\]](#21)
, but it is envisaged that these will be handled by Service Delivery in the 09/10 income year and following. The devolvement of the making of these determinations reflects that these functions are better handled by the operational area of Inland Revenue, rather than OCTC with its interpretative focus.

### III. The Public Rulings Unit

#### The composition of the Unit

As mentioned, the Public Rulings Unit sits within the OCTC - a separate business group within Inland Revenue led by Inland Revenue's Chief Tax Counsel. The Unit is a small one - currently comprising a Director, and three managers - all qualified lawyers and/or accountants and ten analysts - all legally trained and/or having significant taxation experience. The Unit also includes a programme coordinator, who is responsible for a range of functions within the Unit, including the project management aspects of the technical work programme, and continuous improvement of processes.

Public items take the form of projects that are assigned to teams within the Public Rulings Unit depending on their priority. Each team consists of an analyst, a manager, and the Director, Public Rulings or the Chief Tax Counsel, whose role is to sign off the project once complete. These teams are responsible for carrying out the necessary research and analysis which supports and ultimately results in the public item.

The role of programme co-ordinator was created in 2008. The programme co-ordinator plays a critical role in ensuring the delivery of the technical work programme, through managing the programme and providing the Director with regular reporting on delivery progress and performance. The creation of this role reflects the Unit's commitment to adopting sound project planning methodologies to ensure it meets its delivery obligations. The programme co-ordinator also champions continuous improvement of processes and internal and external relationships.

The public rulings process is centralised within the Public Rulings Unit. No other area within Inland Revenue has the delegated authority to make public rulings, which helps to maintain quality and consistency of the rulings process and items produced. The Unit is also the only area producing purely interpretative statements, guidelines and QWBAs.[\[22\]](#22)

### Other areas of Inland Revenue

The Unit works closely with many other areas of Inland Revenue, but in particular the Policy Advice Division (PAD) and the Technical Standards group within Service Delivery.

From time to time, the interpretative work undertaken by the Unit results in referrals of issues to PAD for legislative amendment. This can arise where it is thought that a purely interpretative response is unlikely to lead to a workable situation for taxpayers, and/or where the interpretative outcome is not aligned with the original intended policy aim. When this does occur, the Unit's work is often very useful to the legislative drafters in terms of providing a better understanding of the existing statutory position, and the background to and pressure points surrounding the issue.

The Public Rulings Unit also works closely with Service Delivery's Technical Standards area. Many issues addressed by the Unit will have operational implications - in terms of their day to day implementation, application dates and transitional issues, where there has been a change in view from an existing position or practice. The Unit consults with Technical Standards through the development of a public item to ensure that these issues have also been addressed and communicated effectively.

### IV. Process

#### How are the topics for public items selected?

Suggestions for potential topics come from a wide range of sources, including taxpayers, various professional and industry bodies, and accounting and legal firms and from other areas of Inland Revenue. Additionally issues are sometimes highlighted in the course of other projects undertaken within OCTC (eg, a taxpayer adjudication where legislative uncertainties have been identified, or issues raised during the course of a private binding ruling).

Until the 08/09 financial year, the priority to be given to an identified issue and the type of item that would be published was decided at a regular meeting of the Public Items Panel (PIP). The panel was made up of the Director, Public Rulings, Unit managers, and representatives from Inland Revenue's Policy Advice and Technical Standards groups. Each item was given priority based on a number of factors including: the importance of the issues involved, the level of uncertainty/ambiguity, the number of taxpayers potentially affected and the potential revenue implications. Each item was then placed on a waitlist to be allocated in due course to a project team, as resources permitted.

However, over time it had been found that this approach could lead to inefficiencies - not least of all being slowness to react to current issues, an inability to assess the importance of projects currently being worked on against new ones arriving at any point in time, and effectively no input from anyone external to Inland Revenue.

With these considerations in mind a different approach has been adopted for the 08/09 financial year. In July 2008 an assessment was made of all public advice work on hand and on the Unit's waitlist. Criteria similar to those referred to above (as applied by PIP) were applied and a list of potential projects was drawn up. This list was then circulated within Inland Revenue and refined. Following this, the list was provided to the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Taxation Committee of the New Zealand Law Society for comment and input.

This has resulted in a programme of priority work (work programme) for the 08/09 financial year. This has the advantage of permitting the Unit to plan in advance its work commitments and better ensure that it produces timely and relevant items. However, if other issues subsequently arise, there is some flexibility for the Unit to re-prioritise its work programme to include such issues, in preference to existing topics. It is intended to repeat the process for the 09/10 financial year with the aim of seeking input earlier than July 09 if possible.

Although available to some of the Unit's key stakeholders, currently the work programme is not widely published. However, the aim is to publish once the setting of the work programme process has bedded down, hopefully in the 09/10 year.[\[23\]](#23)

#### How are public items consulted on?

Once an initial draft public item of any type has been prepared, it is generally consulted on internally within Inland Revenue, and then externally with the general public, representative bodies in the accounting and taxation industry, and other interested parties.

The internal consultation period typically lasts a minimum of four weeks. Standard internal Inland Revenue commentators are the Policy Advice Division, various Legal and Technical Support groups, Litigation Management, Technical Standards, and the Large Enterprises unit.

Submissions received are carefully considered and the item modified accordingly. Once signed off, the revised item is then circulated to the Minister of Revenue, Treasury and Inland Revenue's senior management team prior to its release for external comment.

The external consultation period generally runs for a minimum of six weeks[\[24\]](#24)
, and is conducted by publishing notification of the draft item in the _Tax Information Bulletin_ and electronically notifying a large number of standing commentators (approximately 900 at present), again made up predominantly of professional bodies, accounting and law firms, the major law publishers and tax agents and advisers. Contact is also made with relevant industry groups during the draft creation and consultation process, where applicable.

Once the consultation period is over, submissions are considered by the team and changes made if appropriate, before a final item is produced and published. In cases where submissions have led to a change in view or significant rework, further consultation will be sought with regard to the item to ensure that all stakeholders have sufficient opportunity to make further comments before finalisation. This can extend the time taken to produce a public item, but it is considered warranted given the potential importance of many of the areas addressed in items and the desire to ensure items are as correct and comprehensive as possible to better ensure their endurance and usefulness over time. The Unit considers consultation a key part of the development of an item. Accordingly, all comments are fairly and completely considered. In some cases, where a view submitted is considered but ultimately not followed, this may result in an item including an "alternative arguments" section to explain opposing views and why they have not been thought to be ultimately persuasive.

Once an item is finalised, each submitter receives a letter thanking them for their submission and setting out how their submission has been taken into account.

#### How are public items made public?

The main method of publication of finalised public items is the monthly _Tax Information Bulletin_ (TIB), an Inland Revenue publication comprising various rulings, guidelines, case notes, policy statements, and determinations. This is sent to approximately 4,700 subscribers, mostly tax practitioners and professionals, and is available to any member of the public on request.

The TIB is also available on the Inland Revenue website.[\[25\]](#25)
 Any member of the public can email Inland Revenue to be placed on a list of subscribers who receive regular notification when a new TIB is available. At present there are approximately 5,800 subscribers.

The Public Rulings Unit also publishes its items online, on an internal site as part of the Inland Revenue intranet, and on a specific part of the Inland Revenue website dedicated to public items. At the same time an electronic copy of the item is sent via a group email to just over 100 contacts who have previously requested to be specifically notified, such as New Zealand's major accounting firms, the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, and the New Zealand Law Society. Soft copies are also provided to law publishers, for further dissemination through their usual publication channels.

In the case of public rulings and determinations, a further method of publication is the _New Zealand Gazette_, a government publication produced weekly by the Department of Internal Affairs. This is part of Inland Revenue's legislative requirements when making public rulings and determinations. A short notification, including the legislative basis of the ruling, is published.

#### How many public items are issued each year?

The number of public items issued by the Public Rulings Unit can vary somewhat depending on demand and available resources. From soon after the establishment of the binding rulings system in 1995 through to the present, the focus has been on identifying and clarifying more difficult and/or important issues, rather than aiming to produce large numbers of less difficult and/or important issues. The complexity of the issues addressed has often meant that projects are substantial and contentious and give rise to the need for extensive consultation (and in some cases, re-consultation) before being able to be finalised.

The Public Rulings Unit is expected, under its external performance standards, to finalise 30 - 50 public items a year (including determinations). The following table shows the numbers and types of items issued in the financial years 2000/01 - 2007/08.

#### What are the time frames for providing public items?

A project plan is created at the start of every project with an initial timeframe depending on the complexity and background of the project, and the experience and resources of the team. Given the diverse nature of the projects, there are currently no standard timeframes laid down for public items. Projects can range anywhere from two to three months (eg, a re-issue of a previously issued public ruling with minimal new work required) to over a year, bearing in mind this includes various consultation periods.

The timeframes for projects can expand or contract depending on the number and nature of submissions received once the first draft has been published. The Unit is aware of the need to take into account considerations of timeliness and efficiency while ensuring a result of the highest possible quality. As noted above, in some cases consultation can result in an item needing to be re-consulted to ensure changes made can be adequately considered by interested parties. This inevitably extends out the time taken to complete an item and can result, in some cases, in items taking many years to complete. The Unit is highly aware of the need for items to be finalised in the shortest time possible - so as to be of the greatest usefulness to taxpayers and their advisers - but this cannot be at the expense of the robustness of the item and the need to ensure all views are considered comprehensively.

### V. The future

The Public Rulings Unit has been in existence for 10 years. The Unit continues to strive to reduce the time it takes to produce high quality and relevant interpretative advice, with somewhat limited resources. An ongoing challenge for the Public Rulings Unit - as for many in the taxation profession - is to recruit and retain suitably qualified and experienced staff to best perform its role as the provider of such advice.

#### Customer survey

In early 2009 the Unit undertook a customer survey seeking to better understand the needs of those who use and/or provide comment on public items. At the time of writing the results from the survey are still being considered.[\[26\]](#26)
 Findings from the survey will be used to modify and improve services for the 09/10 financial year and beyond. It is envisaged that the results from this survey, and related recommendations for process improvements, will be made available shortly. However, some ideas for enhancements to the Unit's service are set out below.

#### Stakeholder relationships/communication

The Unit continues to seek to strengthen its relationship with key stakeholders, including the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, and the Taxation Committee of the Law Society, and their members. As noted above, where possible the Unit plans to increase the involvement of such stakeholders in the selection and prioritisation of its work programme.

Focus is also being given to involving such bodies and, where applicable, industry groups, earlier in the preparation of items.

In addition, the Unit will introduce an online customer feedback service in respect of each of its public items as another avenue for interested parties to provide feedback on an ongoing basis.[\[27\]](#27)

Consideration is also being given to making publicly available a summary of the key submissions received on an item during the consultation phase, and the response to those submissions, so this information is widely available after an item is finalised. This would be done in such a way as to ensure submitters' anonymity.

#### Process enhancements

Further consideration is being given to the Unit's internal practices to streamline workflows. In particular, moving away from the routine use of detailed reports supporting the conclusions made in public items and adopting different practices based on the complexity of the issues so as to improve timeliness, without compromising quality. It is envisaged that the Unit will also shortly move to adopting timeliness standards based on the type and complexity of public item. Expected timeframes for delivery of drafts and finalised items would then be published with the work programme.

### VI. Conclusion

The Public Rulings Unit's work within OCTC has the potential to assist a large number of taxpayers and their advisors to comply with their tax obligations. However, the ongoing challenge is to ensure that advice is available as promptly as possible, while maintaining the highest quality through a transparent and comprehensive consultative process. The challenge of producing accurate, relevant and timely tax technical public advice through the production of the Commissioner's public rulings and interpretative statements is unlikely to become any easier in the future, but the need remains for this service to assist in providing taxpayers and their advisors with certainty as to their obligations.

2 As the name suggests, literally questions asked of the Commissioner which are generally able to be answered in a succinct manner.

3 From 1 July 2008 the Public Rulings Unit no longer is responsible for the issuing of depreciation determinations. They are now dealt with by the Technical Standards group, which is part of the Service Delivery operational area of Inland Revenue.

5 The binding rulings regime also provides for the issuing of private and product rulings, which unlike public rulings are provided to a specific taxpayer or class of taxpayers, or relate to a specified product.

The Commissioner's usual practice is to apply binding public rulings prospectively where his view of the law has altered. For this reason, BR Pub 00/09 was withdrawn and a new public binding ruling, BR Pub 00/11, issued with a new application period.

19 Section 91G TAA 1994

Inland Revenue stops using custom audience lists
================================================

**04 November 2024**

Inland Revenue has announced it will stop the use of custom audience lists due to public concern.

Here is what the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, Peter Mersi, said at a media briefing today.

"In the course of our work, we are required to make every effort to contact customers about their entitlements and obligations. That requirement is included in our legislation and it’s what drives our efforts to use the most effective and efficient means of communicating with people.   
  
As you’re aware, Inland Revenue has been using custom audience lists with social media platforms for a number of years.   
  
The purpose of those lists was to help us more accurately target individual taxpayers with information they need. It has been true for some time that to communicate with large numbers of people effectively, social media platforms are very important. Being able to reach people where they are active is vital. Using social media since 2013 has significantly increased our success in reaching taxpayers with important messages about their entitlements and obligations.  
  
However, in response to public concern at having personal details passed to social media platforms without their consent, we will no longer supply de identified, or hashed, customer details to social media platforms for use in targeted advertising.  
  
As Commissioner, I want to make it very clear that we have listened carefully to the concerns people have expressed. And it’s really important to me that we do the right thing in responding to those concerns. I take the matter of customer privacy very seriously and I think our decision, and this special briefing, demonstrates that.  
  
When concerns were raised over our use of custom audience lists, we paused their use on 12 September. Over the past several weeks, a comprehensive internal review of our use of custom audience lists has been carried out. We have also had our review independently reviewed by Geof Nightingale. Both our and Geof’s review documents will be available online early this afternoon.  
  
It's important for me to say at the outset that it’s not the review that has driven our decision to stop using custom audience lists.   
  
It is people’s strongly expressed concerns, about information being passed to social media platforms regardless of the protections, that have led us to make the call we have. The review has enabled us to explore those concerns in greater detail.  
  
Inland Revenue will continue to advertise on social media platforms but not by using custom audience lists. For the reasons I’ve outlined already, social media platforms are a very important and effective way to reach taxpayers with information.  And one of my clear responsibilities as Commissioner is to ensure that Inland Revenue makes the maximum effort to reach taxpayers with the information they need in respect of their entitlements and obligations.   
  
Customer privacy is a top priority. I can reassure all of our customers that in all the work we have done during the course of the review, there has been no evidence of customer details ever being used by social media platforms for anything other than the purpose intended.  
  
In undertaking the review, and in responding to OIA requests on this matter, we discovered two instances of customer details being supplied in their raw form by Inland Revenue to a social media platform – clearly, this was not the correct procedure. One instance was in the context of trying to fix a problem with creating a particular custom audience list. The other was the result of a misunderstanding of what data the hashing process applied to with one of the platforms.   
  
These unintended disclosures occurred at the Inland Revenue end and while both have been reported to the Office of the Privacy Commissioner, neither were categorised as notifiable. That means we are not required to report them publicly or to notify the customers involved. This is because the risk of any of the customer data having been shared further is deemed very low, as is the risk that it could have been used for any harmful purpose.   
  
We are examining the circumstances surrounding both instances and if we find any breach of our code of conduct we will work through what action is to be taken.   
  
We are writing to the taxpayers involved in the first of the two instances, apologising for what happened, explaining how it happened, and telling them what details were shared. And the social media platform involved has confirmed that all unhashed data provided to them was deleted within previously agreed time frames.  
  
The second is less easy to quantify, and identifying individual customers involved is very difficult because it was in the context of a totally automated, ‘machine to machine’ exchange between Inland Revenue and the platform.   
  
I want to emphasise here again, that the decision to stop using custom audience lists has been driven by public concern – not by these unintended disclosures. Obviously, they are a concern, and we are treating them very seriously, but as I’ve said, neither was deemed serious enough to meet privacy legislation requirements for reporting.  
  
I have made the decision to make all of this information public because as Commissioner I prioritise transparency and maintaining the trust of our customers. So, I apologise to all those customers whose details were passed against correct procedures. And I’m giving taxpayers my assurance that we have stopped sharing their details, in any form, with social media platforms - we have no plans to resume that practice.   
  
Prior to the review Inland Revenue has always believed that sufficient work was done to ensure the security of customer details within the hashing and custom-list creation process. In addition to hashing, the social media platforms have layers of security which means customer information has been kept safe and secure.  
  
Again, there is no evidence that any customer details, hashed or unhashed, have ever been used by social media platforms for anything other than the purpose agreed.  
  
Custom audience lists have been a very valuable tool for Inland Revenue with real benefits for customers because we could get relevant messages directly to them through the channels we knew they were using.   
  
The terms of the agreements with the social media platforms were always explicit and clear in stating that all hashed data was secure, used only for the purpose intended, and then deleted within agreed timeframes.  
  
But as I’ve said, public concern at the practice of passing details to social media platforms in any form has led us to the decision not to resume use of the custom audience list tool.   
  
We have a number of different ways of reaching the customers we need to get to, so that they can continue to get the information they need as quickly and efficiently as possible. We will continue to review these for their effectiveness and ability to reach taxpayers.  
  
Thank you for your time today. It isn’t often that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue calls a media briefing such as this. As I said at the outset, it’s a personal priority of mine that we are transparent and that we do the right thing in responding to customer concerns."

Inland Revenue systems re-open after final major upgrade
========================================================

**28 October 2021**

Inland Revenue’s secure online service myIR has re-opened, along with its phone lines and some offices, after the final stage of Inland Revenue’s multi-million-dollar programme to upgrade and simplify the tax system.   
  
Inland Revenue closed last Thursday afternoon and reopened as planned this morning.   
  
During this closure, IR migrated more than 128.7 million accounts so that all our tax and social policy products - such as child support - are now in our new system which has also been upgraded to the latest version.   
  
Because the shutdown coincided with a major filing date, businesses will have up to 4 November to file and pay their 1, 2 and 6-monthly GST returns for the taxable period ending 30 September; and pay their provisional tax instalments for income tax period 31 March 2022 that are usually due 28 October.    
  
Customers who want to apply for the third Resurgence Support Payment, can do so again. Applications stay open until a month after all of New Zealand returns to Alert Level 1.  
  
2.8 million child support assessments were brought into new system. Improvements to our system mean that from November, we’ll be able to pay Child Support payments to customers by the 23rd of the same month, as long as the payment has been made on time.  
   
From November, new liable parents (plus parents re-entering the system) who are working will have the Child Support deducted directly from their pay through their employer.   
  
The improvements to myIR simplify the way information is presented, making it easier for customers.  
  
They will have better visibility of their obligations and payments in myIR and be able to do more for themselves, including registering online and advising of any changes in circumstances.   
  
The layout will adapt to fit the size of any screen without loss of functionality, making it seamless to use myIR across different devices. That’s important because most of our Child Support customers use a smartphone to access myIR.  
  
Simplified navigation will allow customers to easily find and do what they need to do.   
  
The upgrade means we’re no longer running our services off two systems. That change brings even greater functionality and efficiency for our customers and the ability for us to respond more quickly to events like Covid -19.

Test Strategy for Inland Revenue. It encapsulates all aspects of testing to support delivery and BAU change at Inland Revenue providing Inland Revenue standards for testing, test phases, test entry/exit criteria, defect severity definitions, test reporting, test environment and security controls. This artefact is a reference artefact, intended to reduce waste by applying the concept of writing once to be used for all testing in the organisation. This artefact aligns; - Future Operating Model - Enterprise Design and Integrity Blueprint - IR’s Future Testing Services Model – approved Strategic Governance Board 3 June 2021 This artefact covers the Inland Revenue Organisation - Customer Compliance Services - Enterprise Services - Information and Intelligence Services - Enterprise Design and integrity The Test Strategy covers the following: - Test Organisation - Test P hases - Test Entry and Exit Criteria - Defect Severity Definitions and Process - Test Deliverables and associated RACI - Test Environments - Security and Data Compliance The Test Strategy is supported by the Inland Revenue Testing Patterns standards which set s out the application of the Test Strategy across the Inland Revenue Business and Technology Landscape. Page 7 of 47 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] What’s new Organisational alignment • Reflection of the Future Operating Model in roles and responsibilities in “Test Organisation” • Testing services model updated in alignment with IR’s Future State Testing Model – SGB Paper, this is reflected in the “Testing Services Model” • Introduction of the ‘Initiative’ context in alignment with Strategic Portfolio Stewardship, this is reflected in the “Testing Programme” Evolving Testing • Accessibility testing has been updated to reflect recent learnings, a pattern is provided to address accessibility • Testing Environments now reflect the post Transformation context – i.e. rationalised Test Environments What’s next • Digital Inclusivity is an emerging theme in our digital landscape, there is an open question ‘what is the role of testing in Digital Inclusivity’. We have seen testing evolution in the areas of Customer and Accessibility. Digital Inclusivity is a challenge for the whole of society, not bound by IR or testing as a capability. • Extension to Cross government Testing. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue is designated as the System Leader for Service Transformation. System leadership for service transformation is about ensuring government services are joined-up and organised around the needs of New Zealanders. The intent of service transformation is to improve the way government services are delivered by making sure they are accessible, efficient, and integrated. Page 8 of 47 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Test Principles The test principles provide key guidance to the programme across all areas of activity from design, communication and engagement, procurement, and operations. The Test Strategy provides: • Consistency, common criteria across Inland Revenue e.g. Test Entry/Test Exit, Defect criteria i.e. using the same language • Compliance and Consultation, consistent application of RACI ensuring that consultation and approval meets Inland Revenue standards • Defined deliverables and standards that will be adhered to and endorsed. Recognising different ways of working across IR, emphasis is on required outcomes as opposed to enforced methodology. • Re-usable documentation such as this artefact, allowing programmes to reference and reduce duplication • Alignment to Business Services, a common Test Pattern approach tailored to meet the outcomes of each Initiative’s in-scope Business Services. • Emphasis on Customer, e nsure that customer focus is part of testing practices • Test Automation, enabling broad scale assurance of IR services by way of automated testing running using continuous frameworks. • Testing in context, p roviding approaches in testing that fit the context of the business outcomes and solutions being delivered. • Tooling, supporting delivery and BAU using right-fit tools that fit the context of the processes and solutions being delivered. Page 9 of 47 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 2 Test Organisation Figure 1 - Test Organisation 2.1 Roles and Responsibilities The testing organisation is established via a networked structure. • Enterprise Design and Integrity Domain Lead - Testing providing for Test Strategy, Governance, Reporting and Capability. ED&I manages the strategic relationship with IR’s testing partner and testing from delivery partners. • Testing teams report into the organisation to which the testing delivery is for CCS, IIS, Enterprise Services. 2.2 Testing Services Model CCS, II&S and Enterprise Services provisioned with a lean base testing services profile to cover BAU and a small-scale change The model provides the ability to flex for change and scaled initiatives; • Functional Testing and User Acceptance Testing by sourcing business resourcing on demand from Change Gateway • Test Management, Technical Testing and Integration by way of professional testing services, IR’s testing partner and technology partners as applicable. Figure 2 – Testing Services Model Page 10 of 47 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 3 Testing Programme 3.1 Testing Scope The testing programme is derived in the following contexts: • The Initiative Pipelines as derived across the organisation o Customer Compliance Services - Planning Design and Delivery Initiative Pipeline o Enterprise Services Initiative Pipeline o Information and Intelligence Services Initiative Pipeline • BAU Testing across the organisation o Customer Compliance Services - Planning Design and Delivery  business context supporting START, Digital Gateway and Contact Centre o Enterprise Services  business context supporting Ātea, \[Information redacted\] and IGA  technology context supporting infrastructure related change o Information and Intelligence Services Ini tiative Pipeline  business context supporting public website and Haukainga The delivery pipeline is controlled within the organisational units, is prioritised by the Strategic Portfolio Stewardship by way of the Planning and Prioritisation group. 3.2 Testing Delivery Model Testing deliverables are aligned to Initiatives, Test Delivery then occurs in the context of those initiatives. Figure 3 - Testing Delivery Model Page 11 of 47 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 4 Test Deliverables 4.1 Test Deliverables Hierarchy The testing deliverables hierarchy at Inland Revenue is implemented so that detailed content of phase definitions, entry/exit criteria, RACI and severity definition is drafted once for Inland Revenue and re-used across all delivery initiatives. • Inland Revenue Enterprise Context – Enterprise Design and Integrity • There is a single Test Strategy for Inland Revenue which defines the standards for Test Phase Definitions, Entry/Exit Criteria, Test Capability and Defect Severity Definition • The Test Patterns and Standards sets out the application of the Test Strategy across the Inland Revenue Business and Technology Landscape. • Initiative Delivery Context - Planning Design and Delivery • Test Approaches provide an overarching view of test delivery on initiatives, test phases being applied, roles, responsibilities, environments and schedule. • Test Plans provide detailed insight into delivery of a Test Phase on and initiative, in many cases the detail a test plan provides is baked into working practice meaning an explicit artefact is not required. Examples being Test Plan as part of Solution Blueprint for Gateway Services, or Test Plan as part of Business Function Definition summary. • Test Exit reports provide a measure of testing conducted against defined Test Exit Criteria Page 12 of 47 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 4.2 Test Deliverables RACI and Approval All deliverables must be formally endorsed and approved in accordance with RACI. All testing deliverables are outlined in work plans and follow contractual requirements. All deliverable sign offs must be stored in a controlled repository. The following RACI model applies to Test deliverables. - Consulted parties must ‘endorse’ the deliverable - Accountable parties must ‘approve’ the deliverable.

The Initiative or project deliverables register, and the test plan will provide the deliverables as they will be applied in the context of the Initiative or project. 4.3.1 Test Approach Typically a one-page document or slidepack that depicts the scope and techniques for an initiative or project. Deliverable Description Objectives Test Approach A test approach considers the following elements: • test phases • test environments • roles and responsibilities • deliverables • test traceability • architecture picture with test phases • test schedule • a short list of test deliverables • a risk assessment • any techniques being applied • any test automation • To communicate test approach 4.3.2 Test Plan Test Plans will be created per Initiative or Test Phase depending on the objectives. • The project team may choose to embed core material from a Test Plan into Test Approach and therefore negate the need for Test Plan. • The project team may choose to embed core material from a Test Plan into project artefacts (such as Solution Blueprints). • The Test Manager/Initiative lead may choose to create a single test plan containing all test phases or break it into multiple test plans for each phase. This deliverable is used to define and communicate a detailed test approach for each test phase such as Unit Test, System Test, Integration Test, Performance Test, Business Test etc. The Test Plan explains the objectives and scope of the test, resources, key dates. The following is a high level of what will be included in a Test Plan: Deliverable Description Objectives Test Plan This test plan covers all test planning for a Business Service or test phase within a Initiative. • Test scope • Test phases • Test approach • Testing roles and responsibilities • Traceability—reference the artefacts that traceability will be applied to • Environment requirements Page 14 of 47 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Deliverable Description Objectives • Risks and dependencies • Test tools • Hand-over to support approach. 4.4 Test Scenarios / Scripts and Expected Results Testing by defining test scripts is activity that uses scenarios: stories to help the tester work through a complex problem or test system. Scripts can be further broken down into sub- scripts as required, until detailed, testable scenarios and expected results can be determined. Test scripts define the tests to be performed and should match the test phases they relate to and the requirements and designs they intend to prove: Deliverable Description Objectives Test scripts and expected results. Test scripts and expected results for the Initiative or project test phase. • To provide test scripts for the scope under test • To provide clear expected results • To provide a basis for shared understanding of the detail of what is being tested with all stakeholders. 4.5 Requirements Traceability Matrix The Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) maps each test to the requirements for a specific test phase The format for an RTM may be in a tool, spread sheet, mind map or another agreed format. Deliverable Description Objectives Requirements Traceability Matrix A matrix that organises and traces tests to requirements. • To provide clear traceability of test to requirements/user stories. • To provide a complete view of how each requirement is covered. 4.6 Test Status Report A weekly test progress report for testing compliant with Inland Revenue reporting standards. Deliverable Description Objectives Weekly Test Progress Report A test progress report that includes: - Risks - Issues - Deliverables • To provide clear reporting on status and project controls. Page 15 of 47 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Deliverable Description Objectives - Test Status - Defect Status (if applicable). 4.7 Test Exit Report The Test Exit report provides a quantitative view of the testing results. Upon successful completion of the test execution, the test phase is formally closed. This is achieved through a Test Exit Report. The Initiative or project may aggregate to a single test exit report or create test exit reports for each phase. The Test Exit Report documents the testing conducted at a summary level, records any variance from the test plan and assesses the testing conducted against exit criteria. Any residual defects, risks and issues are documented. A Initiative test manager may choose to create a single test exit report containing all test phases or break it into multiple test exit reports for each phase. Strong preference for a single test exit report for a release. Deliverable Description Objectives Test Exit Report The test exit report covers test completion for a release or test phases as applicable • an evaluation of test completion against exit criteria • test status summary • defect status summary • variance to test plan 4.8 Testing traceability A clear line of sight must be demonstrated from requirement to test for every test phase. Traceability is an end to end programme construct; it covers the domains of analysis, development and testing. To achieve a complete view, it is important to address what activity has been conducted before testing and then how that is modelled into the test phases. Testing quality is driven by several factors including “test inputs”. Regardless of development or delivery methodology, test phases will align to design artefacts and deliverables. Different levels of test artefacts help focus testing on the full set of functionalities being delivered from the granular unit level all the way up to the core business process. In the START context testing traceability is provided to Business Functional Definition (BFDs), for Atea, testing is traced to User Stories. Page 16 of 47 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 5 Test Phases This section describes the testing phases that a project may move through before being released into Production. The test approach will articulate which test phases apply in the context of the scope being delivered. The following phases of testing may apply: • Functional Testing • Unit/Verification Testing • Business System Testing / System Testing • Integration Testing • Partnership Testing • Regression Testing • Scaled Business Simulation • Functional Security Testing • User Acceptance Testing • Customer Interaction Testing • Accessibility Testing • Non-Functional Testing • Infrastructure Testing • Performance Testing • Security Testing • Disaster Recovery • Operational Acceptance Testing Page 17 of 47 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 5.1 Functional Testing 5.1.1 Unit and Verification Testing 5.1.1.1 Expected Outcome Testing of the components that make up the solution to ensure they are functionally correct. Tests are traceable to design or functional definition. 5.1.1.2 Definition Unit Testing confirms that the individual code module operates in the correct manner, as an isolated unit and is performed at the completion of the development of each code module. It proves that the linkage of build components produces the correct outcomes. Unit testing will be conducted on all components of the solution by the team coding the program or interface. Where applicable the use of test stubs and drivers will simulate upstream and downstream functionality of the component being tested. START context Development Task Verification is an activity under the FAST Method that has project business representatives directly engaging with the development team. Verification is an iterative process where business staff confirm the configuration completed by the developers meets their needs and expectations. Business staff provides feedback on the functionality within the system and developers continue to make changes. Changes are made and re-verified, possibly multiple times, until they are satisfied. • Mandatory Development Task Verification. • Developers are responsible for initiating verification by working with the Domain Specialists to go through the solution informally • The standard due date to complete verification is 7 days from the development completion date, however this can be extended to an achievable date mutually agreed by the team. • Reporting and progress visibility through Delivery Workbench • Defining ’Acceptance Criteria’ for Development Tasks: FAST Leads accountable to provide a brief description of what is expected to be verified. Writing the description can be delegated to a developer. • Identifying ’Verification Testing Only’ Development Tasks that will have no test scenarios written or executed against them. • Creating ”No development required” Development Tasks to perform regression testing as part of Development Verification Testing. • If there are schedule pressures during the late stages of development verification and development tasks are cycling between verification and development, by mutual agreement development tasks will be closed with residual low severity defects to allow more time for higher value activities. The residual defects must be captured as SQRs before closing the development task. • Data for verification created by Domain Specialists, assisted by developers by providing slices used in Developer Unit Testing. • DES Service Testers supporting where needed by creating and submitting Gateway Services payloads 5.1.1.3 Environment Unit Testing is performed in the Development environment, which will be logically separate to all other test environments. Verification Testing is typically performed in a test environment. Refer to the Test Environments section of this document. Page 18 of 47 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 5.1.2 Business System Testing / System Testing 5.1.2.1 Expected Outcome System Testing focuses on testing of the requirements as documented in the relevant business functional design, business rules and business process documents. It ensures the functionality at an application level is fit for purpose. 5.1.2.2 Definition Business System Testing is the core functional testing phase and development phase, it runs concurrently with integration testing. For START projects this is also called Business System Testing (BST), for non-START projects, this is typically called System Testing. Business System Testing / System covers: • Functional Testing—confirms the system is operating according to defined business needs (by way of traceability to a functional artefact—see Traceability section) using both converted data and native data. Includes alternate condition and exception scenarios. • Testing with Converted Data—confirms the system is operating according to defined business needs with converted data. START System Testing also includes functional testing of converted data. Testers utilise test scenarios, created by the project business representatives working alongside professional testers, to test and confirm the system is operating according to defined business needs with converted data. • Business Process Testing – explicit testing of the end to end business processes, these will be mapped into Business System Testing and Integration Testing. • Regression Testing—ensuring the change has not caused any failure in existing functionality, this can be in three forms: o Tightly coupled, the change directly impacts a shared function, there is shared data or common code. o Loosely coupled, the change has downstream implications in another system (i.e. START changes for Xpress Client). o Not coupled, no obvious connection however there is perceived risk, there may be sub-system data that is consumed by another system. START context Business System Testing will use signed off business functional design documents (or equivalent) and business processes and rules to derive test scenarios and provide detail to the business scenarios used during test execution. • Clearly defined scope guidelines guiding clearly defined scope, with the accepted residual risk ratified by business authority • Scoping is a joint responsibility of Domain Specialist – Testing and the FAST functional lead. • All BST requires rationale that aligns with the BST scope guidelines, BST testing will generally be required under these circumstances: • New core functionality • Custom config and code. For example: • Child Support: Formula Assessment Calculation engine, Child Support Income Springboard, Relationship Springboard etc Page 19 of 47 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] • Changes to custom build from previous releases • Highly visible areas – high reputational risk, high customer impact or high staff impact. For example: • myIR • External interfaces • Automated Letters and External Reports • Functional complexity hotspots • High volume combined with complex variables and complex outcomes: For example: P&I calculation, Offsets • Deviations from existing patterns • Data permutation driven converted data scenarios • BST focus is on business process outcomes instead of fields, rules and validations • Fields, rules and validations primarily tested in Development Verification Testing, unless the function fits one of the categories listed above • Business Testers external to the project using their business knowledge to test the business processes instead of granular field level testing • BST scenario preparation and execution • Domain Specialist - Testing responsible for managing test scenario writing and test execution, reporting to BTM, Channel Owner and BST Manager • FAST Lead scenario review mandatory. Domain Specialist - Testing also spot checking scenario quality. • Test scenario estimates are no longer utilised. Test preparation progress is tracked on Test Scenario Group level = How many Test Scenario Groups have their Test Scenarios written. This is overlaid with a testing schedule view. • Tester training approach modified to support remote testing with more emphasis on jellybean-specific functional training: • Teams specifying the scope and schedule of functional demos to be given to testers throughout testing • On-the-job learning supported by Domain Specialists and developers, based on a defined roster of Domain Specialist and developer support • FAST to create and refresh base slices (native and converted). FAST training testers how to augment these slices by creating targeted data for test scenarios. • Gateway Services Testers supporting BST Preparation and Execution where needed by creating and submitting Gateway Services payloads. • Project business representatives will support review and prioritisation of test scenarios. 5.1.2.3 Environment Business System Testing is performed in the Test or Quality environment. Refer to the Test Environments section of this document. Page 20 of 47 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 5.1.3 Integration Testing 5.1.3.1 Expected Outcome Integration Testing will ensure the system meets the functional requirements derived from business processes. The testing is conducted between multiple systems both internally and externally. 5.1.3.2 Definition The purpose of Integration Testing is to test the fully integrated solution in a way that reflects business use including interfaces, both internal and external to the design, with the hardware, software and infrastructure in a functionally equivalent state to production. Integration Testing is prevalent across Inland Revenue across multiple domains. The context is important in that it often spans multiple technologies and IR supplier vendor domains, examples: • myIR Customer login; spans www.ird.govt.nz, XIAMS, START • IR employee onboarding; spans Ātea, ICA, Service Now START context For START. integration testing focuses on Interfaces and is included within the Business System Testing and Scaled Business Simulation phases. Gateway Services teams conduct Integration Testing on external services, this can also be referenced a “Service Testing” 5.1.3.3 Environment Integration Test must be conducted in an integrated environment. Refer to the “Test Environments” section of this document. Page 21 of 47 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 5.1.4 Scaled Business Simulation Testing 5.1.4.1 Expected Outcome The purpose of Scaled Business Simulation Testing is to test the solution under production like conditions and scale. The objective of the testing to create a realistic simulation of business conditions within the solution following the major launch. The testing will cover the launch itself and significant business events following the launch. 5.1.4.2 Definition Scaled simulations are typical in START releases however not exclusively in this context. Testing of Payroll can utilise Scaled Business Simulation in the Enterprise Support Services context. START Context Scaled Business Simulation testing will examine full production cycles across platforms on a full set of converted production data. Data created in START by performing real- world business scenarios will also be used during this phase of testing. Scaled Business Simulation will be the final verification that the integrated solution meets IR’s defined business needs. The high-level SBS schedule is stored and kept up-to-date in Delivery Workbench. The details of what will be covered in each pass will be determined during the SBS test planning. The Domain Leads, Domain Specialists and BAs will collaborate with the FAST Architects and Development Leads to determine key system dates and business processes that will be tested in each pass of SBS testing. When the detailed schedule is developed for SBS, it will be added to Delivery Workbench. Some scenarios will be added to Delivery Workbench before a ‘trial run’ is conducted. Each SBS pass will be preceded by mock cutover activities, including mock conversion and other tasks that will occur during deployment. Mock cutover is planned and managed by the Deployment team in the Technical Cutover Testing and Production Implementation Verification testing phases. Scaled Business Simulation will focus on IR’s most important business scenarios, emulating real-world usage conditions. It will al so include comprehensive testing of START to ensure it delivers the required functionality described in the BFDs. Mock financial reconciliation will be planned and conducted as part of mock cutover activities and SBS passes. The emphasis will be on batch processing using the START job stream tool to schedule and run daily, nightly, weekly and monthly job streams as a simulation of processing over multiple months. The Integration Testing of interfaces using higher, production- like volumes will also occur. Heritage batch processing is included in SBS testing, based on a risk-based assessment: any major daily, nightly, weekly, monthly or yearly processes will be run during SBS, if deemed necessary from a risk perspective. The results of all job streams will be logged and tracked. Results will be benchmarked against predetermined requirements in order to verify that batch processing can be completed within the nightly window. If deemed important based on a risk assessment, SBS scenarios can also contain negative or boundary test scenarios. Scaled Business Simulation Testing will feature the same security controls as those in the Production Environment. 5.1.4.3 Environment Scaled Business Simulation Testing must be conducted in the “Quality” environment. Refer to the “Test Environments” section of this document. Page 22 of 47 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 5.1.5 Partnership Testing 5.1.5.1 Expected outcome Testing ensures the solution can successfully interact with partners meeting the functional requirements. 5.1.5.2 Definition The purpose of covers testing with external parties, typically this testing links with a planned test phases and provides a single view of IR Testing requirements to individual partners. Where relevant, Partnership testing will have specific focus on data reconciliation. Partnership Testing aggregates testing with a Partner for any test phase and runs the overall co-ordination of that testing. 5.1.5.3 Environment Partnership Test must be conducted in an integrated environment. This may be TEST or QUALITY or DIGITAL environments that are currently in the concept phase. 5.1.6 User Acceptance Testing 5.1.6.1 Expected Outcome UAT ensures that the solution meets the business requirements and processes. 5.1.6.2 Definition User Acceptance Testing is typically performed by the business to validate that the developed solution meets the business requirements and processes. User Acceptance Test scenarios are based on business processes and requirements. There is no explicit User Acceptance Test Phase on START. The test strategy recognises that user acceptance testing for START is blended with system, integration and functional testing within Business System Testing, Integration Testing and Scaled Business Simulation. User Acceptance Testing is prevalent across Enterprise Services and II&S. 5.1.6.3 Environment UAT will be performed as part of BST in the “Test” or the “Quality” environment, whichever is the most suitable to conduct the scenario under test. Refer to the “Test Environments” section of this document. Page 23 of 47 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 5.1.7 Regression Testing 5.1.7.1 Expected Outcome Regression testing ensures that pre-existing functionality still operates as expected in the updated environment. 5.1.7.2 Definition Regression Testing is conducted is conducted within Business System Test, Integration Testing, Scaled Business Simulation or Performance Test phases to ensure that pre-existing functionality still operates as expected in the updated environment. Typically the regression test scope is established by way of an impact assessment conducted by the test team in conjunction with development representatives. Some areas, such as Atea, START Gateway Services and core START Child Support formula have comprehensive test automation suites, these suites are run daily and on demand. 5.1.7.3 Environment Final Regression Test will be performed in the “Test” or the “Quality” environment, whichever is the most suitable to conduct the scenario under test. Refer to the “Test Environments” section of this document. 5.1.8 Functional Security Testing 5.1.8.1 Expected Outcome Testing ensures that authorised users have access to correct features as per requirements. 5.1.8.2 Definition Functional Security Testing ensures that only authorised users have access to features of a system, and that the users have access to the functionality they need to perform their assigned duties and no more. This testing includes testing user access delegation functions. User access rights creation, updates and deletion will also be tested. 5.1.8.3 Environment Functional Security Test will be performed in the “Test” or the “Quality” environment, whichever is the most suitable to conduct the scenario under test. Refer to the “Test Environments” section of this document. Page 24 of 47 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 5.1.9 Customer Interaction Testing 5.1.9.1 Expected Outcome Customer Interaction Testing (CIT) is designed to increase the voice of its customers (tax agents, individuals, businesses, third party software providers and more) in the testing process. CIT typically applies to external users of IR systems, it can apply to internal users. 5.1.9.2 Definition Customer Interaction Testing gathers ‘real life’ experiences of customers at every iteration of development, allowing for the business teams, developers and technical staff to maintain constant contact with the people for whom the systems are being designed in the first place. Typically Customer Interaction Testing is engaged in sprints to define key functional areas to expose the IR product to the identified customer segments e.g. tax agents, individuals and businesses. Feedback is collected in sprint reports on design issues, defects, observations, and customer experience. The feedback then helps identify design improvements for resolution. Technology solution in IR environments enable scale, with the ability to en gage thousands of end-users, and provided detailed management information on customer interaction. The technology mix is Qualtrics for customer survey alongside IR Digital Test Environments that are accessible to support real customer interaction. 5.1.9.3 Environment Customer Interaction Testing will be performed in the “Test” or “Quality” environments, the “Digital” environment is the preferred environment. The environment must be accessible to our customers. Refer to the “Test Environments” section of this document. Page 25 of 47 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 5.1.10 Accessibility Testing 5.1.10.1 Expected Outcome Accessibility assessments of Inland Revenues (IR) systems supports inclusion of employees with accessibility impairments, using assistive technologies to perform their jobs to the best of their abilities. 5.1.10.2 Definition IR is required to conform to New Zealand Government Web Usability Standards & Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 - Level AA Inland Revenue takes a layered approach to Useability and Accessibility, it is worth noting that testing is possibly the least effective control for accessibility, in this area it is better for quality to be positioned up front in COTS, Cloud and development practices. Layered approach to accessibility; • Vendor software compliance, this is where the provider of the software solution provides certification or evidence of compliance in the base unconfigured software package. Examples are FAST providing a Gentax compliance statement or \[Information redacted\] • Delivery partner development standards compliance, this is where an Inland Revenue delivery partner provides evidence of development practices that support compliance with accessibility standards. This controls the delivered configuration. Examples are FAST providing a development practice statement for START or \[Information redacted\] providing compliance of \[Information redacted\]. • Accessibility Testing , engaging with IR users with accessibility needs in testing processes. This approach provides a tailored and focussed view on areas of our systems that our Internal Customers are using. • External Accessibility Review, review of IR systems by an external party, largely applicable in the myIR or www.ird.govt.nz context. 5.1.10.3 Environment Accessibility Testing will be performed in the “Test” or “Quality” environments, the “Digital” environment is the preferred environment. The environment must be accessible to our customers. Refer to the “Test Environments” section of this document. Page 26 of 47 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 5.2 Technical Testing The role of the Technical Test team in non-functional testing detailed below. 5.2.1 Infrastructure Testing 5.2.1.1 Expected Outcome Testing ensures the infrastructure is implemented as specified in the design. 5.2.1.2 Definition The objective of Infrastructure Testing is to ensure that each delivered element of infrastructure is correctly implemented as documented in the Specification and the Detailed Design. Infrastructure testing may extend to the following test types as defined in the test plan: - High Availability - Monitoring - Networking - Security - Backup/Restore - Audit - Reporting 5.2.1.3 Environment Infrastructure Testing will be performed in every environment where new infrastructure is provisioned. Refer to the “Test Environments” section of this document. Page 27 of 47 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 5.2.2 Performance Testing 5.2.2.1 Expected Outcome Testing of the non-functional specifications to ensure the system delivered meets the performance expectations of the business. 5.2.2.2 Definition The purpose of performance testing is to verify that the system meets the performance related “non-functional” specifications (NFR’s / SLA’s). Performance can include backup and restore speeds and loads (SAN and network speeds), restore of VMs, CDC (data synch between FIRST and START) and third-party interfaces. Also, the performance impact of security controls such as antivirus scanning load, performance impact of security controls. Performance testing provides information to management about the quality and stability of the system so that implementation decisions can be made with an awareness of the potential production impacts. Performance testing also validates the production design for the infrastructure. Performance testing may extend to the following test types as defined in test plan: • Volume • Load • Stress • Scalability testing • Soak testing To adequately measure Performance Testing of the applications, a set of Non-functional requirements detailing the allowable levels will be agreed with the Business. These metrics will provide a benchmark against which to measure results during test execution. The performance testing framework uses the Enterprise Risk framework to quantify risk and assess the requirement for performance test. 5.2.2.3 Environment Performance Testing will be performed in the “Quality” environment. To ensure realistic results these environments must represent production accurately. As a pre-requisite the test environment will have to be configured to allow performance testers and their tools access. Page 28 of 47 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 5.2.3 Security Vulnerability and Penetration Testing 5.2.3.1 Expected Outcome Verifies the security controls defined in the Security Risk Assessments are implemented and functioning as expected Systems and data are protected from unauthorised access and disclosure. 5.2.3.2 Definition The purpose of security testing is to verify that the delivered solution conforms to the Inland Revenue security standards. Security risk is evaluated with IT Security and scope is determined. External security testing services will be procured from a dedicated security testing company to conduct the testing. Security engagement occurs at 3 levels: • Review of technical solution and coding standards for site specific code • Vulnerability testing of infrastructure relating to new or changed applications or infrastructure in scope • Penetration testing. Security testing aims to ensure that system functions as expected, Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability principles of Inland Revenue are preserved. It provides assurance that the Inland Revenue systems are securely implemented and that unauthorised users cannot access or harm data, applications and networks. It will also test the effectiveness of the implemented security controls around external channels to help secure Inland Revenue resources and minimise information security risk. Security testing tests features to search for exposures that might result in: • Unauthorized access to the underlying operating system. • Unauthorized access to application resources. • Unauthorized access to audit or authentication data. • Unauthorized access to network resources. • Denial of service attacks. • Exploitation of Vulnerability resulting in loss of Confidentiality, Availability or Integrity of Data. • Unauthorised access to Inland Revenue resources being undetected. • Malicious activities by authorised users being undetected. Penetration testing involves simulating an attack to test the system for potential vulnerabilities other testing covers validating such things as patch levels, network segregation and firewall rule sets Penetration testing involves Black box testing and White box testing. Black box testing assumes no prior knowledge of the infrastructure to be tested, whereas the white box testing provides the testers with complete knowledge of the infrastructure to be tested. For the Production system an assurance report must be produced in a publicly consumable format—ISAE 3402 Type 1 and Type 2 available on request. Testing of START application access controls is a test activity in Business System Test. 5.2.3.3 Roles and Responsibilities Page 29 of 47 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] An independent IT security company, which is independent from the build team and other testing teams, will be engaged by IR to perform information security testing. The technical test team will develop an internal approval process to ensure that only authorised users are given access to test environments and test data. 5.2.3.4 En vironment Security Testing will be performed in the “Quality”, “DR” and “Prod” environments as applicable. Refer to the “Test Environments” section of this document. Page 30 of 47 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 5.2.4 Operational Acceptance Testing Operational Acceptance Testing ensures that the procedures and personnel required to implement the new application are in place. The Operational Acceptance Testing verifies the production environment’s ability to handle the new system. Operational Acceptance Testing may extend to the following test types as defined in the test plan: • IT Operations Service Testing verifies that the correct functionality, architecture, and procedures are defined and implemented to allow production support teams to run, maintain, and support the system. • Database backup – From an Operational Acceptance Test perspective, you should test and validate that database have been backed up successfully without loss of data. Testing can be performed with help of developers or tools implemented to take the database backup at a specified time for the application developed. • Database Recovery –Recovery and restoration could be performed either manually or automatically dependant on what mechanism is applied for the application developed. Data loss is the key here. • Software Installation and Configuration– Software Installation and Configuration test should be performed to ensure the deployment package, scripts and configurations work according to the installation instructions. Deployed components to OAT shall be packaged and distributed to the available environment. Verification of installation, configuration and of major functionality should be done by execution of Smoke Tests. • Rollback – testing that you can rollback an application to the last known working configuration in case problems occur during the deployment • Failover – Failover testing verifies that an application proceeds as normal when a redundant component fails. Failover test could be performed for network failover, component failover, server failover etc • Supportability – In Supportability testing we perform– Installation test (above), Rollback (above) and Monitoring. In monitoring we check handling of events generated when the system is malfunctioning. We perform verification of monitoring mechanisms for the system – particularly availability, performance and capacity being measured and reported. • Reliability –Failover test and Recovery routines are explained above. You can also check that Recovery Routines work within the conditions specified. • Performance – Generally performance testing is performed separately but sometimes from an Operational Acceptance Test you would perform sanity checks of the application under load • Maintainability –testing installation routines and rollback for updates/patches for database, infrastructure and application. 5.2.4.1 Environment Operational Acceptance Testing will be performed in the “Quality”, “DR” and “Production” environments as applicable. Refer to the “Test Environments” section of this document. Page 31 of 47 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 6 Test Management and Reporting 6.1 Reporting Test Status for Inland Revenue is provided by Test Managers to their respective BAU unit or Initiative lead. The same status is reported to the ED&I Domain Lead Testing for aggregated executive reporting. The provision of a separate testing report is consistent with a 2015 NZ Public Sector Lessons Learnt; “The testing team need a clear communication to the governance body that is separate from the delivery arm of the project, this will ensure quality issues can be raised effectively.” Figure 4 Test Reporting The following sections would be typically included in a Weekly Test Progress Report: • Overall RAG status of Previous, Current and Next week • RAG status for 10 keys i.e. Scope, Risks, Issues, Inter-dependency, Schedule, Resources, Finances, Stakeholder engagement and Delivery Partner • Key Achievements in the reporting period • Key Activities planned for next week • Key risks and issues along with Mitigation plan/call to action • Status of key deliverables • Test Metrics (as applicable for IT and Business Testing) Page 32 of 47 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 6.2 Test Metrics Metrics provide a means to quantify the success of the testing effort and identify areas for improvement. Metrics can illustrate whether error rates are decreasing, where errors are being introduced, whether problems are being resolved fast enough, and whether the testing process is on target. All of these can be invaluable in the management of the testing process. At a minimum the following information should be included as part of each Test Team’s weekly status report as appropriate. • Test Scenario progress. This includes planned and actual figures for the following: o Test Scenarios Completed. • Execution Progress. This includes planned and actual figures for the following: o Tests Executed o Tests Passed o Tests Failed o Tests Planned but Unable to Be Executed o Tests Blocked by Defects • Defect metrics o Open defects o Defect resolution rates Page 33 of 47 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 7 Test Entry and Exit Criteria 7.1 Test Entry Assessment Prior to starting a test phase, a test readiness assessment should be carried out, this will assess the readiness to start testing and track test dependencies. Test Entry Criteria as follows • An approved Test Approach/Test Plan has been approved • Sufficient approved requirements are available to construct tests • Previous test phase is completed to the point where this test phase can start • Tests have been written that will cover the areas that will be tested first. • Requirements Traceability Matrix completed and reviewed (includes assessment of coverage) • Data requirements have been identified and created within the Test environment for the scope under test. • Test environments have been built configured to a documented state and the appropriate test data loaded. • Configuration management processes are in place. • A successful smoke test has been conducted. • All resources required to execute the Test scenarios have been identified and available It is expected that the readiness assessment is reviewed periodically on the lead up to the start of testing so that any areas that have a dependency are tracked to the test schedule. Any late running tasks can then be remediated so they do not impact the test schedule. 7.2 Test Exit Criteria (applicable to all test phases) Test exit conditions indicate that the test phase is complete and include; • All high and medium priority test scenarios are executed. • All defects are documented. • There are no outstanding severity 1 and 2 defects. • Outstanding severity 3 and 4 defects have been reviewed and approved by business and technical representatives. • Any workarounds are agreed by the business representatives and documented. • For Technical Testing - Non-functional requirements have been met, or exceptions agreed upon by business and architecture after risk assessment. • Requirements Traceability Matrix updated. • Test Exit/Evaluation Report is approved The test exit report must confirm the test exit criteria have been met and provide evidence to support that confirmation Page 34 of 47 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 8 Defect Management Defect management is the process of logging, analysis, tracking and resolving of defects. Defects will be gathered and managed throughout all phases of testing. The Test team will report on defects and it is the responsibility of all project members to ensure defects are resolved in severity/priority order. The reporting on defects is highly visible and may be reported at any level in the organisation and potential into NZ government forums. 8.1 Defect Management Processes Defects require a review and traction process to ensure that defects are recorded accurately, have the correct severity (according to the business) and are worked on in the correct order. The process is designed to maximise the business value of the defect process and to trend the project to meet minimal viable product, the aim is to fix the most important things first. • Internal Review—During test execution, defects will be reviewed and monitored daily by the test manager (in conjunction with the relevant test analyst or business representative) and escalated as required. • B usiness Severity/Priority Review—Business stakeholders will be briefed on defects on a regular basis (daily at peak periods). Business representatives are the authority on allocation of defect severity and priority, if there are changes required to defect severity, business consultation and agreement is mandatory. The business must provide input into the severity of every defect. • Defect Traction Review—Defects will be reviewed regularly (daily at peak) with development teams to provide estimation on fix date on defects. The defect traction review ensures that defects are being worked on in severity/priority order. The Product Owner (Systems Integration and Business) from Operational Readiness and Support Initiative will be responsible for facilitating the defect review meetings with nominated members from each of the Initiative. • Transparency—for any test phase at Inland Revenue, defects must be available in summary and detailed form, this includes transparency when the software is in the vendor test phases prior to the delivery to Inland Revenue. 8.2 Business Consequence and Customer Impact Defects are often stated using technical terminology that is foreign to business and customer contexts. The Business Consequence and Customer Impact fields provide the opportunity to use plain english to describe a defect. As testing approaches exit, this information is often pivotal in determining severity and the quality level of the solution. • Business Consequence - Business Consequence is a narrative that describes what the impacts are on Inland Revenues business should the defect remain unresolved. • Customer Impact - Customer Impact is the narrative that describes what will happen in the customer context should the defect remain unresolved. Page 35 of 47 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 8.3 Defect Severity Defect severity needs to be assessed for each defect. Severity rating will be established from the Business and Customer impacts of the defect and in collaboration with the relevant business representatives. The following defect severity definitions are used at Inland Revenue: Severity Description Examples 1- Critical A mandatory function is affected for process or data integrity and the impact is major. No further testing is possible on that function until the Severity 1 defect is corrected. Severe business or technical problem. The system and/or integrated systems cannot be used until the defect is resolved Has a major impact on critical business activities. No workaround exists. Defect causes system to crash. Application / solution cannot be used. Defect causes severe data corruption e.g. records cannot be resurrected. Defect causes severe loss of data. System function cannot be used. Transactions cannot be saved. Module cannot be used until the defect is resolved. 2- High A significant function is affected and implications to the process or data integrity are major. Testing of the impacted module or system is prevented but testing in other systems/modules is possible. Serious business or technical problem. Has a major impact on business activities. Workaround exists but is cumbersome and unsustainable. System’s usability is significantly impaired. Business rules implemented incorrectly. Scenario level data corruption. 3- Medium A function is affected but the process impact or data implications are minor e.g. a business function is affected but the implications to the process or data integrity are minor. Moderate business or technical problem. Functionality does not work as required or designed. A workaround exists. Poor usability. Fields not defaulting to correct values. Focus and tab orders incorrect. Workflow implemented incorrectly. Errors not handled correctly. Sort orders incorrect. 4- Low An inconvenience factors such as minor layout error, misspelling in documentation or omissions. Cosmetic defect that has minimal impact on the business. Defect causes annoyance to system users. Spelling mistakes within application UI or internal documentation. Poor screen layout. Fields misaligned. Page 36 of 47 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 8.4 Approach When a defect is found during testing it will be logged and resolved following the steps below. 1. The defect is raised. 2. The development team will investigate the defect, consulting with the test team as required and code the fix. They will update and advise the test team that the fix is ready to re-test. 3. If it is found that the defect results from missing or ambiguous requirements in specification, or the specification needs to be corrected, or businesses requirements have changed, then a change is managed. Such defects raised which require additional functionality or change in existing functionality from what is documented, will be closed once a decision on change path is approved. 4. The test team will then re-test the change and conduct regression testing if required. If the defect is resolved, then the test team will close the defect. If the defect is still not fixed then the test team will consult with the IT and/or development team, leaving the defect open. 5. If the defect is found to be raised in error, it will be closed and the reason for closure will reflect that it was raised in error. There are two test tools FCR and Jira that will be used for defect/issue tracking see table in test tools section for details. 8.5 Transition of defects that remain open at exit At test exit there will be times where defects remain open for further action. The test exit report will nominate the planned resolution path for a defect. Defects that may be transitioned need to be signalled to project management prior to the exit cycle along with a proposal on a resolution path. All open defects at test exit must be documented in the test exit report along with the proposed resolution path for those defects. If the exit criteria have not been met and there are severity 2 defects at exit, then the test exit report must be supported by a contingency plan. The contingency plan is the responsibility of the Release and Deployment Manager. If any defects require resolution in a subsequent release, then a change request is required.

The mapping is intended to be standard path implementation; it is not intended to be used to enforce constraints in test method, more a guideline. For example conducting Business System Testing in Quality is acceptable, so too is Security Testing in Test. 9.2 Test Environment Control Control on entry to Test Environments is provided by way of Enterprise Control. • Enterprise Change and Release providing controls on project entry into release windows on applications and systems. • Change Control board providing the daily control on change actions in non-production and production environments. 9.3 Configuration Management Configuration Management is the responsibility vendor team providing the delivery services in the application or domain. Page 38 of 47 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 10 Test Data This section describes the approach for test data. It defines the following: 1. The types of test data that will be used in each test environment. 2. The sources of the test data that will be used in each test environment. 3. The roles and responsibilities for the provision and management of test data. 4. The test data provisioning processes. 5. The test data management processes, including test data backup and restore. The sources of test data include: Source Description Manufactured data Test data that is created manually. No alignment requirements. Converted data Data that has been extracted from Heritage applications and converted. Reference data Data that is copied from a reference data repository. Production Data Data copied or derived from Production. The following table maps the data source to test phase. Test Phases Data Source TEST Environment Manufactured Data Converted Data Production Data – Sliced copy QUALITY Environment Manufactured Data Converted Data Production Data – Full copy The data preparation for testing specific scenarios will be the accountability of the test manager for each Testing Phase. Page 39 of 47 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 11 Security and Data Compliance This section covers the security and data privacy standards that must be met at Inland Revenue. The IR Testing Security and Data Usage in Tests standard is referenced here Security and Testing. All aspects of security must be complied with including Standing Instruction 6 and 7. 11.1 Security imbedded into process Security testing is typically back-ended in the project or Work-stream delivery lifecycle. It is important that Work-streams build security in by design and perform security validations prior to submitting systems for Certification and Accreditation. Certification and Accreditation should not be the first case where bounds or abuse cases are tested, or libraries are validated for validity. 11.2 Security controls Security controls are to be documented in the Initiative Risk Assessment and System Security Plan. 11.3 Use of Production Data in Non-Production Environments Data in the TEST environment potentially uses production copy data, this largely pertains to START however can occur in other applications such as Ātea. Where production data is used there are specific controls and naming standards that apply. What is PII? PII is any information about an identifiable individual or would allow someone to know whose information it is. In order to be identifiable, the person’s name is usually attached but email address would also apply especially if someone’s name is contained in the email address. External customers - If name and email is removed then IRD number, DOB and bank account number on their own won’t be PII as it’s unlikely someone could be identified by that data without a name. Internal users - Usually it’s someone’s name but having a userID attached to information would make it PII as you can search for a userID in the phone directory. If the employee/personnel number is attached, this is also PII but it’s more difficult to identify the individual concerned as employee numbers are not widely available. Key principles for using production data PII (Personally Identifiable Information) is populated in sparsely in TEST environments and in the QUALITY environment, there are a number of controls and expected behaviours that users must adhere to. All programmes and projects will adhere to the following key principles; • Read and take note of this guidance and complete the specified training if you haven’t already done so prior to accessing test environments • Only access data that you have a justifiable business reason to do so • If you get a security violation or are unexpectedly exposed to PII or Special Files customer make a note of what you were doing and raise a security issue. • Do not leave your desktop unlocked whilst away from your desk • Obfuscate, crop or delete any extracted PII where possible and label as “In Confidence” • Only store extracted PII if you absolutely need to and store appropriately • Digital only to be stored in specified secured locations Page 40 of 47 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] • Physical documents/media must not be left on desk and stored in a locked credenza • Do not leave information on printers / photocopiers unattended • Do not create copies or share PII by email or Teams • Dispose appropriately, extracted PII where no longer necessary • Do not try and circumvent the process / security controls • Do not store project or test information on your home drive. If you are unsure about anything that you are doing please check with your manager for guidance . The process for raise a Security Issue is to raise a Service Now incident and to tag it as “security related”, if in doubt, raise the issue. 11.4 Code of Conduct All users of PII must be familiar with the following Code of Conduct sections; • The Accountability of Public Servants • Decision making checklist • Employee Obligations • Integrity of the tax system • Secrecy Systems Security All users must also be familiar with the People Policies and Guidelines. More specifically the Topic 3 “Conduct and Behaviour Policy”. 11.5 Inland Revenue Third Party Suppliers The Security Remote Access Policy (which under development May 2022) will provide the procedures for managing access to IR systems and Sensitive Information for IR Vendors and Third Party suppliers. These procedures must be adhered to. 11.6 Testing with External Partners The Inland Revenue partner landscape includes multiple integrating parties in a number of contexts; (i) Core Tax and Social Policy Digital Service Providers integrating with Inland Revenue’s Gateway Services APIs. (ii) Core Tax and Social Policy integration with other government agencies. (iii) Core Tax and Social Policy integration with banking sector organisations. (iv) Enterprise Services integration to with external organisations to support IR internal processes. The Partnership Test plan must contain a security section and contain the following text, the wording is agreed by IR executive, please do not alter: Inland Revenue is obliged to maintain the secrecy of any taxpayer related information. This includes information shared between Inland Revenue and business partners during system testing. Page 41 of 47 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] All data used in testing should be treated as if it were Production quality, with all appropriate controls in place to ensure: • The environment is controlled and no unauthorised individual can access the testing or staged environments, • Processes are in place to ensure that source copies of data are deleted once testing is completed, • The data used for testing is isolated to prevent accidental use, and, • Controls are in place to prevent contamination or accidental release to other environments. Page 42 of 47 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 12 Risk based testing The testing risk model is informed by Inland Revenue’s Enterprise Risk Framework. There is a balance to be achieved in the application of testing as a control on software quality and the corresponding investment by Inland Revenue in the process of testing. Typically each project or programme will utilising the risk framework to inform testing coverage. Consultation with business is essential in applying the risk framework. • Risk Consequence Assessment - use it to assess the severity of a risk, and what is impacted by it, for example, customers, health, reputation, legislative compliance etc. • Risk Likelihood Assessment - use it to calculate the rating of your risk based on likelihood and consequence. An example of how the framework can be applied for applications under Performance Test Phase is as follows: Application Name Technical Impact (Likelihood) Business Score (Consequence) Inherent Risk Derived Risk Level Recommendation Application 1 Rare Severe Medium 6 Recommend targeted Testing Application 2 Unlikely Moderate Low 5 No Testing Required Application 3 Possible Major High 7 Recommend Testing Application 4 Likely Moderate High 7 Recommend Testing Application 5 Almost Certain Insignificant Medium 6 No Testing Required Page 43 of 47 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 13 Test Tooling The right fit tooling will be applied across the application and infrastructure landscape.

Inland Revenue to shut down services
====================================

**15 April 2019**

The tax system is about to close for a week as Inland Revenue implements its biggest changes in 20 years.

Online services in myIR will be unavailable from 3pm Thursday afternoon and will reopen at 8am on Friday 26 April. Inland Revenue contact centres and front counters at its offices will also be closed.

Inland Revenue Deputy Commissioner Sharon Thompson says the dates were carefully chosen to cause the least possible disruption to customers.

“Easter holidays and Anzac Day fall within this period so there are only two full business days when our services won’t be available.

“Almost 20 million tax records are going to be transferred to a new system during the shutdown so we’re closing to make sure that goes smoothly.

“When we reopen on Friday 26 April, we will have a vastly superior tax system – one that can issue automatic tax refunds and can operate closer to real time to help more New Zealanders pay the right amount of tax at the right time.”

This is the third time in the last three years that Inland Revenue has shut down the tax system to roll out part of its business transformation. The first year saw the GST system modernised. Year two moved more business taxes into myIR and brought in the Accounting Income Method option for paying provisional tax.

The third release sees individual income tax records moved to the new system. This will allow the process of automatic tax assessments to get underway along with mechanisms to make sure customers are on the right tax code and not over or under paying tax.  

“No customer will be disadvantaged by our shutdown.” says Ms Thompson. “The payments of Working for Families tax credits will go out on Friday and employers filing their final Employer Monthly Schedule or doing payday filing will be able to file on April 26. Although we would encourage them to file before the shutdown if they can.

“Tax payments can still be made via internet banking and all the information on our website will remain accessible.

“There’s never an ideal time to shut down the tax system but we’re confident the changes will make any inconvenience worthwhile.

“Tax is about to become much more straightforward for salary and wage earners,” says Sharon Thompson.

Inland Revenue urges overseas businesses to register for GST
============================================================

**03 October 2019**

Overseas businesses selling goods valued at a thousand dollars or less to New Zealand consumers are urged to register for GST ahead of a 1 December deadline.

The Government is introducing an offshore supplier registration system that requires overseas businesses to collect GST on low-value goods sold to New Zealand consumers at the point of sale. These businesses may need to register for, collect and return GST of 15% from 1 December this year.

Inland Revenue spokesperson Nick Bradley says New Zealand retailers already include GST in the price of their goods, collect this GST, and pay it to IR.

“Right now, GST isn’t collected on all goods purchased online from overseas because the cost of collecting less than NZ$60 in GST and tariff duty at the border isn’t cost-effective,’ Nick Bradley says.

“The change will help level the playing field for New Zealand businesses and stop the loss of a significant amount of tax revenue from the steady growth in online shopping.

“The change applies to all sales of low-value goods to consumers in New Zealand including online, mail order or by phone.

“From 1 December overseas businesses must start collecting GST on these goods but first they need to be registered for it. Registration applies to merchants or retailers selling directly to New Zealand consumers, as well as online marketplaces and re-deliverers.

“Beat the rush and register to collect GST from 1 December.  That way, you’ll be ready to go,” Nick Bradley says.

Registrations are already open. Details are available at [https://www.classic.ird.govt.nz/campaigns/2018/gst-policy-update.html](https://www.classic.ird.govt.nz/campaigns/2018/gst-policy-update.html)

**Media contact: Gay Cavill 029 2014 585**

**Background:**

New Zealand consumers will no longer pay tariff duty, an import transaction fee or a biosecurity system entry levy at the border. New Zealand Customs will still collect these, and GST, if the value is over NZ$1,000.

Processes will be put in place so Customs does not collect GST on any goods already taxed at the point of sale by the supplier.

Until 1 December 2019, New Zealand Customers will continue to collect GST and tariff duty at the border on goods brought from overseas when the amount due is more than NZ$60. This excludes most alcohol and tobacco products.

The 1 December introduction is 2 months later than the date originally proposed in draft legislation (1 October 2019) to allow affected businesses more time to make the necessary system changes.

A low-value good is a physical good valued at NZ$1,000 or less (excluding GST). Examples include books, clothing, cosmetics, shoes and sporting equipment and small electronic items.

GST is already collected on online services and intangibles bought from overseas. Examples include software downloads, e-books, legal and accounting advice, and streamed movies and music.

**FAQ**

Does the NZ$1,000 threshold apply per item or per invoice/transaction?

Per item. If multiple low-value goods are sold in a single transaction, the supplier must collect GST on each low-value good even when the total value of the sale/transaction is over NZ$1,000.

This also means that if a consumer in New Zealand purchases multiple goods in a single transaction made up of low-value goods and high-value goods (goods valued above NZ$1,000), the supplier must collect GST on each low-value good.

High-value goods will generally continue to be taxed at the border as they come into New Zealand.

Are there any exceptions?

These changes do not apply to supplies of fine metal, alcohol and tobacco products because:

• fine metal is exempt from GST under existing rules

• most alcohol and tobacco products regardless of value are subject to excise taxes and GST at the border. This is not changing.

Low-value goods sold to GST-registered New Zealand businesses for use in their business are also generally excluded under the new rules. But, if a New Zealand business imports goods in a consignment valued over NZ$1,000 the business will pay GST and duty on these goods at the border.

Inland Revenue walks the talk on payday filing
==============================================

**27 November 2018**

Inland Revenue has become the country’s first big employer to adopt payday filing ahead of it being mandatory on 1 April next year.

Customer segment leader Richard Owen says switching early makes good business sense.

“There are 5,138 staff to pay every fortnight at Inland Revenue so waiting until April to adopt a new system didn’t seem a sensible option.”

“We have been telling all employers that it’s better to switch sooner rather than later and there’s no point in saying that unless you’re prepared to practice what you preach.”

More than two months of pay runs with payday filing have been successfully completed at Inland Revenue. This means all the PAYE and deduction information about its employees has been filed at each fortnightly payday instead of monthly.

Receiving this type of information on a timelier basis will allow Inland Revenue to be more accurate when calculating taxes and social entitlements such as Working for Families tax credits.

It’s also a key part of the proposed plan to simplify end-of-year taxes for individuals.

“One of the benefits of Inland Revenue switching early,” says Mr Owen, “is that it has taught us some valuable lessons we can share with other significant employers.

“We’re intimately aware of the planning involved in the switch, especially when there’s a large number of staff to pay. We’ve drawn on our experience to create easy-to-use guides to help employers using the same payroll software through each step of the process.”

Inland Revenue Chief People Officer Mark Daldorf says the developer of the payroll software package the organisation uses has been helpful with resolving obstacles.

“Pay runs so far have gone well and we’ve seen only a few minor, but resolvable issues, for a few staff with unique circumstances.

“Like any new process, it takes some getting used to, especially how the employment information is displayed in myIR but we’ve been able to quickly adapt to the new look and feel.”

Mr Owen says Inland Revenue is willing to help employers adopt payday filing in any way it can.

“We’ve shown that it’s possible to shift to payday filing well ahead of the deadline so other large employers should feel confident they can do the same.

“The first step is to start talking with your payroll software provider and work out a plan to get you ready well in advance.”

Inland Revenue warns customers to beware of fraudulent tax agent callers
========================================================================

**21 May 2014**

Inland Revenue is warning its customers to beware of fraudulent tax agents who claim to work on its behalf to ensure people receive their tax refund.

"We have received reports of people going door-to-door and giving the impression to householders that they are a tax agent who works on behalf of Inland Revenue.

"Just to be clear, Inland Revenue will never telephone, email or knock on your door regarding your tax refund. Neither will we ask for your credit card details or monetary payment in order to receive your refund," said Group Manager Customer Services Eleanor Young.

In South Auckland, householders have recently contacted Inland Revenue about a scheme where callers to their homes claim to work with the Inland Revenue. When pressed, the callers changed this to being contracted by the department.

"This is an attempt to use the Inland Revenue logo and brand to steal confidential and personal information.

"We want to make our customers aware that the tax refund services that do exist to help people receive their refunds do not work for, or on behalf of, Inland Revenue. Customers should always check the person's ID and contact us if they are concerned in anyway.

"Any information that is given to these fraudsters can result in a business or individuals suffering identity and data theft."

Customers who want to manage their tax return themselves can always simply request a personal tax summary through Inland Revenue's myIR website. They will then be sent their personal tax summary and once confirming the amount online the refund will be automatically refunded into their bank account.

"The key thing to remember is that Inland Revenue will never issue a tax refund onto a credit card," Ms Young said.

Inland Revenue asks customers to keep their IRD numbers, tax information, online passwords and all other data safe at all times. If you have replied and given money or provided details please contact your bank or credit card provider immediately.

Inland Revenue welcomes Penny and Hooper decision
=================================================

**24 August 2011**

Inland Revenue has welcomed the Supreme Court decision in the Penny and Hooper Case.

Acting Commissioner of Inland Revenue, Mary Craig, said the decision upholds Inland Revenue's view, and a ruling by the Court of Appeal last year, that the income allocation or diversion arrangements constitutes tax avoidance.

The decision helps to clarify the law in this area, and Inland Revenue will carefully work through the implications, Ms Craig said.

Orthopaedic surgeons Mr Ian David Penny and Mr Gary John Hooper had entered into a tax avoidance arrangement, where they incorporated their businesses and drew a salary that enabled them to pay tax on the bulk of their income at a lower rate. Both men acknowledged that the salaries paid were not commercially realistic in those circumstances.

The Supreme Court upheld the earlier decision by the Court of Appeal, made in 2010.

However, while welcoming the decision, Inland Revenue will be taking a measured approach as to how it is applied.

"The decision does not mean that every incorporated business, or one that is managed through a family or trading trust, is a tax avoidance arrangement, and the Court gives clear advice on that," Ms Craig said.

The Court also confirmed that avoidance does not arise, despite a low salary being set, if particular circumstances are present - such as a business being in financial difficulty, or where there are capital investment requirements.  
"The issue is really about balancing various factors, such as how such entities are managed, and the deliberate use of companies and trusts to divert income and reduce a person's tax obligations. If one person is generating the profits, but is diverting their income into other structures and declaring a reduced salary for the financial benefit to themselves or their family, then that is tax avoidance," Ms Craig said.

Inland Revenue is focusing on those who have created similar structures, and use them in a non-commercial or contrived manner to minimise tax, as part of its ongoing compliance focus programme, set out in its publication "Helping you get it right".

Inland Revenue in 2010 published a Revenue Alert on the matter, in the [Revenue Alert RA 10/01](technical-tax/revenue-alerts/revenue-alert-ra1001.html)
. It is likely that this will now be updated.

Information on compliance with tax rules is available on the Inland Revenue website, in the "Getting it right" section, or people should contact their tax agent or advisor.

Inland Revenue’s Greg James: choose the provisional tax option that’s right for your business
=============================================================================================

**21 May 2018**

Following the introduction of the new accounting income method (AIM) there are now four options for managing provisional tax, so small businesses can use the one best suited to their particular needs.

AIM is available to businesses with annual turnover under $5 million, using accounting software, and allows the user to pay provisional tax only when the company is making a profit.

It joins the three existing options:

*   the traditional provisional tax product, known as standard uplift, where three payments are made each year based on your tax bill in the year previous plus 5%;
*   the GST ratio method, where provisional tax is calculated based on your GST supplies and is all paid along with your GST;
*   the estimate method, based on an estimate of likely earnings for the year.

These options are supported by a recent relaxing of rules meaning that fewer taxpayers need to make interest payments to Inland Revenue. AIM offers users even less exposure to the use-of-money-interest system as long as payments are made in full and on time.

The big difference with AIM is that the calculations are made by your business software, which both builds tax obligations into your usual business processes and means there’s less chance of over- or under-paying and falling into the interest system.

A further advantage is that if your business makes a loss you can get a refund of overpaid tax straight away rather than waiting until the end of the year.

![](/-/media/project/ir/home/media-releases/2018/inland-revenues-greg-james-choose-the-provisional-tax-option-thats-right-for-your-business/gregjames.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20210303221254&hash=6323154EA136BC81FC94C18A1B7176D4)

Inland Revenue Deputy Commissioner Greg James

AIM software providers tell us it should take an average business or tax agent around 30 minutes to set up the AIM software for their business and around five minutes for every two-monthly filing.

The beauty of AIM is that all the complexity of provisional tax is taken care of by the software so if you are a business that keeps good records during the year and has robust accounting practices, then AIM is no additional work.

We know that AIM won’t work for every small business and that’s why we have three other provisional tax options that we continually try to improve.

We are expecting uptake of AIM to grow steadily as the accounting industry adapts to new ways of working, the usage of accounting software grows in small businesses and the number of software providers offering it increases.

**Easing the burden**

Deciding which one to choose is a call for each business and its advisors to make but we are confident that AIM will be a great way to reduce compliance costs, particularly for businesses starting up, growing fast, or with irregular or seasonal income.

A business’s time burden should lessen year after year as the software improves and becomes more aligned with how you do business.

AIM requires a little set-up time before the first payment in order to plan for adjustments like depreciation and private expenditure but the resulting calculations are made by the software.

Subsequent filings are much quicker and easier since the software saves the previous adjustment settings. Each filing sends the company’s statement of activity to Inland Revenue but there’s still an end of year assessment to finally determine if the right amount of tax has been paid.

Customers have told us they’re worried about being caught out by data entry errors but the software allows plenty of opportunity to catch and correct those. Any mistakes that still manage to slip through are likely to be picked up in the end-of-year tax return process.

**Adapting to new ways of working**

We are seeing rapid change in the accounting industry driven by increasing use of technology. Alongside this, we see a demand from customers for real time financial information on how a business is tracking.

AIM is a product designed to meet that demand and respond to the new ways accountants are working.

There’s steady growth in the accounting software market as more accountants change their business practices and as the software continues to develop more functionality to meet the needs of a wider range of customers. We think the number of our customers preferring to file their tax directly from their software will only increase.

Our business transformation programme is about making all interactions with the tax system simpler and easier. We want all customers to be able to pay tax in a manner and format that works best in their life and their business.

Now is the time for businesses to see if AIM is the best provisional tax option for them. Existing businesses will need to opt in at the start of the tax year. For many, this will mean filing their first AIM payment and statement of activity at the end of June. New businesses can start using AIM as soon as they get up and running.

Inland Revenue’s Richard Owen: shifting your business to accounting software may be easier than you think
=========================================================================================================

**21 June 2018**

We often encounter a few raised eyebrows when we enthusiastically promote accounting software to small businesses.

It might appear a little out of place but we do it because we can see the transformative benefits software can offer small businesses and how easy it makes it for them to meet their tax obligations.

It’s no coincidence that Inland Revenue’s transformation is heavily focused on making sure that our systems can work seamlessly with the accounting software that businesses everywhere are adopting.

![](/-/media/project/ir/home/media-releases/2018/inland-revenues-richard-owen-shifting-your-business-to-accounting-software-may-be-easier-than-you-th/richard-owen.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20210303221255&hash=687BCA8516BC05FC966F549FA595FD8E)

Inland Revenue customer segment leader Richard Owen

We are creating future services that are designed to simplify the ways a customer interacts with the tax system. Many of these initiatives will be further enhanced when accounting software is used as the technology will link directly with our systems, which makes doing your accounts and paying your tax a smoother process.

However, we understand some customers remain unsure about whether software can truly work for them.

So we conducted a survey of customers who were already using the technology to see how they are finding it.

The results are encouraging: 90% of accounting software users surveyed have found the transition to software easy and those who have made the switch are noticing it saves them time and money, with 81% saying they now spend less time managing their tax.

So clearly, using software is easier than some people may think.

Many businesses and their accountants currently manage their books across two systems – they might have a spread sheet to record all their activity and then have to copy much of that information across to myIR in order to file their taxes.

Software packages are now available that perform all the appropriate calculations and are linked directly to Inland Revenue.

This has already happened with calculating and filing GST and now there’s a provisional tax option called AIM or the accounting income method, which integrates into a business’s usual processes to reduce the chance of over- or under-paying provisional tax. Payment is only required when the company is making a profit.

AIM is quite clearly a game changer for provisional tax but we don’t expect customers to rush to it straight away. People will look at what their peers are doing and how it’s working for them first – but we believe momentum will build up.

Payday filing of all employment information such as PAYE, KiwiSaver and student loan deductions will be mandatory for most businesses from April 2019 so the equivalent of employer monthly schedules will need to be submitted when employees are paid.

Software users will have the capability to file directly to IR, which removes that extra compliance step. In fact some businesses have already adopted payday filing, which has been optional from April this year. Those who haven’t should be considering how to make it part of their business practices before it becomes compulsory, and talk to their software or payroll providers about how they can help.

We are working to integrate tax into everyday business practices to make compliance quicker and easier and the technology helps us achieve this.

When 90% of software users surveyed say the transition was easy and 81% are saying it saves them time, the case becomes compelling to make the switch and ease the pressure to meet your tax obligations.

Inland Revenue’s Tony Morris – let’s bust the myth about robot tax investigators
================================================================================

**04 October 2018**

The use of automated algorithms is disrupting industries across the world and tax administration is certainly no exception.

We at Inland Revenue have been using versions of this technology for years to make sense of large volumes of data and to pick out trends in information such as taxpayers’ filing and payment behaviour.

The big difference these days is that the technology is performing these tasks much faster and is organising the data in such a way that allows us to make better decisions more efficiently. It’s a lot more effective than the ‘Ctrl F’ keyword search that many of our compliance officers will remember using in the past.

What hasn’t changed is that real human beings control the process and are central to the technology being a success. So let’s quickly dissolve the myth about robot tax investigators busting tradies for not declaring cash jobs – it just doesn’t happen and never will.

Our people will continue to make all the decisions about when to open a case for investigation and how to handle the data and insights that are produced.

![](/-/media/project/ir/home/media-releases/2018/inland-revenues-tony-morris--lets-bust-the-myth-about-robot-tax-investigators/tony-morris.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20210303221258&hash=5FCEE0570CFCBCB3E056713A8761DD8E)

Tony Morris, customer segment leader at Inland Revenue

Here’s an insight into how it works in practice: a smart data search might tell us that a group of small businesses may be underreporting income, compared to other businesses of their kind. Our first assumption will be that we have a group of businesses that need some help to get their taxes right. It might be that they don’t know how to comply or perhaps they need some advice on keeping good business records.

The next step is to try to help them out. It might not provide a great plot line for an action movie but this is the approach we prefer – we just want to help customers get their taxes right from the start.

Of course we’ll take action if a customer doesn’t want to comply or it becomes evident that they haven’t but this only happens after we exhaust all forms of assistance.

Our analytics technology helps ensure the data is telling us what we need to know, which is how we can help a customer stay on top of their tax obligations and receive the social policy payments to which they are entitled. Data is only ever used for these purposes and there are strict rules surrounding how we treat it, especially when it’s passed on from other agencies.

Algorithms are a part of any data analytics operation but at Inland Revenue they are used to help construct that story about the customer. Algorithms don’t make any decisions, only inform them. The ones IR uses are predictive in nature, programmed and checked by real people and the privacy of taxpayer information is always paramount.

The information we glean from analytics technology helps us make targeted interventions, which are designed to prevent the customer from running into further problems.

A big part of modern day tax administration is about turning the huge volume of data that comes to us digitally every day into useful information. Analytics technology gives us the ability to sort through that quickly and solve problems.

As it turns out, we are using technology to help customers far more often than we use it to make a case for auditing them.

Input tax deductions limited under s 21HB where the supplier and the recipient are associated persons
=====================================================================================================

2014 case note – Section 3A(3)(a) of the GST Act limits input tax deductions claimed under s 21HB where the supplier and the recipient are associated persons.

Case

TRA 008/14 \[2014\] NZTRA 15

Legislative References

Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The issue for the Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") was whether the input tax credit claimed by the disputant under s 21HB of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 ("GSTA") for the purchase of the house before 1 April 2011 is limited to zero, pursuant to s 3A(3) of the GSTA definition of "input tax", where the supply is from an associated person.

The TRA found that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue's ("the Commissioner's") decision to disallow the input tax credit claimed was correct. The TRA found that s 21HB of the GSTA is intended to have retrospective effect. It is the original acquisition of the goods or services with all of their attaching circumstances that is referred to in s 21HB(3) of the GSTA. Further, the purpose of the transitional rules contained in s 21HB was to put a registered person affected by the 2010 amendments in the same position that they would have been in had they carried on a taxable activity at the time they purchased the particular goods or services.

### Impact of decision

There is now authority that provides s 3A(3)(a) of the GSTA limits input tax deductions claimed under s 21HB where the supplier and the recipient are associated persons.

### Facts

This proceeding involved a challenge to the Commissioner's decision to disallow the input tax credit claimed for the purchase price of a property claimed in the disputant's goods and services tax ("GST") return for the period ended 30 September 2011. The property was used for the provision of short-term rental accommodation. The input tax credit claimed was disallowed on the basis it was limited to zero due to the associated person rules.

On 18 February 2005, Mr X purchased a residential property ("the Property") from an unregistered person for $635,000. No GST was included in the transaction as the property was a private residence. Mr X was not registered for GST in his personal capacity. From the date of the purchase until early 2007, Mr X spent in excess of $300,000 and many weekends making capital improvements to the Property.

During 2007, Mr X who then owned 99% of the shares in the disputant transferred the Property to the disputant, an associated person, for $1,100,000. The disputant treated the Property as a "dwelling" for GST purposes and considered the supply to be GST-exempt based on advice received from a tax specialist. An independent valuation of the Property and chattels as at 20 February 2007 showed the total value of the Property as being $1,100,000 (GST inclusive).

In 2010, the definition of "commercial dwelling" in s 2 of the GSTA was amended to include accommodation in homestays, farmstays, bed and breakfast establishments, and serviced apartments with effect from 1 April 2011. The definition of "dwelling" was also amended.

With effect from 1 April 2011, persons or businesses who supply short-term accommodation and whose total supplies in any 12-month period exceed the $60,000 threshold, were required to register for GST and charge GST on their supplies under s 51 of the GSTA. They were also entitled to claim GST input tax based on the various provisions of the GSTA.

Section 21HB of the GSTA was introduced in 2010 to allow taxpayers now falling under the new definition of "commercial dwelling" to apply for input tax credits on goods or services originally not acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies.

On 28 June 2012, the disputant registered for GST with effect from 1 April 2011. The first GST return for the six-month period ending 30 September 2011 was filed on 14 September 2012.

This GST return included an input tax credit claim for the value of the property and for the extensive renovations/refurbishments carried out by Mr X during his period of ownership and also by the disputant. The portion of the input tax credit claim which relates solely to the acquisition of the Property is $119,622.87.

The disputant's claim for input tax for the period ended 30 September 2011 was allowed in part by the Commissioner but disallowed in relation to the purchase price of the Property on the basis the associated person rules in s 3A(3)(a) of the GSTA limited the GST claimed to zero. The calculation contained in s 3A(3)(a) of the GSTA relating to associated persons is the lesser of the following three amounts:

1.  the tax included in the original cost of the goods to the supplier (being zero); and
2.  the tax fraction of the purchase price ($119,628.07); and
3.  the tax fraction of the open market value of the supply ($119,628.07).

### Decision

The disputant argued that the correct interpretation of s 21HB(3) of the GSTA was that the only attribute of the original supply attached to the acquisition was that of cost. The disputant submitted that the acquisition, being the purchase of the property, claimed under s 21HB(3) is a statutory fiction by which the goods or services are deemed to have been acquired on 1 April 2011 at the original cost of supply but with no other attaching attributes of the original supply.

The disputant argued that the Commissioner's interpretation of s 21HB (that the disputant is not eligible for a 15% input tax credit and on any future sale of the property the disputant will only be able to retain 85% of the sale proceeds) effectively deprives the disputant of part of its assets. The disputant argued that this results in unfairness that Parliament could not have intended.

The Commissioner submitted that it is the original acquisition of the goods or services with all of their attaching circumstances that is referred to in s 21HB(3) of the GSTA. The Commissioner argued this interpretation is supported by s 21HB(2) which provides that the disputant is entitled to an input tax deduction under s 20(3C) to the extent to which a deduction has not been made under the old apportionment rules. Such a deduction could only have been made on the original supply of the goods, not a fictional supply.

Further, the Commissioner submitted that in considering s 21HB of the GSTA, it is necessary to consider s 3A(3)(a) and the amended definition of "associated persons" which was intended to remove the incentive for persons to enter into transactions primarily to gain a significant tax advantage. Its specific purpose was to limit the input tax credit available in relation to supplies of secondhand goods between associated parties to remove the tax advantages. While the associated persons limitation in s 3A(3)(a) can be unfair where a taxpayer acquires goods or services from an associated person for legitimate reasons, this unfairness was acknowledged and a conscious choice by Parliament.

In addition, the Commissioner submitted that Parliament was aware when it implemented the associated persons regime that it would create inequity between transactions entered into between associated persons and non-associated persons. However, this inequity was outweighed by the potential revenue consequences of the provisions. The purpose of s 21HB of the GSTA was to put a registered person affected by the 2010 amendments in the same position they would have been in had they carried on a taxable activity at the time they purchased the particular goods or services. To provide an associated person with an input credit deduction in the case of s 21HB of the GSTA would place associated persons in a more advantageous position than if the rules had not been put in place and would be inconsistent with the associated persons regime.

Judge Sinclair found the meaning of ss 21HB(2) and (3) of the GSTA plain and unambiguous. Further, Judge Sinclair was satisfied that on the wording of s 21HB(1) it is clear that s 21HB is intended to have retrospective effect. She accepted the purpose of the transitional rules contained in s 21HB were to put a registered person affected by the 2010 amendments in the same position they would have been in had they carried on a taxable activity at the time they purchased the particular goods or services. She found Parliament has done this by retaining the general input tax definition contained in s 3A(3)(a) which limits input tax deductions where the supplier and the recipient are associated persons.

Ngā rawa ōkiko kore Intangibles
===============================

New Zealand's transfer pricing rules are to be applied consistently with the OECD's Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations - July 2022. Guidance on intangible property arrangements is contained in Chapter VI of the guidelines.

[Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations (OECD)](https://www.oecd.org/tax/transfer-pricing/oecd-transfer-pricing-guidelines-for-multinational-enterprises-and-tax-administrations-20769717.htm)

For the purposes of the guidelines, paragraph 6.6 says an intangible is 'capable of being owned or controlled for use in commercial activities, and whose use or transfer would be compensated had it occurred in a transaction between independent parties in comparable circumstances' and is 'not a physical asset or financial asset'.

Identifying intangibles
-----------------------

It is important that intangibles are clearly identified. Companies must be able to demonstrate that they add significant and substantial value if large royalty payments are to be substantiated. We ask similar questions to those raised by the Australian Taxation Office in this regard.

1.  Have all intangible profit drivers been individually identified (including goodwill and any licensed intangibles)?
2.  What is the value of all intangibles owned and used by the company and have they been valued by a professional firm?
3.  Is the intangible protected?
4.  Who bore the cost of creating the intangible?
5.  How and to what extent does the intangible contribute to the profit?
6.  Has an intangible been assigned and if so what was the consideration?

The most common way of identifying intangibles created locally is through close examination of research and development costs and remuneration data (high pay for special skills leading to greater value-added / non-routine intangibles). We pay close attention to such data to ensure that due recognition is being given to the creation of valuable intangibles in New Zealand.

A common issue that seems to be roundly ignored is that any substantial business carries with it goodwill. Attributing all intangible value to trademarks, trade names and so forth can only be done by ascribing a nil value to goodwill. In the context of any well-established business, such a position is hard to support.

Inbound royalties
-----------------

Inbound licensing of intangibles, including royalty charges, is a current focus. The following checklist might be useful to companies involved in licensing arrangements with offshore associates.

| Question | Checklist |
| --- | --- |
| 1   | Is there an up-to-date licensing agreement in place? |
| 2   | Does the agreement clearly identify the intangible property being supplied and accurately reflect the commercial arrangement for the New Zealand market, or is it merely a standard document used in many markets? |
| 3   | Does the intangible property add significant and substantial value to the New Zealand business operations taking into account existing valuable goodwill, a monopoly or duopoly position, local know how or other domestic intangibles? |
| 4   | If a royalty is paid for the use of the intangible property, has a standard global/regional rate been used or has the rate been customised to the circumstances of the New Zealand business? |
| 5   | Some activities of the licensee may not require use of the intangible property - have these been excluded from royalty computations? |
| 6   | If a royalty is paid for the use of any intangible property, does the taxpayer produce appropriate profits for its functions, assets (including its own intangibles) and risks after payment of the royalty? |
| 7   | Has the 25% rule been used as a cross-check? (Note: 25% of earnings-before-interest-tax-and-exceptional-items and royalties is generally considered towards the top end of sums payable to a licensor absent unusual circumstances.) |
| 8   | If royalties are high relative to earnings derived from the intangible property, has consideration been given to renegotiating the terms of the license? If not, why not? |
| 9   | Has non-resident withholding tax been deducted and at the correct rate? |
| 10  | Has any additional assistance been provided from offshore in connection with the supply of scientific, technical or commercial knowledge or information? (Such assistance may also be subject to non-resident withholding tax.) |

It is the responsibility of local management to ensure a company's transfer prices are in accordance with the arm's-length principle. Where substantial royalties are incurred to offshore associates, we suggest you seriously consider the possibility of working cooperatively with us to obtain an advance pricing agreement.

The 25% rule
------------

We apply the 25% rule in our risk assessment analyses to select transfer pricing cases for further review. Inbound royalty amounts exceeding the 25% rule are initially assigned a high risk rating pending further review. We recommend that taxpayers also consider applying this as a cross-check.

Profit Split Method
-------------------

In New Zealand the profit split method is not commonly selected as the most appropriate method. This method can be very subjective and difficult to apply in practice.  We recommend that taxpayers who apply the profit split method as their primary method also consider applying a secondary method as a cross-check.

Intangible property transfers
-----------------------------

The transfer of intangible property out of New Zealand, particularly where it's intended that the property be subsequently licensed back to the original property owner, will continue to be a focus area for us.

The transfer of bundled intangible property or 'catch-all' transfers, as compared with the transfer of specific legally protectable property, will be subject to the highest degree of scrutiny. In these cases, care must be taken to ensure that bundled transfers do not include property that is inseparable from the business from which it has been generated, for example goodwill.

In all cases, it's important to be able to identify:

*   what is being sold
*   who developed it
*   who currently owns it
*   whether or not it is capable of sale.

A thorough examination of the legal arrangements implemented to effect the transfer is also critical. A valuation of the intangible property can only be undertaken once all of the facts are fully understood in context.

Location savings
----------------

Local market features are considered in a comparability analysis, but as confirmed in the OECD guidelines, are not intangibles for transfer pricing purposes. Although we currently have no issues on hand, we're aware that the treatment of location savings, particularly the value attributed to location savings vis-à-vis other factors, is an area of growing contention globally.

We're concerned that in some cases the value arising from location savings is hypothetical and not borne out when comparisons are made with comparables. We see this as another area where the arm's length outcome can only be properly determined by reference to the specific facts of the case, and recommend taxpayers contact us if experiencing difficulties.

Intelligence-led
================

The objective of the Intelligence-led workstream was to lay the foundation to transform Inland Revenue into a truly intelligence-led organisation. This meant using the right information at the right time to make the right decisions for our customers and for Inland Revenue. To do this we needed trusted information, knowledge, and intelligence.

![Chevron showing data, information, knowledge, action, result](/-/media/project/ir/home/graphics/about-us/buisness-transformation/business-transformation-guide/intel-led.png?modified=20220509212124)

It was identified that being intelligence-led would help Inland Revenue to:

*   protect and increase the revenue we collect for the Crown
*   make it easier for customers to comply
*   be a more efficient organisation.

While the Intelligence-led workstream has ended, intelligence-led is a cultural anchor for Inland Revenue and we expect to see the organisation’s capabilities and application of information technology continue to grow.

Incremental transformation of the entire information ecosystem.

The Intelligence-led workstream comprised of several projects iteratively delivered from 2017 through to 2021, including:

*   Implementation of the Enterprise Content Management System (Stax).
*   Implementation of the advanced analytics platform, also known as the Data Intelligence Platform (DIP).
*   Creation of reports for each major release of the new tax administration system.
*   Replacement of IR’s knowledge base (an information resource for frontline staff).
*   Replacement of IR’s intranet.
*   Implementation of enterprise search.
*   Replacement of the summation evidence management system.
*   Implementation of guided help functionality for frontline staff and on the Inland Revenue website for customers.
*   Cleansing, archiving and retention of information and data from heritage platforms.

The transformation reaches beyond technology, to include new organisational capabilities, new ways of working, and new operating models. Investment in capability uplift for our people was included as part of the workstream. Nothing was left untouched.

Executive sponsorship key to complete transformation and new transformational approach
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Getting the senior level mandate to scrap the old rule book and do things differently is key. A strong executive sponsor is essential. This is because the benefits are often incremental and not immediately visible, and the effort required to effect the change at an enterprise level is significant. The benefits are long term and transformational.

Connected ‘one team’ approach essential for effective and lasting transformation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Blended project teams delivered each of the changes. These were a combination of BT programme team members (bringing project resources, discipline and change expertise) and the enduring Inland Revenue business team (bringing subject-matter expertise and the eventual owners of the solutions). This ensured the solution was fit for purpose. It also resulted in increased capabilities through the project and a relatively seamless transition of knowledge and ownership at its close.

‘Start last, finish first’ – More time in preparation for a speedier delivery
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Intelligence-led workstream applied a 'start last, finish first' approach to ensure the bulk of the work was completed before migration started. This includes understanding how the new system works and the types of information and data it generates before any information/data migration begins.

Once this is well understood, the subject matter experts use the knowledge of the new system to appropriately cleanse the existing information and data ready for migration.

When this is complete, the cleansed information and data is put into the new system as part of the system’s next release. This ensures the new system has “clean” information and data right from the start.

Targeted change management and communications critical to embed intelligence-led culture
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As well as introducing new technology solutions, the Intelligence-led workstream also needed to begin embedding ‘intelligence-led’ as an anchor of Inland Revenue’s culture. This required a targeted, inclusive and all-encompassing change and communication approach that would extend beyond the close of the workstream.

Investing in experienced change and communications resources was critical to ensure the changes were delivered and embedded effectively and efficiently. For the data project, this involved an external agency specialising in technology working alongside the business. For the information project, this involved a mix of internal Inland Revenue and contracted expertise.

Change activity was carefully planned and managed to ensure the timing and approach didn’t conflict with other organisational activity and to ensure team leaders and frontline teams weren’t overburdened. As appropriate, approaches were shared with workforce planning teams for feedback.

Intelligence-led projects were often competing with other high-priority activities for airtime. This meant it was important to think outside the box when developing the change and communication approaches. In addition to traditional communication channels, we developed games, quizzes and webinars to get key messages across.

People-led design for greater adoption
--------------------------------------

It was important to the success of the Intelligence-led projects that change was seen not to be happening to our people but with them.

We took time to understand the changes from a user perspective through impact assessments and user testing. We also engaged users in system design, from early design workshops to regular check-ins through our interactive webinars for staff. It was important that any feedback from staff was acknowledged and fed-back through regular communication channels.

To ensure change activity was appropriately tailored, we took a leader-led change approach and tailoring activities according to user groups (for example, different levels of training and support were allocated according to use of the system). Some of the change activity included training and the use of change champions to support users during go-lives and post-go live.

Recommendations from implementing the advanced analytics platform
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The new advanced analytics platform was delivered jointly with the enterprise data analytics team as the business owner in 2019-2020. This was one of the first projects within Inland Revenue to implement co-design using true agile methodology.

The enterprise data analytics team started in the passenger seat but transitioned to the ‘drivers’ of platform by the close of the project with coaching and support from BT.

*   A clear direction was crucial for a common sense of purpose and guidance. However, we recognised the path would always be grey in some areas, and at times enduring Inland Revenue teams would go backwards before they were able to move forward.
*   We created principles to live by, targeting incremental pieces of value delivery rather than big change, creating a new delivery model and allowing people to learn the tools in practice and on the job through blended vendor teams who acted as mentors as well as formal training.
*   It was important to be persistent, move quickly and be able to fail fast. This means accepting that mistakes will happen, to learn from them and move on rather than be punitive.
*   Do not underestimate the effort needed to change. Take the time to develop a thorough people plan for those who will eventually own the system and consider people/team culture, context and environment.
*   There is no ‘final state’. Remember to emphasize the incremental shift approach. While the size of the shifts may get smaller, change and improvement is continuous.
*   It takes courage, skill and creative participation on everyone’s part to be successful.
*   For impacted teams, work with them and take them on the change journey.
*   One of the best practices was the enterprise data analytics team’s agile quarterly planning, involving large room/scaled planning and co-design with accountable stakeholders. This allowed the team to collaborate, align and sequence their workload and resource to meet competing demands including day to day analytics work requests. As a result, people learn how to work differently as collaborative groups, adopt and use the new tools, data and analytics to better inform their decision making to deliver better outcomes for Inland Revenue and our customers.

Recommendations from implementing an enterprise records management system
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The enterprise records management system (Stax) was implemented with the information and knowledge management team as the business owner in 2018-2019.

*   Build a strong working relationship with vendors early on to ensure understanding and expectations are met in a timely manner.
*   Treat information management clean-up as a priority – do not underestimate the amount of effort that comes with migrating content from the old to the new system and make sure to give content owners enough time to clean up their content.
*   Plan for education and training activity to embed new systems, capabilities and practices.
*   Adapt to user needs, technology and techniques as they evolve. Understand how people work with content in their teams (for example, how they think about and find content, how they structure some of their work within their teams and work together such as case work), amount of content, and time to prepare content for migration.
*   Have an enterprise content model for your information and knowledge systems before rolling them out so people know when and how to use each system. Understand how various content systems must work together, how they need to be designed and how people should use them.
*   Coordinating a combination of tools is best. We moved from a centralised view of ‘one repository for everything,’ to a federated multi-systems view using the best tool for the job – connected by our new enterprise search and intranet replacement.
*   It's important to develop an understanding of the information and knowledge management tool set and leverage the advanced capabilities to make it easier for users.
*   Have clear guidance and support people in using the tool set in a way that helps them deliver value for our customers.
*   Open by default is a big shift for many people. It’s important to continuously support and encourage people to share information and knowledge so that reusable IP can be built over time, as well as continue to refine monitoring and scanning processes to support appropriate information protection where required.
*   There is real value in going beyond traditional knowledge management which tends to focus on explicit knowledge (captured and codified knowledge) to the detriment of tacit knowledge from people’s insights and experience. Cultural change is better supported through modern knowledge management techniques. Continuously grow and develop these techniques and promote stronger networks, connections and meaningful conversations to empower staff.
*   Metadata is critical. Understanding the minimum mandatory metadata that must be common in all content management systems to facilitate cross-system searchability and ensure that any item of information could be easily retained, discovered, managed, used and disposed.
*   Take an outside-in view of information. Data is just data. Information requires constant reference to the user experience to shape the outcomes from the project.

Recommendations from introducing a modern intranet replacement with enterprise search
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The aim of the Intelligent Information Project was to develop a place for Inland Revenue people to connect and find the enterprise-wide information they need when they need it. It wasn’t just an internet replacement. It was an opportunity to connect all our information sources through a powerful new search engine.

*   The change effort has been deliberately low-key and successfully fronted by business owners. This still meant investing in change and communications to achieve this result and ensure the change activities were well planned and managed. There will be ongoing effort needed to maximise benefits of the technology such as shifting to 'search first behaviour.'
*   A search first experience is reliant on content that is written with the person who needs it in mind, not how the author thinks about it. The language needs to make sense to the search terms used; the onus is on the content writers to know their audience.
*   People’s understanding that this is more than an intranet replacement and how information is connected from different systems through a new search engine gradually increases as more systems are connected, and people experience the search capability, personalisation and mobility of the new intranet.
*   The intelligent search that is being used on both the external websites and for the intranet is extremely powerful. The information and knowledge management team have been using it to discover content in different systems and working with the content owners to permission the content appropriately.
*   Engagement with our people directly and with the business has resulted in a better sense of ownership and positive feedback about how we have made the effort to listen and helped us evolve what we have delivered.
*   Working with other teams to leverage their expertise and passion for content has meant that the delivery of the change has been championed by many people rather than pushed by the project team. The project team has on occasion been the ‘silent partner’ in the background supporting rather than fronting every deliverable.
*   The use of webinars and the Change Champion network have been a great way of sharing what we are doing and getting feedback into the design.
*   Building capability in the business alongside the project team is critical in ensuring successful transition and ongoing embedding of the change.

Intention or purpose of one or more trustees attributable to trust as a whole
=============================================================================

2013 case note – intention/purpose of some trustees - whether amounts derived on disposal of properties income - GST, shortfall penalties, gross carelessness.

Case

TRA 019/11

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 1994 and 2004, Tax Administration Act 1994, Goods and Services Tax Act 1985

### Summary

The decision by the Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") held that two of the three trustees, Mr and Mrs B, had the intention or purpose to sell when each of the relevant properties was acquired. This intention or purpose was attributable to the Trust as a whole, despite the third trustee asserting that she had no such purpose or intention.

The TRA also held that the Trust's activities amounted to a business of erecting buildings and a taxable activity for goods and services tax ("GST") purposes. Accordingly, the trustees of the Trust were found to be jointly and severally liable to pay income tax and GST output tax on the sale proceeds from seven properties. The TRA also found that shortfall penalties for gross carelessness applied.

### Impact of decision

The TRA's decision that the intentions or purposes of some, but not all, of the trustees of a trust can be attributed to the Trust as a whole, is an important one. It appears to confirm the approach taken in CIR v Boanas (2008) 23 NZTC 22,046 (HC) in relation to the intentions of partners in a partnership. It is worth noting that the TRA also considered that from a broader perspective, it would result in "an extraordinary outcome if a trust can simply ignore the unanimous trustee requirement in its day to day operation and then be able to take advantage of that requirement when considering its tax obligations". Such a comment also appears to echo the Court of Appeal's sentiments in _Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Newmarket Trustees Ltd_ \[2012\] NZCA 351; \[2012\] NZLR 207.

### Facts

The disputants are the trustees of the B Family Trust ("the Trust"). The Trust was settled on 9 October 1996 by Mr and Mrs B, who were also appointed as trustees and were the primary beneficiaries of the Trust. Mr and Mrs B's solicitor, Ms X, was also a professional trustee for the majority of the periods in dispute.

Over a 12-year period between September 1996 and September 2008, the Trust bought and sold 11 properties. Ten of those properties were purchased as vacant sections and the Trust had houses built on nine of those ten properties. Mr and Mrs B lived in each of the newly built houses for between two and ten months before selling them, with the exception of the tenth property, which they occupied for two and a half years.

Following an audit, the Commissioner issued default assessments to the Trust for income tax and GST on the sale proceeds from seven of the 11 properties. This was on the basis that:

1.  the properties were bought with the purpose or intention of resale; and/or
2.  the Trust was in the business of erecting buildings; and
3.  the buying, improving, and selling of the seven properties constituted a taxable activity for GST purposes.

The Trust was also assessed for shortfall penalties on the basis that it had been grossly careless in taking its tax position or, alternatively, failed to take reasonable care.

The trustees disputed the Commissioner's assessments and filed a challenge proceeding in the TRA.

### Decision

#### Attributing purpose or intention to the Trust

The disputant submitted that for the purposes of section CD 1(2)(a) of the Income Tax Act 1994 and 2004 ("the ITA"), the intention or purpose of sale must be attributable to the Trust as a whole, not just to individual trustees. Therefore, where intention or purpose is not unanimous, it cannot be regarded as an intention or purpose of the Trust. If just one of the trustees did not have the intention or purpose to sell when the relevant properties were acquired, it could not be concluded that the Trust as a whole had the intention or purpose to sell either. The disputant referred to the fact that the Deed of Trust required the decisions of the trustees to be made unanimously in support of this proposition.

The Commissioner contended that if Mr and Mrs B, acting in their capacities as trustees, had the intention or purpose of resale, the fact that Ms X may have had other intentions or purposes did not defeat the application of section CD 1(2)(a) of the ITA.

In finding for the Commissioner, the TRA agreed with the Commissioner's submission, that section CD 1(2)(a) of the ITA specifically provides that the intention or purpose to sell need only be one of a number of intentions and purposes and does not need to be the dominant intention or purpose. The TRA also accepted the Commissioner's submission that it does not necessarily follow that Trustees had to be unanimous as to their intention for the future use of that land. There may be situations where trustees have different intentions. The TRA also considered that even if that approach was not correct, Ms X knew that Mr and Mrs B were entering into agreements for the sale and purchase of land. Ms X allowed her co-trustees to enter into these transactions and she was therefore estopped from denying that she approved the decisions of Mr and Mrs B. The Commissioner also contended that Mr and Mrs B were acting on behalf of the Trust when they purchased and sold Trust land and that it was clear from the evidence that Ms X was aware of her co-trustees' activities. As a consequence, all the trustees were bound by the decisions and actions of Mr and Mrs B.

The TRA concluded that in the circumstances, the intention of Mr and Mrs B could be attributed to the Trust.

#### Were the amounts derived on the disposal of the seven properties income?

##### Purpose or intention of sale

While the Commissioner contended that the Trust had acquired the relevant properties with the purpose or intention of sale, the Trust argued that when each of the relevant properties was acquired, the Trust had not intended to sell them. Instead, the Trust asserted that the intention was that each property would become Mr and Mrs B's long-term family home (as beneficiaries). Mr and Mrs B then gave evidence that shortly after each house was completed, unforeseen events occurred that required them to sell.

After considering the evidence, the TRA held that the Trust failed to prove on the balance of probability that, at the time of acquisition of each of the properties, the Trust did not have at least one intention or purpose of sale. The TRA found that Mr and Mrs B were not credible witnesses and that their alternative explanations for why each property had to be sold lacked credibility and were not supported by any contemporaneous documentation or evidence.

##### Business of erecting buildings

The Trust contended that it was not in the business of erecting buildings. This was on the basis that not only were the Trust's activities not carried out in a coherent and organised way, but that the Trust also lacked the necessary intention to make a profit. It was argued that the Trust did not have a coherent business plan nor did it maintain business records. In addition, it was argued that even if Mr and Mrs B had an intention to make a profit, that intention was not shared by Ms X and therefore the requisite intention to profit could not be attributed to the Trust as a whole.

Despite accepting that the Trust had not maintained business records, the TRA nonetheless held that the Trust's activities of purchasing sections, building houses and selling them on, were carried out in a coherent and organised way. For the reasons discussed earlier, the TRA disagreed with the Trust's "unanimous intention" argument, finding that the Trust as a whole had an intention to profit. For reasons covered in the TRA's analysis of the intention/ purpose/issue, the TRA also found that the relevant properties had been acquired for the purpose of the business of erecting buildings, and that in any case, the properties were disposed of within the applicable 10-year period after each house was completed.

##### Exemption for residential land

The TRA held that the "residential exemption" in section CD 1(3) of the ITA would only apply if a dwelling was used "primarily and principally" as a residence, and only if the taxpayer is not engaged in a regular pattern of acquiring and disposing or acquiring and erecting buildings (see _Case K21_ (1988) 10 NZTC 218 (TRA); _Case M102_ (1990) 12 NZTC 2,634 (TRA) and _Parry v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (1984) 6 NZTC 61,820 (HC)).

The TRA agreed with the Commissioner's contention that the occupation of each property (with the exception of property five which was sold before being built on) was incidental to the more significant purpose of sale and as such the properties were not occupied "primarily or principally" as residences. The TRA also held that section CD 1(3) did not apply because the Trust was engaged in the acquisition of sections, construction of dwelling houses and subsequent sales to such an extent that a regular pattern of was established.

#### Is the Trust liable to account for GST output tax?

In line with the TRA's finding that the Trust was engaged in the business of erecting dwelling houses on the properties, the TRA also found that the Trust's activities of buying land, building houses and on-selling the developed properties constituted a taxable activity. As a consequence, the Trust was deemed to have been registered for GST and required to account for GST output tax on the sale proceeds from the properties.

The TRA did not accept the Trust's argument that the activities of buying, building and selling occurred simply as a series of "one off" transactions, and that the activities occurred on an intermittent basis.

#### Shortfall penalties

The TRA found that in view of the large number of sections that the Trust had purchased, improved and sold, there was a high risk of a tax shortfall occurring. The scale and duration of the activities undertaken by the trustees meant that the risk was an obvious and serious one. Because a reasonable person in the circumstances of the trustees would have foreseen the risk, the TRA concluded that shortfall penalties for gross carelessness had to apply.

[New rules for taxing controlled foreign companies and foreign dividends](/new-legislation/act-articles/2009-34/taxation/new-rules "New rules for taxing controlled foreign companies and foreign dividends")

Interest allocation rules
=========================

2009 amendment applies the interest allocation rules to NZ residents with interests in CFCs. The rules are designed to prevent excessive interest deductions.

**_Subpart FE of the Income Tax Act 2007_**

Subpart FE has been amended to apply the interest allocation rules to New Zealand residents with interests in CFCs. These rules are designed to prevent excessive interest deductions being allocated against the New Zealand tax base.

### Key features

Interest allocation rules have been extended to outbound entities: New Zealand residents with an income interest in a CFC. The existing safe harbours apply. Interest deductions are not restricted unless the New Zealand group debt percentage is more than 75 percent (and, for a company or a trustee, is also more than 110 percent of the worldwide group debt percentage).

An outbound entity will not typically be required to apportion interest expenditure unless New Zealand group assets are less than 90 percent of the assets of the worldwide group and the total interest deductions of the New Zealand group are more than $250,000. In addition, an adjustment mechanism has been introduced for outbound entities with finance costs of less than $2 million. This eliminates apportionment for outbound entities with finance costs of up to $1 million and provides tapered relief for those with finance costs between $1 million and $2 million.

Various changes have been made to the definitions of "debt" and "assets" in subpart FE. Fixed-rate foreign equity and fixed-rate shares held by New Zealand residents are now included when determining total group debt for the New Zealand group. Equity investments in CFCs are no longer included within the total group assets of the New Zealand group. The rules for measuring the debt of the worldwide group have been aligned with those for measuring the debt of the New Zealand group.

### Detailed analysis

#### _Application of rules to outbound entities_

Previously, the interest allocation rules only applied to New Zealand taxpayers controlled by a single non-resident. Subpart FE has been amended so that the rules also apply to outbound entities - New Zealand-resident companies, individuals and trustees with an income interest in a CFC (sections FE 1(1)(a)(i) and FE 2(1)(e) to (f)).

The safe harbours set out in section FE 5 apply to outbound entities as well as to entities controlled by non-residents. Thus, an outbound entity will not be subject to restriction of its interest deductions under subpart FE unless it has a New Zealand group debt percentage that is more than 75 percent (and, for a company or a trustee, is also more than 110 percent of the worldwide group debt percentage).

Additional carve-outs apply to outbound entities by virtue of section FE 5(1B). There is an exemption from the requirement to apportion interest expenditure if:

*   the value of New Zealand group assets is 90 percent or more of the value of the assets of the worldwide group; or
*   total interest deductions of the New Zealand group are not more than $250,000 and the group does not include an entity with an income interest in a CFC that derives rent from land in the country or territory in which the CFC is resident.

#### _Apportionment of interest_

Section FE 6 contains the formula for apportioning interest for an excess debt entity. The effect of the formula, when it applies, is to produce an additional amount of income for the entity. As well as interest, the formula includes dividends paid in relation to fixed-rate foreign equity or fixed-rate shares (subsections (2) and (3)(ab)).

An adjustment mechanism has been introduced for outbound entities with finance costs of less than $2 million (subsections (2) and (3)(ac)). The effect of the adjustment is to eliminate apportionment under this section for outbound entities with finance costs of up to $1 million. For outbound entities with finance costs of between $1 million and $2 million, tapered relief is available, gradually reducing as costs increase towards the $2 million cut-off point.

#### _Determination of New Zealand group_

For an outbound entity that is a company (an excess debt outbound company), the New Zealand group is determined by reference to the New Zealand parent (section FE 12(4)). The group comprises those companies for which control can be traced from the parent (section FE 28). The meaning of "control" for these purposes is determined under section FE 27. The New Zealand parent is identified under section FE 26 by tracing ownership interests up the chain of companies on a tier-by-tier basis until no New Zealand-resident company has an ownership interest of 50 percent or more in the last company in the chain (subsection (4B))

For an outbound entity that is an individual or a trustee, the New Zealand group is determined under section FE 3. It includes all associated persons who are resident or have a fixed establishment in New Zealand or who derive New Zealand-sourced income that is not relieved under a double tax agreement. Excess debt outbound companies, and those within the New Zealand group of such companies, are not included.

The associated persons rules prevent the use of non-arm's-length arrangements to undermine the intent of the income tax legislation. In the context of the interest allocation rules, the application of these rules is intended to stop the use of close associates to bring excessive levels of debt within the New Zealand tax base, contrary to the policy intent. The rules governing when a person is associated with an individual or a trustee are set out in sections YB 1 to YB 16. Those provisions are discussed in detail elsewhere in this report.

Section FE 29 provides that companies or groups owned by the same natural person or trustee are to form a single New Zealand group.

#### _Determination of worldwide group_

It may also be necessary to determine the worldwide group of a company or a trustee that is an outbound entity, for the purposes of calculating the worldwide group debt percentage. For a company, the worldwide group is determined under sections FE 31B and FE 32 and includes the company, its New Zealand group, and its worldwide GAAP group (being all non-residents required to be included with the company in consolidated financial statements under generally accepted accounting practice). For a trustee, the worldwide group is determined under section FE 3 and includes the trustee, the trustee's New Zealand group, and all CFCs in which either the trustee or another member of the New Zealand group has an income interest.

#### _Measurement rules_

The general measurement rules set out in subpart FE apply to outbound entities for the purposes of calculating total group debt and total group assets of the New Zealand and worldwide groups. In particular, the New Zealand group debt percentage can be measured on various dates (section FE 8). Various bases for the valuation of total group assets may also be used (section FE 16), and the on-lending concession under section FE 13 applies to arm's-length debt provided by an outbound entity to its CFCs.

Various amendments have been made to the definitions of debt and assets in subpart FE. In particular:

*   Fixed-rate foreign equity and fixed-rate shares held by New Zealand residents are now included when determining total group debt for the New Zealand group under section FE 15.
*   Equity investments in CFCs are now excluded when determining total group assets for the New Zealand group under section FE 16.
*   The rules in section FE 18 for measuring the debt of the worldwide group have been aligned with those for measuring New Zealand group debt. Accordingly, non-interest bearing liabilities and liabilities that do not provide funds are no longer treated as debt for the worldwide group, even if they are included as debt under generally accepted accounting practice.

Interest deductibility
======================

On 23 March, the Government announced that [deductions for interest expenses on rental properties will be restricted](/news/2021/2021-03-23-government-property-announcements)
 from 1 October 2021.

On 10 June, the Ministers of Finance and Revenue [released a public consultation document](/news/2021/2021-06-10-interest-deductibility-consultation-launched)
, _[Design of the interest limitation rule and additional bright-line rules](/publications/2021/2021-dd-interest-limitation-and-bright-line-rules)
,_ seeking feedback on a range of **design issues for implementing that proposal**, including:

*   Interest on a mortgage on a residential investment property (acquired **before 27 March 2021**) will be gradually phased out between 1 October 2021 and 31 March 2025. Other interest would immediately cease to be deductible from 1 October 2021.
*   Land outside New Zealand would be excluded from the new rule as would a number of other types of properties.
*   Exemptions are proposed for property developers and for owners of new builds. In addition, initial or early owners of new builds would be subject to a five year bright-line test, rather than the ten year test.

The proposals do not affect a person’s main home.

*   limiting interest deductions on residential investment properties (the design of the rules [were consulted on](/news/2021/2021-06-10-interest-deductibility-consultation-launched)
    ).

In September 2021 the Government [released draft legislative proposals](/news/2021/2021-09-28-interest-limitation-proposals)
 aimed at limiting interest deductions for residential investment properties. These proposals will be considered by Parliament and may change.

In summary, residential investment properties capable of being used for long term accommodation would be subject to the proposed rules. However, the following exclusions and exemptions are proposed:

*   an exclusion for the main family home
*   exclusions for several types of residential property, and
*   exemptions for new builds and for property development.

The following information sheets provide general information about how the proposed rules are intended to work:

[Student Loan Scheme Amendment Act 2007](/new-legislation/act-articles/student-loan-scheme-amendment-act-2007 "Student Loan Scheme Amendment Act 2007")

Interest-free loans for borrowers studying full-time overseas as undergraduate level
====================================================================================

2007 amendment to the Student Loan Scheme Act means students studying full-time overseas at undergraduate level may be granted an interest-free student loan.

##### Section 38AJ of the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992

The Commissioner has been given the ability to grant borrowers studying full-time overseas at undergraduate level an interest-free loan.

### Background

The Commissioner previously had the ability to grant borrowers studying full-time overseas at postgraduate level an interest-free loan, but not those studying at undergraduate level.

### Key features

Section 38AJ gives the Commissioner the ability to grant borrowers studying full-time overseas at undergraduate level the full interest write-off which gives effect to interest-free student loans, if the Commissioner considers it fair and reasonable to do so.

For the exemption to apply, a borrower must provide the Commissioner with:

*   a document from the New Zealand Qualifications Authority (NZQA) verifying that the borrower's course is at undergraduate level;
*   evidence from the borrower's overseas education provider confirming that the applicant is enrolled full-time in the undergraduate course verified by the NZQA; and
*   all other information, and in the manner that the Commissioner may reasonably require, to establish whether the grounds for the grant of an exemption apply.

Study at undergraduate level means study that is assessed by the NZQA as being equivalent to level 7 on the New Zealand Register of Quality Assured Qualifications.

### Application date

The changes applied from 1 April 2007.

[Student Loan Scheme Amendment Act 2005](/new-legislation/act-articles/student-loan-scheme-amendment-act-2005 "Student Loan Scheme Amendment Act 2005")

"Interest-free" student loans for borrowers living in New Zealand
=================================================================

2005 amendments mean no interest on student loans for borrowers living in NZ. IR will give a full write-off for the period during which a borrower qualifies.

### Sections 37, 38, 38AA to 38AK, 41, 65A and 69 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992

New legislation gives effect to the government's decision not to charge interest on student loans for borrowers living in New Zealand. This will be achieved by way of Inland Revenue giving a full interest write-off for the period during which a borrower qualifies. With a small number of exceptions, borrowers living overseas will not be entitled to the interest write-off.

If borrowers do not qualify for the new interest write-off, they may still be eligible for a full interest write-off if they are studying, or a base interest write-off or reduction. Borrower eligibility for a base interest write-off or reduction has been restricted to two years for each.

### Background

The legislation addresses one of the government's stated objectives of encouraging student loan borrowers to remain in, or return to, New Zealand. The new legislation also addresses the government's concern over the affordability of tertiary education. Efforts to reduce debt have been limited for some borrowers because of the need to service interest payments. The removal of interest will reduce total debt and reduce the repayment times of borrowers.

### Key features

From 1 April 2006, all borrowers personally present in New Zealand for 183 or more consecutive days (the 183-day requirement) will qualify for a full interest write-off. If a period that would have been 183 or more consecutive days in New Zealand is broken by a period or periods in the aggregate of 31 days or less overseas, the time spent overseas will be treated as having been spent in New Zealand. Borrowers must be personally present in New Zealand for the first day of that 183-day period.

Borrowers who qualify will have all interest charges written off from the day they first met the 183-day requirement.

Once borrowers have qualified for the full interest write-off they will continue to be eligible for the write-off until they have been overseas for 184 consecutive days or more (a 184-day absence). If a period that would have been 184 or more consecutive days overseas is broken by a period or periods in the aggregate of 31 days or less in New Zealand, the time spent in New Zealand will be treated as having been spent overseas. Borrowers must be personally present overseas on the first day of a 184-day absence.

When borrowers cease to be eligible for the interest write-off, any interest charged from the first day of the 184-day absence will not be written off or, if already written off, will be reinstated.

Borrowers who are present in New Zealand for part of a day will be treated as being present in New Zealand for the whole of that day and not absent from New Zealand for any part of that day.

**Example one**  
Scott has been living in England for the last two years and returns to New Zealand to live here permanently on 1 June 2006. Scott meets the 183-day requirement on 30 November 2006 and is eligible to have all interest charged from 1 June 2006 written off.  
  
**Example two**  
Maria lives in New Zealand and travels to Australia for two weeks in May 2006. Maria would have spent 183 consecutive days in New Zealand from 1 April 2006 if she had not gone overseas. Because she spent 31 days or less overseas, in what otherwise would have been 183 days in New Zealand, the time spent in Australia is treated as if she had stayed in New Zealand. Maria will be eligible for a full interest write-off from 1 April 2006.  
  
**Example three**  
Lucy has been living in Fiji for two years. On 1 September 2006 Lucy returns to New Zealand for three months. Lucy does not meet the 183-day requirement and is not eligible for the interest write-off.  
  
**Example four**  
Tom lives in New Zealand and has met the 183-day requirement. On 1 December 2006 Tom goes to the UK to travel. Once Tom has been out of New Zealand for 184 days he ceases to be eligible for the interest write-off because he does not meet the criteria for an exemption. Any interest written off since 2 December 2006 (the day after he left New Zealand) will be reinstated.  
  
**Example five**  
Emily lives in New Zealand and has met the 183-day requirement. She moves to Australia on 1 January 2007. In March 2007 she returns to New Zealand for a one-week holiday before returning to Australia. Emily would have spent 184 consecutive days in Australia from 2 January 2007 if she had not returned to New Zealand for the one-week holiday. Because she spent 31 days or less in New Zealand, the time spent in New Zealand is treated as if she had stayed in Australia. Emily ceases to be eligible for the interest write-off, and any interest written off from 2 January 2007 will be reinstated.

#### Exemptions

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue may grant an exemption to the 183-day requirement in certain circumstances. Borrowers who are granted an exemption will qualify for the full interest write-off for the period for which the exemption is granted, even if they have a 184-day absence. For borrowers to be granted an exemption they must meet certain conditions and provide proof, as outlined below, to Inland Revenue that they meet these conditions. Borrowers must also provide any other information that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue may reasonably require to establish if an exemption applies.

All borrowers who meet the 183-day requirement or are granted one of the following exemptions will have an interest write-off credited to their student loan account after the end of each tax year (31 March).

Exemptions can be granted in the following circumstances:

##### Full-time study overseas at post-graduate level

Post-graduate study must be at levels equivalent to 8, 9 or 10 on the New Zealand Register of Quality Assured Qualifications under section 253(1)(c) of the Education Act 1989. For borrowers to be granted an exemption under this category they must provide the following proof:

*   documentation from New Zealand Qualifications Authority (NZQA) verifying that the post-graduate course is equivalent to levels 8, 9 or 10; and
*   evidence from the overseas education provider verifying full-time, post-graduate enrolment, for the course verified by the NZQA.

**Example six**  
Louise does not meet the 183-day requirement because she is doing her Masters in Arts at the London School of Economics and Political Science. She provides proof to Inland Revenue that she meets the criteria for the full-time study at post-graduate level exemption. She is granted an exemption and is eligible for the interest write-off.

##### Working for the New Zealand government

Borrowers who are away from New Zealand in the service in any capacity of the government of New Zealand - for example, a member of the armed forces - may qualify for an exemption.

**Example seven**  
John does not meet the 183-day requirement because he is working for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade at the New Zealand Embassy in the Cook Islands. John applies for, and is granted, an exemption. John is eligible for the interest write-off.

##### Unexpected delay in returning to New Zealand

Borrowers who are unexpectedly delayed in returning to New Zealand because of events or circumstances beyond their control may be eligible for the exemption. They must be resident for income tax purposes during the time in question and must provide proof:

*   of their intended return to New Zealand; and
*   that, had they returned to New Zealand as intended, they would have met the 183-day requirement; and
*   of the unexpected delay that resulted in their not being able to return to New Zealand as intended; and
*   that the unexpected delay was due to an event or circumstance beyond their reasonable control, such as:

*   an airline strike;
*   personal illness;
*   death of a family member;
*   fire, flood, storm, earthquake, landslide, volcanic eruption or other act of God;
*   an explosion or nuclear, biological, or chemical contamination; or
*   sabotage, terrorism or an act of war (whether declared or not).

**Example eight**  
Robert has met the 183-day requirement. He planned to travel overseas for five months but becomes unwell while overseas and cannot travel home to New Zealand for another two months. Robert has a 184-day absence overseas but applies to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue for an exemption. He provides proof that he was unexpectedly delayed in returning to New Zealand, is granted an exemption and continues to be eligible for the interest write-off for the entire time he was overseas.

##### Unplanned absence

Borrowers who have an unplanned absence owing to an event or circumstances beyond their control may be eligible for the exemption. They must be resident for income tax purposes during the time in question and must provide proof:

*   of the duration of their unplanned absence from New Zealand; and
*   that the absence was due to an event or circumstance beyond their reasonable planning or control, such as:

*   the illness or death of a family member overseas;
*   their employer requiring attendance at a conference overseas.

**Example nine**  
Liz has met the 183-day requirement and travels to Brazil for a holiday. She was overseas for 180 days and returns permanently to New Zealand. After one week back in New Zealand she has to go to Australia for her grandmother's funeral and stays there for 10 days. Because Liz spent less than 31 days in New Zealand in what otherwise would have been 184 or more consecutive days overseas, the time spent in New Zealand is treated as having been spent overseas. Liz has a 184-day absence overseas. She provides proof to Inland Revenue of her unplanned absence overseas and is granted an exemption. She remains eligible for the interest write-off while she was overseas.

##### Absence because of employment or occupation

Borrowers who are required to be absent from New Zealand because of their employment or occupation may be eligible for the exemption. They must be resident for income tax purposes during the time in question and have a permanent place of abode only in New Zealand. They must provide proof:

*   that they receive either a source deduction payment (such as salary or wages) as defined in section OB 2(1) of the Income Tax Act 2004; or
*   income from a business that has a permanent place of business in New Zealand; and
*   the majority of their absences from New Zealand are because of their employment or occupation.

**Example ten**  
Billy has met the 183-day requirement. Billy's New Zealand employer sends him to Australia to work in the Sydney office for seven months. He stays in a hotel in Sydney and keeps in regular contact with his wife and children, who have remained in their family home in Auckland. (Billy's permanent place of abode is in New Zealand only.) He continues to receive salary from his New Zealand employer. He has a 184-day absence overseas but provides proof to Inland Revenue that he meets the conditions for the absence because of employment exemption. He is granted an exemption and remains eligible for the interest write-off while he is overseas.

##### Working or volunteering for a charitable organisation

Borrowers who are working as a volunteer or for token payment for a charitable organisation named in the regulations made under section 87 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 can receive an exemption under this category for a maximum aggregate period of 24 months.

##### Partner of someone who would meet one of these exemptions

Borrowers who go overseas with partners who would meet the conditions for one of the earlier exemptions may be eligible for the exemption. They must be resident for income tax purposes during the time in question and provide proof:

*   of their relationship with their wife or husband, civil union partner or de facto partner (hereafter referred to as "partner"); and
*   that the absence from New Zealand resulted because they accompanied their partner overseas; and
*   the partner was absent from New Zealand -

*   undertaking full-time study overseas at post-graduate level and satisfies the conditions of the full-time study overseas at post-graduate level exemption (as outlined earlier); or
*   in the service in any capacity of the government of New Zealand; or
*   as a result of employment or occupation (as outlined earlier); or
*   because the partner was working as a volunteer or for token payment for a charitable organisation named in regulations (as outlined earlier).

Borrowers can receive an exemption for a maximum aggregate period of 24 months if their partner was working as a volunteer or for token payment for a charitable organisation listed in the regulations to the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992.

##### Transitional provision

A transitional provision gives the Commissioner of Inland Revenue the discretion to grant a full interest write-off to borrowers who fail to meet the 183-day requirement from 1 April 2006. An interest write-off may be granted for up to 183 days during the period 1 April 2006 to 30 September 2006. This provision will ensure that borrowers are treated the same as if the "interest-free" student loans policy was implemented as a true interest-free policy, with borrowers not being charged interest on their loans until they have been overseas for 184 days.

**Example eleven**  
Sam has lived in New Zealand all of his life. On 1 September 2006 he moves to the United States permanently. He has not met the 183-day requirement from 1 April 2006. Under the transitional provision, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue grants Sam an interest write-off for the period 1 April 2006 to 1 September 2006. This is because if interest was not charged, Sam would have been entitled to an interest-free loan until he moved to the United States.  
  
**Example twelve**  
Belinda has also lived in New Zealand all of her life. On 1 May 2006 she leaves New Zealand, travels around Asia for four months, returning to New Zealand on 31 August 2006. She has not met the 183-day requirement from 1 April 2006. Under the transitional provision, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue grants Belinda an interest write-off for the period 1 April 2006 to 30 August 2006. This is because if interest was not charged, Belinda would have been entitled to an interest-free loan for this period. Belinda meets the 183-day requirement on 1 March 2007 and is eligible for an interest write-off from 31 August 2006 onwards.

##### Objections to decisions made by Inland Revenue

Borrowers will be able to challenge the decision made by Inland Revenue not to grant an exemption to the 183-day requirement.

##### Consequential changes

All borrowers are required to advise Inland Revenue when they have been, or expect to be, overseas for more than three months. All borrowers who have advised Inland Revenue of their absence, or expected absence, overseas are required to advise Inland Revenue when they return to New Zealand.

From 1 April 2006, a base interest write-off or an interest reduction can be granted for a maximum aggregate period of two tax years each.

**Example thirteen**  
Alex does not meet the 183-day requirement because he spends all of the 2007 tax year in South America. He remains a resident for income tax purposes because he has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. He works part-time and his income is below the repayment threshold. He is eligible for a base interest write-off for the 2007 tax year. On 1 April 2007 he returns to New Zealand, meets the 183-day requirement on 30 September 2007, and is eligible for the full interest write-off from 1 April 2007. On 1 April 2008 he leaves for a one-year holiday in Australia and remains a resident for income tax purposes. He has a 184-day absence and is not eligible for the full interest write-off from 2 April 2008 (the day after he left New Zealand) but is eligible for a base interest write-off for the 2009 tax year because his income is below the repayment threshold.

### Application date

The new interest write-off applies to interest charged on or after 1 April 2006.

Interest amounts
----------------

Interest gets calculated daily on your overpaid or underpaid tax. It does not compound and is not included when calculating penalties.

The interest rates are set by government and are based on market rates, so they vary over time.

| When interest rate started | Debit rate | Credit rate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 16 January 2025 | 10.88% | 4.30% |
| 29 August 2023 | 10.91% | 4.67% |
| 9 May 2023 | 10.39% | 3.53% |
| 17 January 2023 | 9.21% | 2.31% |
| 30 August 2022 | 7.96% | 1.22% |
| 10 May 2022 | 7.28% | 0.00% |
| 8 May 2020 | 7.00% | 0.00% |
| 29 August 2019 | 8.35% | 0.81% |
| 8 May 2017 | 8.22% | 1.02% |
| 8 May 2016 | 8.27% | 1.62% |
| 8 May 2015 | 9.21% | 2.63% |

When interest starts
--------------------

If you've underpaid tax or duty, interest:

*   starts on the day after the original due date for the amount owing, or
*   starts from a new due date (if you received Working for Families Tax Credit and you meet specific criteria to have a new due date)
*   stops on the day the overdue balance (including interest) gets paid in full.

If you've overpaid tax or duty, interest starts on the latest of either:

*   the day after the original due date
*   the day after payment.

If you need to file a tax return to get a refund of your overpayment, interest starts on the latest of the:

*   original due date
*   day after the payment that generates the refund (that's when the credit becomes available)
*   date you filed your return.

In most cases, interest stops the day the overpaid tax is refunded or transferred to another tax account or period.

Interest you're paid is gross income
------------------------------------

Any interest you're paid on an overpayment is gross income. You'll need to include it in your income tax return or income tax assessment for the year in which it's refunded. You need to do this even if you credit the interest towards paying other unpaid tax.

If your return is reassessed and we find that you've overpaid, you may be paid interest. This is also gross income but only in the income year following the year of assessment.

Underpaid interest is deductible
--------------------------------

Interest you pay on underpayments of tax is deductible for business purposes. You can claim it as an expense on your income tax return.

If your return is reassessed and we find that you've underpaid, you may have to pay interest. This is also deductible, but only in the income year following the year of reassessment.

Interest on tax in dispute
--------------------------

When you're disputing a tax amount, you can put payment on hold until a decision is made. If we decide the amount in dispute is not right, we'll refund the disputed tax and pay you interest on it. If we decide that the amount in dispute is right, you'll have to pay us any outstanding amount and any interest on it.

Interest and extra time to pay
------------------------------

When you get a notice of assessment or a statement of account balance we'll give you up to an extra 30 days to pay. If you pay the balance within that timeframe, you do not need to pay the interest that gets added between the date the notice or statement was issued, and the date of the payment.

If you pay after more than 30 days, the interest amount will be recalculated, so the balance may not be cleared in full.

Interest and payments
---------------------

If you make a payment to clear unpaid tax, it is used to pay off unpaid interest and then tax. The exception to this rule is for payments of provisional tax, where payments are used for provisional tax instalments as directed by the taxpayer.

Credit interest may be used to pay other unpaid taxes.

GST and provisional tax
-----------------------

There are different rules about interest on GST and provisional tax.

[All Income tax dates](/index/key-dates#f:@irsccoresubject=[Income tax])

Interest is not a penalty. It is a charge for the use of money. This means we may:

*   charge you interest on late provisional or end of year tax payments
*   pay you interest if you overpay your provisional tax.

We will work out the interest charges once you’ve filed your income tax return. We will not charge or pay interest if you under or overpay by $100 or less.

If you use the accounting income method (AIM)
---------------------------------------------

*   We will not pay you interest if you overpay your provisional tax. 
*   We will charge interest if you pay late or underpay your provisional tax, from the day after the instalment was due. 
*   Once a Statement of Activity is filed, we will charge penalties and interest from the day after the due date for each instalment. This is different from other provisional options where the penalties and interest will not be charged until the end of year income tax return is filed.

If you use the ratio option
---------------------------

*   If you pay on time, we will not charge or pay you interest on your provisional tax. 
*   We may charge interest if you owe more than $100 after your end of year tax due date (7 February, or 7 April if you have a tax agent with an extension of time).
*   We may charge penalties if provisional instalments are paid late or underpaid.

If you use the standard option
------------------------------

### RIT of under $60,000

If your [residual income tax (RIT)](/api/glossary/item?id={5F62E02F-5C69-4E98-B925-D9197C71558A})
 is less than $60,000, we'll charge or pay you interest from the day after the end of year tax due date.

Before the 2023 income year, we charged interest on any late instalments from the day after the missed (or short-paid) instalment.

### RIT of $60,000 or more

If your RIT is $60,000 or more, we'll charge or pay you interest from the day after the final instalment date if you have made your payments in full and on time.

We will work out interest on the difference between the provisional tax you have paid and your [residual income tax](/api/glossary/item?id={5F62E02F-5C69-4E98-B925-D9197C71558A})
.

If you have paid all but your final instalment in full and on time, we will charge interest from the final instalment due date. This allows you to make a payment that is different to your final standard instalment.

If you use the standard method then estimate your final instalment, you will have UOMI calculated as if you estimated for the full Interest year.

For instalments, other than the final instalment, if you pay an instalment late, or if you do not pay an instalment at all, we will charge interest from the day after the instalment due date. Interest is charged on the smaller of:

*   the instalment minus the amount already paid
*   your residual income tax divided by the number of instalments for the tax year, minus the amount already paid.

These rules may not apply to you if you are [associated persons](/api/glossary/item?id={51FA1411-3A83-4019-8451-CED79A628D11})
 and one of you:

*   is a company that is not covered by the above standard option rules
*   uses the GST ratio option
*   has entered a provisional tax interest avoidance arrangement.

If you use the estimation option
--------------------------------

*   We may charge interest from the first provisional tax instalment date if you use the estimation method.
*   If you underestimate, we may charge you penalties and interest on the difference, from the provisional instalment dates. You may be charged even if you paid your estimated provisional tax in full and on time.
*   If you overestimate, you will be entitled to receive any interest due. If you overestimate, you are treated as having taken reasonable care in making the estimate.

This higher chance of penalties and interest is why it is important to estimate your residual income tax carefully, and to estimate again if your income increases.

Electing to be a provisional taxpayer
-------------------------------------

If you are not a provisional taxpayer but expect your RIT to be more than $5,000 you may choose to be a provisional taxpayer and this will mean you are paid UOMI for overpayments. In this case, you must use the estimation option for the year of your election.

If you are filing by paper, attach a letter to the return. If you are filing online, send us a message in myIR on the same day that you file your return. Use the term ;elect to be a provisional taxpayer

If you want to formally elect to become a provisional taxpayer, you will need to:

*   have paid at least $5,000 by the final instalment date (7 May for most people)
*   send your request at the same time as filing that year's income tax return.

New provisional taxpayers
-------------------------

Special rules apply if you are a [new provisional taxpayer](/api/glossary/item?id={934B7D12-4FFE-480D-81F4-F75570C5E64B})
 and you have started a taxable activity during the year.

We will calculate interest from the day after your first provisional instalment would have been due if one of the following apply:

*   you use the estimation option and your [residual income tax](/api/glossary/item?id={5F62E02F-5C69-4E98-B925-D9197C71558A})
     is more than $5,000 (or you elected to be a provisional taxpayer)
*   your [residual income tax](/api/glossary/item?id={5F62E02F-5C69-4E98-B925-D9197C71558A})
     is $60,000 or more and you are a new provisional taxpayer for that particular income year.

If you have started a business and you think you will be in one of these situations, you may want to talk to a tax agent about estimating your income.

[Student Loan Scheme Act 2011](/new-legislation/act-articles/student-loan-scheme-act-2011 "Student Loan Scheme Act 2011")

Interest, relief, penalties and offences, objections, disputes and challenges
=============================================================================

Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 updates the interest and penalty provisions and brings them into line with those that apply more generally to tax offences.

**_Sections 133-188, 221 and schedule 7_**

Changes have been made to the interest and penalty provisions to bring the offences and penalty amounts up to date and into line with those that apply for tax offences more generally. These will have the effect of strengthening the rules applying to those who default on their student loan repayments.

### Background

The offences and penalties in the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 have not been changed since the Act came into effect. This means that offences and penalties that apply to non-compliant borrowers have not kept up with the changes to offences and penalties that apply for not complying with tax obligations more generally. An incentive therefore exists for borrowers to comply with tax obligations (due to higher penalties) ahead of student loans repayment obligations.

The Act will bring penalties for not complying with filing, information provision, and repayment obligations more into line with the penalties applying to taxes. These changes are intended to:

*   encourage borrowers to pay the correct interim payments when they are due;
*   bring the rules up to date with changes to equivalent tax obligations (for example, higher penalties for evasion and the introduction of a late filing penalty); and
*   reduce any tendency for borrowers to give student loan obligations a lower priority than tax repayment obligations.

The relief provisions currently available to a borrower namely, relief from late payment interest, hardship relief (limited to the current year, prior years or the next year), and financial relief by way of instalment arrangements have been retained.

The borrower currently has the contractual right to object to any loan advance that has been attributed to a borrower. These objections are dealt with by StudyLink. The borrower can also object to the Commissioner regarding any assessment made by the Commissioner, any penalty imposed, any decision concerning significant financial hardship, or the assessment of a repayment obligation. These objections are dealt with by the Commissioner and are retained in the new Act.

### Key features

The new rules include the following changes:

*   The late payment penalty of 19.56% per annum has been replaced with a late payment interest of 10.6% per annum.
*   Late filing penalties will be imposed for incomplete or absent declarations, or notifications in certain circumstances.
*   The underestimation penalty that applies when a borrower has underestimated their repayment liability has been replaced with the ability to charge late payment interest from each overdue interim payment, and the penal repayment penalties that apply in cases of evasion will be replaced with a student loan shortfall penalty for borrowers who have taken an incorrect tax position.
*   Student loan shortfall penalties will be imposed at the same rate that would apply for taking an incorrect tax position.
*   The previous student loan criminal offences "rules" relating to wilfully or negligently failing to provide correct information will be replaced with the criminal offences that apply for tax purposes, such as absolute liability offences and knowledge and evasion offences. The same maximum penalty amounts that apply for income tax offences will also apply to student loan offences.
*   The previous offence rules for aiding and abetting an offence will be retained in the student loan rules, but with higher penalties to reflect those imposed in relation to tax.
*   The Commissioner can also enter into arrangements with borrowers for the repayment of outstanding amounts by way of instalments.
*   The Commissioner can refrain from collecting amounts due if this would cause significant hardship to the borrower. The Commissioner can also refrain from issuing notices of assessment and collecting small amounts.
*   The ability for borrowers to object to loan advances has been retained in the new Act. The current objection and challenge process has also been updated to reflect the process used in the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### Detailed analysis

**_Interest_**

The legislation imposes interest on the loan balances of all borrowers and then provides a full interest write-off to borrowers for each day that they are New Zealand-based. The effect of this is to impose interest only on the loan balances of borrowers who are overseas-based.

The interest rate is determined by the following formula:

a% = b% + 0.74

where:  
**a** is the interest rate for the tax year  
**b** is the interest rate determined as the average of the monthly average 10-year Government bond yield rate published by the Reserve Bank for the 5 years ending in December in the year preceding the relevant tax year.

The interest rate for the year is currently 6.6%. Interest is calculated each day and charged and added to the loan balance on the last day of the tax year. The Commissioner is required to notify the borrower in writing of the amount of interest charged as soon as practical after interest is added to the borrower's loan balance.

### Changes from 1 April 2013

Up to 31 March 2013, the current treatment will remain whereby loan interest will be imposed on all borrowers and a full interest write-off will be provided for New Zealand-based borrowers. From 1 April 2013, loan interest will only be imposed on overseas-based borrowers. This will contribute towards reducing the complexity of statements issued to borrowers as interest will not be shown on the statements of borrowers who are New Zealand-based.

The calculation of loan interest will also change. Previously, loan interest was calculated daily, charged and compounded annually. From 1 April 2013, loan interest will be calculated daily but charged and compounded monthly. This change in calculation method will not affect the overall annual interest rate imposed on a borrower. However, any change in the 10-year Government bond yield rate, on which the interest rate is based, will influence the interest rate charged.

**_Penalty for late payment_**

From 1 April 2012, the penalty for late payment will change its name from "late payment penalty" to "late payment interest". Also, when a borrower has not paid an amount by the due date and each individual unpaid amount is $334 or more, late payment interest will be imposed on each amount outstanding as follows:

*   0.843% of the unpaid amount on the day after it was due; and
*   0.843% of the unpaid amount as at the day that is one month since the last time the late payment interest was imposed.

Late payment interest will be calculated, charged and compounded monthly.

Again, the Commissioner must notify the borrower as soon as possible, after the late payment penalty is imposed.

### Changes from 1 April 2013

From 1 April 2013, the way late payment interest is imposed will change.

Late payment interest will be calculated each day on the borrower's total unpaid amount above $500 and the interest will be charged and compounded each month.

Also, instead of late payment interest being charged on each individual unpaid amount of $334 or more, the threshold will be increased and late payment interest will apply if the total amount outstanding is $500 or more.

**_Small amounts_**

The Commissioner does not have to:

*   issue a notice of assessment to borrowers if the repayment obligation or total remaining repayment for the tax year is less than $20;
*   collect a repayment obligation or a total remaining repayment for the tax year if the amount payable is less than $20. This amount is not written off and remains part of the borrower's loan balance;
*   collect and may write-off an amount payable by an employer or PAYE intermediary if the amount payable is less than $20;
*   collect a repayment obligation if the amount has not been paid by the due date and is less than $334. This amount is not written off and is added back to the loan balance.

**_Relief_**

There are three types of relief that a borrower can apply to the Commissioner for:

*   relief from late payment interest;
*   hardship relief (limited to the current year, prior years or the next year);
*   financial relief by way of instalment arrangements.

**_Relief from late payment interest_**

Relief from late payment interest is available to the borrower when the borrower applies and the Commissioner considers that, having regard to the circumstances, it is equitable to do so and the relief is warranted. The relief can cancel all or some of the late payment interest imposed and refund any amount paid in relation to the cancelled interest.

### Changes from 1 April 2013

From 1 April 2013, more detailed payment priority rules will apply. These rules are reflected in the provisions providing relief to borrowers from the late payment interest.

Some minor amendments will be required to the provisions providing relief to borrowers from the late payment interest both from 1 April 2012 and 1 April 2013 to correct technical errors. These amendments are included in the Student Loan Scheme Amendment Bill, which was before Parliament at the time of writing.

**_Hardship relief_**

When a borrower applies for hardship relief on the grounds that the payment of the repayment obligation would cause or has caused hardship or there are special reasons that make it fair and reasonable to provide relief, the Commissioner can decrease the borrower's repayment obligation.

The relief can be provided by either refunding a repayment obligation previously paid for the current year or for the previous tax year, or by reducing future deductions from salary and wages (by way of a special deduction rate) or a future pre-taxed repayment obligation or future other income repayment obligation. If the Commissioner reduces the borrower's repayment obligation due to hardship, the reduced amount is not written off and is not added to an unpaid amount but remains part of the borrower's loan balance.

Should the borrower's circumstances change and the change would have affected the borrower's entitlement to hardship, the borrower is required to notify the Commissioner who may review the previous decision to grant hardship relief. The hardship relief may be reversed and/or the borrower's repayment obligation may be reinstated.

**_Financial relief by way of instalment arrangements_**

Borrowers who have an unpaid amount can apply to the Commissioner to enter into an instalment arrangement for the repayment of the unpaid amount. Should the Commissioner grant the instalment arrangement, the borrower will continue to be liable for late payment interest on the amount outstanding during the instalment arrangement. If at the end of the arrangement the borrower has met all of the requirements of the instalment arrangement, the late payment interest that has accrued during the instalment arrangement will be reduced.

### Changes from 1 April 2013

Up to 31 March 2013, borrowers who enter into an instalment arrangement and meet their obligations under the arrangement will have the late payment interest reduced to reflect their compliance.

From 1 April 2013, for each month that a borrower under an instalment arrangement meets their obligations, the late payment interest the borrower is liable for will be reduced by two percentage points. This ensures that borrowers receive the benefit of compliance sooner, while removing the previous requirement to apply for the reduction in late payment interest. These changes to instalment arrangements for student loans reflect the way tax instalment arrangements are generally administered.

**_Late filing penalty_**

A late filing penalty has been introduced to encourage borrowers to file their pre-taxed income declaration or declaration of world-wide income by New Zealand-based non-resident borrowers. Before the penalty can be imposed, the Commissioner must notify the borrower in writing or by public notice that the late filing penalty will be imposed if the borrower does not provide the declaration to the Commissioner within 30 days of the date of notice.

Once the 30-day period has passed, the Commissioner can impose the penalty. The penalty depends on the borrower's net income as follows:

*   a $50 penalty will be imposed if the borrower's net income is less than $100,000;
*   a $250 penalty will be imposed if the borrower's net income is between $100,000 and $1 million (inclusive);
*   a $500 penalty will be imposed if the borrower's net income is over $1 million.

To ensure that two penalties are not imposed for the same offence, a late filing penalty for student loan purposes will not be imposed if a late filing penalty has been imposed under the Tax Administration Act 1994 in relation to the same return.

The late filing penalty will be due and payable on the later of:

*   60 days after the notification that the late filing penalty would be imposed;
*   the same date as the first standard interim payment[1](#1)
     for the borrower if the borrower does not have an extension of time to file a return. For a March balance date borrower, this will be 28 August;
*   the same date as the final standard interim payment[1](#1)
     for the borrower if the borrower has an extension of time to file a return. For a March balance date borrower, this will be 7 May.

**_Shortfall penalties_**

Currently, if a borrower evades or attempts to evade their repayment obligation, they can be subject to a penal repayment penalty of up to 300 % of the amount evaded. This penalty is now outdated and has been replaced with a range of shortfall penalties. These penalties increase in severity according to the offence ranging from not taking reasonable care in complying with repayment obligations to evasion.

The shortfall penalties will apply when a borrower:

*   has taken an incorrect tax position which is lower than the correct tax position; and
*   is also liable to pay a shortfall penalty for income tax.

Borrowers may also be liable to pay a student loan shortfall penalty if taking an incorrect tax position has also reduced their student loan repayment obligation.

The student loan shortfall penalty can be up to 150% of the shortfall in the borrower's repayment obligation, and will be the same percentage rate imposed for the borrower's income tax shortfall. This will ensure that borrowers who do not comply are penalised on the whole shortfall, and not just the income tax amount.

**_Offences_**

Criminal offences currently in the Student Loan Scheme Act relate to wilfully or negligently failing to provide correct information. These offences will be replaced with the criminal offences that apply for tax purposes, such as strict liability offences, and knowledge and evasion offences. The same maximum penalty amounts that apply for income tax offences will also apply to student loan offences.

The current offences for aiding and abetting an offence will be retained, but with higher penalty amounts to reflect those imposed in relation to tax, as will the offence relating to prejudicing employees because of their student loan liability. However, there will be no change to the penalty amount for the latter offence and the $2,000 penalty will continue to apply.

The following table provides a summary of the offences and penalties under both the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 and the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011.

| Civil offences | Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 |     | Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 |     |

**_Objection rights_**

A borrower can:

*   object to a loan advance;
*   dispute a decision by the Commissioner; or
*   challenge a Commissioner's decision once the borrower has completed the disputes process.

_Objections_

A borrower can object to the details of loan advances outlined on a statement issued by the Commissioner. The borrower has at least 31 days from the date of the statement to object, unless StudyLink has allowed an extension of time to object.

The Loan Manager must consider the objection and, as soon as practicable, notify the borrower and Inland Revenue of their decision and the reasons for that decision. If the objector does not agree with the Loan Manager's decision, the borrower can require the Chief Executive to determine the decision. The request must be made within 21 days of the Loan Manager's decision or the Chief Executive may provide an extension of time for the borrower to request a determination of decision by the Chief Executive.

Once the Chief Executive has received a request to consider the objection, they must consider the objection and, as soon as practicable, notify the borrower in writing of their decision and the reasons for that decision.

If a borrower disagrees with the decision of the Chief Executive, the borrower can, within 30 days[3](#3)
 of being notified of the Chief Executive's decision, apply to the Disputes Tribunal or District Court for determination of the dispute. The Court or Tribunal will only consider objections once they have been considered by the Loan Manager and the Chief Executive.

_Dispute and challenge process_

The same disputes process that applies for income tax disputes will apply to disputes involving a decision by the Commissioner under this Act.

Once a borrower has concluded the disputes process, and the dispute has not been resolved, the borrower may challenge the decision.

A borrower may dispute any of the following matters (excluding the details of a loan advance) under the Act:

*   any information (other than a loan advance) provided to the borrower;
*   the Commissioner's decision not to treat a borrower as being physically in New Zealand or regarding the start and end dates of the borrower being treated as a New Zealand resident;
*   the Commissioner's decision not to issue a special deduction rate certificate or that the certificate issued is erroneous;
*   that the additional deduction rate certificate is incorrect or has been issued in error;
*   the Commissioner's determination as to the salary or wage deduction to be made on the grounds that the determination is erroneous;
*   the Commissioner's determination that a significant over-deduction was not made was erroneous or that the amount of the significant over-deduction stated in the notice was erroneous;
*   the Commissioner's decision to prohibit a borrower from making an application for the borrower's unused repayment threshold to be allocated to their secondary income or an application for the exemption for full-time study;
*   an assessment of the borrower's repayment obligations on the basis that the assessment is erroneous, excessive or issued in error;
*   the imposition of interest or late payment interest, or the amount of interest charged or late payment interest charged;
*   the Commissioner's decision not to provide relief from late payment interest, hardship relief, or financial relief by way of an instalment arrangement. The borrower can also challenge the relief provided on grounds that relief is not fair and reasonable; and
*   the imposition of the late filing penalty or a shortfall penalty on the grounds that the penalty was imposed in error.

After considering the challenge the Commissioner must notify the borrower that the Commissioner has either:

*   allowed the challenge in full;
*   allowed the challenge in part; or
*   disallowed the challenge.

### Application dates

The changes relating to shortfall penalties, late filing penalties, and criminal offences for not complying with obligations, apply from 1 April 2012 onwards. However, they apply to obligations for the tax year and therefore cannot be determined until the end of the year.

The changes relating to the rights of a borrower to object to the details of loan advances and challenge details of their consolidated loan balance, apply from 1 January 2012, being the date from which that the loan advances provisions apply.

The other changes outlined above apply from 1 April 2012.

* * *

1If a borrower is not liable to make interim payments, the date is the date at which the borrower would be liable to make interim payments if they were an interim payer.

2These penalties are adjusted to take account of reductions due to borrower's good behaviour, voluntary disclosure or temporary shortfall and increased penalty due to obstruction.

3 The referee of a Disputes Tribunal or a District Court judge may extend the time allowed to apply to a Disputes Tribunal or District Court.

Interlocutory appeal in advance of substantive hearing
======================================================

2013 case note - interlocutory appeal in advance of substantive hearing relating to Trinity Scheme - postponement, judicial discretion, tax avoidance.

Case

Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd & Others v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

High Court Rules rule 1.2, Judicature Act 1908

### Summary

This was an appeal of a High Court decision that the Commissioner's interlocutory application should be heard before the appellant's interlocutory application. The Court of Appeal did not disturb the High Court's decision and exercised their discretion not to hear this interlocutory appeal matter before the substantive hearing in the High Court.

### Impact of decision

The Court of Appeal has the discretion to decline to hear an interlocutory appeal in advance of a substantive hearing in a lower court if the Court decides that the issues on appeal may be overtaken by the substantive hearing or that the appellant is unlikely to be prejudiced by postponement (_Reid v Attorney-General_ \[2012\] NZCA 174).

### Facts

The appellants in this case were investors in the Trinity tax avoidance scheme. The appellants have applied to the High Court for an order that the judgment of the High Court in _Accent Management Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2004\] 22 NZTC 19,027 (HC) ("_Accent Management_") be set aside. Venning J found that the Trinity scheme (in which the appellants are investors) was a tax avoidance arrangement. This decision was also upheld in the Court of Appeal (_Accent Management Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2007\] NZCA 230, (2007) 23 NZTC 21,323) and in the Supreme Court (_Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2008\] NZSC 115, \[2009\] 2 NZLR 289).

The appellants claim that the decision in _Accent Management_ is voidable on the ground that Venning J was or may have been seen to be biased because he was beholden to the Commissioner, in respect of an alleged stamp duty debt.

An interlocutory application to join the Attorney-General to the proceeding was also filed by the appellants. A draft amended claim for compensation under the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 was attached to that application.

In response to the challenge of Venning J's judgment, the Commissioner filed an appearance under protest to jurisdiction and an interlocutory application for dismissal or strike out. The Commissioner argued that if the claim had to be properly considered in any court, that consideration would have to occur in the Court of Appeal.

Katz J in the High Court was asked to determine which interlocutory application should be heard first. The Judge determined it was premature to consider adding additional defendants or causes of actions before the Commissioner's protest to jurisdiction application was determined. The second issue for the High Court was the appellants' application that this matter be heard by a Full Court of the High Court. This issue was referred to the Chief High Court Judge, Winkelmann J, who decided that there were no grounds which would justify constituting a Full Court in respect of the interlocutory applications or the substantive proceeding (_Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ HC Auckland CIV-2012-404-7682, 17 April 2013).

### Decision

The Court of Appeal decided to defer the appeal. The Court recognised that _Siemer v Heron_ (\[2011\] NZSC 133, \[2012\] 1 NZLR 309 at \[32\]) allowed an appeal as of right to the Court of Appeal against interlocutory decisions. However, it was also recognised that there is discretion to decline to hear an interlocutory appeal in advance of the substantive hearing in a lower court. This discretion can be exercised if the issues on appeal may be overtaken by the substantive hearing or if the appellant is unlikely to be prejudiced by postponement.

Mr Judd QC argued for the appellants that the Court of Appeal should hear the appeal prior to the Commissioner's protest to jurisdiction, because otherwise the appeal would be rendered nugatory. The Court of Appeal concluded that the decision as to the order in which these interlocutory matters are heard is not dispositive in any substantive or practical way and that the appellants are not prejudiced by deferral of the appeal.

Mr Judd QC indicated that the appeal against Winkelmann J's refusal to constitute a Full Court was not a focus of the appellants' concern. The Court of Appeal decided it was therefore not necessary to decide that matter.

The Court of Appeal made no order as to costs and the fixture to deal with the appeal was vacated.

Interlocutory application for stay of liquidation proceedings pending judicial review dismissal
===============================================================================================

2009 case note – High Court confirmed that judicial review proceedings cannot be used except in exceptional circumstances.

Case

Berrytime Land Limited and Berrytime Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Judicature Amendment Act 1972, Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The High Court dismissed the application for a stay on the basis that the taxpayer's case for establishing "exceptional circumstances" required for judicial review was not strong.

### Impact of decision

The High Court confirmed that judicial review proceedings cannot be used except in exceptional circumstances.

### Facts

1.  Berrytime and Berrytime Land filed GST self-assessments totalling $3,365,134.54 (for Berrytime) and $808,924.32 (for Berrytime Land). Apart from one payment of $246,914.63 on behalf of Berrytime Land, none of the assessed GST has been paid resulting in penalties and interest being added to the liability.
2.  By a letter dated 16 June 2008, Berrytime claimed it had made errors in the GST returns. Berrytime proposed amendments be made to reduce their liability by $1,883,169.11. The letter requested new assessments be issued. The Commissioner treated this letter as a request for the exercise of the Commissioner's discretion under section 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) as Berrytime was out of time to file a NOPA. However, the request was ultimately declined on 11 September 2008 due to a lack of documentary support.
3.  The Commissioner filed proceedings to wind up both companies on 22 September 2008, on the grounds of persistent and/or serious failures to comply with the Companies Act, and that winding up was just and equitable. Amended statements of claim were filed on 10 October 2008. Liquidation was sought on the basis of the companies' inability to pay their debts, in addition to the grounds set out in the original statement of claim.
4.  A second request for amendment of the GST assessments was made by the companies' in a letter dated 23 January 2009. Amendments were sought pursuant to section 113 for both Berrytime and for Berrytime Land. No supporting documentation was attached.
5.  In a meeting held on 4 February 2009 between the Commissioner and the representatives for the companies, the Commissioner requested the companies provide information to support their position. In a follow-up letter dated 13 February 2009, the Commissioner requested this be provided by 27 February 2009 and advised that if significant progress could not be made over the following few weeks, the Commissioner would not seek an adjournment of the liquidation proceedings.
6.  Nothing was received by 27 February 2009 and the Commissioner requested an update on 2 March 2009. On 3 March 2009, the companies advised that an update was forthcoming. On 10 March 2009, the Commissioner advised that if the information was not received by 13 March 2009, he would have no option but to decline the application.
7.  On 13 March 2009, the Commissioner was provided with a number of documents. However, he considered that they did not support their position as set out in the letter dated 23 January 2009. Accordingly, the application was declined on 18 March 2009.
8.  On 25 March 2009, the day before the liquidation hearing was due to proceed, the companies' filed an application for judicial review and an interlocutory application for interim orders staying the liquidation proceedings pending the outcome of the judicial review application.
9.  The liquidation proceedings were heard the following day and the companies argued that the Commissioner should have amended the self-assessments. In his reserved judgment, issued on 3 April 2009, Doogue AJ concluded that both companies are insolvent. However, rather than make orders placing the companies in liquidation, he adjourned the proceedings until 7 April 2009, noting that if the companies had not made payment, then certificates of unpaid debt would be required. On 7 April 2009 the liquidation proceedings were further adjourned until 22 April 2009, pending the outcome of the interlocutory application.
10.  In this interlocutory application, the companies argued that the decision of the Commissioner was communicated with insufficient notice and without providing opportunity to comment prior to the liquidation proceedings. The companies also argued that the Commissioner had made a mistake of fact in considering that the self-assessments were correct and had not taken relevant considerations into account. Further, it was made in breach of the Commissioner's duties and obligations under the TAA and SPS 07/03 and that the decision was unreasonable in light of the large amount of information requested and provided, that the information raised questions about the correctness of the self-assessments, and that the Commissioner was unreasonable in not taking account of evidence provided.

### Decision

_Are interim orders necessary to preserve the taxpayers' position?_

11.  The companies submitted that orders were necessary because if the companies were placed in liquidation, they would not have the opportunity to pursue the judicial review proceedings. The Commissioner disagreed on the basis that judicial review proceedings could be continued by a liquidator.
12.  Andrews J accepted that it would be the companies' preference to pursue the judicial review proceedings themselves, rather than leave them in the hands of a liquidator and accepted there was some force in the argument that once in place, liquidation would be difficult to "unwind" should the outcome of judicial review lead to a reduction of the liability. Accordingly, her Honour concluded that interim orders may be necessary to preserve the companies' position.

_Are interim orders justified taking into account all relevant factors?_

13.  It was accepted by the parties that the correctness of a tax assessment can only be challenged by way of the procedures set out in the TAA and that challenge by way of judicial review will be available only in "exceptional circumstances".
14.  Andrews J held, after considering these factors, that the applications by the companies should be dismissed
15.  In particular, her Honour held that the fact that the companies "were committed" to ensuring that the correct tax position was represented, and that "extraordinary efforts" had been taken to meet requests were not relevant in the light of a taxpayer's obligations under section 15B of the TAA as the companies were required to provide information and to cooperate.
16.  The companies also submitted that there had been a "conscious mal-administration" in that the Commissioner had allowed himself only two hours to review the material provided on 13 March 2009 before determining that there was insufficient evidence to support the request for amendment.
17.  However, evidence showed that the material was reviewed over three days. In any event, the history of contact between the parties, the failure of the companies to provide supporting documentation with their two requests for assessment, and the repeated requests by the Commissioner for information supporting the requests showed that considerable opportunity had been given to the companies to provide information. This evidenced that the Commissioner had acted lawfully and properly in dealing with the companies, and was not in breach of any of its obligations and duties under the TAA.
18.  The companies also alleged that there had been an abuse of power by the Commissioner on the basis that the section 113 amendment request was rushed through so as to progress the liquidation proceedings, enabling the Commissioner to access a wealthy shareholder. Her Honour could find no grounds for establishing such a motive.
19.  Andrews J concluded that the case for establishing exceptional circumstances required for establishing judicial review proceedings was not strong but rather could "only be described as weak".
20.  With regard to the public interest, Andrews J accepted that in light of her finding above regarding the weakness of the case, the balance of requiring the public interest in the Commissioner being able to carry out his statutory duties against the likelihood of the companies' succeeding in their judicial review proceedings fell on the side of not preventing the Commissioner from carrying out his statutory duties and obligations or from continuing the liquidation proceedings.
21.  As for the public and private repercussions of granting orders, while the Commissioner alleged that the court has no jurisdiction to stay itself, Andrews J accepted that section 8 of the Judicature Amendment Act 1972 gives clear statutory authority to stay any proceedings that are in connection with any matter to which the application for review relates. However, her Honour noted that this does not assist in considering whether an application for interim orders should be granted.

Te ratonga takawaenga Intermediation service
============================================

Intermediation is the process of linking an account or customer record belonging to an individual or organisation to a client list of a business intermediary (like a tax agent, bookkeeper or payroll bureau) so the intermediary can act on their behalf.

About the intermediation service
--------------------------------

The intermediation service is a SOAP web service that enables intermediaries to:

*   link, delink or update the intermediary client list to their clients' accounts or customer master
*   retrieve clients and client lists that have already been established.

Intermediaries can use this service to create and manage links from a client list to a customer master or their accounts on any tax product.

1 UNCLASSIFIED 2017-01-12 12 January 2017 Internal approach to managing changes or perceived changes of interpretation or practice Purpose 1. The purpose of this document is to record Inland Revenue’s approach to changes to, or perceived changes to, our tax/social policy technical interpretation or practice of administering tax legislation and to provide guidance for deciding what action to take in such circumstances. This document seeks to deal with a wider set of circumstances than those addressed by the Commissioner’s statement on advice. 1 2. Much of what is set out here already happens in Inland Revenue. However, the aim is to make our internal process more transparent; that is, for there to be a more overt process we all adopt and for the process to be clearer as to who is responsible for what aspects of it. The successful adoption of this approach will be the collective responsibility of everyone in the technical areas of Inland Revenue. Although this document sets out a process, and provides some guidance, it does not proscribe what course of action to take in an individual case. In any case involving change or perceived change, Inland Revenue has a variety of options. The point of this document is to better ensure we are aware of the issues early and follow a consistent process to manage them effectively and transparently. 3. Changes in interpretation or practice are by definition potentially problematic for Inland Revenue because they can affect taxpayers’ and their advisors’ ability to understand and ultimately comply with their legal (tax) obligations. (Examples of such changes include: a change in the Commissioner’s view in a published statement, a change in position because of an adjudication or a private ruling decision, a change through a court case, or a perceived change where taxpayers assume Inland Revenue holds a particular view because this has never been challenged on audit.) At times Inland Revenue has been criticised for how we have managed situations involving change or perceived change in position. Many of these situations are, or become, sensitive, in terms of possible public, key stakeholder or industry-specific reaction, lobby or interest group comment, and so on. By having a process that is more overt, consistent and broader in scope 2 to identify change situations early, and to address and communicate our decisions on these situations more effectively, we will better maintain the integrity of the tax system and, ultimately, taxpayer compliance. This is consistent with providing greater predictability of outcomes for Inland Revenue and taxpayers. Current environment Parliament makes the law; the Commissioner must apply it correctly 4. Parliament, not the Commissioner, or Inland Revenue, makes taxation laws. We acknowledge that, as a matter of principle and good tax administration, taxpayers should generally be able to rely on advice the Commissioner gives and practices 1 Status of Commissioner’s advice (TIB Vol 24 No 10 - December 2012). 2 Although in many respects building on existing processes, such as the TIG network, the escalation policy and the provision of interim operational positions by LTS Technical Standards. This document is also broader in scope because it deals expressly with technical practice and issues of perceived change. 2 UNCLASSIFIED 2017-01-12 the Commissioner has considered and applied over time. This ability to rely on advice or practice assists taxpayers with their compliance obligations in a self- assessment environment. However, the Commissioner is under an obligation to apply the law correctly. With the exception of the binding rulings regime (which is the only way to bind the Commissioner interpretively under the law), the law is not effectively changed merely by the Commissioner giving or taking a different view (whether published or otherwise), or adopting a practice that is inconsistent with the law. 3 5. That said, as a matter of good tax administration, Inland Revenue will generally stand behind its public statements and acknowledged policies or practices. Application of a change of view from a published statement or specific advice 6. The Commissioner recently clarified her position in cases where a published public statement has changed or where a taxpayer has received specific advice (which the Commissioner has specifically communicated to that taxpayer) that has subsequently changed: see Status of Commissioner’s advice (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 24, No 10, December 2012). Generally, the default position is that where the change results in a position less favourable to taxpayers the position will be applied prospectively. Where the change results in a position that is more favourable to taxpayers, the Commissioner may apply the change retrospectively subject to the exercise of her discretion under section 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). Prior settlements and time-barred periods are unaffected by subsequent changes in position in either direction. 7. In exceptional cases, the Commissioner may apply a new position that is less favourable to one or more taxpayers immediately (ie, without advance warning), or retrospectively (including to current disputes or cases). In deciding whether to use section 113 to apply a new position retrospectively, the Commissioner will apply the care and management principles in sections 6 and 6A of the TAA. Factors the Commissioner will consider include (but are not limited to):  The amount of revenue at stake;  The number of taxpayers affected, including the extent to which some taxpayers have been following the earlier incorrect position while others have been taking the correct position;  The resources necessary to identify, audit and reassess the relevant taxpayers;  Whether retrospective application is likely to undermine or support taxpayer perceptions of the integrity of the tax system; and  Whether retrospective application is likely to promote or adversely affect taxpayer compliance. \[It is also relevant to this context that the item on the Status of Commissioner’s Advice provides that Standard Practice Statements are only guidelines to how the Commissioner will exercise her discretions. This is particularly because she 3 CIR v Ti Toki Cabarets (1989) Ltd (2000) 19 NZTC 15,874; Lemmington Holdings Ltd (No 2) v CIR (1983) 6 NZTC 61,576 and Westpac Banking Corporation v CIR (2008) 23 NZTC 21,694. 3 UNCLASSIFIED 2017-01-12 always needs to exercise her discretion properly in any particular situation. 4 In addition, that item provides that from time to time the Commissioner may decide not to follow a court or tribunal decision. In these cases it follows that a position or practice may not actually change.\] Application to a wider set of change circumstances 8. This document seeks to deal with a set of possible circumstances that may involve changes or perceived changes in the Commissioner’s interpretation or practice of the law that is wider than circumstances addressed in the Commissioner’s statement on advice; in particular where there has not been a previous public position taken. This document sets out a process to better ensure we more routinely identify potential change situations early so we can handle them effectively. Relationship with the Escalation Policy 9. The process set out in this document has a relationship with the Escalation Policy insofar as, when identifying and dealing with change situations, it might be necessary to ensure that a position is correct. However, broadly this process is about dealing with change and perceptions of change, whereas the Escalation Policy is about testing positions. An escalation decision could lead to an overt change in a position. This process may establish that we have no formal position or that we have inconsistent positions. This might require a position to be determined and communicated. When does a change or perceived change situation arise? 10. Change issues can arise in a number of situations – not just when Inland Revenue overtly moves to adopt a change as occurs, for example, with a public statement. 5 In thinking about this wider category of situations, it is perhaps useful to divide the situations into two broad categories – (i) where there has been a change in position and (ii) where there has not been a change in position but this is perceived as being the case. Some common examples of each are indicated below. There has been a change in position:  An explicit change of view in a published public statement (interpretative or operational);  A decision from a superior court means CIR’s position must change 6 ;  An Escalation & Advising (E & A) decision overturns an existing position;  An adjudication report overturns an existing position 7 ; 4 However, from an internal perspective any specific departure from an SPS would need approval from the Group Tax Counsel (GTC). 5 More “change situations” may have occurred in recent years because of the escalation process providing greater certainty about Inland Revenue’s technical positions. 6 With the exception of cases where Inland Revenue has communicated it is not following the decision because of an appeal or an intention to contest its reasoning in another case. 7 This may require an escalation to decide whether the position taken in the adjudication is a new Inland Revenue position. Before escalation, the existence of the decision may cause externals to see this as indicative of a wider change in position. 4 UNCLASSIFIED 2017-01-12  A private or product ruling overturns an existing position 8 ; or  An overt change to our internal policies or practice. There has not been a change in position but this is perceived as being the case:  Self-assessment has led taxpayers to consider Inland Revenue has accepted a position that it has never formally considered or perhaps was not even aware of;  Inland Revenue has not pursued a dispute for reasons other than the technical correctness of the position taken (eg, because of limited resources or a missed NOPA/SOP deadline leading to deemed acceptance), and the taxpayer interprets this as condoning the position more generally;  Externals consider the position Inland Revenue holds is “X”, but we consider the position is, and always has been “Y” (hence externals perceive a change). Sometimes this can arise when we issue a public statement confirming or clarifying or providing more examples of IR’s position on an issue.  A taxpayer says Inland Revenue has changed its position because we have not followed something said in an Inland Revenue publication or on the website, whereas we think there is an obvious error in the publication or website so that it is reasonable to maintain that there is no change in our underlying or substantive established technical position;  A taxpayer is aware of another taxpayer being treated in a different way, in what they perceive are like circumstances, and assumes Inland Revenue has changed its position, when in fact the situations are distinguishable \[but Inland Revenue staff cannot discuss the differences without breaching secrecy\];  Inconsistent practice across Inland Revenue means we do not have a consistent or singular position but externals, aware of different practices, perceive it as a change in position;  The Commissioner overtly withdraws a public statement but does not replace it, and externals continue to follow the public statement. 11. The approach to “change” outlined below applies across all these circumstances because even in cases when the change is only perceived, it potentially raises issues for us. However, the extent to which each step in the approach applies will depend on the nature of a particular case, whether there is in fact any change in position, and in particular, how the matter arose and who raised it. 8 This may require an escalation to decide whether the position taken in the private or product ruling is a new Inland Revenue position. Before escalation, the existence of the ruling may cause externals to see this as a wider change in position. 5 UNCLASSIFIED 2017-01-12 Our approach to dealing with change or perceived change in position: 12. The broad approach to dealing with change or perceived change situations has four steps. The steps are essentially sequential but may overlap to some degree 9 : 1. Identify a potential change or perceived change situation. 2. Establish whether the position being proposed is actually a change from the Commissioner’s earlier position or could be seen as a change. 3. Determine how to apply that “new” position if there is a change, or perceived change in position. 4. Determine how (when and in what format) to communicate the Commissioner’s approach to the matter internally and externally. Step 1: Identify a potential 10 change or perceived change situation. 13. Where there is an overt and deliberate change in position (eg, a new position in a public statement) identification is straightforward. 14. However, part of the problem for Inland Revenue in the past has been its inability to identify early enough (or at all) that a situation involves a change or that taxpayers perceive it as such. Under this new approach, Inland Revenue staff would be required to raise these situations, when they arise, through the Tax Intelligence Group (TIG) and identify them as having change elements. 11 Examples of situations that should be raised would include cases where an agent is arguing that the Commissioner is changing her position; a taxpayer is relying on old advice; and new legislation causes an outcome not overtly dealt with in its introduction that appears to create a change to past treatment. Where possible, those raising issues should identify the source of the position that is being suggested has changed. 12 Importantly, at this stage there is no need to decide definitively whether there has been an actual change or simply a perceived one (this is done at step 2). The point is to bring such matters to a central place for consideration and oversight and to manage any required next steps. TIG, in conjunction with Legal & Technical Services (LTS) Technical Standards, will be responsible for prioritising issues, deciding the next steps, the relevant people to be involved and reasonable time frames for dealing with the matter. 15. Judgements will need to be made about whether an issue involves one or a limited number of taxpayers such that it can be effectively dealt with in that context or whether the issue has broader “change” implications. The process set out here is directed at the latter situation, but issues arising with a single or small number of taxpayers could be the beginning of a wider issue. Therefore, some issues may need to be monitored for wider implications. The intention is to have these issues raised so they can be monitored. For example, should a taxpayer or their adviser raise an argument that a position Inland Revenue is taking represents a change in position from our treatment of them in the past (because 9 In particular, communication considerations (step 4) may arise through the life of an issue. 10 Potential in the sense that the identification process might throw up some issues that are found to not involve any change at all. 11 Exceptions to this are discussed at paragraph 18. 12 If a taxpayer or taxpayer’s agent is asserting a change issue, it would be generally reasonable to expect the taxpayer or agent to specify the source of the position they maintain Inland Revenue is no longer adopting. 6 UNCLASSIFIED 2017-01-12 of past advice or practice), then this should be brought to TIG’s attention. However, this may not warrant further action if it is an isolated matter. 16. It is important to acknowledge that not every case where Inland Revenue and a taxpayer (or their advisors) disagree on the correct tax position involves a potential change in position. For example, many technical queries, binding ruling applications, indicative view requests, investigations, and disputes relate to issues that are factual in nature, raise new or novel considerations, or involve situations where the law is unclear and untested and we have no position or no clear position. In these cases, the matter should be resolved through normal processes. 13 Time frames 17. At this stage in the process some thought should be given to identifying time frames for resolution of the matter. At times we have been too slow to identify and then act on information in order to plan for a successful resolution of issues, involving changes in position. Without putting hard and fast rules in place, the general position should be to aim for a preferred solution within 3 months of identifying a problem, and to have taken action within 6 months. \[Straightforward matters should obviously be dealt with in shorter timeframes than this\]. It is not possible to set absolute time frames as some matters will be easier to resolve than others. However, we should be mindful of the time taken and the effect on taxpayers and aim to provide finality as soon as practicable. (As discussed at step 2, sometimes we will need to establish and communicate an interim operational position (which may include confirming the status quo) while we identify and implement a preferred solution.) Exceptions 18. This document discusses change or potential change issues being raised through the TIG network. There may be exceptions to this approach. For example, situations where it is already apparent that there has been a change (eg, an overt change in position in a public item or through an escalation) would not need to be referred to TIG and go through this “identification” step. Another exception would be where the matter is especially urgent or specialised. 14 Step 2: Establish whether the position being proposed is actually a change in position or could be seen as a change. 19. Step 2 is an exercise in comparing positions – to see whether there has been any change or perceived change. In some cases this exercise will be straightforward; in others less so. 20. Where it is not clear whether there has been any change or perceived change:  First, we need to establish the current position (ie, the position Inland Revenue is currently applying). In some cases this will be clear; in other cases we will need to establish this. (In some cases, having confirmed what we are currently doing, we may want to test this thinking to ensure this view is in fact correct. 13 For example, local LTS advice, TIG and escalation processes, the binding rulings process, disputes, indicative views etc. 14 This mirrors a similar exception in the Escalation Policy. 7 UNCLASSIFIED 2017-01-12 Internally we already have a process for determining the Commissioner’s position – this usually involves a referral to LTS for an opinion or, in some cases, ultimately to E & A. In other cases it may be more desirable to consult externally on a potential position through a draft public statement or issues paper. This process of confirming the correctness of a position may itself lead to a different position and hence an identified change in view.)  Having determined the position we are currently applying, we need to determine whether there has been a change or a perceived change from a past position (interpretation or practice). In some cases this will be straightforward. In other situations it will require an assessment of some or all of the following: o Did Inland Revenue have a clear existing position? o How different is the new position from the previous one? o Even if it is not clear that there has been a change in position, would some taxpayers think so and why? o Given Inland Revenue’s past actions, what would be seen as a reasonably predictable response from Inland Revenue? o And, importantly, has Inland Revenue overtly contributed to taxpayers’ behaviour or understanding such that it might be seen to be reasonable to argue that there has been some kind of change? 21. It has not always been easy to identify what has been happening (ie, what have taxpayers been doing or what has Inland Revenue been saying, doing or permitting). However, this information is vital to assess both the level of change (if any) and the likely taxpayer reaction to that change. The TIG process will be used to ascertain this, the likely impact on taxpayers and Inland Revenue and any potential external reaction to a change in position. Interim operational position 22. Assuming that there is a change or perceived change situation, we also need to determine, at this step, whether Inland Revenue needs an interim operational position while we decide how the matter will be resolved ie, how taxpayers should be treated in the meantime given that actual or perceived uncertainty. 23. The need for an interim operational position will depend on the level of awareness (both internally and externally) of the issue. Where there is little internal or external knowledge, no interim position may be needed; in other cases it might be necessary to confirm internally that the status quo should prevail and at other times it will be necessary to give more guidance. This may involve practical guidance to Service Delivery personnel on what to do with existing cases and/or any new cases identified. It might also include guidance about the application of resources (or otherwise) on issues while the matter is being resolved. 24. In many cases, the interim operational position may involve “holding” a position even if there are now reservations about its correctness. In other cases it may need to reflect the “reality” of inconsistent practice to date and/or to anticipate the likely “final position”, possible legislative solutions and transitional problems. 8 UNCLASSIFIED 2017-01-12 25. It may be necessary to identify which periods an interim position applies from and to. This will need to be communicated – in most cases both internally and externally (see also step 4 below which is applicable here too). 15 It will likely be important to emphasise that the position is only interim. Step 3: Determine how to apply that “new” position if there is a change, or perceived change in position. 26. Having determined that there is a change or perceived change, the next step is to decide whether the new position will be applied. This will usually involve discussions with Policy & Strategy (PAS) to determine whether the new position is in accordance with the requisite policy settings (ie, what the law should be in policy terms). In deciding this, PAS may need to provide advice to the Minister. In some cases, a decision may be made not to adopt the new position pending legislative change. This will likely involve care and management decisions. In cases of perceived change it may be that there is no new position to apply, in which case move to step 4. In such cases, however, issues of policy and/or taxpayers taking incorrect positions may still need to be worked through. 27. Where the new position is in accordance with policy, decisions will be needed about when the new position applies from – whether it is prospective or retrospective. As set out above, this will most likely involve similar care and management considerations to those already acknowledged by Inland Revenue in the statement on the Status of the Commissioner’s Advice. In that statement, we differentiated between situations where the change is to a position more favourable to taxpayers, and situations where the change is less favourable. We said that where the position was more favourable, we would apply the principles set out in the statement on the application of section 113 of the TAA about whether or not we would agree to reopen past assessments. Where a position is less favourable to taxpayers, we would generally apply the new position prospectively. However, in exceptional cases, a prospective application will be inappropriate, and immediate or retrospective application will be necessary or desirable (subject to the operation of the time bar). 16 28. In deciding whether to apply a new position retrospectively, the Commissioner will apply the care and management principles in sections 6 and 6A of the TAA. Generally, the Group Tax Counsel will formally exercise these principles and communicate decisions taken. Questions to consider include the following:  Is the new position less or more favourable to taxpayers? \[As with incorrect public statements, where the position is less favourable to taxpayers we will likely have a bias towards only applying the change prospectively, but this needs to be carefully weighed along with the following considerations set out here. Where the position is more favourable, then section 113 considerations apply to determine retrospective changes.\] 15 In cases involving a single adjudication or private/product ruling, the internal interim position may simply tell staff not to follow that decision while it is being escalated or other action is being taken (communicated through a memo from the Group Tax Counsel). Externals should generally be informed that an adjudication or ruling is based on the specific facts and does not of itself result in a change to the Commissioner's view until we release a public statement of some kind. 16 This would generally have no impact on the imposition of penalties or use of money interest if there has been reliance on a Commissioner’s official opinion: s 120W of the TAA. 9 UNCLASSIFIED 2017-01-12  Has Inland Revenue contributed to any past uncertainty? \[If we have overtly contributed to past uncertainty, and this has led to taxpayers being disadvantaged, then we would likely take this into account to preserve the integrity of the tax system and not enforce a position for a period affected by that uncertainty. If Inland Revenue did not know about a position taken, so took no action, for example by not challenging a tax return, then this should not be seen as contributing to uncertainty.\]  How long has Inland Revenue known about the position taxpayers have adopted? \[The longer Inland Revenue has known about the position taken (in the sense of more than simply receiving returns), the more likely we should act now to minimise as far as possible any disadvantage to taxpayers.\]  How long has Inland Revenue taken to resolve this issue? \[If we have taken a long time to resolve an issue it may be unfair to then apply it to past periods that (through our own delays) have been periods of uncertainty for taxpayers.\]  Is it reasonable that taxpayers considered the past position to be correct at law? \[The more reasonable it was for taxpayers to have relied on the past position, the less likely we are to apply the new position in a way to disadvantage them. Reasonableness of the position will likely be considered in terms of the words of the legislation, the state of the relevant case law, and taxpayers’ reasons for their reliance.\]  How many taxpayers are affected? \[This question goes to the impact of the issue on taxpayers and on Inland Revenue – where large numbers of taxpayers are involved we will, in particular, need to consider compliance costs for them and resourcing issues for us in terms of deciding how the new position will be applied. That said, there can still be cases where the number of taxpayers affected is relatively small, but the impact on those taxpayers is significant.\]  What type of taxpayer is involved – ie, do they understand tax matters and/or have access to legal/tax technical advice? \[This question may be relevant when assessing the reasonableness of the reliance on the past position and the potential impact of the timing of the application of the new position. For example, does this type of taxpayer have tax expertise themselves or in-house, or ready access to affordable advice or is the opposite true?\]  What impact will the decision about the application date have on taxpayers' ability to comply? \[In selecting an application date, consider the ability for taxpayers to comply within and for that period. If compliance would be difficult for taxpayers, then this might suggest another option would be preferable.\]  What impact will the decision about the application date have on Inland Revenue’s resources? \[Taking all considerations into account, if the impact on the application date selected will have a significant effect on Inland Revenue’s resources, then consider adjusting the date. Said another way, we need to take into account the overarching integrity of the change and whether this would likely be compromised by the selection of a certain date (over another date) because we could not implement the change effectively.\] 10 UNCLASSIFIED 2017-01-12  How much revenue is at stake? \[If the revenue at stake is considerable this may weigh against adopting a prospective approach for less favourable positions, or permitting reassessments retrospectively where the position is more favourable.\]  What has Inland Revenue done in similar situations in the past? \[This is important in terms of testing whether we are being consistent in our approaches in like situations.\] 29. Having decided from when the new position should be applied, consider any transitional issues for taxpayers moving to that position from their past treatment or from any interim position. Any positions adopted to deal with transitional issues need to be robust enough such that if taxpayers do not comply we are prepared to follow up with audit action. 30. Where the new position is not in accordance with intended or desired policy, PAS will generally consider whether to recommend to government to change the law. At this point further consideration will be needed about whether any interim operational position can and will remain in place while the new legislation is formulated, consulted on and enacted (which is likely to take some time). A new interim operational position may be needed depending on when the new legislation is likely to be enacted. (PAS would be considering from a legislative position whether savings provisions and/or transitional rules need to feature as part of the legislative amendments.) Step 4: Determine how (when and in what format) to communicate the Commissioner’s approach to the matter both internally and externally. 31. Those responsible for considering the relevant issues and identifying the plan for moving forward on an issue will also need to overtly decide on a communication plan. It is likely it will be necessary to first communicate to Service Delivery that the matter has been identified and is being looked into – this may also involve requiring staff to report any similar issues to a central issues group to ensure consistency. Careful consideration needs to be given to when and how best to provide external information. Staff from our communications area will need to be informed early and kept “in the loop” as the matter progresses. Thought should especially be given to how the message will likely be received - given the background to the matter, will there be a negative reaction, and if so, by whom and to what degree? The answer to this will also inform how the delivery of information should be handled. 32. In many cases, there will also be a need to set an operational position and to communicate that position. Internally, this will usually be done through an OpInfo item or a memo from the Group Tax Counsel or Group Manager, Investigations & Advice (I & A). Externally, the most likely vehicle is through a Commissioner’s Operational Position. A central issues group or, in exceptional circumstances, an email address, may need to be established through which those internally or externally uncertain about what to do about a matter can raise issues. “Frequently asked questions” or a media statement may also be needed. It will be important to ensure, as far as possible, that any advice available on the website and through the call centre (the IR Knowledge Base) is consistent with any operational position. 33. Once a final position has been reached, the necessary communications will need to be reconsidered – how can Inland Revenue best ensure taxpayers and their advisors are fully informed about the nature and timing of any change and the implications for them? Working closely with relevant stakeholders (eg, Chartered 11 UNCLASSIFIED 2017-01-12 Accountants Australia and New Zealand, New Zealand Law Society, Corporate Taxpayers Group, and industry bodies) will be important. It will usually be necessary to tailor the communication to the situation – possible approaches could include – media statements, one-on-one meetings, a Commissioner’s Operational Position to accompany a final interpretative statement, webinars or seminars. Again, it will be important to ensure all advice is consistent no matter where it is found – the website, call centre and printed publications will need to be updated. Responsibilities under this approach 34. Much of what is set out above is already happening within Inland Revenue. However, the purpose of this document is to ensure that the approach is more transparent and it is clearer who is responsible and accountable, and the authorised decision-maker for different aspects of any matter. This document also sets out a clear process and principles to consider in terms of possible actions, unless a specified case requires a modified approach. 35. As explored above, one key aspect is to ensure issues are identified early and steps are taken to decide what we should do about them. This suggests some kind of committee or group with representatives from LTS, PAS, Investigations and the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel (OCTC) at the least. TIG already exists and includes attendees from all those areas. Given this, it is thought desirable, in the first instance, to continue to use TIG (and the network underpinning it) for the referral of potential change issues for consideration and identification. One modification to existing processes would be to ensure any issues potentially involving change or perceived change are “flagged” and, if significant, or potentially significant, reported on to the Technical Governance Committee (TGC) to maximise awareness and oversight. 36. Where issues are reported to TGC they will be noted as potentially raising “change” concerns. In this way, TGC will be able to monitor the progress of an issue and where necessary provide direction on its handling and resolution. 37. When an issue is identified as involving a change or perceived change and being significant enough to warrant it, a core issues group (with a lead person) of representatives from LTS, PAS, I & A and/or OCTC (as appropriate depending on the issue) would be established. TGC will nominate these representatives. This issues group would be responsible for considering the matter as it progresses through the steps and ensuring timely resolution. For significant issues, this issue group might sometimes update TGC in person on the handling of the matter. 38. A further aspect of the approach set out above is the need to establish and communicate interim operational positions (clearly and as early as possible). Under existing processes, LTS Technical Standards, in conjunction with the Group Tax Counsel as sign-off, are responsible for setting any interim operational positions in conjunction with consultation with the issues group (and in some cases TGC). This is another aspect TGC will oversee. Summary 39. So to summarise, the key points of this approach are as follows:  Change of position situations arise in a wide variety of ways; 12 UNCLASSIFIED 2017-01-12  The approach set out in this document should be used as a basis for working through change of position situations, unless a specified case requires a modified approach;  TIG networks will assist with the early identification of issues and refer issues to TIG for consideration;  TIG will act as a filter and monitor of potential issues;  TIG, with LTS Technical Standards’ assistance where needed, will identify what, if any, is Inland Revenue’s current interpretation or practice (ie, what we are currently doing on an issue) and recommend whether any “new” position is a change in the Commissioner’s position;  LTS Technical Standards (as convenor of TIG) will manage issues through TIG and be responsible for flagging any significant, or potentially significant, “change” issues to TGC;  LTS Technical Standards, in conjunction with the GTC, will be responsible for any interim or final operational positions (including those dealing with any transitional issues);  TGC will oversee sensitive change issues and provide direction for their handling and resolution;  Where needed, a representative issue group (with a lead person) formed to deal with a particular issue will have responsibility for advancing and implementing the resolution of that issue.

Page 6 of 27 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] This plan sets out the internal communications approach and activities for Business Transformation Stage 4 Workstream 1 (START Delivery) for the period July 2020 to December 2021. The activities detailed in this plan will ensure IR’s people understand, support and take the appropriate actions required to enable the transformation. This document is a point in time and our plans will be strengthened as we work closely with our internal stakeholders. There will also be a separate communications plan for go-live and early life support. This plan should be read in conjunction with: • Stage 4 START Delivery Stakeholder Engagement Plan. • Stage 4 START Delivery Customer Communications and Marketing Plans, to be developed later in the year in conjunction with IR Marketing and Communications. 1.1 About Inland Revenue IR is an organisation of around 5,000 staff dispersed across 17 cities and towns in New Zealand. IR collects 80% of the revenue that the New Zealand Government needs to fund the country. In the 2018-2019 financial year Inland Revenue; • We collected approximately $113M from duties in 2019. • We have approximately 2,500 active New Zealand Foreign Trusts registered with IR. • We received just under $13 million in Unclaimed Monies and paid out $1.4 million. • We collected $471 million from more than 164,000 parents who pay child support. We distributed $290 million to receiving carers. • We made $367 million paid parental leave payments to 66,923 parents. 1.2 About Business Transformation Business Transformation (BT) is a multi-year, multi-stage change programme that will help IR become the modern world-class revenue organisation that's set out in our vision IR for the Future. It's about changing Inland Revenue to make it simpler, more open and certain for New Zealanders to pay their taxes and receive their entitlements. The programme's objectives are: • Improving agility so policy changes can be made in a timely and cost-effective manner. • Delivering new and more effective services to improve customer compliance and help support the outcomes of social policies. Page 7 of 27 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] • Improving productivity and reducing the cost of providing our services. • Improving the customer experience by making it easier and simpler for our taxation and social policy customers, with a particular focus on enhanced digital provision of services. • Increasing the secure sharing of intelligence and information to improve delivery of services to New Zealanders and improve public sector performance. • Minimising the risk of protracted system outages and intermittent systems failure. From a functional perspective, a key aspect of the programme change is the progressive replacement of the FIRST core tax and social policy system with START. The programme also requires other significant shifts including changes to the organisation model, the introduction of supporting technology and a review of policy and legislative settings to frame and support the programme’s objectives. 1.3 Business Transformation START delivery progress to date As at June 2020, the following has been delivered: 1. Business Transformation Stage 1, delivering GST and some other functions into START including Case Manager and Customer Interaction Manager, and making GST easier for customers and making the management of GST simpler and faster for IR and the government. 2. Business Transformation Release 2 delivering the Account Income Method (AIM), voluntary Payday Filing, Withholding taxes, Fringe Benefits Taxes, Gaming Machine Duty, EMS, and imaging correspondence. 3. Business Transformation Release 3 delivering income tax, donation tax credits, Working for Families tax credits and the Customer Master from FIRST to START. Introducing new approaches to meeting tax obligations and paying tax, including a new year end assessment process for many individual income tax customers. Payday filling, optional from Release 2, became compulsory for employers. 4. Business Transformation Release 4 delivering student loans and KiwiSaver products into START and moving the end-to-end processing of employer obligations (PAYE) into START. We also implemented a number of income tax and working for family’s enhancements. 1.4 START Delivery Scope for Stage 4 There are three parts to the START Delivery workstream. • transferring the remaining products into START • implementing new legislation, including what we need to put in place to support the government’s COVID-19 response, and • delivering optimisation initiatives (subject to prioritisation). Transferring the remaining products into START Page 8 of 27 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] The products will be split into two groups – for an initial release in February or March 2021 and a later release in October 2021, which will also include the upgrade to START v12. The earlier release, targeting 1st March 2021 will include the following products: • Unclaimed Monies. • Paid Parental Leave. • Duties – including casino, lottery and totalisator duty, along with the problem gambling levy. • New Zealand Foreign Trusts. The later release, in October 2021 includes the following product: • Child Support. • START and myIR Version upgrade. • Several smaller changes including creating the START archive New legislation, including supporting the Government’s COVID-19 response This stream of work includes a number of known legislative changes such as Portfolio Investment Entity (PIE) income becoming refundable which will affect the 2021 auto-calc and the removal of child support incremental penalty. Also likely in this period, is legislative change as part of any incoming government’s first 100 day-day plan following the September 2020 election. Managing the response to COVID-19 is also going to continue to be a key priority for the Government for the foreseeable future. The pandemic has had a significant impact on almost everyone in New Zealand and the Government has already introduced a wide range of measures to assist. These include the wage subsidy scheme and the Small Business Cashflow (Loan) Scheme for small to medium sized businesses, as well as several initiatives for families and individuals, particularly to help those who may have lost jobs or income. To implement many of these initiatives, legislative changes were necessary, and experience shows us that there’s likely to be more to come. Optimisation At the same time as we complete the implementation of the core START products, we’ll look to optimise the products and processes that we have delivered through our previous releases including Tax on Income, Working for Families, KiwiSaver, Student Loans etc. Optimisation involves working with the business to pick out the things which will improve the experience for our customers and improve the efficiency of our processes. The business will play a key role in prioritising what we can deliver in this stream. A group of leaders from across the business has been set up to provide recommendations to the Transformation Executive Working Committee (TEWC). We expect the size of tasks will vary, with some requiring a larger, more focused delivery approach, while others can be likened to fine tuning, rather than a major change. Page 9 of 27 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 1.4.4 Other There is also some scope which falls under “other” in Workstream 1. One of these is the KiwiSaver Future State project which is about replacing the Heritage AS2 Business to Business (B2B) gateway with Gateway Services Application Programming Interfaces (API’s) between IR and the KiwiSaver providers. We’re currently in the process of understanding the change impact on our people including what changes are likely to require internal communications targeting our people working on KiwiSaver. The Annual Changes stream of work also sits in the “other” scope items. 1.5 About Business Transformation internal engagement START delivery has been the major focus of the majority of our people throughout the transformation programme. We’ve delivered a lot of change and have used high profile, highly effective communications campaigns to capture and hold our people’s attention. Now we’re at stage 4. For many of our front-line people, their perception is that with the majority of products already in deployed, BT is finished. Their work is in START, there’s minimal co-existence and they are now focused on delivering their work using their new tools and capabilities and moving to the future operating model. There will be interest in what’s happening in the other BT workstreams – removing FIRST user access, decommissioning and archiving (particularly what data are we retaining and disposing of), the new home base Haukāinga which will replace our intranet, a new payroll system and how the capability and processes developed by the programme will transition to the business when the programme closes (linked to the future operating model). This means that to engage people in further changes to START, we must take a different approach to communication than in previous releases, to ensure we can capture and hold their attention where and when we need to. 1.5.1 First Release – S4.1.R1 The number of people directly impacted in the first release (S4.1.R1) is small. The Families segment will be deeply interested in Paid Parental Leave (PPL) and may take the opportunity to broaden out the number of people who do PPL work. Specific teams within the Individuals segment do es work around unclaimed monies and duties. T he International Revenue Strategy segment manage New Zealand Foreign Trusts. Our people in the Contact Centre, Community Compliance, Significant Enterprises and External Relationships will need general awareness of the changes so they can answer simple customer enquiries and provide myIR support. We will target these groups, leveraging our technology and they will be included in our Teams Live Deep Dive events. For the first release, our communications will be targeted and include support for business engagements led by the Product Owners and the OCMT team, with less emphasis on all-IR communications Where our campaigns may need to become more general is in the support of Optimisation and legislative change. Our people will need to know what’s happening, including what is being Page 10 of 27 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] worked on as well as how the customer experience is being improved and any changes to business processes and procedures. We will make sure we have a robust plan around these communications. 1.5.2 Second Release – S4.1.R2 The second release (S4.1.R2) where we move child support into START directly impacts around 450 people in the Families Segment. Internal communication and engagement will also be required to support the ratification of the Hague Convention, which allows for maintenance to be recognised and enforced in other member countries. NZ will apply it to child and spousal support in line the second release. At the same time, we’re upgrading START and myIR to a new version - Version 12. This may feel like a big change for our people because START will look different, but it will still do all the same things and usability will be better. The bigger impact is on our customers because of changes to myIR – both how it looks and navigates - including how calls to actions are presented for all products and all customers. There is a big job to do to ensure customer- facing teams, in particular Community Compliance, Significant Enterprises and the Contact Centre, are re-engaged and empowered to help and support their customers, so we continue to drive uptake and make digital channels the preferred option for customers. A key principle of our internal stakeholder engagement and communications is that we will ‘start from the top’. We will follow this principle again for Stage 4. This means our communications campaigns will first provide people leaders with a good understanding of what is changing and why, so they can lead, coach and support their people through these changes. We will target specific leaders whose teams are impacted to ensure that they have enough information to lead their teams through the changes. Page 11 of 27 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Stage 4, Workstream 1, START Delivery, Internal key stakeholders Figure 1: Internal key stakeholders Refer to the Internal and External Stakeholder Engagement Strategy and Plan for a more detailed analysis of internal audiences. Page 12 of 27 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] START Delivery internal communications activity seeks to overcome the following key challenges: 1. The update to START and myIR V12 brings change on change for teams who have been impacted at every release. Embedding could be difficult as people are still catching up. 2. The ongoing impacts of COVID-19 may add to our delivery scope and make engagement more difficult, and are not all known — but will include: • Changing priorities for our customers, affecting how we work. • Changes to our working environment – how and where our people work. 3. High levels of change across IR in 2020/2021, including organisation design change, can mean change fatigue and less bandwidth to focus on Stage 4. 4. Organisation design change will mean changes to teams and individuals BT depends on for stakeholder engagement, marketing and communications. Page 13 of 27 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Stage 4 is the final step in our multi-stage transformation journey. From a START delivery perspective, the impact on our people overall is lower than previous releases and will be felt by specific teams who do specific work. 4.1 First release impacts Significantly fewer people are impacted in the first release (S4.1.R1) with most people requiring awareness and light touch support only so they can deal with simple customer enquiries and referrals. The way we support our people to get ready for the release can be scaled accordingly by taking an individualised approach with those most highly impacted. • HIGH impact for the specialist unclaimed monies team when their work moves into START and from legislative change. All of their current processes from a holder and claimant/owner perspective will change. They will have revised guidance on how they apply their judgement to determine if the Commissioner is satisfied that the claimant is the owner before refunds can be made. The impact of legislative changes to how and when holders file UCM, the ability to use available historical data held by Inland Revenue to locate owners, and the automated publishing of the unclaimed monies list on the website is likely to generate a significantly higher volume of proactive actions and an influx of enquiries, claims, cases and refunds. • MEDIUM impact for the specialist PPL team when their work moves into START and LOW impacts for employer-handling teams including CCS-Individuals (Contact Centre and Transactional processing), depending on design decisions. There is potential for a wider group of people in the Families segment or Contact Centre to undertake PPL work, including taking applications over the phone by exception. The PPL team currently provide business continuity cover for IR payroll and this will need to be revisited when they cease working in the SAP payroll system. • MEDIUM impact for the small specialist duties team as automation in START will remove a significant amount of the manual work that currently exist eg manual reconciliations, validations to reduce duplicate returns and misdirected payments, automatic application of penalties and interest, credit offsets to other account types. • LOW - MEDIUM impact for International Revenue Strategy and Significant Enterprises in respect of New Zealand Foreign Trusts as manual processes move into START eg digital channels for receiving and managing information and returns from trustees, validations to improve data quality and reduce manual handling, automated processing of payments and invoicing. 4.2 Second release impacts The impact on our people will increase for the second release (S4.1.R2) with around 460 people in child support teams across 10 sites. The v12 upgrade will impact everyone who uses START to some degree, with the most impact of those people supporting customers to use myIR in Community Compliance, Significant Enterprises and the Contact Centre. Page 14 of 27 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] • MEDIUM - HIGH impacts for child support teams in the Families Segment as their work moves into START, large transactional processes are automated and as specialist functions such as international child support are integrated into core systems. Child support people will also need to understand legislative and technical changes, e.g. as a result of the Hague Convention and Child Support Amendment Bill. Our people will need to be able to support child support receiving carers and paying parents navigate and use myIR and understand the changes and choices that affect them and the children. Improved information sharing with MSD and Oranga Tamariki and extending the MSD portal for social policy purposes should make interactions with partner agencies easier. • HIGH impacts for customer-facing teams who will need to support customers adjust to further myIR change, particularly Community Compliance, Significant Enterprises and the Contact Centre. v 12 is the first upgrade and an opportunity to re-engage our people with START and myIR functionality with a focus on benefits to them and customers. We will look to empower our people to help customers with a better understanding of the system so they can continue to drive uptake and help customers to stick with digital channels. • LOW - MEDIUM impact for all people who use START with changes to look and feel, navigation and some processes affecting all products and functions. New functionality may be introduced, subject to design decisions. There are also likely to be consequential impacts to reports and reporting. Page 15 of 27 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 5.1 Core proposition A core proposition sits at the centre of our communications and engagement activity. It illustrates the heart of what we want to convey to our people, customers, stakeholders and audiences. Our core proposition supports the reason for the transformation and will remain relevant for the lifetime of the transformation: Making tax simpler, more open and certain for New Zealanders to pay their taxes and receive their entitlements. 5.2 Overarching narrative We’re making it simpler, more open and certain for New Zealanders to pay their taxes and receive their entitlements. The wider benefits of our transformation include: 1. Making it easier for people to get things right and difficult to get wrong—and increasing voluntary compliance. 2. Ensuring continued collection of tax revenue. 3. Contributing to a growing, healthy economy. 4. Improving government’s ability to make policy changes more quickly and cost- effectively. 5. Improving the resilience of the tax system. 5.3 Key messages 5.3.1 Key messages for Stage 4, Workstream 1 • This is the final stage of the Business Transformation Programme and the changes we’re making will end system coexistence for all of our teams and give our people better access to information about our customers, meaning we’ll be faster and more accurate in our processing. • In time, these changes should allow customers to do more for themselves, freeing our people up to deal with more complex customer enquiries. • Workstream one is called START Delivery – and there’s three parts. • The first involves moving the remaining products into START. To do this we’re splitting the remaining products into two groups – an initial release in 2021 and a later release in October 2021. • The second part includes supporting the Government’s response to COVID-19, Budget initiatives and any other legislative changes we may need to implement Page 16 of 27 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] (some of which may not be implemented in START but will require changes to START Help). • The third part is about improving aspects of the products and processes that we have delivered through our previous START releases. This is called Optimisation which will be led by the business who will select things that BT will implement. • Some of the proposed changes require legislative amendments, and we expect these to be introduced to the house during 2020 or 2021. Some products may go live before the legislative changes are enacted, with policy and operational contingency plans in place. The key messages by product/service assume the relevant legislation will pass. • On completion of Stage 4 there will be no more BT Programme! But change won’t stop there. It will be ongoing, so we remain the modern world-class revenue organisation we’ve all created today. 5.4 Key messages by product/service 5.4.1 Unclaimed Monies • We’re making changes to Unclaimed Monies, which is money that is passed to the Crown when a business/organisation is unable to find the owner, after a period of time. • From 2021, when the new legislation is enacted, it will be defined as an Inland Revenue Act so that Inland Revenue can use the information, we hold to find the owners of the money. • We are changing the length of time before money is classified as “unclaimed” to five years (it is currently 6 years and, in some cases, 25 years). • In some situations, where money remains unclaimed by a former client/customer the holder can transfer the money to Inland Revenue straight away. • The threshold for transferring unclaimed monies remains at $100, but the Commissioner has discretion to accept smaller amounts. 5.4.2 New Zealand Foreign Trusts • We are making some changes to the way New Zealand Foreign Trusts are administered. • Moving away from paper forms and processes • Moving to digital channels for providing and managing information • Reducing manual handling and improving processing of information 5.4.3 Duties Page 17 of 27 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] • We are changing the way we administer duties. • The move to START will enable digital channels for receiving and distributing information and money. • We’ll also automate processing of returns, payments, P&I, disbursements and reconciliation. 5.4.4 Paid Parental • We’re making some changes to Paid Parental Leave. • Customers will be able to submit applications and update their circumstances via digital channels. • It will also allow automated processing of applications, disbursements and monitoring to present overpayments. 5.4.5 Child Support • We’re making some changes to Child Support. • Subject to legislation, we’re removing the incremental penalty. This change will be made in FIRST as part of the Annual Changes project in April 2021 ahead of the second release. • Moving Child Support into START will modernise and improve information sharing, online services, and self-management tools and deliver straight-through processing with fewer manual interventions, automating large transactional processes and providing a better integration of International Child Support into core systems. • We’ll also deliver legislative changes to improve fairness, simplify aspects of the scheme, improve compliance and deliver on Government goals to improve the wellbeing of children. • It may include changes that affect some individuals, such as requiring some to start paying child support directly via their employer. 5.4.6 START Version 12 • We’re upgrading START and myIR to version 12. • The changes will include better functionality, enhanced security, a different navigational structure and a new look and feel. • Part of the upgrade means myIR will look different and our people in frontline / customer facing roles will have to support customers during this transition. Page 18 of 27 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Effective engagement with our people remains just as important in this final stage of the programme. In this stage, we will transition new teams to the system, re-engage the wider IR audience to embrace the START and myIR upgrade and build pride and confidence in what has achieved for IR and its customers as the transformation programme closes. • It is important that our people understand the key milestones of the programme lifecycle and how they can support those milestones. It is also imperative that we mirror our external customer campaigns internally, so our people can support our customers through the changes. • In this release we’re changing our approach to focus on the teams where change is relevant, so we’ll create more focused communication for the first release rather than relying on the broadcast channels we have used in previous releases. • In the second release, the v12 upgrade impacts a much wider audience and creates an opportunity for us to re-engage our people through our broadcast channels. This is not a new product, but rather an upgrade so we will treat it as such accordingly. • As this is the final stage of the Transformation, we’re taking the opportunity to highlight people who have worked on the programme and gone back to the business to showcase their skills. We’ll also be highlighting benefits that have been delivered through previous releases. These communications are designed to give people confidence that when the BT Programme winds up, there are a lot of people within the organisation who were part of the design and decision-making process. 6.1 Communications objectives Successful communications provide both a proactive strategy and reactive treatments. At a broad level our communications objectives are: • Decision-makers (members of boards, governance and reference groups) and influencers (leaders whose opinion and positive perception of the programme will contribute to its success) understand and support transformation and have continued confidence in BT’s ability to deliver. • Ensure our people feel confident that at the conclusion of the Programme, the organisation has the knowledge, experience and skills to use the tools and systems implemented by the BT Programme. • Empower our people to help customers with a better understanding of the system. • Ensure our people know what is being shared with customers and when, ahead of time. • Ensure our people are sufficiently well informed, allowing them to go into their training in the best place. Page 19 of 27 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] • Everyone impacted by the START Delivery workstream knows what will change, the benefits of change to themselves and their customers, what they need to do differently and when. • Communication risks are identified, managed and mitigated. 6.2 Communications approach Our communications approach is in five parts: 6.2.1 Signpost where the information can be found • Through the BT Intranet pages, we have created a great reference library of information that is very product specific. We need to consistently sign post this information so that people know where to find it. 6.2.2 Make transformation part of our everyday conversations • Work with others to ensure transformation content is an integral part of BAU organisational activities including: o Conversations that people have with our customer-facing teams (with CCS-I and CCS-B ). o Business unit newsletters, news stories and other internal content (with Internal Communications). 6.2.3 Create START advocates • Support the BT team to be proud to work on the programme, and equip them with information and stories to support their interactions with people across IR. • Support the key users to play more of a role pre go -live to proactively promote key features in START. • Support our Product Owners and OCMT Team to deliver targeted business engagements with impacted teams to share the features and changes. • Ensure every IR employee who plays a role within the programme – eg SMEs, developers, testers and workshop attendees - remains connected and informed throughout the final stage. • Create opportunities for IR staff to engage with and understand the changes to START, such as, Open Homes and Regional People Leaders’ Forums. • Give our people the confidence to be advocates of START with our customers. 6.2.4 Actively support our leaders to lead and our unions to support. • Where practical and desirable, tell leaders and unions first. • Use the unions as BT advocates e.g. through BT Workshops and Updates. • Enable and support leaders to have high-quality conversations with their teams. Page 20 of 27 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] • Support team leaders to lead and coach their people through the final stage of Transformation. 6.2.5 Demonstrate IR values • Be customer-centric - Increase our agility. Be swift to respond to opportunities and be quick to change what isn’t working. • Continue to use business intelligence, measurement, feedback and what we've learned to inform our communications and engagement activities. • Ensure we acknowledge diversity in our communications. 6.3 Communications channels The final stage of Transformation requires a different approach to previous releases. Our people impacted by many of the changes work in discreet areas across the organisation and are easy to target directly. Also, the way the organisation works has changed since the COVID pandemic – with more flexibility around working from home. We need to ensure our channels are fit for purpose to address their changes. In particular, we will focus on: 6.3.1 Business Engagements • Our people impacted by many of the changes work in discreet areas across the organisation and are easy to target directly. This means much of the internal engagement and communications will be direct with the teams via the Product Owners and their teams. We’ll support these engagements through the deep dive events and creating material as required. • We will also identify these teams’ existing or preferred channels to share information appropriately 6.3.2 Visual story telling • Identifying opportunities to use video and multi-media to tell customer and staff stories. • Continuing to provide collateral, like Meetings in a Box, to ensure consistent messaging for complex and important information. 6.3.3 Digital engagement • Develop new ways to engage our people through Base Configuration Verification sessions, Regional People Leaders’ Forums and Open Homes, this year being conducted mainly online. • Continue to point impacted teams to the BT intranet pages as the single source of truth for the changes. • Leverage the opportunities afforded by digital channels and make the most of the BT intranet, Yammer and Teams spaces. Page 21 of 27 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Page 22 of 27 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 6.4 Channels and Tactics Tactic Focus of tactic When Channels for Leaders BT channels will be used to communicate core information around START Delivery. BT Leaders Update Sets the narrative for the month, outlining key points that leaders need to know and can take away and share with their teams, including introducing new terminology. Second Thursday of every month BT Monthly Info Pack Contains the key messages and builds on the themes introduced in the Leaders Update. The BT Monthly pack will be distributed to BTMs, Customer Segment Leads, Group Managers, Product Owners and key users, to share up-to-date information on BT progress. Third week of every month Open Homes Used to test change impacts and ensure they capture what will be different, and to educate attendees. These will be run online for Stage 4 and there will be two, one for each release. August 2020 and May 2021 People Leaders’ Forum To help leaders understand the change and to provide the tools and information required to lead their people through the final stages of Transformation, and other topics. This will be run online this year. October People Leaders Messages Used to give leaders a heads up about what’s coming, reminders or information they need to share with their teams. These have moved to weekly and there is also an opportunity for any urgent messages to be sent out of cycle. As required Attendance at Leadership Meetings With the smaller teams impacted, there is more opportunity to present to leadership teams around the changes. This has already started happening. Page 23 of 27 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Channels for all our people The following channels are for all our people. Transformation News Designed to reinforce the messages that have been delivered by leaders from the BT Leaders Update and the BT Monthly Info Pack. Fourth week of every month Deep dive Updates (webinars) These are used to provide further detailed information about specific topics. They are presented by subject matter experts and accompanied by a detailed presentation and question and answer session. As required Videos Videos have been used with great success in previous releases. We will continue to use them, where appropriate – to highlight senior-level endorsement, to give messages clarity or bring them to life and to signpost more formal communications on the intranet or other media, eg ‘Day in the life’ videos. As required Virtual Chat with Greg Virtual chat with Greg sessions will be offered to staff in various locations to reconfirm the why and the benefits of this transformation and support ongoing change eg the upgrade to version 12. TBC Meeting in a box Used when there is technical information and it would help the leader to have prompts to aid team discussion. Where possible, an activity is provided to help embed the message. As required BT Intranet Used by our people as the internal ‘single source of truth’, information will be created and added to regularly. From June and updated regularly, as required START Delivery Infographic Like Releases 2 and 3, we will create an infographic to help explain the scope of START Delivery. One-off Page 24 of 27 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Channels for all our people The following channels are for all our people. Business Engagements Given the size of the impacted groups for this release, there will be opportunities to hold information sessions and engagements regarding the changes. Featured News Used whenever there is critical information to share with all IR people. It is the most read existing IR internal communications channel. As required Yammer / Teams Yammer has been used with success in previous releases (particularly for competitions). We will explore how we might continue to use this, and Team channels complement existing channels. As required Posters As with previous releases, there is an opportunity to attract attention through posters. As required Other Unions – Teams events, workshops and national union meetings Unions are kept up to date with progress through monthly teleconferences and attendance at national union meetings. When required, workshops are also held. Monthly – Teams Event Workshops – 3 per annum – August/Sept, February June/July. BAU communications channels A range of newsletters are produced by different areas of the business and we’ll also work with the internal communications team to access the CCS channels. Page 25 of 27 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Risks Mitigations This is the final stage of Business Transformation and the changes will occur over an 18-month period, which requires us to keep people’s attention for a longer period. There is potential for change fatigue. Remind our people about what we are doing and why and then take a light touch approach when we don’t need their attention. Provide a recap of what’s been achieved so far and the benefits – both to them and to our customers - of the changes that are coming. Provide case studies of how we’ve reduced re-work, improved compliance reduced the cost of compliance and made it simpler for customers. Many of the changes impact specialist teams, meaning that we can do targeted communications. However, there is a risk that if the business decides to assign different teams to that work, then people may not be as prepared as their colleagues. Ensure that we publicise opportunities for people to attend our deep dive sessions and promote transformation news and the BT Intranet pages as a source of information. Changes to the organisation through He Kōtuitui and the Future Operating Model will occur during this last phase of transformation and ar e likely to distract and compete for staff attention, creating challenges in achieving cut-through. Work collaboratively with the He Kōtuitui team and the Internal Communications team to understand impacts and avoid communications congestion, using the Executive Communications Group to escalate concerns. Page 26 of 27 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] It is essential that we measure what we do, and set targets for the future, giving us the ability to adapt plans. Below is a table setting out each objective and how it will be measured: Communications objective Measurement Decision-makers and influencers understand and support the transformation and have confidence in BT’s ability to deliver. Feedback from engagements with CCS leadership team Union feedback through monthly Teams Updates. Stakeholders and those who work at IR feel they have been engaged and involved in transformation and understand and support the need for change. Internal Channel survey. Yammer/Teams Survey. Readership of BT content on IR intranet, BT intranet and People Leaders Space. Subscriptions to internal Transformation News. BT Leaders’ TEAM event attendance and feedback. Feedback from BT events including Open homes, Regional People Leaders’ Forum. Comments and questions on IR intranet and BT inbox. Everyone impacted by the changes, both internally and externally, knows what will change, the benefits to them and their customers, what they will need to do differently and when. Internal Channel survey. Business and people readiness survey (run in lead up and just after go-live). Communications risks are managed and mitigated. Measured as per BT Risk Register in JIRA.

For example, if your balance date is 31 December, please provide information for the year ended 31 December 2022. Alternatively, if your balance date is 30 September, please provide information for the year ended 30 September 2023). Please send the form to internationalquestionnaire@ird.govt.nz by 15 April 2024. Part A: Basic worldwide group details at balance date Name of New Zealand parent entity: this is the top tier New Zealand entity with an immediate non- resident shareholder. It may be the New Zealand branch of an overseas company. Where there are multiple entry points into New Zealand, more than one member of the worldwide group may get a questionnaire. Part B: New Zealand financial accounting group numbers ¾The numbers in this part will often come directly from the consolidated financial statements filed with the Companies Office for the New Zealand group. ¾For a branch, use the New Zealand branch accounts. ¾Where there are multiple entry points into New Zealand, report on each group separately (you should have received a questionnaire for each group if its turnover was over $30 million). ¾Where a group has subsidiaries overseas, you may exclude their results but please provide details in an attachment to your response. ¾Figures can be rounded to the nearest thousand. ¾If financial statements are prepared in a currency other than New Zealand dollars, the numbers may be in that currency but please note this in your response. ¾Interest expense and interest income will usually be labelled as such in the financial statements and relate to the borrowing and lending of funds. Please exclude FX gains and losses. Also, please use an attachment to your response to provide any clarification of the figures provided, particularly if they depart from the financial statements. Part C: 7KLQcDSLWDOLVDWLRQ ¾The “debt percentage of New Zealand group” is calculated as per sections FE 14 to FE 16 of the Income TaxAct 2007 (inclusive) and after section FE 13 (“the on-lending concession”) has been taken into account. ¾Rules which came into effect from 1 July 2018 require “non-debt liabilities” as defined in section FE 16B to be deducted from the value of assets. Non-debt liabilities are items like trade credits, GST payable, provisions for employee benefits, financial liabilities from GHULYDWLYHVDQGFHUWDLQGHIHUUHGWD\[OLDELOLWLHV3OHDVHUHIHUWR7,%9RO1R$SULO IURPSDJHDWZZZLUGJRYWQ\] 3 ¾Please remember that the rules apply to a group of non-residents who act in concert and own more than 50% of a company. ¾Please advise us if an election has been made in terms of section FE 30 to include another company in the group and/or the measurement date in section FE 8 is other than the end of the income year. Part D: Transfer pricing Question 1: For the purposes of the question, you can pick a representative month or calculate an average. Treat a full-time employee as one who works more than 30 hours a week. For part- time workers, add the hours worked in a month and divide by 120 to get the number of full-time equivalents. Question 2: For the purposes of this question, the amount earnt would include such items as salary, bonuses and the taxable value of fringe benefits. Question 3 : The primary transfer pricing method is the one which was applied to transactions having the most material effect, being the highest value of transactions. Please provide further details in an attachment if you wish to clarify your response. The transfer pricing methods are those referred to in section GC 13(2) and Chapter II of the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations 2017. Question : Illustrative examples of “material changes” are: ¾A change in the characterisation of a subsidiary from a limited risk distributor (e.g. not bearing risks associated with inventory or receivables) in the 202 tax year to a full risk distributor in the 2023 tax year; and ¾A change in risk assumption between associated parties as to who bears freight costs. Please provide further details in an attachment if you wish to clarify your response. Question : “Material structural changes” refers to any significant change relative to the group’s functions, assets held, an d risks borne in respect of its New Zealand operations. The term does not cover continued or incremental developments undertaken in the ordinary course of business or changes in corporate structure such as the establishment of new entities where they do not affect the functions, assets or risks of the New Zealand operations. 4XHVWLRQV$QVZHU\\HVLIIRUH\[DPSOHWKHYDOXHRIWUDQVDFWLRQVZLWK+RQJ.RQJZDV PLOOLRQDQGWKRVHZLWK,UHODQGZHUHPLOOLRQUHVXOWLQJLQWK HPLOOLRQEHLQJH\[FHHGHG Questions 7 and 8: Answers to these questions are to be derived from the same source data and on a consistent basis as the financial information disclosed in Part B. 4XHVWLRQ)RUPRUHLQIRUPDWLRQRQWUDQVIHUSULFLQJGRFXPHQWDWLRQSOHDVHUHIHUWR&KDSWHU9 RIWKH2(&'7UDQVIHU3ULFLQJ\*XLGHOLQHVIRU0XOWLQDWLRQDO(QWHUSULVHVDQG7D\[$GPLQLVWUDWLRQV  4 5 Common errors to avoid Avoiding the errors below will save you time and money. 1)Providing figures for the wrong income year. ➢This questionnaire is for the 2023 income year, which is balance dates falling between 1 October 2022 and 30 September 2023. 2)Not answering questions. ➢Please ensure you have answered all the questions on page 2. ➢Where a value is zero, please enter "0" rather than leaving a box blank. 3)Not following the instructions. ➢For example, please provide net profit before tax, not net profit after tax. 4)Not explaining departures from financial statements. ➢We generally expect figures to align with the consolidated financial statements for the relevant group. It is helpful to provide an explanation where this is not the case, such as when you choose to exclude controlled foreign companies. 5)Copying details from a previous questionnaire. ➢Please note our questionnaire changes from year to year s o please read the form carefully as to the current year’s requirements. 6)Forgetting to send the questionnaire once completed. ➢We follow up all questionnaires not received. 7)Responding for the wrong group. ➢If there are multiple entry points into New Zealand, one group may have a turnover more than $30 million while another may only have a turnover of $5 million. Please do not combine results. Each group will receive a questionnaire if it is significant enough. 8)Not responding to the questionnaire. ➢The questionnaire is compulsory but in the interests of goodwill we do not make a formal request at the outset. It is very important that you complete the questionnaire accurately and by the due date otherwise it will impact on your risk rating and trigger potentially unnecessary enforcement actions.

Interpretation of section 113: The Commissioner's ability to correct assessments
================================================================================

2014 case note – CIR's ability to correct assessments under s 113 of the Tax Administration Act - discretion, irrevocability, correct assessment.

Case

Westpac Securities NZ Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994, Income Tax Act 2007

### Summary

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue's ("the Commissioner") ability to exercise her discretion in s 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA") is not limited to amendments made to correct an assessment previously in error. Section 113 can also be applied to amend an assessment that is not incorrect and substitute another more appropriate assessment. Also, the Court held that the fact that an election made by the taxpayer was irrevocable did not limit the Commissioner's ability to exercise s 113.

### Case Impact Statement

This judgment confirms that the Commissioner's power to amend assessments in s 113 of the TAA is not limited by the "correctness" of the previous assessment; the Commissioner has a wide discretion to amend an existing assessment which may not be incorrect and substitute another more appropriate assessment. Further, the Court held that the irrevocability of elections in s IC 5(4) of the Income Tax Act 2007 ("ITA") did not preclude the Commissioner from exercising the s 113 discretion.

The judgment also indicates that in the exercise of the discretion the Commissioner may take into account factors such as that s 113 is not intended to be used by taxpayers as a way of circumventing the statutory disputes process or "gaming the system", the merits of the case, and the resources available to the Commissioner.

The Commissioner is currently considering the impact of this decision on her Standard Practice Statement (SPS 07/03) _Requests to amend assessments_. In the interim, the Commissioner will continue to apply SPS 07/03 having regard to this decision.

### Facts

The plaintiffs were all members of the Westpac group of companies ("Westpac"). Four of the group's companies elected to offset losses against the income of Westpac Securities NZ Ltd and WestpacTrust Securities NZ Ltd, which resulted in the latter companies being unable to use foreign tax credits that subsequently became available to them.

Westpac applied to the Commissioner under s 113 of the TAA for the Commissioner to amend the assessments of the relevant companies so that the losses could be offset elsewhere.

The Commissioner declined the request on the basis that s IC 5(4) of the ITA provides that loss offset elections are irrevocable and that provision applied equally to Westpac and the Commissioner; and that Westpac's elections were legally valid options which had resulted in correct assessments and so did not fall under her s 113 power to correct. In making the latter decision, the Commissioner also relied on the distinction drawn in her Standard Practice Statement (SPS 07/03) between genuine errors and regretted choice and decided that Westpac's case was one of regretted choice.

Westpac applied for judicial review of that decision.

### Decision

**_Section 113_**

Clifford J, referring to the dictionary definition of "correct" as meaning "free from error, true, accurate" or "in accordance with fact, truth, or reason" or "meeting the requirements of a particular situation", noted the concept of correctness was not necessarily a binary one. Clifford J concluded that, on a plain reading of s 113, the Commissioner was not precluded from amending an assessment which was on one understanding correct to ensure it is nevertheless accurate or most appropriate for a particular situation.

Clifford J considered this analysis was confirmed when s 113 was viewed in the context of the TAA and ITA as a whole. He reviewed the purpose of the self-assessment regime, the Commissioner's care and management provisions in ss 6 and 6A of the TAA, the disputes process and the circumstances in which the Commissioner may amend an assessment in ss 113A, 113B and 113C. He concluded from this review that the Commissioner's power to amend assessments was Parliament's recognition of the competing interests in a self-assessment tax system: that while taxpayers were obliged to self-assess correctly, amendments may still be necessary to ensure the integrity of the tax system is upheld.

Finally, Clifford J examined case law and the legislative history of s 113, noting that its predecessor (s 23 of the Income Tax Act 1976) provided the relevant power was to make all "alterations in or additions to" an assessment. The essence of the provision had remained the same and the previous authority on the interpretation of s 23 remained applicable. He noted that the Court of Appeal had emphasised the broad scope of s 23 and held that the Commissioner was not precluded from using s 113 to amend an assessment where there are a number of correct tax positions (_Wire Supplies Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2007\] NZCA 224, \[2007\] 3 NZLR 458). Equally, Wylie J had noted the unfettered nature of the s 113 discretion (_Arai Korp Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2013\] NZHC 958, (2013) 26 NZTC 21-014).

Taken together, Clifford J held that neither the authorities, nor the wording or purpose of s 113, required an amendment only where an incorrect tax position was taken. Further, he considered the integrity of the tax system would be undermined if the Commissioner was precluded from looking behind a correct tax position to consider whether the assessment needs correcting. It might be the case that allowing a taxpayer to amend a self-assessment was more consistent with the policy underpinnings of the legislation.

Accordingly, Clifford J held that the s 113 power was not limited in the way the Commissioner had argued. However, he also held it was not limited in the way Westpac had argued: that is, between a situation where the taxpayer makes a choice that with the benefit of hindsight is demonstrated to be less advantageous to an alternative position, and an error that would have been apparent at the time to a taxpayer with a proper appreciation of the relevant facts and law. His Honour considered that distinction would be a factor relevant to whether the Commissioner would exercise her discretion, rather than a limitation on the power itself. Relevant factors would also include the fact that s 113 is not intended to be used as a way of circumventing the disputes process, the merits of the case and the resources available to the Commissioner. Clifford J indicated that the fact that Westpac was a well-resourced taxpayer was also a relevant consideration.

**_Section IC5(4)_** 

Clifford J accepted Westpac's argument that s IC 5(4) of the ITA applied only to the taxpayer and not the Commissioner. His Honour agreed that the section was there to clarify that although the form of an election is a unilateral choice by one taxpayer, it would be impractical if that taxpayer could unilaterally revoke its choice as the election affected two taxpayers. However, that consideration did not apply to preclude the Commissioner from exercising her discretion under s 113.

Further, it would be impractical given the extensive number of situations in which the Commissioner may need to exercise her s 113 power, including resolving a dispute with a taxpayer, for her to be precluded in resolving that dispute from amending an irrevocable election.

**_Conclusion_**

Clifford J held that the Commissioner may consider whether to exercise her discretion under s 113 to correct Westpac's assessments in the manner requested by Westpac. However, whether she would exercise her discretionary power in that way was a matter for her and outside the scope of the Court's judgment.

Interpretation of section 89K(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994: the meaning of "as soon as reasonably practicable"
=======================================================================================================================

2015 case note – CIR properly refused to exercise discretion to accept the disputants' late statements as they were not issued 'as soon as reasonably practicable'.

Case

TRA 016/14 and TRA 017/14 \[2015\] NZTRA 08

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

This was a decision of the Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") confirming that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") had properly refused to exercise her discretion to accept the disputants' late statements of position ("SOPs") as they were not issued "as soon as reasonably practicable" as required by s 89K(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA").

### Facts

The disputants issued proceedings under s 89K(6) of the TAA challenging the Commissioner's refusal to accept their late SOPs.

On 1 December 2009, the disputants took title to two residential properties ("the Properties") from the trustees of the G Trust and claimed goods and services tax ("GST") input tax deductions. The disputants had been incorporated to purchase the Properties with finance provided by the two finance companies which had financed the G Trust. The G Trust was controlled by Mr G, who was facing various creditor claims and charges of tax evasion.

By letter dated 7 October 2010, the disputants were notified of the Commissioner's decision to assess the disputants' GST as nil without the issue of notices of proposed adjustment in accordance with s 89C(eb) of the TAA.

On 31 May 2013, Ms Y, the disputants' accountant requested all information held by the Commissioner in relation to the disputants pursuant to the Official Information Act 1982 ("OIA").

On 17 June 2013, the Commissioner replied stating that the information would be supplied when the Commissioner's SOPs and disclosure notices were issued. The SOPs and disclosure notices were issued on 11 September 2013. However, the information requested under the OIA was omitted. The information was eventually sent by courier under a covering letter of 11 October 2013 albeit it was incorrectly addressed.

The disputants requested an extension to file their SOPs, which they were granted until 12 December 2013. On 11 December 2013, Ms Y advised that she was still waiting for the relevant information and requested a further extension to file the disputants' SOPs.

In a letter dated 23 December 2013, the disputants were advised that there was no statutory authority for the Commissioner to provide an extension in relation to the issue of a SOP outside of the response period and were referred to s 89K of the TAA.

It was accepted by the disputants that the folder of documents was received on 15 January 2014.

On 25 March 2014, the disputants' counsel wrote to the Commissioner seeking confirmation that if SOPs were provided within three weeks of the Commissioner's response that they would be accepted as being within the required timeframe. On 2 April 2014, the Commissioner declined to give such a confirmation.

The disputants' SOPs were provided to the Commissioner under cover of a letter dated 22 May 2014. In that letter the disputants made an application that the SOPs be accepted under s 89K of the TAA as having been provided within the applicable response period.

On 23 July 2014, the Commissioner refused the disputants' application.

### Decision

The TRA was firmly of the view that the disputants in the two challenges had failed to issue their SOPs "as soon as reasonably practicable" as required by s 89K of the TAA and the Commissioner had properly refused to exercise her discretion to accept the late SOPs.

Judge Sinclair acknowledged that the Commissioner's investigation was protracted and complicated by her wider investigation. However, her Honour agreed with the Commissioner that the time taken to complete her investigation is not a relevant factor when considering the disputants' response time.  

The TRA stated that allegations of sham and tax avoidance are not uncommon and that the law in relation to both areas is reasonably settled. Accordingly, while careful analysis of the facts was required, no matters of particular complexity had been identified by the disputants that would have made the preparation of their SOPs especially time consuming.

Judge Sinclair further stated that the disputants had the ability to apply to the High Court for an extension of time for issuing their SOPs before the expiry of the response period but had failed to do so.

The TRA found that in effect the disputants had taken over six months to provide their SOPs from the date that they were originally due. The TRA also found that the disputants had shown no urgency in responding to the Commissioner's SOPs and that it was reasonable to expect that preparatory work on the SOPs would have been commenced by the disputants prior to receipt of the documents requested under the OIA.

Judge Sinclair considered it to be of particular importance that the matters arose within the disputes process contained in Part 4A of the TAA where there are strict time frames within which particular steps are to be taken.

Introduction and summary of the act
===================================

Income Tax Act 2007 - introduction and summary of the Act.

The Income Tax Act 2007, which received Royal assent on 1 November 2007, represents the fourth and final stage in the rewrite of income tax legislation using plain drafting techniques. The bill was introduced on 15 November 2006 and had its first reading on 23 November.

The Finance and Expenditure Committee reported the bill back to Parliament on 16 July 2007. The second reading and committee stages took place in August and the third reading on 25 October. It was the last bill referred to the Governor-General for signature by long-serving Clerk of the House, David McGee QC. It was also the largest bill to be passed by Parliament.

The Act rewrites Parts F to Y of the 2004 Act as well as the schedules to that Act. It also makes consequential amendments to Parts A to E to highlight the relationship between provisions in Parts F to Y with the core provisions, and to move income rules to Part C, deduction rules to Part D, and timing rules to Part E.

The rewriting of these provisions is not intended generally to change the effect of the law. However, there are a few exceptions to this general position, and these are listed as intended legislative changes in Schedule 51.

As the 2007 Act represents the final stage of the rewrite project, this _Tax Information Bulletin_:

*   outlines the main aspects of the Act's scheme, purpose, and structure;
*   explains the main consequential amendments to Parts A to E;
*   outlines the main drafting improvements in Parts F to R and the schedules;
*   outlines the intended legislative changes occurring in each Part;
*   summarises the general approach to drafting in the 2007 Act; and
*   outlines how the drafting style provides a consistent framework expected to be followed in the drafting of future legislation.

### Application

The Income Tax Act 2007 applies from the first day of the 2008-09 tax year or the first day of the corresponding income year of a person who has a tax balance date other than 31 March.

### History of the rewrite process

New Zealand's income tax legislation dates back to 1891. Since then, the legislation has significantly expanded the concept of "income tax" to keep pace with the changing nature of income-earning activities in New Zealand. Although income tax legislation was recast several times during the twentieth century, it was not until the 1990s that it was comprehensively reviewed from a structural and presentational perspective.

Various bodies and officials prepared reports and papers that discussed rewriting the income tax legislation, including:

*   the Consultative Committee on the Taxation of Income from Capital (the "Valabh Committee");
*   the Working Party on the Reorganisation of the Income Tax Act 1976; and
*   the Organisational Review of the Inland Revenue Department.

These groups highlighted various weaknesses in the numbering, formatting and reorganisation of the legislation. Problems included:

*   failure of the core provisions to integrate with each other and with the rest of the legislation;
*   the difficulty of discerning the scheme and purpose of the legislation;
*   a lack of logic in both the structure of the legislation and the ordering of some sections;
*   the lack of organisation of the legislation and its failure to reflect adequately the legislation's role of quantifying taxable income, imposing a tax liability on that income, and setting out a process of assessment and collection; and
*   the inconsistent drafting style and presence of redundant wording, cumbersome sections and repetitive provisions.

These reviews led to the establishment of the project to rewrite the Income Tax Act. The project's first stage was the re-ordering and renumbering of the Income Tax Act 1976, and the subsequent enactment of the 1994 Act and the Tax Administration Act 1994.

The 1994 Act organised the legislation into parts that were structured around a set of core provisions, using an alphanumeric system. There was some consolidation of material by topic, and the definitions were brought together in one section.

The next stage was the rewrite of the Core Provisions Act, which led to the enactment of the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996. The rewritten core provisions contain a clear conceptual scheme for the Act, based on the transactional approach to taxation. This scheme is also integrated with the assessment rules in the Tax Administration Act 1994. This framework is not expected to be disturbed in the future unless structural changes arise out of a review of the entire scheme of the Act.

The 2004 Act contained the rewritten Parts C to E. The main objective was to integrate the income, deduction and timing rules with the framework set out in the core provisions.

Some minor adjustments were made to the core provisions to clarify some aspects of those rules - for example, the development of a structure for the concept of "assessable income". Another key adjustment was the identification of the relationship between each specific deduction rule and both the general permission and the general limitations rules.

### Objective of the rewrite project

The rewrite project has consistently focused on the primary aim to produce legislation that clearly and unambiguously states the underlying policy. This objective is regarded as integral to reducing compliance and administrative costs and increasing voluntary compliance with the tax law.

Independent studies were commissioned to examine the readability of the 2004 Act by comparing provisions of the 2004 Act with their corresponding rule in the 1994 Act. The results of these studies generally concluded that provisions in the 2004 Act are easier to read and understand than their corresponding provisions in the 1994 Act.

**Consultation**

During the drafting, and in line with New Zealand's generic tax policy process, extensive consultation occurred with specialists within and outside Inland Revenue. The New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants and the New Zealand Law Society also made a significant contribution during the consultation and drafting process.

Consultation occurred at several points during the drafting of the Act:

*   before and after the release of Inland Revenue's exposure drafts of legislation for Parts F to N of the 2004 Act;
*   before the introduction of the Income Tax Bill 2006 in November 2006;
*   during submissions and consideration of the bill by the Finance and Expenditure Committee; and
*   after the select committee reported back the bill, but before its second reading.

This process was intended to provide assurance that the provisions in the 2007 Act have the same outcomes as those of the 2004 Act, unless a change in outcome is intended and listed in Schedule 51. The government has indicated that it will promote a remedial amendment to correct any provision in the new Act which is found to produce a different result from the outcome under the corresponding provision in the 2004 Act. This process will not apply when an intended change in outcome is noted in Schedule 51. Consultation was also undertaken on the manner of enacting the rewritten provisions. The options for the bill were to:

*   amend the 2004 Act by replacing Parts F to the end of the Act with rewritten Parts; or
*   produce a new Act containing rewritten Parts F to the end of the Act, including the schedules and consolidated parts A to E.

The second option was preferred in submissions and was supported by the Rewrite Advisory Panel mainly because it minimised confusion over the numbering of sections.

For example, the differences between the two options can be compared by reference to section FC 1 of the 2004 Act. This section is about the tax treatment of profit-related debentures. In the 2007 Act, the subject matter of section FC 1 is quite different from the content of section FC 1 of the 2004 Act. In the 2007 Act, section FC1 describes the operation of subpart FC, which is about the income tax treatment of transfers of certain property on death. Therefore, if the option to amend the 2004 Act had been chosen, readers would have needed to distinguish between two provisions bearing the same reference in the 2004 Act. In referring to section FC 1, a reader would need to make it clear whether the reference was to section FC 1 of the Act before it was amended or section FC 1 of the Act as inserted by the amendment.

Taking the option of a new Income Tax Act meant that readers can identify the provision in this example as section FC 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 or section FA 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

### Erroneous interpretations of provisions in the Act

Taxpayers should continue to have regard to the comments of the select committee in its commentary in reporting back the Income Tax Bill 2002 (Income Tax Act 2004). These comments are likely to be equally relevant to the 2007 Act.

In particular, the committee noted at that time, that there was a:

> "... risk that some practitioners, having previously misinterpreted some provisions in the old Act, may fail to realise that the rewrite Act clarifies the correct interpretation that applies to those provisions, and continue to apply their erroneous interpretation to the new Act. Such a situation should be minimised as far as possible, and we therefore encourage the Inland Revenue Department to undertake an education programme to inform practitioners that they cannot necessarily rely on their current understanding of the law, and should actively check the provisions contained in the new Act."

This statement remains relevant, as it is clear fromthe commencement and transitional provisions that Parliament intends that readers discern the meaning of aprovision using the normal rules of interpretation.

### Transition from the 2004 Act to the 2007 Act

he transitional provisions provide that the 2004 Act may be used as an interpretive guide to the 2007 Act, but only in limited circumstances. The 2007 Act is not intended to contain any changes in policy unless such a change is signalled in Schedule 51.

Reference to the provisions of the 2004 Act will not be required unless either of the following situations arise:

*   A provision in the 2007 Act is unclear or leads to an absurdity. In this situation, section ZA 1 ensures that the 2004 Act and associated case law are to be used as the key authoritative interpretive guide.
*   A clearly stated provision in the 2007 Act is compared with the corresponding provision and the 2004 Act to determine if that provision contains an unintended policy change. In this situation, the non-legislative process established for the 2004 Act facilitates a review of the factual situation raised and, if necessary, provides for a recommendation to the government for a remedial retrospective legislative change. This process is administered by the Rewrite Advisory Panel, headed by the Rt Hon Sir Ivor Richardson, former President of the Court of Appeal.

### Impact on other legislation

The 2007 Act repeals the 2004 Act, but only in relation to tax on income derived in the 2008-09 and later tax years (sections A 2(2) and ZA 1(2)). The 2007 Act also makes consequential amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994 (Schedule 50) and many other Acts of Parliament (Schedule 49).

### Key features

The short title and commencement provisions located before Part A and the core provisions in Parts A and B have some consequential but minor changes. These provisions also draw the reader's attention to reliance on concepts contained in the Interpretation Act 1999.

The overall operation of the core provisions is not altered by the 2007 Act. However, a working knowledge of the core provisions and their relationships to the rewritten provisions is fundamental to understanding the scheme and purpose of the Act and the way in which Parts F to R support the operation of the core provisions.

In addition, a number of other improvements to the Act have been made, including:

*   the signposting in Part I of all loss rules located in other Parts of the Act;
*   the signposting in Part L of all tax credit rules relating to the satisfaction of a person's income tax liability that are located in other Parts of the Act;
*   requiring tax withheld at source on prepaid income to be spread forward and matched with the timing of the income;
*   the use of tables to provide quicker access to the memorandum account rules;
*   the consolidation of the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations into the PAYE rules in Part R;
*   providing for a consistent use of a balance date approach to business rules when transactions affect more than one income year;
*   when appropriate, rules relating to particular types of entities or transactions are grouped together rather than being split between Parts F and H - for example, the collection of the consolidated company rules into subpart FM;
*   the omission of redundant rules - for example, sections CY 1, DY 1 and DY 2 of the 2004 Act; and
*   rationalising provisions that perform similar functions - for example, section OA 7, where a number of common rules deal with the treatment of opening and closing balances of memorandum accounts.

### Policy changes and obsolete provisions

All intended changes giving a change in legislative outcome are listed in Schedule 51. These intended changes typically involve clarifications of existing policy where the rules contained an ambiguity that required resolution as part of the rewrite process.

Provisions in the 2004 Act that have also become unnecessary or obsolete have been omitted from the rewritten Act. Schedule 52 identifies these omissions, many of which were located in the "Z" subparts of Parts C, D and E of the 2004 Act.

### General principles used in rewrite drafting

The principles used are:

*   organising the material from the general to the specific, and using general rules to perform a pivotal role to provide links to the core provisions;
*   starting Parts, subparts and sections with more widely used rules and concluding with less widely used rules;
*   grouping provisions performing similar functions or having similar subject matter to provide the reader with the relevant context;
*   reducing repetition by applying common sets of rules to minimise overlap;
*   limiting the subject matter of each section to a single concept;
*   adopting a plain language approach;
*   using a consistent format to aid accessibility by improving the flow of text.

In general, the drafting approach has been to use subpart A in each Part to provide a link to the core provisions if the Part as a whole supports the operation of the core provisions. This is most evident in Parts I, L, M and R. Parts E to G do not lend themselves to this approach as they focus on a range of transactions or entities which have an effect on the operation of Parts C or D, and sometimes subpart BC in determining a person's schedular income tax liability.

### Drafting changes

The main drafting changes made in rewriting Parts F to N of the 2004 Act relate mainly to structural relationships, are relatively minor, and are intended to improve the legislation. They fall into five main types:

*   the modernisation of the style and language, including the use of tables - for example in Part O to improve access to the memorandum account rules;
*   the use of defined terms that capture their subject matter more closely, which has led to changes to some recognised terms (see Table 1);
*   the use of acronyms to shorten sentences by minimising long compound phrases as defined terms and to reflect common practice (see Table 2);
*   the improvement in the clarity of the law; and
*   the removal of redundant material moving some provisions to other Parts of the Act.

The remaining acronyms mostly relate to the memorandum accounts (ASCA, CTRA, FDPA and MACA), where use of an acronym is logical and its use limited in practice. In the case of CTR, ESCT and FDP there is a new or changed acronym.

### Terminating provisions

Terminating provisions are placed in a separate "Z" subpart at the end of each Part. This continues the practice used in the 2004 Act, but the contents of each subpart have been reviewed and spent provisions or provisions having little future relevance have been omitted. The omission of any of these provisions does not remove their application to relevant past situations. Provisions in the 2004 Act that are omitted from the 2007 Act can be identified by referring to Schedule 52, part A.

Introduction
============

KiwiSaver Act 2006 – introduction to the Act.

**To view the full [KiwiSaver Act 2006](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2006/0040/latest/DLM378372.html?search=ts_act_KiwiSaver+Act+2006_resel&sr=1 "This link will open in a new window.")
 (at www.legislation.govt.nz).**

The KiwiSaver Act 2006 establishes KiwiSaver, a government-sponsored, work-based savings scheme. The purpose of KiwiSaver is to encourage a long-term savings habit and asset accumulation by individuals who are not in a position to enjoy standards of living in retirement similar to those in pre-retirement. KiwiSaver is aimed at increasing individuals' wellbeing and financial independence, particularly in retirement, and to provide retirement benefits.

### Background

KiwiSaver is part of a package of government initiatives designed to increase the level of savings by New Zealand households and support New Zealanders in retirement. Other initiatives include the introduction of the State Sector Retirement Savings Scheme and the establishment of the New Zealand Superannuation Fund. The latter is aimed at pre-funding the cost to the government of New Zealand Superannuation. KiwiSaver was announced in Budget 2005 and builds on the recommendations of the Savings Product Working Group.

### Key features

KiwiSaver will be implemented from 1 July 2007. It has implications for five broad groups:

*   savers;
*   employers;
*   scheme providers;
*   existing registered superannuation schemes; and
*   government.

#### Savers

Participation in KiwiSaver will not be compulsory and will be open for individuals to join provided they are entitled to be in New Zealand indefinitely, up until the age of eligibility for New Zealand superannuation (currently 65). To overcome inertia, which prevents some people from saving, the Act requires employees starting new employment to be automatically enrolled in KiwiSaver with the right to opt out.

Employees automatically enrolled will have KiwiSaver contributions deducted from their salary or wages from their first pay. Employees can opt out of KiwiSaver by notifying Inland Revenue or their employer from the end of week two to the end of week eight after starting employment. Existing employees can opt into KiwiSaver through their employer or by contracting directly with a provider.

People who are not employees, such as the self-employed and unemployment benefit recipients, can opt into KiwiSaver by contracting directly with a provider and can make contributions based on the contract with the scheme provider.

Employees who are under 18 will not be subject to automatic enrolment but can opt in by contracting directly with a provider.

The Act gives KiwiSaver members the ability to:

*   choose their own KiwiSaver scheme and investment risk-profile (for example, conservative, balanced or growth), but employees will be allocated to a default scheme with a default investment product if no choice is made;
*   transfer between KiwiSaver schemes at any time;
*   contribute at either 4% or 8% of the gross salary or wages paid by the employer (the 4% rate will be the default rate unless the higher rate has been elected by the employee);
*   make voluntary contributions (in addition to contributions deducted from their salary or wages) directly to the provider or via Inland Revenue;
*   cease contributions by applying to Inland Revenue for a contributions holiday after an initial membership period of 12 months. The contributions holiday will be for a period of between three months and five years and can be renewed at the end of the period.

Contributions will be locked in until the age of eligibility for New Zealand Superannuation or five years after the first contribution, whichever is later, with the following exceptions:

*   withdrawal to assist with the purchase of a first home after at least three years membership;
*   significant financial hardship;
*   serious illness; or
*   permanent emigration.

An upfront government contribution of $1,000 will be credited to a member's KiwiSaver account when contributions are first paid by Inland Revenue to the provider. This upfront contribution cannot be withdrawn to purchase a first home, or in cases of significant financial hardship or serious illness. The $1,000 contribution can be withdrawn if the member permanently emigrates and will be paid to the member's estate upon death.

There is no Crown guarantee of KiwiSaver schemes or products.

#### Employers

The Act requires employers to:

*   advise Inland Revenue of the name, tax file number and address of new employees subject to automatic enrolment;
*   provide all new employees subject to automatic enrolment with an information pack, supplied by Inland Revenue. This pack will contain information about KiwiSaver, an opt-out form and information about default providers and schemes;
*   make deductions of KiwiSaver contributions from the gross salary or wages paid to employees who are automatically enrolled and pay this amount along with PAYE, student loan deductions or other tax obligations to Inland Revenue.

The Act allows employers to:

*   have a chosen KiwiSaver scheme for their employees who do not select their own scheme;
*   apply to the Financial Markets Authority for an exemption from the automatic enrolment rules if they provide access to an approved registered superannuation scheme. Employees whose employer is exempt from the automatic enrolment provisions will still be able to join KiwiSaver (by opting in).

The Act ensures that if an employer is merely acting as a conduit or passing on information about KiwiSaver to its employees the employer will not be liable as an investment adviser or promoter under the investment advisers and securities legislation.

#### Scheme providers

The Act establishes that KiwiSaver schemes will be governed by trust deeds and regulated similarly to registered superannuation schemes. All KiwiSaver schemes must be registered by the Financial Markets Authority. The Act provides for default schemes to be appointed for those who do not select their own scheme. Other providers will be able to offer schemes if they meet a minimum set of criteria, including having fees that are not unreasonable.

Registered providers will receive contributions direct from KiwiSaver members and via Inland Revenue and will invest those contributions on behalf of members.

#### Existing registered superannuation schemes

The Act provides three broad options for existing registered superannuation schemes that meet certain criteria:

*   converting to a KiwiSaver scheme. Members of the registered superannuation scheme will become KiwiSaver members (with the consent of all members);
*   establishing a KiwiSaver scheme within an existing registered superannuation scheme, under the existing trust deed. Members of the registered superannuation scheme can decide to become a KiwiSaver member at individual level; or
*   continue to operate independently of KiwiSaver.

#### Government

The Act establishes Inland Revenue as the central administrator of KiwiSaver. This role includes:

*   providing information about KiwiSaver to employers for distribution to employees;
*   allocating new employees to a default scheme and sending the employee an investment statement for that scheme;
*   receiving contributions from employers and others and on-paying these to providers (with interest); and
*   administering contributions "holidays" and opt-out requests.

The Act requires the Financial Markets Authority to:

*   register KiwiSaver schemes, including registered superannuation schemes that convert;
*   set up and maintain a register of KiwiSaver schemes;
*   approve employer exemptions from the automatic enrolment provisions; and
*   undertake the ongoing regulation of providers.

Fast tracking small simple disputes
-----------------------------------

This standard practice statement outlines the Commissioner's criteria for settling small simple disputes and the procedures within Inland Revenue to fast-track them to resolution.

### Background

On 1 October 1996 legislation introduced the disputes resolution process.  Inland Revenue established a project team to document procedures and policies for resolving disputes in a ‘typical' scenario.  We deferred developing the fast-track procedures for small simple disputes until the impacts of the new regime could be considered.

This statement outlines options for fast tracking small disputes against a background principle of cost effective timely resolution.  It covers:

*   the criteria for small or simple disputes;
*   the fast track process for small simple disputes; and
*   the ‘review' process for small simple disputes.

### Small simple disputes

If a case meets the following criteria Inland Revenue will treat it as a small simple dispute:

*   the facts are clear and not in dispute
*   the total tax in dispute is less than $15,000
*   there are no significant legal issues of precedent involved
*   the issue is non-recurrent for the particular taxpayer.

A case will not be fast tracked if the Commissioner considers these criteria are not met.  If the criteria are met but the taxpayer does not want the case to be fast tracked, the standard disputes process will be used.

### Fast tracking procedures

The following fast track procedures will be used for small simple disputes:

![INV 140](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/f/a/faad69804ba376df8c57bd9ef8e4b077/sps-inv-140-1-dec03.gif?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214308&hash=6AFC715F1C464AC725993AE23391F4D5)

### Significant legal issues of precedent

A case will be considered to involve significant legal issues of precedent if it affects two or more taxpayers - e.g., a number of partners in a partnership or a number of employees of an employer.

In some circumstances there may be no connection between taxpayers but there is a common issue.  For example, _CIR v Coveney and Anor_ (1995) 17 NZTC 12,193; _Wattie and Anor v CIR_ (1997) 18 NZTC 13,297.  The outcomes of these two cases are likely to be persuasive or determinative of other cases where different taxpayers entered similar arrangements.

The decision as to whether a case involves significant legal issues of precedent will remain with Inland Revenue.

### Disclosure Phase – agreed statement of facts

The fast track procedures dispense with the formal disclosure phase.  The purpose of the disclosure phase is to ensure that all parties have fully disclosed all the material they intend to rely on to support their position.

If the facts are clear and the issues non-precedential there should be no evidence or issues outstanding and little need for the protection of the evidence exclusion rule.  Formal disclosure is therefore generally not warranted for small simple disputes.  To ensure that all the facts have been disclosed and that they are clear and undisputed, an agreed statement of facts should be reached.

If the facts do not differ from those set out in the Notice of Proposed Adjustment or Notice of Response the agreed statement of facts may simply be a signed statement referring to those facts.  If the facts have been updated since the issue of the Notice of Proposed Adjustment or the Notice of Response a separate document outlining the facts and evidence should be agreed.

At the end of this statement is a recommended statement for use where facts are agreed.

The Agreed Statement of Facts will precede the review, so Inland Revenue's reviewer can be satisfied that there are no further material facts that either party seeks to rely on.

### Review

All fast tracked disputes will be subject to a final review before the Notice of Assessment or Notice of Disputable Decision is issued.  The person reviewing the file will be a member of Inland Revenue's Technical Legal Support Group in the local Service Centre who has not previously had any involvement in the dispute.

The purpose of the review is to ensure that:

*   the facts are clear and not in dispute
*   the tax in dispute is less than $15,000
*   there are no significant legal issues of precedent involved
*   the issue is non-recurrent for the particular taxpayer
*   the parties have agreed there are no outstanding facts
*   the evidence disclosed and the law support the proposed adjustment.

### Taxation Review Authority claims jurisdiction

Only a taxpayer can elect to use the Taxation Review Authority (TRA) small claims jurisdiction.  If an issue is fast tracked within Inland Revenue there is no obligation on the taxpayer to use the small claims jurisdiction of the TRA.  However, if the taxpayer elects the TRA small claims jurisdiction in their NOPA or Notice of Response that election is irrevocable and binding on the taxpayer.  If a taxpayer indicates that they do not want to use the small claims jurisdiction the Commissioner will take this into account in deciding whether to agree to use a fast track option.

If the case is fast tracked within Inland Revenue and taxpayer does file their case in the TRA's small claims jurisdiction the Commissioner retains the right to apply to the TRA to move the case to a different hearing authority - section 138O of the Tax Administration Act 1994.  This is likely to occur only if the taxpayer introduces new facts, evidence or legal argument that was not disclosed during the fast track process.

### Shortfall penalties

It is probable that shortfall penalty adjustments will not meet the small simple dispute criteria in the short term.  Except for evasion cases shortfall penalties are new and there is no case law on where the boundaries fall.  Using the standard process when shortfall penalties are at issue will ensure consistency in applying the penalties, and if agreement cannot be reached Inland Revenue's Adjudication Unit will provide the independent review.

An example of a case involving shortfall penalties that could be fast tracked is failure to account for PAYE.

### Recommended statement for use when facts are agreed

The following statements should be used when facts have been agreed.

"I, \[taxpayer\] agree that the facts outlined in \[the NOPA, NOR, or other document\*\] are complete and form the basis of my position taken in this dispute.

"I, \[team leader/senior investigator\], on behalf of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, agree that the facts outlined in \[the NOPA, NOR or other document\*\] are complete and form the basis of Inland Revenue's position taken in this dispute."

\* The document referred to in both statements must be the same.

Content Standards for Notice of Proposed Adjustment and Notice of response (Jul 99) (WITHDRAWN)
===============================================================================================

Withdrawn statement SPS INV-150 Content Standards for Notice of Proposed Adjustment and Notice of response. Statement provided for historical purposes only.

Introduction
------------

This Standard Practice Statement sets out the Commissioner's practice applied to the content standards for Notices of Proposed Adjustment and Notices of Response

Application
-----------

This Standard Practice Statement applies from 1 August 1999.

Background
----------

The Disputes Resolution rules introduced an open, "all cards on the table" approach to tax disputes, with the aim of resolving tax disputes fairly, quickly and efficiently.  The process requires the exchange of certain information between the Commissioner and a taxpayer, and begins when one party issues a Notice of Proposed Adjustment ("NOPA") to the other. If the recipient of the NOPA disagrees with the proposed adjustment, that party must reject any or all of the proposed adjustments within a two month response period by issuing a Notice of Response ("NOR").  If a NOR is not issued within that timeframe and there are no exceptional circumstances as defined in the Tax Administration Act 1994 the NOPA recipient is deemed to have accepted the proposed adjustments in the NOPA.

There has been some confusion about what information must be in the NOPA and NOR.  This has lead to claims that a NOPA or NOR was invalid because of alleged information shortcomings, and on occasion resulted in the deemed acceptance of proposed adjustments because the response period expired before alleged deficiencies could be made good.  This is a critical outcome for a taxpayer; deemed acceptance finalises the dispute and the taxpayer no longer has the right to challenge the Commissioner before the Courts.

The Commissioner does not consider deemed acceptance in these circumstances appropriate or in keeping with the stated aims of the disputes resolution rules.  To remove some of the misconceptions and help taxpayers who wish to dispute assessments or proposed adjustments, this standard practice statement sets out the relevant tax laws, the Commissioner's practice on applying those laws, and associated practical issues.

Legislation
-----------

All legislative references are to the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("the Act").

Section 89F gives a list of content headings for a NOPA, and section 89G(2) gives a similar list for a NOR.  Both sections incorporate a standard which governs the content headings and acts as a guide to the amount and quality of the information required.  These are guidelines, so they are flexible and permit NOPA and NOR to have a wide variance in content, style and detail, with the result that the amount and quality of information they contain can vary considerably and still comply with the law.

When information provided under the content headings is full and complete (i.e.of a high quality) problems and misunderstandings are unlikely to arise.  They are more likely to occur when information content is minimal or of a lesser quality.

From 1 April 1999, the tax laws which govern the content of a NOPA and a NOR are as follows:

**_NOPA_**

**89F** A notice of proposed adjustment must be in the prescribed form and contain, with sufficient detail to reasonably inform the recipient, -

(a) The items in a disputable decision or a tax return that the issuer of the notice proposes should be adjusted; and

(b) The tax laws on which the adjustments are based; and

(c) An outline of the facts giving rise to the adjustments; and

(d) The legal issues arising in respect of the adjustments; and

(e) The propositions of law relied on or distinguished in respect of the adjustments.

**_NOR_**

**_89G(2)_** A response notice must, with sufficient detail to reasonably inform the recipient,-

(a) Specify the items in the notice of proposed adjustment that the issuer of the response notice considers to be in error; and

(b) Specify the tax laws on which the issuer of the response notice relies; and

(c) Outline the facts contained in the notice of proposed adjustment that the issuer of the response notice considers to be in error; and

(d) Outline any further facts on which the issuer of the response notice relies; and

(e) Outline any additional legal issues that the issuer of the response notice considers arise in respect of the notice of proposed adjustment; and

(f) State the propositions of law relied upon in respect of the response notice.

Commissioner's Approach
-----------------------

The standard for NOPA content is defined by the wording "must ... contain, with sufficient detail to reasonably inform the recipient" which precedes and governs the required content list.  The same standard, only this time without the word "contain", precedes and governs the required content list for the NOR.

Essentially, each standard requires a NOPA or NOR issuer to provide enough factual and relevant details for the recipient of the notice to understand why a tax adjustment or determination is proposed or rejected.  Case law when applied to the words "sufficient detail to reasonably inform" indicates that the circumstances and background to a dispute must be taken into account.  These include any information already available or known to the recipient of a NOPA or NOR.

Previously it was suggested that NOPA and NOR content should have enough detail to inform a reader who lacked prior knowledge of the disputed issue.  This viewpoint overlooked an important factor in the disputes resolution process, i.e. that the Commissioner and a specific taxpayer (whether or not through a tax agent or legal advisor) are always the issuer and recipient of a NOPA and a NOR.  (Which party is the issuer and which is the recipient depends on who began the process.) In most instances, before this there will have been some form of interaction between the two; e.g. the taxpayer will have issued a NOPA following receipt of the Commissioner's assessment of a return filed by the taxpayer, or a determination such as tax residency status.  If the Commissioner has issued the NOPA, this is likely to have followed a GST audit, income tax or other investigation involving the taxpayer.

However the dispute started any earlier interaction between Commissioner and taxpayer would be evidence that both parties had entered the disputes resolution process with an awareness of the issues in dispute.  These and other circumstances, including whether the taxpayer is represented by a tax agent or legal advisor, should be considered when the standards of sections 89F and 89G(2) are applied to the content of NOPA and NOR.

The Commissioner believes he has a statutory obligation to inform taxpayers fully which goes beyond that required by sections 89F and 89G(2).  In keeping with that wider obligation, Inland Revenue will always attempt to issue NOPA and NOR which are complete, fully detailed and of a high standard.  A frank and complete exchange of information by both parties is implicit in the spirit and intent of the disputes resolution process.  Inland Revenue therefore expects that taxpayers, their tax agents and legal advisors, will to the best of their ability also issue complete and fully detailed NOPA and NOR.

The disputes resolution process was neither intended nor designed to be unduly difficult or costly for taxpayers who want to dispute a tax matter.  However, the reality is that some taxpayers may struggle with the requirements, particularly if they do not have professional assistance.  While Inland Revenue encourages taxpayers to issue NOPA and NOR with a high standard of information content, it would be unrealistic to expect this in every instance.

The issuer of a NOPA or a NOR is not bound by or restricted to the content of that notice.  However, it must contain sufficient relevant information to satisfy the legislative requirement that it "reasonably inform" the intended recipient.  Although Inland Revenue prefers and encourages a high standard of NOPA and NOR content, mere brevity and lack of precision do not nullify a notice which directs the attention of the recipient to the necessary information.  The following examples show how this can be achieved:

Content standard for taxpayer-generated NOPA
--------------------------------------------

From 1 April 1999 section 89F requires taxpayers (including tax agents and legal advisors) to use an IR 210 Cover Sheet when issuing a NOPA.  Inland Revenue recommends using the full IR 210 to complete the NOPA, as this form covers each of the content headings listed in section 89F.  Using the full form is optional; taxpayers may instead complete the NOPA by way of a letter or typewritten sheets attached to the IR 210 cover sheet.

Whichever option is used the NOPA should include all available relevant information In keeping with the aim and spirit of the disputes resolution process, this should be as complete and detailed as is possible.  Following the format of the IR 210 form by listing each content heading and responding to each in turn will ensure that nothing is omitted.

Some examples of how to inform the Commissioner and satisfy the requirements of tax law follow.  Note that the examples are not exclusive and that other possibilities exist:

**_(a) The items in a disputable decision or a tax return that the issuer of the notice proposes should be adjusted_**

Inland Revenue needs to know the type and amount of each proposed adjustment as well as the tax return period involved.  Reference should be as specific as possible e.g. "Increase 1998 travel expenditure by $1,500 to $4,365"; "1999 Repairs and Maintenance understated by $3,615"; or "Outputs overstated by $5,000 June/July 1998".  Directing Inland Revenue to an earlier letter which clearly sets out information about the type and amount of proposed adjustment is also acceptable, e.g. "Determination of Loss (date)"; or "See my/your letter (date)".

**_(b) The tax laws on which the adjustments are based_**

Wherever possible, identify the particular tax laws relating to the proposed adjustment.  A taxpayer who does not have access to a copy of the tax laws through a tax agent, legal advisor, Citizens Advice Bureau, or local library etc. can ask Inland Revenue for help.  Should our help be sought, then subject to the information supplied by the taxpayer, Inland Revenue may suggest certain tax laws could apply and will provide a photocopy of these.  Any decision about application and use of a particular tax law in the context of their NOPA or NOR remains with the taxpayer.

However, a general reference such as "The Income Tax Act" or "The Goods and Services Tax Act" is also acceptable if it is clear from the type of proposed adjustment and overall content of the NOPA that certain tax laws will be involved, e.g. a dispute involving depreciation in year of sale (1998) must involve section EG 1(2) of the Income Tax Act 1994.  In some instances, reference to the content of a disputed income tax or GST return may also direct the Commissioner's attention to the relevant tax laws.

**_(c) An outline of the facts giving rise to the adjustments_**

In practice most taxpayers tend to provide more rather than less information under this heading.  Inland Revenue encourages and prefers this approach, as it helps us to understand the taxpayer's point of view and ensures that we have the correct facts.  The law requires an "outline" i.e. a description omitting details.  This can be in the form of a brief statement e.g. "The four wheel drive was purchased for use only in my plumbing business" or "I am able to claim 100% depreciation and expenses because the mower was bought for the factory lawns".  When the adjustment item has been discussed in previous correspondence, reference to this by date(s) or a statement such as "For the reasons previously given, the Commissioner was wrong in fact and in law to treat profit from the sale of 24 Red Dwarf Drive, Galaxy, as 1998 taxable income" is also acceptable.

**_(d) The legal issues arising in respect of the adjustments_**

These are the questions to be decided and answered about the matters in dispute.  There may only be one legal issue in a dispute or there may be several.  The questions can take any form, and be simply put, e.g. "Am I able to claim 100% of expenses and depreciation for the four wheel drive?" Also acceptable is a statement such as "Tax law allows me to claim 100% of four wheel drive expenses and depreciation".

Often, the information provided under headings (a), (b) and (c) will indicate what the legal issues are.

**_(e) The propositions of law relied on or distinguished in respect of the adjustments_**

Under this heading, statements are made about how the law supports the proposed adjustments in the particular situation.  The statements have more value when made not merely as a statement of opinion, but supported by reasoning and authority such as tax laws or case law i.e. Court decisions about how the law should be applied.  Although other authorities can be used to illustrate support or acceptance for the taxpayer's view, e.g. IRD rulings, TIB articles, etc. they carry less weight.  "Distinguished" means showing why a particular tax law or Court decision which would usually apply, does not in these particular circumstances.  Within the disputes resolution process a proposition of law includes any or all of the following:

*   reference to tax laws, e.g. "Section DH 1(2) of the Income Tax Act 1994 allows 100% expenditure and depreciation deduction for business vehicles", "Section BD 2(1)(b)(ii) of the Income Tax Act 1994 applies", or "See tax laws"  
    
*   case law (Court decisions) e.g. " _Case N8_ (1991) 13 NZTC 3,052"  
    
*   publications, e.g. "TIB Volume Nine, No.8 at page 12"  
    
*   IRD rulings, public or policy statements, etc.  
    
*   a simple statement e.g. "The four wheel drive is a business vehicle, and its repairs and maintenance costs are deductible"

Inland Revenue encourages taxpayers to identify and include relevant propositions of law in their NOPA, although we realise that this may not always be possible.  If no specific propositions of law are included, we will treat the tax laws referred to in the NOPA as being the propositions of law on which the taxpayer has relied.

Content standard for taxpayer-generated NOR
-------------------------------------------

Preparing a NOR involves more precise attention to information detail than preparing a NOPA.  Inland Revenue recommends using an IR 210A when preparing a NOR, to ensure that each content heading listed in section 89G(2) is considered.  Use of this form is optional; taxpayers may complete a NOR by way of a letter or typewritten sheets.  Whichever option is used, all available relevant information should be included in the NOR.  In keeping with the aim and spirit of the disputes resolution process, this should be as complete and detailed as is possible.  Following the format of the IR 210A by listing each content heading and responding to each in turn will ensure that nothing is omitted.

Some examples of how to provide sufficient information to inform the Commissioner and comply with tax law follow.  Note that the examples are not exclusive and other possibilities exist:

**_(a) Specify the items in the notice of proposed adjustment that the issuer of the response notice considers to be in error_**

Although it can be helpful to do so, a NOR issuer is not required to say why an item is in error (disputed) under this heading.  The information supplied elsewhere in the NOR should explain why the item is disputed.

The word "specify" in the heading means each disputed item must be identified.  There are several ways of doing this.  If the taxpayer disagrees with all the proposed adjustments in the NOPA, a statement such as "The proposed adjustments are wrong" will make this clear.  If one or more of a number of proposed adjustments are disagreed with, each must be identified, e.g. "Items a, c, e, and f are wrong", or "Proposed adjustment amounts of $6,259.00, $3,400.00 and $1,321.00 are incorrect".

When the disagreed adjustments include several which can be combined together under a recognisable description, (e.g. adjustments which obviously all relate to vehicle repairs and maintenance) a statement such as "Repairs and maintenance items totalling $5,690.00" with separate identification of the other disputed adjustments is acceptable.

**_(b) Specify the tax laws on which the issuer of the response notice relies_**

The word "specify" again requires the NOR issuer to identify the tax laws relied on.  Frequently these will be the same tax laws as the Commissioner has relied on in his NOPA, although the two parties disagree about how they should apply in the particular circumstances.  When this occurs, a reference to the NOPA with a comment such as "See NOPA" or "As stated by the Commissioner" is sufficient.

A NOR issuer may consider tax laws other than those quoted in the Commissioner's NOPA apply.  In this situation the Commissioner must be given at least the relevant Parts of the Act, section references, or enough information under this heading or elsewhere in the NOR for him to be able to identify the tax laws the issuer has relied on.

**_(c) Outline the facts contained in the notice of proposed adjustment that the issuer of the response notice considers to be in error_**

The NOR issuer is not required to say under this heading why any fact may be in error (although this would be helpful) merely to identify those which are.  The information supplied under the next heading (d) should explain why a NOPA fact is disputed.

Only an outline is needed; directing the Commissioner's attention to the relevant paragraph, page number, or any other recognisable feature is one way to indicate which facts are in error.  If none of the facts in the NOPA are in error, writing "Facts agreed" makes this clear, and is preferable to leaving that section of the IR 210A NOR blank.

**_(d) Outline any further facts on which the issuer of the response notice relies_**

The NOR issuer should show here any facts to be considered which were not included in the NOPA.  The Commissioner needs to know why any NOPA fact is disputed.  He also needs to be told about facts he has overlooked or did not know when the NOPA was prepared, as additional information or new information may be all that is needed to resolve the dispute.  As in the NOPA examples, this can take several forms, including a brief statement; e.g. "The four wheel drive was used only in my plumbing business.  I have two other cars available for private use".  Reference to correspondence in which the additional facts were discussed, or interviews and meetings where proceedings were tape-recorded and/or a subsequent transcript agreed, would also be adequate.  (Dates should be given in each instance.)

If facts were correctly stated in the NOPA and there are no additional facts to be taken into account, no entry is needed under this heading.  However writing "none" or "not applicable" clarifies this to the Commissioner.

**_(e) Outline any additional legal issues that the issuer of the response notice considers arise in respect of the notice of proposed adjustment_**

As with a NOPA, these are the questions that need to be answered about the matters in dispute.  A NOR issuer may consider there are legal issues over and above those in the NOPA as a result of additional facts not considered by the Commissioner, or the application of tax laws on which the Commissioner has not relied.

Because only an outline is required, the information provided about additional facts and tax laws can make the Commissioner aware of further legal issues.  If a question is asked or a statement made in everyday language e.g. "Am I allowed a deduction under section BD 2(1)(b) for factory floor repairs? or "Can I claim the cost of driveway repairs as home office expenses?" it will alert the Commissioner to any additional legal issues.

**_(f) State the propositions of law relied upon in respect of the response notice_**

As with a NOPA, a simple statement or reference to tax laws, Court decisions, publications or IRD rulings and statements that the taxpayer considers support rejection of the proposed adjustments is required.  If the taxpayer relies on the Commissioner's propositions of law, statements such as "See NOPA" or "Refer Commissioner's propositions of law" clarify this.

If this section of the IR 210A is left blank, any reference in the NOR to tax laws will be treated as a reference to the propositions of law on which the taxpayer is relying.

General
-------

The examples give some guidance on the nature and quantity of information to include in a NOPA or NOR for it to comply with the standards required by the law.  They are not exclusive; other possibilities exist and at all times regard must be had for the circumstances surrounding the dispute.  Inland Revenue recommends that where possible, taxpayers seek professional guidance with the preparation of these notices.

As demonstrated by the examples Inland Revenue intends to apply as broad an interpretation to the content of taxpayer-generated NOPA and NOR as the standards permit.  Where necessary, we will ask taxpayers to clarify or expand aspects of their notice by providing additional information.  Inland Revenue considers that this approach has a basis in case law and is consistent with the aims of the disputes resolution rules.

Similarly, when the response period remaining permits we will ask taxpayers to provide any information needed to bring their document to the relevant minimum content standard.  In this situation, the information must be written and issued to Inland Revenue prior to the end of the notice response period, otherwise the taxpayer will not have issued a NOPA or a NOR.  To avoid the possibility of taxpayers finding they have run out of time before essential information can be provided, we recommend the issue of NOPA and NOR earlier rather than later in the response period.

Only in the exceptional circumstances defined in section 89K(3) can the Commissioner accept a late notice as having been given within the response period.

Note that the requirements for the third document of the disputes resolution process – the statement of position (SOP) described in section 89M – are much more formal and restrictive than those of section 89F for the NOPA and section 89G(2) for the NOR.  Where Inland Revenue has issued a Disclosure Notice, and the outcome of the process is unfavourable to the taxpayer who challenges the Commissioner's position before the Courts, both taxpayer and Commissioner will be limited by section 138G(1) to the contents of their respective SOP.  Only in very unusual circumstances will the Courts allow the introduction of additional evidence, issues, or propositions of law not previously contained in the SOP.

When Commissioner and taxpayer have exchanged and rejected NOPA and NOR, and it seems likely the dispute will proceed to adjudication (the final stage of the disputes resolution process) Inland Revenue strongly urges taxpayers to seek professional assistance before attempting to prepare an SOP.

Timeliness in resolving tax disputes (Feb 02) (WITHDRAWN)
=========================================================

Withdrawn INV-170-Timeliness in resolving tax disputes (Feb 02). Statement provided for historical purposes only.

Withdrawn
---------

This statement has been withdrawn and is provided for historical purposes only.

Introduction
------------

This Standard Practice Statement (SPS) establishes administrative practices and time lines that will assist in the timely progression of cases in dispute.

Application
-----------

This SPS shall apply from 1 March 2002 to all cases in dispute.

Summary
-------

The disputes resolution process aims to promote the prompt and efficient resolution of tax disputes.  Taxpayers have a right to have their dispute go through the whole disputes resolution process.  When it becomes evident that a case is likely to proceed to dispute a time line should be negotiated between the taxpayer and the Inland Revenue officer involved to ensure timely and efficient progression of the case.

While both Inland Revenue staff and taxpayers should endeavour to meet the agreed time lines, if it becomes apparent the negotiated time line cannot be achieved this will be discussed with the taxpayer with a view to agreeing a new time line.

Negotiating time lines for the timely resolution of disputes is an administrative practice encouraged by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue; failure to negotiate an agreed time line or adhere to the agreed time line will not prevent a case from progressing through the disputes resolution process.

Background
----------

In 1996, the disputes resolution process was introduced to ensure the effective and efficient resolution of tax disputes.  The process requires the issues and evidence to be considered by the Commissioner and the disputant before proceedings commence in a court.

Fundamental to the effective progression of a case in dispute is a commitment by the parties involved to work through the process in a constructive manner and to a reasonable time line.  This SPS sets out the steps the Commissioner will follow when a case enters the disputes resolution process.  This includes both statutory requirements and administrative practices.

While the emphasis of the disputes resolution process is to obtain agreement, the SPS covers all the stages of the disputes resolution process which could be involved in any one dispute in order to establish the time lines and procedures that Inland Revenue staff will follow.

Discussion
----------

**Time lines for completing the disputes resolution process**

Each case in dispute will have a different set of circumstances and features, nevertheless there is practical value in establishing time lines for completing the steps in the disputes resolution process.  The suggested time line outlined below should form the basis of discussing and agreeing time lines for a specific case in dispute.

As a yardstick a simple case in dispute can take up to 16 months from the time a Notice of Proposed Adjustment (NOPA) is issued until the assessment is issued.  The following diagram is indicative of the time line for a simple dispute initiated by the Commissioner:

**Factors that may influence the agreed time lines**

While it is expected that the agreed time lines established between the taxpayer and the Inland Revenue officer will closely follow the time lines suggested above, there may be aspects of the particular disputed case which could have a bearing on the timely progression of that case.  These aspects are commented on below:

*   _**Information on which to form opinions and make fact based decisions**_

> Critical to the timely and satisfactory progression of a case in dispute is the Commissioner's need to have all the information and facts necessary on which to form opinions and make fact based decisions.  Any delay in providing information will inevitably impact on the timely progression of the case.
> 
> Where circumstances warrant, the Commissioner will take assertive action to seek information required.  The actions will include use of the information requisition powers in the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA).
> 
> The prime objective remains to effectively resolve the dispute by way of agreement or move to formal proceedings in a timely manner.

*   _**The conference phase**_

> The conference phase is an administrative practice designed to identify and clarify facts or issues, and to attempt to resolve those facts or issues in dispute.  The time suggested for the conference phase is an average of 3 months.  The time will vary according to the facts of the specific case.
> 
> The conference is an important part of the overall disputes resolution process.  The Commissioner's intention is to encourage open and full communication.  Conferences provide Inland Revenue and taxpayers with an opportunity to precisely identify the facts and issues causing the dispute.  Effective dialogue between Inland Revenue and the taxpayer increases the prospect of a productive outcome.  For example, dialogue may identify common ground, inconsistencies, erroneous arguments, or alternative agreements.
> 
> The parties to the dispute should carefully assess the significance of conducting a conference.  In brief, taxpayers and Inland Revenue staff should perceive the conference phase as an effective option to progressing or resolving the dispute.
> 
> The clarity of each party's position in respect to the matters in dispute, the level of cooperation and the nature of the communications to date, would be factors taken into account in determining whether or not to conduct a conference, or determining how long the conference phase should be.
> 
> The decision to either conduct or waive a conference should be by mutual agreement.  The time lines involved in completing the next step in the agreed process would be expected to be an important outcome from the overall discussions.

*   _**Time bar waivers**_

> Time lines for investigations and resultant dispute proceedings will take account of the time bar reopening limitations set out in sections 107A, 108, and 108A of the TAA.
> 
> If the original time line established for progressing a dispute has not been met, it is still important to ensure, as far as practicable, that the case follows the full course of the disputes resolution process, and in particular to have the case adjudicated by the Adjudication Unit.
> 
> If a case is likely to be time barred, the taxpayer will be contacted and asked to waive the time bar under section 108B of the TAA.  Exercise of the time bar waiver will allow further opportunities for the disputed case to be resolved before issue of the assessment notice, including by way of an independent review by the Adjudication Unit.
> 
> In the event that the request to waive the time bar is declined by the taxpayer, the Commissioner will consider the options available to progress the case towards finality.

Standard Practice
-----------------

Upon receipt or issue of a NOPA, unless already negotiated, the Inland Revenue officer involved will contact the taxpayer to negotiate a time line for progression and finalisation of the dispute.

Negotiation of the time line will take into account the following statutory and administrative timeframes.

### Where a NOPA is issued by the Commissioner

**Issue of a NOPA**

When the Commissioner issues a NOPA, the taxpayer or agent will be contacted within 10 working days of the date of issue of the NOPA to ensure that the NOPA has been received.

Within 2 weeks of the expiry of the response period for the NOPA, the taxpayer or agent will be contacted with a view to ascertaining if the NOPA is to be responded to.

**Consideration of taxpayer's Notice of Response (NOR)**

Within 1 month of receipt of the taxpayer's NOR, the Inland Revenue officer involved will advise the taxpayer or agent whether the NOR is accepted, rejected in full or in part, or requires further work to be done before a decision can be made.

Where the NOR is accepted in full, all “closure” actions on the case (such as issuing the notice of assessment) should be completed within 1 month of the issue of advice of acceptance of the NOR.

If further work is required to be carried out before a decision to accept or reject a NOR can be made, the Inland Revenue officer will regularly update the taxpayer or taxpayer's agent on the progress of further analysis or enquiry work being undertaken.

**The conference phase**

The time suggested for the conference phase is an average of 3 months commencing 1 month after receipt of the NOR.  This time is intended to cover any analysis required as well as organising and conducting a conference.  The time may well vary according to the specific facts of the case.  If by the end of this phase the dispute has not been resolved, or if by mutual agreement no conference is held, a Disclosure Notice will be issued, together with the Commissioner's Statement of Position (SOP).

**Taxpayer's response**

The taxpayer must file their SOP within the statutory response period for the Disclosure Notice, that is 2 months.  This time may be extended by application to the High Court.

**Additional information by the Commissioner**

Within 2 weeks of receipt of the taxpayer's SOP, the taxpayer will be advised whether or not the Commissioner proposes to provide additional information by way of Addendum to the SOP.

**Additional information by taxpayer**

Where the Commissioner has agreed to accept additional information from the taxpayer, the time line above suggests 1 month for agreement to be reached and information provided.

**File preparation and adjudication**

Where agreement cannot be reached the disputed case should proceed to adjudication.  Before the case is forwarded to the Adjudication Unit the Inland Revenue officer involved will send to the taxpayer a copy of the Adjudication cover sheet.  The cover sheet includes a list of the evidence being sent to Adjudication with the file.  The taxpayer should respond within 10 working days advising whether they want any other material already disclosed and not listed on the cover sheet to be included in the file.  The file will be sent to Adjudication within 12 working days of the taxpayer being sent the cover sheet.

**Where the NOPA is issued by the taxpayer**

The processes and steps involved in progressing the dispute towards settlement or formal proceedings when a taxpayer has issued a NOPA are generally the same as those outlined above.  Establishing agreed time lines to assist in the timely progression of a case where the taxpayer has initiated the dispute proceedings is as important as where the Commissioner has initiated the disputes resolution process.

When discussing time lines for resolving taxpayer initiated disputes three key differences from a Commissioner initiated dispute will be taken into account:

*   Within 2 weeks of the expiry of the response period for the NOPA, the taxpayer will be contacted and advised whether the Commissioner intends to respond to the NOPA by issuing a NOR.  At this stage the Inland Revenue officer involved will initiate time line negotiations with the taxpayer.  
      
    
*   The Commissioner will initiate the conference stage within 1 month of receipt of the notice of rejection of the Commissioner's NOR.  
      
    
*   An additional 2 months must be added to the time line to recognise the fact that the Commissioner's SOP does not accompany the Disclosure Notice but is issued within 2 months of the date of issue of the taxpayer's SOP.

**Inability to meet negotiated time lines**

While both Inland Revenue staff and taxpayers should endeavour to meet the agreed time lines, if it becomes apparent the negotiated time line cannot be achieved this will be discussed with the taxpayer with a view to agreeing to a new time line.

Negotiating time lines for the timely resolution of disputes is an administrative practice encouraged by the Commissioner; failure to negotiate an agreed time line or adhere to the agreed time line will not prevent a case from progressing through the disputes resolution process.

==============================================================================================================================

Withdrawn INV-200-Not taking reasonable care (Mar 98). Statement provided for historical purposes only.

Withdrawn
---------

This statement has been withdrawn and is provided for historical purposes only.

Introduction
------------

A shortfall penalty is a penalty imposed as a percentage of a tax shortfall, or deficit or understatement of tax, which results from certain actions on the part of a taxpayer.  The law divides these actions into five categories of fault, or breach, with a specified penalty rate for each category as listed below:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Not taking reasonable care | 20% |
| Unacceptable interpretation | 20% |
| Gross carelessness | 40% |
| Abusive tax position | 100% |
| Evasion or similar offence | 150% |

These penalty rates are non-negotiable and where a default occurs the applicable penalty must be imposed.  A taxpayer does however have the right to challenge the decision to impose a shortfall penalty but not the amount of penalty.

This statement deals with defaults that breach the standard of "reasonable care".

Application
-----------

The penalties apply to obligations relating to the 1997/98 and subsequent income tax years and to taxable or dutiable periods commencing on or after 1 April 1997.

Shortfall penalties apply when there is a deficit or understatement of tax, or where a refund or loss is reduced.  Defaults in employers' obligations are also considered under shortfall penalties.

The penalty provision is generic in application.  This means that it applies to all Inland Revenue Acts (but for Child Support and Student Loans, it applies only to employer obligations).

Purpose
-------

The purpose of the not taking reasonable care shortfall penalty is to increase voluntary compliance with the system.  The standard is the cornerstone of the penalties regime which requires all taxpayers to act reasonably in the conduct of their tax affairs.  It is a fluid concept which recognises the distinct characteristics of particular obligations and the different burdens placed on various taxpayers.

The standard recognises taxpayers' varying abilities and reflects a balance between the need for returns to be correct and the recognition of the difficulties that taxpayers may face in ensuring that they are correct.

Legislation
-----------

Section 141A of the Tax Administration Act 1994:

**Not taking reasonable care -**

1.  A taxpayer is liable to pay a shortfall penalty if the taxpayer does not take reasonable care in taking a taxpayer's tax position (referred to as "not taking reasonable care") and the taking of that tax position by that taxpayer results in a tax shortfall.
2.  The penalty payable for not taking reasonable care is 20% of the resulting tax shortfall.
3.  A taxpayer who, in taking a taxpayer's tax position, has used an acceptable interpretation of the tax law is also a taxpayer who has taken reasonable care in taking the taxpayer's tax position.

Test of reasonable care
-----------------------

The test of reasonable care is whether a taxpayer of ordinary skill and prudence would have foreseen as a reasonable probability or likelihood the prospect that an act (or failure to act) would cause a tax shortfall, having regard to all the circumstances.

Whether the taxpayer acted intentionally is not a consideration.  It is not a question of whether the taxpayer actually foresaw the probability that the act or failure to act would cause a tax shortfall, but whether a reasonable person in the circumstances of the taxpayer, would have seen the tax shortfall as a reasonable probability.  It equates with the concept of negligence in the civil law of Torts, and the jurisprudence is well established.  "Negligence is to be measured objectively by ascertaining what in the circumstances would be done or omitted by the reasonable man" (_Meulan's Hair Stylists Ltd v CIR_ \[1963\] NZLR 797).

In the tax context, reasonable care includes exercising reasonable diligence to determine the correctness of a return position.  It also includes the keeping of adequate books and records or to substantiate items properly, and generally making a reasonable attempt to comply with the tax law.

**Appropriate to category of taxpayer**  
The reasonable care test is not intended to be overly onerous and does not mean perfection.  The effort required of the taxpayer is commensurate with the reasonable person in the taxpayer's circumstances.  Ordinarily what is expected is the achievement of a standard appropriate to the category of taxpayer, rather than that of the individual taxpayer involved.

The category of taxpayer will affect what constitutes reasonable care in each particular case.  The standard required of a salary and wage earner will differ from that required of a business taxpayer.  For most salary and wage earners, an earnest effort to follow the Tax Pack instructions will be sufficient to pass the reasonable care test.

Business taxpayers must meet the standard of the "reasonable business taxpayer".  The business taxpayer may be required to do more than the "reasonable wage earner".  For example, the amount of tax involved, and the complexity of the business taxpayer's affairs may require them to seek professional assistance in meeting their tax obligations.

**Objective v subjective**  
Reasonable care is an objective test, however, it brings in subjective elements.  What is meant by subjective is that when considering whether the taxpayer has taken reasonable care, the circumstances of the particular taxpayer need to be considered "objectively" by looking at what a reasonable person would have done in those circumstances.

Factors to consider
-------------------

Circumstances that may be taken into account when determining whether reasonable care has been exercised include:

*   the complexity of the law and the transaction (the difficulty in interpreting complex legislation);
*   the materiality of the shortfall (the gravity of the consequence and the size of the risk);
*   the difficulty and expense of taking the precaution;
*   the taxpayer's age, health and background.

In addition, for a business, reasonable care may also take into account:

*   the size and nature of the business;
*   the internal controls in place;
*   the business record keeping practices;
*   system failures (Year 2000 failure would not generally be considered to be an acceptable reason).

**Interpretations**  
On questions of interpretation, reasonable care will depend on:

*   what efforts the taxpayer had taken to resolve the issue;
*   the types of advice received;
*   the certainty of the law.

Reasonable care requires a taxpayer to come to the same conclusions that a reasonable person would come to in the circumstances of that taxpayer.

The standard of reasonable care in interpreting the law applies to all matters, regardless of the amount of tax.

**Amount of shortfall - materiality**  
Materiality is implicit in the standard of reasonable care.  In considering whether a taxpayer has taken reasonable care, consideration will be given not only to the nature of the shortfall, but also to the size of the shortfall in relation to the taxpayer.

If the amount is large, relative to the total overall tax liability, then, the taxpayer should have been aware that something was amiss.  For example, if a taxpayer with a returned income of $50,000, omitted income of $10,000 (which was clearly "income") from his or her return, it would be fair to say that the taxpayer should have been aware, regardless of the fact that the agent had completed the return, that not all of the income had been returned.

Contrast the above situation, to that of a large corporate taxpayer whose returned income for the year was $50,000,000.  An omission of income of $10,000 would more than likely not have been material enough to put the taxpayer on notice.  Therefore, depending on any other circumstances, this taxpayer may well have taken reasonable care to ensure that the return was correct.

**Tax agents and advisers**  
A taxpayer who has relied on the advice of a tax adviser will usually be considered to have exercised reasonable care.

However they may still be exposed to a penalty for lack of reasonable care should they:

*   fail to provide adequate information when seeking advice;
*   fail to provide reasonable instructions to a tax adviser; or
*   unreasonably rely on a tax adviser or on advice (when they have reason to believe that the advice is not correct).

A taxpayer does not satisfy the obligation to take reasonable care simply by using the services of a tax agent or tax adviser.  It remains the taxpayer's responsibility to properly record matters relating to his or her tax affairs during the year, and to draw all the relevant facts to the attention of the agent or adviser, in order to meet the reasonable care test.

**Previous audits**  
There may be cases where a taxpayer has been previously audited, a particular matter found to be in default but in a subsequent return prepared by an agent, the same matter results in a shortfall.  Depending on the exact circumstances, even though the agent prepared the return, the fact that the taxpayer had been alerted by the previous audit may indicate a lack of reasonable care on the part of the taxpayer on the second omission for not ensuring that the return was correct in that particular regard.

**Complexity of the law**  
Reliance on an agent must be weighed against the complexity of the law relating to the matters at issue.  If a taxpayer seeks advice on a matter on which the tax law is extremely complex, they are more likely to rely on that advice without question.  A taxpayer would be required to support the argument that they accepted the agent's advice as correct.  The matter to be considered is whether a reasonable person in the taxpayer's circumstances would have been put on notice of agent error.

**Agent fault**  
Agents have a responsibility to obtain relevant information about their clients.  Matters to be considered would include:

*   Whether or not a questionnaire was completed.
*   Was the information compiled accurately?
*   Was the questionnaire discussed with the client?

The taxpayer has a responsibility to advise the agent of matters affecting his or her income.  For example, advising the agent of all of their investments, bank accounts, second jobs, perk jobs, cash taken for drawings, etc.

Taxpayers have a responsibility to fully and comprehensively advise their tax agents of their tax affairs.

**Language difficulties**  
There is a responsibility on both the agent and the taxpayer to ensure as far as is practicable, both parties have all the relevant information to ensure that the tax return is compiled as accurately as possible.  This means ensuring that any potential language problems are addressed where it is practical to do so.

Inland Revenue advice
---------------------

**Publications**  
It is unlikely that taxpayers will be considered to have breached the reasonable care standard if Inland Revenue has failed to provide adequate information in its guides on which the taxpayer has relied.

Where there is no apparent reason for a taxpayer to question information provided, the taxpayer will generally have taken reasonable care.

**Advice provided to individual taxpayers**  
Where a tax shortfall arises and the taxpayer states that they were relying on advice from Inland Revenue the following general rule will apply:

Where the taxpayer has sought Inland Revenue advice and this can be verified then a penalty for not taking reasonable care will generally not be imposed.  Verification may take the form of a letter from Inland Revenue or the taxpayer being able to provide details of when and from whom the advice was sought.

This rule is however subject to the full circumstances and facts of the case.

**Arithmetical error**  
Arithmetical errors may indicate a failure to take reasonable care but are not conclusive.  The decision will depend on the procedures in place to detect such errors, the size, nature and frequency of the error, or the circumstances in which the taxpayer made the error.

**Defence to lack of reasonable care**  
In large adjustment cases when the matter turns on a matter of interpretation, the acceptable interpretation standard must be satisfied.  A taxpayer who can demonstrate that the position taken is an acceptable interpretation is deemed to have satisfied the reasonable care standard.

**Burden and standard of proof**  
A taxpayer has the right to challenge the decision to impose a shortfall penalty through the disputes process.  If the issue can not be resolved through the disputes process the taxpayer has the normal rights of review through the courts.

The burden of proof in civil proceedings relating to the imposition of penalties rests with the taxpayer.  They must show that on the "balance of probabilities" they have taken reasonable care.  Accordingly, if the taxpayer can show that it is probable that they took reasonable care, they will have satisfied the standard.

Standard rate of penalty
------------------------

The standard rate of penalty payable for not taking reasonable care is 20% of the resulting tax shortfall.

This rate may be adjusted by varying rates in the following circumstances:

*   voluntary disclosure before or during an audit
*   voluntary disclosure at the time of return filing
*   temporary tax shortfalls
*   obstruction

Other reference
---------------

An explanation and examples of shortfall penalties and other offences and penalties can be found in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Volume Eight, No.7 (October 1996).

Summary
-------

Section 141A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that a taxpayer who does not take reasonable care in taking a tax position is liable to pay a shortfall penalty of 20% of the resulting shortfall.

The test of reasonable care is whether a person of ordinary skill and prudence would have foreseen as a reasonable probability or likelihood the prospect that an act (or failure to act) would cause a tax shortfall, having regard to all the circumstances.

===============================================================================================================================

Withdrawn statement INV-205-Unacceptable interpretation. Withdrawn 2003 and provided for historical purposes only.

Withdrawn
---------

This statement has been withdrawn and is provided for historical purposes only.

Introduction
------------

A shortfall penalty is a penalty imposed as a percentage of a tax shortfall, or deficit or understatement of tax, which results from certain actions on the part of a taxpayer.  The law divides these actions into five categories of fault, or breach, with a specified penalty rate for each category as listed below:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Not taking reasonable care | 20% |
| Unacceptable interpretation | 20% |
| Gross carelessness | 40% |
| Abusive tax position | 100% |
| Evasion or similar offence | 150% |

These penalty rates are non-negotiable and where a default occurs the applicable penalty must be imposed.  A taxpayer does however have the right to challenge the decision to impose a shortfall penalty but not the amount of penalty.

This statement deals with defaults that fall within the shortfall penalty category of "unacceptable interpretation".

Application
-----------

The penalties apply to obligations relating to the 1997/98 and subsequent income tax years and to taxable or dutiable periods commencing on or after 1 April 1997.

Shortfall penalties apply when there is a deficit or understatement of tax, or where a refund or loss is reduced.  Defaults in employers' obligations are also considered under shortfall penalties.

The penalty provision is generic in application.  This means that it applies to all Inland Revenue Acts (but for Child Support and Student Loans, it applies only to employer obligations).

Purpose
-------

The purpose of the unacceptable interpretation shortfall penalty is to ensure that in a self assessment environment taxpayers who take a position which has significant tax consequences take extra care.  It ensures that the conclusions they reach on their tax liability are sound.

Legislation
-----------

Section 141B of Tax Administration Act 1994:

**Unacceptable Interpretation -**

1.  In relation to a tax position taken by a taxpayer, an unacceptable interpretation –
    1.  Is an interpretation or an interpretation of an application of a tax law; and
    2.  Viewed objectively, that interpretation or application fails to meet the standard of being about as likely as not to be correct.
2.  A taxpayer is liable to pay a shortfall penalty if –
    1.  The taxpayer's tax position involves an unacceptable interpretation of a tax law; and
    2.  The tax shortfall arising from the taxpayer's tax position exceeds both –
        1.  $10,000; and
        2.  The lesser of $200,000 and one percent of the taxpayer's total tax figure for the relevant return period.
3.  For the purposes of this section, a taxpayer's total tax figure is –
    1.  The amount of tax paid or payable by the taxpayer in respect of the return period for which the taxpayer takes the taxpayer's tax position before, in the case of income tax, any group offset election or subvention payment; or
    2.  Where the taxpayer has no tax to pay in respect of the return period –
        
        1.  Except in the case of GST, an amount equal to the product of –
            1.  The net loss of a taxpayer in respect of the return period, ascertained in accordance with the provisions of the Income Tax Act 1994, are to be used in this subsection as if they had a positive value; and
            2.  The basic rate of income tax for companies in the relevant return; or
        2.  In the case of GST, the refund of tax to which the taxpayer is entitled for the return period, -
        
          
        that is shown as tax paid or payable, or as net losses of the taxpayer, or as a refund to which the taxpayer is entitled, in a tax return provided by the taxpayer for the return period.
4.  Where subsection (2) applies, the shortfall penalty is 20% of the resulting tax shortfall.
5.  For the purposes of this section, the question whether any interpretation of a tax law is acceptable or unacceptable shall be determined as at the time at which the taxpayer takes the taxpayer's tax position.
6.  For tax positions involving an interpretation of a tax law or laws that have been taken into account in a tax return, the time the taxpayer takes the taxpayer's tax position is when the taxpayer provides the return containing the taxpayer's tax position.  If the taxpayer does not provide a tax return for a return period, the taxpayer takes the taxpayer's tax position on the due date for providing the tax return.
7.  The matters that must be considered in determining whether the tax position taken by a taxpayer involves an unacceptable interpretation of a tax law include –
    1.  The actual or potential application to the tax position of all the tax laws that are relevant (including specific or general anti-avoidance provisions); and
    2.  Decisions of a court or Taxation Review Authority on the interpretation of tax laws that are relevant (unless the decision was issued up to one month before the taxpayer takes the taxpayer's tax position).
8.  For the purpose of determining whether the resulting tax shortfall is in excess of the amounts specified in subsection (2)(b), -
    1.  A tax return provided by –
        
        1.  A partnership; or
        2.  Any other group of persons that derive or incur amounts jointly or are assessed together, -
        
          
        is to be treated as if it were a tax return of every taxpayer who is a partner in the partnership or person in such group; and
    2.  The tax rate in a return period applying to a partnership is deemed to be the same as the basic rate of income tax for companies for the relevant period.
9.  The amounts or the percentage specified in subsection (2) may be varied from time to time by the Governor-General by Order in Council.

Threshold
---------

A taxpayer is liable to pay a shortfall penalty if the tax shortfall arising from the taxpayer's tax position exceeds both $10,000, and the lesser of $200,000 and 1% of the taxpayer's total tax figure for the relevant return period.

### Interpretation or application of a tax law

The unacceptable interpretation test applies only to tax shortfalls caused by a taxpayer treating a tax law as applying in a particular way.

A taxpayer treats the tax law as applying in a particular way where he or she concludes that, on the basis of the facts and the way the law applies to those facts, a particular consequence follows.  For example, an amount of expenditure is deductible.  In some cases a taxpayer's tax position may not represent conclusions of the taxpayer, but instead reflect calculation or transposition errors.

As a broad rule, where a tax shortfall was caused by an error in calculation or a transposition error, section 141B will not apply, since the taxpayer will not have treated a tax law as applying in relation to a matter in a particular way.  However, in such a case consideration would need to be given to the reasonable care standard.

Non-application of a tax law
----------------------------

There may be instances where a taxpayer argues that he or she did not apply a section of the Act, therefore, did not interpret the particular section as applying.  Accordingly, the taxpayer contends that the unacceptable interpretation standard does not apply.  The non-application of a tax law will in all cases be considered to be applying the tax law.

What is an unacceptable interpretation?
---------------------------------------

#### Level of standard

The taxpayer's case does not have to be so balanced with the Commissioner's that no real preference can be given to one over the other.  The test is not **more** likely than not, nor is it **as** likely as not; such wording would imply a 50 percent or better chance of success.  Rather the standard is **about** as likely as not correct.  In addition, the word "likely" implies a degree of latitude.

The upper boundary of probability for a position to be an acceptable interpretation is a 50/50 likelihood of success; but the lower boundary is not quite so clear.  However, guidance can be obtained from establishing where the interface with the standard sufficient for the exercise of reasonable care lies.

Accordingly, the standard is less stringent than that of "more likely than not", but is more stringent than the "reasonable care standard".

Significant emphasis should be given to the word "about".  The standard is not intended to remove the right of a taxpayer to take up issues with the Commissioner, rather, it must be a position to which a court would give serious consideration, but not necessarily agree with.  This means that the prospect of the taxpayer's interpretation being upheld by the court must be substantial, although not necessarily 50 percent.  The taxpayer's argument should be sufficient to support a reasonable expectation that the taxpayer could succeed in court.

An example would be where a taxpayer's position was upheld in the TRA, however, later lost in the High Court.  In such a situation it would be considered that the taxpayer clearly had an acceptable interpretation.  However, in saying this, a taxpayer is not required to take a case to the courts to determine that they had an acceptable interpretation.

If a taxpayer adopts one of several equally likely interpretations this will generally satisfy the standard, as each position is about as likely as any other position to be the correct tax position.

The level is more easily reached if there is no case law on the area and the statute law is ambiguous or unclear.

#### Taxpayer effort

The unacceptable interpretation standard is an objective test involving an analysis of the law to the relevant facts.  This means that it is not relevant that a taxpayer believes that the position taken was an acceptable interpretation.

The unacceptable interpretation standard does not take into account taxpayers' efforts in resolving unclear issues.  The standard is intended to focus on the merits of an argument in support of a particular position, rather than the taxpayer's effort in resolving issues.  The strength of the argument is weighed by considering the existence and reasoning of relevant authorities.  Relevant authorities have not been defined in the legislation, however some matters that must be considered are listed.

Matters which must be considered
--------------------------------

Section 141B(7) provides that the matters that must be considered in determining whether the tax position involves an unacceptable interpretation of a tax law include -

*   The actual or potential application to the tax position of all the tax laws that are relevant (including specific or general anti-avoidance provisions); and
*   Decisions of a court or a Taxation Review Authority on the interpretation of tax laws that are relevant (unless the decision was issued up to one month before the taxpayer takes the taxpayer's tax position – see "Timing").

#### Relevant tax laws

Tax law is defined in section 3(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 as:

1.  A provision of the Inland Revenue Acts or an Act that an Inland Revenue Act replaces:
2.  An Order in Council or a regulation made under another tax law:
3.  A non-disputable decision:
4.  In relation to an obligation to provide a tax return or a tax form, also includes a provision of the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act 1992 or a regulation made under that Act:

Section 141B(7)(a) makes specific reference to the antiavoidance provisions.  This ensures that it cannot be argued that a tax position or interpretation is an acceptable interpretation in terms of a particular legislative provision irrespective of the operation of other provisions such as general anti-avoidance provisions.

In trying to discern the scheme and purpose of the legislation, primary regard must be had to the words of the legislation.  It is Parliamentary intent, as expressed in the statute, which is crucial.  The increased complexity of tax legislation has resulted in some ambiguity, leading to confusion as to the meaning of particular provisions which makes the ascertainment of the true Parliamentary intent difficult.  The Government's consultative documents, the various consultative committee reports, Parliamentary discussion and debate, and Departmental interpretative guidelines may provide assistance in interpreting the legislation under review.

#### Relevant court decisions

Factors that affect the weight of an authority:

**Publication** - The decision must have been published or referred to in a reported commentary.

**Source** - This refers to the court or tribunal which made the decision on which the taxpayer relies.  The higher the source of a decision in the judicial hierarchy, the more precedential the decision.

**Jurisdiction** - Decisions by the New Zealand judiciary, will usually be given more weight than extra-territorial decisions of other countries.

**Relevance** - Authorities that have similar factual circumstances to the case asserted by a taxpayer are more relevant than those authorities which can be materially distinguished on the facts.

However, if a taxpayer has no authorities to support a case there may still exist an acceptable interpretation.  In such cases, a taxpayer needs a well-reasoned construction of the statutory provision which is about as likely as not to be correct.

#### Opinions expressed by tax professionals

Information which supports a reasonable argument may include such items as the contents of tax opinions, legal articles and related material.  However, the mere existence of an opinion from an adviser would not on its own indicate that an acceptable interpretation exists.  It is the content of the opinion and strength of the alternative views, not the fact of seeking advice, which will be relevant.

#### Other matters

Other matters which may be considered in particular circumstances include:

*   binding public rulings on analogous issues and other published Inland Revenue statements,
*   legal articles and related material and references made to statutes other than the Revenue Acts.
*   statute other than tax law
*   dictionary meaning or a definition in another statute.
*   generally accepted accounting practice and commercial practice.

These matters carry more significance in areas where the law is unclear and there is no relevant case law available.

Timing
------

To determine whether an acceptable interpretation exists, consideration will be given to the authorities available at the time the taxpayer took the tax position.  This will generally be when the taxpayer files the tax return.  In addition, subsequent clarification or development of case law or public rulings in a particular area may confirm that a position taken is acceptable.  However, subsequent developments will not be used to argue that a position was an unacceptable interpretation.

The legislation does not require the taxpayer to document an acceptable interpretation at the time of taking the tax position.  Taxpayers will be able to substantiate their arguments when a dispute arises, after filing their returns.  However, in most cases taxpayers will need to consider the validity of an interpretation relating to a sizeable transaction when they take the position in their returns or earlier.

In addition, decisions of a court or the Taxation Review Authority which are issued up to one month before the taxpayer takes the tax position will not be used to argue that the taxpayer's position is an unacceptable interpretation.  For the purposes of this provision "issued" is considered to mean when the decision is published.

Binding rulings and the acceptable interpretation standard
----------------------------------------------------------

The fact that a taxpayer adopts an interpretation that differs from that of a ruling or published Inland Revenue statements will not necessarily mean that the taxpayer has an unacceptable interpretation.  However, if there is a binding ruling supporting the taxpayer's position, there will be no tax shortfall.  A shortfall penalty cannot therefore be considered.

Relationship to the reasonable care standard
--------------------------------------------

The aim of the acceptable interpretation standard is to ensure that taxpayers take care in considering their position.  This is required by the reasonable care standard, however, the acceptable interpretation standard takes away some of the so called "subjective elements" i.e. taxpayer effort, when there is a significant amount of tax at stake.

A taxpayer who satisfies the acceptable interpretation standard is deemed to have satisfied the reasonable care standard.

Standard rate of penalty
------------------------

The standard rate of penalty payable for unacceptable interpretation is 20% of the resulting tax shortfall.

This rate may be adjusted by varying rates in the following circumstances:

*   voluntary disclosure before or during an audit
*   voluntary disclosure at the time of return filing
*   temporary tax shortfalls
*   obstruction

Summary
-------

Section 141B of Tax Administration Act 1994 provides for a penalty for taking an unacceptable interpretation, at the rate of 20%.

A penalty is charged where all of the following conditions are met:

*   The shortfall was caused by a tax position involving an interpretation or application of a tax law.
*   The tax shortfall exceeded both $10,000, and the lesser of $200,000 and 1% of the taxpayer's total tax figure for the relevant return period.
*   The tax position taken fails to meet the standard of being, viewed objectively, about as likely as not to be correct.
