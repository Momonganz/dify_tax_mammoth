The Commissioner can issue binding rulings in certain situations. Inland Revenue is bound to follow such a ruling if a taxpayer to whom the ruling applies calculates tax liability based on it. For full details of how binding rulings work, see our information booklet “Binding Rulings” (IR 115G) or the article on page 1 of TIB Volume Six, No.12 (May 1995) or Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995). You can order these publications free of charge from any Inland Revenue office. CORRECTION TO PUBLIC RULING BR PUB 99/8 COMMENTARY An error has been identified in the Commentary to public ruling BR Pub 99/8, published in TIB Volume Eleven, No.11 of December 1999. A typographical error occurs in the penultimate line of Example 2 on page 7 of the TIB. The line should read “GST 12.5% on x minus y”, not “...x plus y”. We apologize for any inconvenience caused. PRODUCT RULING - BR PRD 99/26 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Air New Zealand Limited. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section 11(2)(a). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is a contract in the form of an Air New Zealand Ltd air waybill (“AWB”) between Air New Zealand Ltd and any customer (the “Shipper”) for the international carriage of cargo by air. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1.The Arrangement will include a contract between Air New Zealand Ltd and the Shipper according to the form of the Air New Zealand AWB for Air New Zealand Ltd to carry cargo for the Shipper from a place outside New Zealand to a place in New Zealand, or from a place in New Zealand to a place outside New Zealand, or from a place outside New Zealand to a place outside New Zealand and, if necessary, to amend the AWB. 2.Air New Zealand Ltd may contract with any other person to perform some or all of the tasks required to carry the consignment. For example Air New Zealand Ltd may contract with a third party to transport the consignment from one place to another, or to unload the consignment at the destination airport. 3.The AWB imports by reference the terms of The Air Cargo Tariff Rules (“TACT Rules”), which provide, among other things, that the validity of the contract for the international carriage of goods by air does not commence until the Shipper and Air New Zealand Ltd execute the AWB. The Arrangement also provides that the Shipper takes responsibility for the information on the AWB. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 2 (February 2000) 5 4.The AWB imports by reference the terms set out in the booklet “Conditions of Carriage – Cargo – International – Issued by Air New Zealand Limited May 1997” along with any other terms and conditions that Air New Zealand includes in its manuals available for inspection. That booklet imports by reference Air New Zealand Ltd ’s terms and conditions applying in Canada and the United States of America in respect of carriage where they apply. Air New Zealand Ltd at one time maintained particular terms and conditions for carriage originating in Canada or the United States of America in order to comply with regulatory arrangements. Those regulatory arrangements have since changed and Air New Zealand Ltd’s terms and conditions for the international carriage of cargo by air applying in Canada and the United States of America are the same in all material respects as its terms and conditions for the international carriage of cargo by air applying elsewhere. 5.The Arrangement provides, inter alia: •AWB amendment: That, if it should become necessary to correct an error on the face of the AWB during the performance of the contract of carriage, Air New Zealand Ltd will do so and the Shipper will pay Air New Zealand Ltd an AWB amendment fee for doing so. •Charges collect: That, if the Shipper so instructs, payment for the transport will (subject to TACT Rules) be accepted on delivery of the cargo at the destination rather than on delivery of the cargo by the shipper to Air New Zealand Ltd at the point of departure. The Shipper agrees to pay a fee to Air New Zealand Ltd for this. •Express transport: That, if the Shipper so instructs, Air New Zealand Ltd will expedite the carriage of the goods. The Shipper will pay an express tariff rather than the usual tariff, and the Shipper may also pay an express handling fee. Both fees will be paid to Air New Zealand Ltd. Air New Zealand Ltd will pay the express tariff for any portion of the journey to the air transport operator that flies the consignment over that portion of the journey. •Dangerous goods transport: That, if the consignment is “dangerous goods” as defined for the purposes of the contract, Air New Zealand Ltd will carry them as such and the Shipper will pay a dangerous goods fee to Air New Zealand Ltd. 6.This Ruling does not consider how any taxation law applies to, or the GST treatment of, the preparation of the AWB or any air waybill (or any amount payable in relation to such preparation), whether or not the preparation of the AWB is part of, collateral to, or otherwise associated with, one or more agreements that are otherwise the subject of any part of this Ruling. Assumptions made by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following assumptions: a)That the AWB is in the form of the Air New Zealand AWB dated 09.94 and printed by Bartsch International, Munich-Ottobrun, Germany, a copy of which was supplied by Air New Zealand Ltd’s solicitor Bell Gully Buddle Weir with a letter to the Commissioner dated 29 August 1997; and b)That any relevant term, condition, practice, or law imported into the Arrangement by reference in the AWB (whether referred to in this Ruling or not) does not differ materially from the terms and conditions set out in: •The booklet “Conditions of Carriage – Cargo – International – Issued by Air New Zealand Limited May 1997”; and •The Air Cargo Tariff Rules April 1996 issue 42 published by International Airline Publications, B.V. in association with the International Air Transport Association, 1996. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to the assumptions above, the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows: The amendment of air waybills •Amendment of the AWB is subject to GST at the rate of zero percent pursuant to section 11(2)(a). IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 2 (February 2000) 6 Charges collect transport •The charges collect fee is a fee for something integral to and inseparable from the transport of the cargo. It is to be taken into account as consideration given for the supply of the transport of the cargo. The charges collect service, and the charges collect fee paid for it, are subject to GST at the rate of zero percent pursuant to section 11(2)(a). The carriage of dangerous goods •The dangerous goods fee is a premium or additional fee for a particular quality of transport. The transport of dangerous goods, and the dangerous goods fee paid for it, are subject to GST at the rate of zero percent pursuant to section 11(2)(a). Express transport •The express tariff is a higher than normal fee for transport of a particular quality. The express transport of cargo, and the express tariff paid for it ̧ are subject to GST at the rate of zero percent pursuant to section 11(2)(a). •The express handling fee is a premium for transport of a particular quality. The express transport of cargo, and the express handling fee paid for it, are subject to GST at the rate of zero percent pursuant to section 11(2)(a). The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2002. This Ruling is signed by me on the 9th day of December 1999. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 2 (February 2000) 7 PRODUCT RULING - BR PRD 99/28 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by BNZ Investment Management Ltd as Manager of the BNZ International Equity Index Trust (“the Trust”). Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CF 3(1)(b)(iii), CF 3(7), CF 3(10), CF 3(12) and the definition of “excess return amount” in section CF 3(14). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the establishment and operation of the Trust as a unit trust: •which will hold a portfolio of shares listed in countries which appear in Part A of Schedule 3 of the Income Tax Act 1994 in the proportions dictated by the modified MSCI World Index; and •including the sale or disposal of shares by the Trustee of the Trust. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. The Trust 1.The Trust is a unit trust established under a deed of Trust dated 1 November 1999. The Department has received a signed copy of the Trust Deed. The trustee is the Public Trustee (“the Trustee”). The manager of the Trust is BNZ Investment Management Ltd (“the Manager”). 2.The beneficial interest in the Trust will be divided into units. Each unit (other than a fractional unit which will confer a proportional interest in the Trust) confers an equal interest in the Trust, but does not confer any interest in any particular part of the Trust or any investment of the Trust. Units in the Trust will be offered to the public and subscription for units will be by way of cash contribution. The Trust will have, at any particular time, more than one unitholder. 3.Under clause 22 of the Trust Deed unitholders will be able to redeem units on a daily basis, subject to two exceptions. One is the Manager’s limited power to suspend redemptions (discussed below). Redemption of units will be of whole units (including whole and fractional units) and not of part units. The power to suspend redemption of units will be exercised only if it is not practicable due to factors beyond the Manager’s control to repurchase or redeem (as specified in clause 22.7 of the Trust Deed) any units within the times set out in Clause 22.3 of the Trust Deed. The second exception to the unitholder electing when to redeem units is pursuant to clause 22.8. This is a de minimis exception where the Manager may compulsorily redeem units if the unitholder has $500 or less of units. 4.To the extent that distributions from the Trust can be fully imputed, an amount equal to taxable gross income will be allocated to unitholders and reinvested annually, by the Manager, into new units on behalf of the unitholders. Cash distributions of gross income may also be made to unitholders. The unitholders will, therefore, derive dividends for tax purposes. There is no automatic redemption facility in place whereby the Manager may withdraw a unitholder’s total investment, including rights to unpaid dividends, and immediately re-invest it in the Trust at the same unit price. Investments of the Trust 5.The Trust has been established to invest in a portfolio of equity securities which correspond to the composition and weighting of the Morgan Stanley Capital International World Index (“the MSCI World Index”), but modified (“the modified MSCI World Index”) such that the portfolio of securities invested in will not be a replication of all countries in the MSCI World Index, but only those countries specified in Part A of Schedule 3 to the Act (“the grey list”) excluding those grey list countries whose share of the total MSCI World Index is less than one percent. The Trust will buy and sell shares and other “authorised investments” as defined in clause 1.1 of the Trust Deed solely to ensure that it matches the modified MSCI World Index, and will not be motivated by any intention to derive a profit or gain from such trades (clauses 27.1 and 30 of the Trust Deed). IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 2 (February 2000) 8 6.A “cash pool” of up to five percent of the net asset value of the Trust will be maintained in order to minimise the number of sale and purchase transactions, fund any daily net funds withdrawals, and utilise net funds inflows pending purchase of equity securities. The cash pool will only be invested in bank accounts, a cash account maintained by the Trust, or in futures or other derivative contracts which give appropriate equity exposure. 7.If a new country is added to the grey list and it comprises more than one percent of the MSCI World Index, the Trustee must include the securities of that country in its portfolio of investments. If a country is removed from the grey list the Trustee must remove the securities of that country from its portfolio of investments. 8.Dispositions of securities (other than the cash pool investments) of the Trust will only occur in the following circumstances, if: (i)The Trust is ever wound up. (ii)At any time, there has been a change in the modified MSCI World Index and, as a result, the composition of the securities in the Trust no longer tracks the weightings in the modified MSCI World Index. (iii)There is, on any day, a net withdrawal of funds from the Trust by the members which cannot be met out of the “cash pool” maintained by the Trust. (iv)There is a claim on the Trustee in respect of the Trust which cannot be met other than as a result of liquidating some securities. 9.The Manager will use a sub-manager, State Street Global Advisers (“SSgA”), to track the modified MSCI World Index. As part of entering the security transactions to track the modified MSCI World Index, SSgA may enter into spot and forward exchange contracts. Forward contracts will be entered into in respect of all transactions where the period of time between entry into the contract and settlement is greater than 48 hours and the conversion of currency is necessary for the purpose of tracking the modified MSCI World Index. Where the period of time between entry into the contract and settlement is less than 48 hours such forward exchange contracts will not be entered into. However, there may be circumstances beyond the Manager’s control where the 48-hour threshold is not satisfied. 10.As part of investing in the modified MSCI World Index the Trust will pool its moneys for investment with another Fund (“the Existing Fund”). 11.Pooling of moneys for investment in the modified MSCI World Index will operate as follows: the Trust will receive subscriptions for units and bank these into its own account. The same will happen with the Existing Fund, i.e. when it first receives subscription amounts it will bank them into its own account. The amounts received by the Trust and the Existing Fund will then be combined when they are banked into one account with SSgA. SSgA will retain the subscriptions received from the Trust and the Existing Fund, as part of the cash pool, until there is an economically sensible acquisition amount ($5 million). The cash pool will be invested into short-term deposit accounts, futures and other derivative contracts (as discussed above). Once the combined subscription amounts reach $5 million, SSgA will acquire securities in modified MSCI World Index for the Trust and the Existing Fund. 12.It will be possible at any point in time to identify the proportionate share of each entity, both in respect of investments in the modified MSCI World Index and the cash pool, and each entity will be the beneficial owner of its investments. Fees charged by, and other costs associated with SSgA, will be shared between the Trust and the Existing Fund in proportion to the investment moneys applicable to each. Pooling will not otherwise affect the rights and obligations of the Manager, Trustee and unitholders under the Trust, nor the governance and operation of the Trust. Either the Trust or the Existing Fund can elect to discontinue pooling investment money at any time. At that stage there would be an allocation of the investments held in the modified MSCI World Index and the cash pool (including accrued income) to the Trust and the Existing Fund as appropriate. Similarly, either the Trust or the Existing Fund can resolve to wind up at any point in time, and the pooling of funds will not impede this or the continued operation of the other entity. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 2 (February 2000) 9 Assumption made by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following assumption: a)The dividend practice of the Trust will be to distribute its retained earnings annually. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: •The Trust has a private ruling stating that the disposition of equity securities, for the purposes specified in paragraph 8, will not give rise to gross income under sections CD 3, CD 4 and CD 5, and such a ruling remains current and in force. •Units in the Trust are issued on terms that redemption is pursuant to section CF 3(1)(b)(iv)(B). How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any assumption or conditions stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: a)Amounts paid by the Trust to unitholders on redemption of units do not constitute amounts paid in lieu of dividends for the purposes of section CF 3(1)(b)(iii). b)Equity securities constitute “capital assets” for the purposes of section CF 3(7) and the definition of “excess return amount” in section CF 3(14). c)Subject to paragraphs d) and e) below, for the purposes of the definition of “excess return amount” in section CF 3(14), gains realised on the disposition of equity securities will be capital gain amounts, subject to section CF 3(10) where any capital losses on the realisation of those equity securities will be deducted from any capital gain amount, and such capital gain amounts will be available for distribution to unitholders. d)Paragraph c) above will not apply and there will be no capital gain amount, as defined in section CF 3(7), for any particular realisation of a capital asset where such asset of the Trust is realised as part of or subject to, any transaction or series of related or connected transactions, between the Trust and any person related to the Trust as defined in section CF 3(12). e)Paragraph c) will also not apply if the unitholder is a non-resident company holding an interest of 20% or more in the Trust, as defined in section CF 3(12), at the time of winding up the Trust, and in such case the “excess return amount” will be nil. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 6 December 1999 to 31 March 2002. This Ruling is signed by me on the 6th day of December 1999. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 2 (February 2000) 10 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS This section of the TIB contains interpretation statements issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. These statements set out the Commissioner’s view on how the law applies to a particular set of circumstances when it is either not possible or not appropriate to issue a binding public ruling. In most cases Inland Revenue will assess taxpayers in line with the following interpretation statements. However, our statutory duty is to make correct assessments, so we may not necessarily assess taxpayers on the basis of earlier advice if at the time of the assessment we consider that the earlier advice is not consistent with the law. DAIRY FARMING – DEDUCTIBILITY OF CERTAIN EXPENDITURE Summary This interpretation statement sets out the Commissioner’s view on the deductibility of certain expenditure relating to operating a dairy farm. It involves considering capital/revenue principles as they apply to various repairs and maintenance/capital improvement situations that may arise in the context of a dairy shed complex. In regard to the key issues in this context, the Commissioner considers: •Milking plant (as defined further below) is one single, identifiable asset. Generally, the cost of replacing a single component part of the plant (e.g. a pump or the pulsator units) is deductible. Depending on the scale and nature of the changes, in situations where a number of parts are replaced at, or about the same time, the cost is usually on capital account. •In a rotary milking operation, the rotary platform system is considered to be a separate asset distinct from the surrounding dairy shed. The cost of replacing the entire platform, or drive mechanism is on capital account. The cost of replacing the electric motor is on revenue account. If individual subsidiary parts of each of those items are replaced or repaired, the cost is deductible. •The piping used in the dairy shed complex is not a fence for the purposes of sections DO 3 or DO 4. The piping surrounds are part of the dairy shed complex comprising the shed and adjoining yard. Accordingly, the cost of the piping forms part of the total cost of the dairy shed which is a separate depreciable asset. •The cost of undergrounding an existing overhead line system which supplies power to a dairy shed is capital. A number of other conclusions regarding the deductibility of specific items of expenditure are addressed below. To the extent that any issues considered in this statement have been the subject of earlier statements by the Commissioner (e.g. fencing and dairy shed complexes), this statement reflects the Commissioner’s current view. This statement does not address depreciation issues. Depreciation rates for identified assets will be set in due course. Background A number of issues have arisen regarding the correct treatment of various items of expenditure relating to the operation of a dairy farm. In particular, difficulties and inconsistencies regarding the treatment of costs involved in acquiring and maintaining the dairy shed complex and various items of equipment situated in the dairy shed. The expenditure breaks down into four general categories, i.e. expenditure on or relating to the following: •The milking plant and related plant and machinery •Rotary dairy shed milking platforms and machinery •The dairy shed, yard and surrounds •Undergrounding of electricity reticulation systems to dairy sheds. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 2 (February 2000) 11 Milking plant and related plant and machinery Comprising: (i)the milking plant: consisting of a number of individual items, e.g. rubberware; pulsators; milk line comprising stainless steel and pvc piping; milk filters; the milk cooler; the milk receiver/air intercepter; pumps/electric motors (ii)the cleansing plant: consisting of jetter washers; mixing bath; water pipes (stainless steel, ordinary steel or pvc); water pumps (iii)the wash down unit: consisting of a water pump and piping (pvc and steel) (iv)water heaters, including insulation wraps (v)milk storage vats and associated plant. A dairy shed may also contain: (i)a refrigeration unit (ii)a drenching system (iii)a plant wash down unit (iv)a yard wash down unit (v)a vat washing unit. Rotary dairy shed milking platforms and machinery Comprising: (i)the rotary platform, including embedded pipe work (ii)the drive machinery: consisting of an electric motor and a drive mechanism. Dairy shed, yard and surrounds Comprising: (i)the shed structure (ii)the dairy shed yard: consisting of the concrete base, pipe railings, and other barriers (iii)the pasture resting yards surrounding or adjacent to the dairy shed (iv)the inlet and exit (outlet) race (v)the stock races leading to the dairy shed. Undergrounding electricity reticulation to dairy sheds Relating to the electricity reticulation system running from the edge of a farmer’s property to the dairy shed. Legislation All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994, unless otherwise stated. Section BD 2(1) specifies the deductions allowable to a taxpayer, while section BD 2(2) provides for certain expenditure or losses to be excluded from allowable deductions: BD 2(1) An amount is an allowable deduction of a taxpayer (a)if it is an allowance for depreciation that the taxpayer is entitled to under Part E (Timing of Income and Deduction), or (b)to the extent that it is an expenditure or loss (i) incurred by the taxpayer in deriving the taxpayer’s gross income, or (ii)necessarily incurred by the taxpayer in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving the taxpayer’s gross income, or (iii)allowed as a deduction to the taxpayer under Part C (Income Further Defined), D (Deductions Further Defined), E (Timing of Income and Deductions), F (Apportionment and Recharacterised Transactions), G (Avoidance and Non Market Transactions), H (Treatment of Net Income of Certain Entities), I (Treatment of Net Losses), L (Credits) or M (Tax Payments). BD 2(2) An amount of expenditure or loss is not an allowable deduction of a taxpayer to the extent that it is ... (e)of a capital nature, unless allowed as a deduction under Part D (Deductions Further Defined) or E (Timing of Income and Deductions). Section DO 3 provides for certain expenditure on farm or agricultural land; the relevant part being: Any taxpayer who in any income year is engaged in any farming or agricultural business on any land in New Zealand shall be allowed a deduction of the amount of any expendi- ture incurred by the taxpayer in that year, being expendi- ture that is not deductible otherwise than under this section or under section DO 4, in – ... (g)The construction on the land of fences for agricul- tural purposes, including the purchase of wire or wire netting for the purpose of making new or existing fences rabbit proof. Section DO 4(1) allows a deduction on an annual depreciated basis for expenditure incurred on certain land improvements specified in Part A of Schedule 7: Any taxpayer who carries on any farming or agricultural business on any land owned by that taxpayer in New Zealand shall in any income year other than the income year in which that taxpayer sells or otherwise disposes of that land, be allowed a deduction in respect of any expendi- ture of any of the kinds specified in Part A of Schedule 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 2 (February 2000) 12 incurred by the taxpayer or by any other taxpayer in preparing or otherwise developing that land, and being expenditure which is of benefit to the business in that income year. Part A of Schedule 7 includes the following items: 6.The construction of access roads or tracks to or on the land. ... 13.The construction on the land of fences, including the purchase of wire or wire netting for the purpose of making new or existing fences rabbit proof. 14.The erection on the land of electric-power lines or telephone lines. 15.The construction on the land of feeding platforms, feeding yards, plunge sheep dips, or self-feeding ensilage pits. ... 17.The construction on the land of structures for shelter purposes. Application of the Legislation Introduction This statement considers: •A brief background to the current taxation treatment of expenditure on “repairs and maintenance” (“R&M”) •The key authorities and principles for distinguishing between capital and revenue expenditure •The significant cases dealing with R&M expenditure issues. After this general discussion, the established principles are then applied to: •Identify the particular dairy farm assets under consideration; and •Determine in relation to those assets whether various types of expenditure are on capital or revenue account. (In both of these sections the analysis is divided into a consideration of the four main categories of dairy farm expenditure identified above.) Background to current treatment of R&M expenditure Up until the 1993-94 income year, deductibility of R&M expenditure was governed by section 108 of the Income Tax Act 1976. Section 108 specifically provided for the deduction of amounts spent on repairs and alterations. An extensive body of case law exists relating to the deductibility (or otherwise) of R&M expenditure incurred under the old regime. To date, no cases have specifically considered the deductibility of expenditure under the new regime. Since the repeal of section 108, the question of the deductibility of expenditure on R&M has essentially involved an application of the capital/revenue distinction. In the context of the 1994 Act, this means a consideration of the general deductibility test in section BD 2(1), and the prohibition on deductions of capital expenditure in section BD 2(2)(e). A significant body of general case law (non-R&M cases) exists on the capital/revenue distinction. However, this does not mean that the body of R&M case law that existed before the repeal of section 108 is no longer relevant. A number of these cases are relevant to identifying the particular asset under consideration. In addition, many R&M expenditure cases apply capital/revenue principles, and many are also helpful for the analogies they offer with the issues under consideration. In summary, both general capital/revenue cases and R&M cases are relevant in determining the deductibility of the dairy farm expenditure considered in this statement. The capital/revenue distinction A large number of capital/revenue cases exist. Many make the point that each case must be decided on its own facts. A landmark case which outlines the proper approach to the subject of determining whether any outgoing is of a capital nature is the decision of the Privy Council in BP Australia Ltd v FC of T \[1965\] All ER 209. A leading New Zealand case that confirms the approach taken in BP Australia is the decision in CIR v McKenzies New Zealand Limited (1988) 10 NZTC 5233. At page 5,236 the Court said: In deciding whether expenditure is capital or income the approach generally favoured by the courts in recent years is exemplified in the following observations of Lord Pearce in BP Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia \[1966\] AC 244 at pp264-265: “The solution to the problem is not to be found by any rigid test or description. It has to be derived from many aspects of the whole set of circumstances some of which may point in one direction, some in the other. One consideration may point so clearly that it dominates other and vaguer indications in the contrary direction. It is a commonsense apprecia- tion of all the guiding features which must provide the ultimate answer. Although the categories of capital and income expenditure are distinct and easily ascertainable in obvious cases that lie far from the boundary, the line of distinction is often hard to draw in borderline cases; and conflicting considerations may produce a situation where the answer turns on questions of emphasis and degree. That answer: IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 2 (February 2000) 13 ‘depends on what the expenditure is calculated to effect from a practical and a business point of view rather than upon the juristic classification of the legal rights, if any, secured employed or exhausted in the process’. per Dixon J in Hallstroms Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1946) 72 CLR 634, 648. As each new case comes to be argued felicitous phrases from earlier judgments are used in argument by one side and the other; but those phrases are not the deciding factor, nor are they of unlimited application. They merely crystallise particular factors which may incline the scale in the particular case after a balance of all the considerations has been taken.” Amongst the factors weighed by the judicial committee in BP Australia were: (a) the need or occasion which called for the expenditure; (b) whether the payments were made from fixed or circulating capital; (c) whether the payments were of a once and for all nature producing assets or advantages which were an enduring benefit; (d) how the payment would be treated on ordinary principles of commercial accounting; and (e) whether the payments were expended on the business structure of the taxpayer or whether they were part of the process by which income was earned. The Court in McKenzies noted that the Privy Council decision in BP Australia was recognised by the New Zealand Court of Appeal in CIR v LD Nathan and Co Limited \[1972\] NZLR 209 and also in Buckley and Young Limited v CIR \[1978\] 2 NZLR 485. The principles from BP Australia, summarised by Richardson J in McKenzies, were adopted by Gallen J in Christchurch Press Company Limited v CIR (1993) 15 NZTC 10,206. Deductions for repairs and maintenance – general principles In the last year there have been three significant New Zealand decisions on R&M expenditure – Hawkes Bay Power Distribution Ltd v CIR (1998) 18 NZTC 13,685, Poverty Bay Electric Power Board v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,001 (CA) and Auckland Gas Co Ltd v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,011 (CA). Additionally, a number of other New Zealand and overseas authorities are recognised as being important decisions in this context, including: New Zealand cases •Auckland Trotting Club (Inc) v CIR \[1968\] NZLR 967 •Case L68 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,398 •Case L95 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,546 •Case N8 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,052 •Colonial Motors Co Limited v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,361 •Sherlaw v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,290 •Case T43 (1998) 18 NZTC 8,287.

Summary of the key principles taken from these cases From the above decisions it is possible to deduce a three-stage approach to the issue of whether or not certain expenditure is deductible: 1.Identify the relevant asset. If this is part of a larger asset, it must be a distinct physical unit capable of operating on its own, albeit that it forms part of the whole. 2.Ascertain the nature, extent, and cost of the work undertaken in relation to, or on, that asset. 3.Determine whether the work has remedied fair wear and tear (deductible repairs), or whether the asset has been improved, or altered, or so substantially changed that it amounts to a new, or substantially new, asset (capital). Identification of the asset The key points to note from the cases are: •The first step is to identify the subject matter of the work. That is, the totality or entirety of the physical asset that is the relevant subject matter under consideration. (Lindsay; Auckland Gas Co; Poverty Bay Electric Power, Hawkes Bay Power). IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 2 (February 2000) 14 •Put another way, it is necessary to identify “a physical thing which satisfies a particular notion” (Lindsay). The focus is on a “physical thing” – the consideration excludes the operational significance, or the economic value, of the subject matter. The fact that a particular physical thing realises its economic value only when used in conjunction with other “things” or business systems, does not mean it is not to be regarded as a separate asset whose replacement is on capital account (per Gault J in Auckland Gas Co). •However, a single asset may be made up of a number of interdependent parts (Auckland Gas Co). There is always a danger of distortion if too large, or too small, a subject matter is identified (Poverty Bay Electric Power). If a subsidiary part of an asset is regarded as the subject matter and that part has been replaced, there might be a tendency to classify what has occurred as a matter of capital, possibly leading to an absurd result. A replacement of a mere component, even a vital component (even if an improved or modified version of that component is substituted), may still be correctly classified as a repair. Conversely, if the subject matter is seen as being too broad, then every replacement of a single unit that forms part of the total subject matter would be seen as merely a repair to the whole. •Ascertaining whether a part of a wider asset is itself a separate physical thing or simply a component of a wider asset, includes considering: whether it is physically and functionally distinct from the wider setting, its relative size and value as regards the whole asset (is it “a principal capital item”? (Hawkes Bay Power)), its ability to be relocated elsewhere, and the process of the business in which the part is used (Auckland Trotting; Case N8; Burnley Football). Relevant also may be whether the part is itself a separate item of plant or equipment distinguishable from the surrounding premises (Auckland Trotting; O’Grady). •It will always be a question of fact, degree, and impression as to what is included or excluded in an entity or asset (Case N8). However, the focus is on finding a significant physical asset that will either function by itself, or is clearly divisible in size or function from other assets that make up the taxpayer’s premises or business. Deductibility The key points to note from the cases concerning the availability of a deduction for expenditure incurred in relation to an asset are: •This will also always be a question of fact and degree in the particular circumstances (Auckland Gas Co; Case N8). The borderline between a repair and an improvement of a capital nature may sometimes be difficult to determine. The test is whether the act to be done is one that in substance is the renewal or replacement of defective parts, or the renewal or replacement of substantially the whole (Wakely & Wheeler). •Expenditure that does no more than restore an asset to an “as new” condition, rather than create a new asset, will be deductible whether this is completed in one income year or over a number of years (Auckland Gas Co). This applies even if the asset is “improved” in the sense of using more modern technology and/or being more efficient by being less susceptible to breakdown (Conn v Robins Bros, but c.f. Western Suburbs Cinemas). •Expenditure on renewal, replacement, or reconstruction of substantially the whole of an asset goes beyond repair and is non-deductible capital expenditure, even if what was spent may have been less than the cost of on-going maintenance (Wakely & Wheeler; Auckland Gas Co; Poverty Bay Electric Power). This will also still apply even if the asset gives no greater performance and/or has no greater life span than that of the replaced asset (Case L68). •The renewal of major components of the asset, rather than their on-going maintenance, can be indicative of the expenditure falling on capital account (Case N8). An assessment has to be made of whether the work is of sufficient substance to place the expenditure on capital account (Wakely & Wheeler). Any improvement to the asset will be relevant to that assessment (Auckland Gas Co; Poverty Bay Electric Power). •In determining whether certain work, possibly comprising repairs and or replacements of a large number of component parts, is capital or revenue in nature, it is important to ascertain the taxpayer’s overall intention, i.e. to repair or to totally improve or reconstruct (Colonial Motors; Sherlaw; Case N8). If the total work is substantial and is intended to produce a different and operationally superior asset, it must be regarded as a capital improvement (Poverty Bay Electric Power). IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 2 (February 2000) 15 •Work resulting in a significant increase in the value of the asset, a change in its character or kind, or involving an amount not regularly incurred, is more likely to be capital expenditure (Case N8; Auckland Gas Co; Highland Railways). Similarly, an amount incurred that is substantial in relation to the value of the asset prior to the work is likely to be capital in nature (Case N8). •In the context of a total project it may be artificial to dissect the work into capital and revenue categories, or to further dissect a purported revenue category into capital and non-capital items. It is necessary to look at the entire asset and see what was there before and after (Case N8; Colonial Motors). •Some authority exists for the proposition that it is possible to carry out substantial repairs over time, provided they are not part of a wider reconstruction project (Sherlaw). •No deduction is available for notional repairs (Colonial Motors). Identification of the asset – specific dairy assets Milking and other associated plant It is possible to loosely group the various items of equipment and plant found inside a typical dairy shed into the following categories: •“Milking plant”: items of plant forming part of the milk extraction process; commencing with the cups placed on the cow and ending with the milk flowing from pipes into a storage vat for later collection. Included are items such as milking cups, clusters or claws (the items attached to the cow during milking), rubberware (including suction cups and hoses linking clusters to the milk lines or pipes), cup removers, stainless steel milk pipes or lines, other milk or air pipes, , vacuum pumps, pulsator units, the milk receiver/air intercepter, the milk pump, the milk filter, and the milk cooler. •“Cleansing plant”: items of plant for cleaning the milking plant by mixing water and detergents and pumping it through the plant. Included are items such as jetter washers, mixing bath, water pipes (stainless steel, ordinary steel or pvc), and the water pumps. •“Wash down unit”: items of plant for washing down the dairy shed surfaces and yards, including items such as a water pump, and pvc and steel piping. •“Water heaters”: one or more water heaters or cylinders for heating water for cleaning the milking plant, milk vat, etc. •“Milk storage vats and associated plant”: the vat into which the milk is pumped and stored until collected by the dairy company. This item is sometimes called a milk silo, milk storage tank or bulk milk tank. The vat has an attached refrigeration unit for keeping the milk cool and there may also be a vat washing unit. (In some, but not all cases, the vat is owned by the dairy company.) The question then arises as to whether the above categories can be accepted as being separate assets or “entireties” for the purposes of considering the deductibility of expenditure incurred for items within these categories. Milking plant It is necessary to ask whether this satisfies the “entirety test” adopted in Lindsay and followed in New Zealand cases such as Auckland Trotting Club, Auckland Gas Co, Hawkes Bay Power and Poverty Bay Electric Power. That is, can it be said to be “a physical thing which satisfies a particular notion”, not being a subsidiary part of anything else? Alternatively, do individually listed items that make up the milking plant category, constitute separate assets, or entireties in their own right? The “particular notion” in this case is the extraction of milk from the cows and its delivery to the storage vat to await collection. The plant satisfies this notion through its network of cups, pulsators, pumps, filter, milk cooler, and pipes. Although consisting of a number of items or component parts, these parts are linked physically as one combined unit to extract milk from the cows. If one of the parts is removed, the unit cannot operate; each part is dependent on the others to perform its function, e.g. the releaser milk pump cannot operate without the milking cups, pulsators, vacuum pump or other parts of the milking unit. A part of the milking unit once removed cannot be used for any useful purpose other than in another milking unit. The conclusion to be drawn from this is that the milking unit network operates as a physical thing or single unit rather than as a number of separate stand-alone assets. However, it is necessary to go a step further and consider if those items included in the milking plant constitute the “entirety” of the asset, or whether they are a component part of some larger asset. It might for example be argued that part of the milking process is the cleansing of the milking unit that is undertaken during each milking. In this connection, consideration IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 2 (February 2000) 16 has been given to whether the cleansing of the milking unit and the items of plant that carry it out (referred to above as “cleansing plant”) can be separated from the core “milk extraction” plant, i.e. are they two or more separate assets or one “entirety”? The cleansing of the milking unit is clearly a regular and integrated part of each milking. It is a fundamental hygiene requirement. As soon as milking of the dairy herd is completed, the milking unit is put through a cleansing cycle of flushing the milking unit with a succession of cold water, hot water and detergents and a final sanitising rinse. Many of the items that make up the two categories are either closely located or physically joined. For example, the water pipes through which the water and cleaning agents are pumped usually run alongside the milk pipes and other items of the milking unit in the milking area. They are suspended from or attached to the same framework or part of the shed structure. Usually, the jetter washers (items of the cleansing unit) are the outlet for the water and detergents, and during the wash cycle the milking cups are attached to them. The cleansing agents are then sucked through the milking unit in the same way as the milk, but diverted immediately before reaching the milk storage vat. It is accepted that some items of the cleansing unit, such as the mixing bath where hot and cold water and detergents are mixed for the wash cycle, and the water pumps that pump the water and detergents into the milking unit for the wash cycle, are not as closely linked physically to the milking unit. However, on balance: •what is involved in each complete milking from a detailed process point of view; and •the way in which the milk extraction and milking unit cleansing items are linked physically; - the various items as a whole can be accepted as constituting “a physical thing which satisfies a particular notion”. In identifying the relevant asset or groups of assets within the dairy shed, it is necessary to also consider whether the milking plant can be said to be a “physical thing”, that is an “entirety by itself” and not a “subsidiary part” of anything else. To some extent this has already been addressed, as it has already been concluded that the items that make up the milk extraction unit should not on their own be regarded as a “single physical thing”. Rather they, along with the items making up the cleansing unit, are component parts that together form the physical asset: the milking plant. The milk extraction and cleansing units are subsidiary units of the milking plant and are linked both physically, and from the milking process point of view, to form an “entirety”. Having reached this view, it is necessary to consider whether this asset is a subsidiary part of anything else. In doing this we must consider the other items usually found in the dairy shed, i.e. the wash down unit; the water heaters; and the milk storage vats and associated plant. As seen above, ascertaining whether a part of a wider asset is itself a separate physical thing or simply a component of the wider asset, includes considering: whether it is physically and functionally distinct from the wider setting, its relative size and value to the whole (is it “a principal capital item?”), its ability to be relocated elsewhere, and the process of the business in which the part is used. It may also be relevant to establish whether the part is itself a separate item of plant or equipment distinguishable from the surrounding premises. The wash down unit is for washing down the dairy shed surfaces and yards and is not linked physically to the milking plant proper, although it is also situated in the dairy shed. The unit also performs an entirely different function from that of the milking plant, i.e. to clean the surrounding surfaces, rather than extract milk. It can also be relocated and used for other cleaning purposes. Given these factors, the wash down unit is a separate item of plant or equipment distinguishable from both the milking plant and the dairy shed setting. The one or more water heaters heat the water for cleaning not only the milking unit but also the milk vat, and other plant. They may often be situated adjacent to some of the cleansing unit, and typically pipes run from the heaters to parts of the cleansing unit. However, pipes can also lead from the water heaters to other items of plant, and the hot water may be used to clean other plant. The heaters are therefore not regarded as part of the cleansing unit: they are capable of being operated on their own and are stand-alone assets. They are not dependent on the milking plant for their operation and could be shifted and used in any operation requiring hot water. In addition, the milking plant could operate without the hot water heaters by only using a cold water wash cycle, albeit less effectively. Therefore, the water heaters are separate items of plant distinguishable from both the milking plant and the dairy shed setting. The milk storage vats and associated plant simply store the milk arising from the milking process until its collection by tanker for delivery to the dairy factory. A vat is usually situated on an elevated platform or stand and located either in a “room” of the dairy shed separate from the rest of the dairy shed plant, or outside the dairy shed itself. Hygiene requirements may also dictate that the vat is sited separately from the milking plant. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 2 (February 2000) 17 From a process or functional viewpoint the vat is a storage asset, whereas the milking plant is involved in the extraction of the milk from the cows. A pipe may run from the milking plant to the vat to deliver the milk, but that does not mean the two units together form “a physical thing which satisfies a particular notion”. The two pieces of plant have different roles to play, although they are interconnected. Compare with the various parts of the batching plant in Case N8 (per Bathgate J at page 3,070): I consider the supervisor’s office, the dispatch office and the control room, which were all housed in a separate and detached building from the ground bins, elevators and tower, to be a separate and distinct entity from the ground bins, elevators and tower plus its contents. The only connection between the two was the electrical wiring connections and the less tangible connections of electrical controls, administration and supervision from one to the other. Or, similarly, the various aspects of the “network” in Auckland Gas Co as discussed by Gault J (at page 15,026): The fact that a particular physical thing realises its economic value only when used in conjunction with other “things” or business systems does not mean it is not to be regarded as a separate asset the replacement of which is on capital account. ... Whether the network is of gas reticulation pipes, electricity wires, telephone lines or computer links it is in each case an assembly of physical things. That they all interlink does not mean that only the whole satisfies a particular notion any more than do all the elements of a production line in a factory. Additionally, the fact that the vat is often owned separately by the dairy company – and presumably could be removed or replaced by that company – gives an indication that the milk vat is a separate asset to the milking plant. These considerations indicate that the milk storage vat is a separate asset distinct from the milking plant and dairy shed setting. Conclusion The milking plant satisfies the “entirety test” adopted in Lindsay and followed in Auckland Trotting Club, Auckland Gas Co, Poverty Bay Electric Power and Hawkes Bay Power. “Milking plant” includes all items of plant commencing with the cups attached to the cow and ending with the pipe from which the milk flows into the storage vat, together with those items making up the milk extraction and cleansing units. The milking plant is capable of being considered an “entirety by itself” and not merely a “subsidiary part” of the entire collection of plant found in a dairy shed. These other items of plant, e.g. the wash down unit, water heaters, and the storage vats are separate plant performing distinct, albeit related, functions. Rotary dairy shed milking platforms Two main types of milking plant systems are the herringbone (the more conventional and cheaper) and the rotary. The latter is less common and more expensive, at least in terms of the initial set-up costs, but more efficient in that a platform system can handle and milk a larger number of cows more quickly. Here we look at whether the “rotary platform” and its associated machinery, is a single, stand-alone asset or part of the wider dairy shed complex. Rotary platforms come in two types: •Floating platforms, where the circular platform takes up virtually the entire area of the milking enclosure inside the dairy shed and floats on water. The whole platform, on which the cows and the operator stand during the milking process, constantly revolves during the milking cycle. Cows walk on to the platform through an entrance off the holding yard, to take the place vacated by the last milked cow that has left the platform at the exit race. The platform usually consists of a reinforced concrete pad, into which the blue galvanised steel pipe work used to enclose and separate the cows is set. The platform is rotated by an electric motor powering a rubber wheel, that in turn is in contact with the platform. •Conventional rotary herringbone platforms, where the platform consists only of an area on which the cows stand, while the operator stands in a pit in the open centre. Here, the platform and cows rotate around the operator during the milking process with the cows walking on and off through entry and exit points. The platform, generally made of high quality specially treated plate steel, rests on a series of rollers, with the pipe work (to enclose and separate the cows) welded or bolted to it. The platform is rotated by an electric motor usually driving (through belts and drive chains) two large drive wheels, making contact with steel railings on the underside of the platform. In deciding whether the rotary platform and associated machinery are distinct from, or part of, the dairy shed complex, both types of rotary platform are considered to be essentially the same. It will always be a question of fact, degree, and impression as to what is included or excluded in an entity or asset. It may also be relevant to ascertain whether the part is itself a separate item of plant or equipment which is distinguishable from the surrounding premises. This issue arose when the Court in Auckland Trotting considered whether the track lighting system formed part of the track or was a separate asset in its own right. The Court there concluded that it was separate (at page 979): IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 2 (February 2000) 18 Alternatively, Mr Barker submitted that the entirety of the “premises” comprises not only the race track itself but also the running rail and the floodlight standards. I am quite prepared to treat the running rail as an integral part of the track. Its inclusion would not influence the ultimate decision of this case one way or the other. As to the floodlight standards, there is not a great deal of evidence. It does appear that these floodlight standards were originally installed in 1958 at a cost of between £40,000 and £50,000. They were moved to their present positions during the year ended June 1960 at a cost of £5,000. This is virtually all the information available to the Court. I infer that the floodlight standards are of considerable size and are erected at intervals in positions adjacent to the track itself. In these circumstances I am not satisfied that the floodlight standards should be regarded as forming a component part of “premises” which also include the track. Their cost and probable size suggest to my mind that as a matter of fact and degree they should be treated as a distinct and separate capital asset in the nature of plant or equip- ment. The mere fact that their purpose is to render the track useable as a night trotting track is not in itself sufficient to justify their inclusion along with the track as one entirety, for the same argument could be advanced in relation to various other buildings (such as stables) whose purpose is also ancillary to the use of the track, but which nevertheless are separate and distinct physical entities. Moller J. has held, on the evidence before him, that the physical thing which satisfies the notion of “premises” is the race track itself and “not any larger thing or aggrega- tion of things of which it may be suggested to form part”. I see no basis on which this Court should interfere with that finding... From this it would appear to be relevant, in trying to distinguish items from the general premises, to take account of: •their physical position •whether they are integral to, or form a component part of, the premises (e.g. in the sense of a track rail to a track) •their movability •their size •their relative value. Conversely, the fact that an item’s function may be necessary in the use of the wider premises, does not in itself mean the item forms part of those wider premises – it may still be a distinct capital asset in the nature of plant or equipment. This issue is analogous to one considered by the Australian courts, i.e. the distinction between premises and plant for depreciation purposes under sections 53 and 54 of the former Australian Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, in dealing with deductibility of repairs and depreciation. \[Note: This Act has been replaced by the completely rewritten Income Tax Assessment Act 1997: refer sections 25-10 and 42-15 respectively.\] Under these provisions, only “plant or articles” were depreciable property. This wording resulted in a body of Australian case law discussing the difference between “plant or articles” and “premises” (premises not being referred to in section 54(1)), and drawing on earlier UK decisions, e.g. Waratah Gypsum Pty. Ltd. v FCT (1965) 9 ATR 570; Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd. v FCT (1968) 10 ATR 481; J. Lyons & Co. Ltd. v Attorney-General \[1944\] 1 All ER 477; Jarrold v John Good & Sons Ltd. (1963) 40 TC 681; Moreton Central Sugar Mill Company Limited v CT (1967) 116 CLR 151; Wangaratta Woollen Mills Ltd v FCT (1969) 119 CLR 1; and IRC v Barclay, Curle & Co Ltd \[1969\] 1 All ER 732. From these cases it is possible to see that plant is generally distinct from the surroundings in which it is used by virtue of being: •a fixture, implement, chattel, or piece of machinery or apparatus that is actually used in the taxpayer’s business in the sense of being part of some process •something that is not merely part of the general setting in which a part of those operations is carried on. A building or structure might be part of a taxpayer’s plant, but only where it is more than simply providing shelter or housing working equipment – it must play a part in the manufacturing or other processes of the taxpayer. It must be more than simply a static and permanent feature of the place in which a business may be carried on, having no other function than to provide a convenient stand for the performing of work in the business. In general, to form part of a taxpayer’s plant a building or structure must have some active role in the business, although not necessarily active in terms of having moving parts. These principles are not dissimilar to those previously set out as regards the identification of entireties or assets in the context of R&M issues. Taking the above into account, and looking at a typical dairy shed complex, it seems clear that the dairy shed is the “setting” or “premises” where the milking operations are carried out, and is not itself bound up with the plant or equipment used inside the shed (c.f. the approach taken in Barclay, Curle & Co Ltd as regards the concrete sides of the dry dock). A dairy shed typically consists of walls on some or all sides of the milking area to protect the milking equipment, operator, and cows from the elements during the milking process. The dairy shed is the “passive setting” for the milking process to be conducted within, and merely performs a “shelter” function. The dairy shed structure does not play an active part in the manufacturing (milking) process (as, for example, the dyehouse did in Wangaratta), but instead provides a IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 2 (February 2000) 19 protective cover for the plant, operators, and cows. It could be compared to the building cladding in Wangaratta which the court described (at page 11) as doing nothing more than exclude the elements. On this basis, the dairy shed structure is not “plant” but merely the “setting” for the milking process. The next question is whether the rotary platform is also part of the “setting”, or whether it is a separate asset in its own right. Having regard to the part the rotary platform plays in the milking process, it satisfies the definition of “plant” used by the above cases, i.e. machinery or fixtures used in carrying on an industrial process. The platform performs a positive function in the taxpayer’s pursuits and is not merely a passive setting for those activities. The platform holds the cows in the position necessary for them to be milked, and is an integral part of the milking process: its rotation can be halted and the rate of rotation varied according to the needs of the process. If it were unable to rotate, the milking process could not operate. The situation is somewhat analogous to the dry dock in the Barclay decision which was treated as being plant and not merely a building or structure. The dry dock in that case was a land based dock adjacent to a waterway and was formed by excavating a large “basin”, lined with concrete. The dry dock was used to hold the ship in place while inspections and repairs were carried out (c.f. the finding in Moreton Central Sugar Co that a pit in the ground designed for servicing locomotives was not part of the taxpayer’s plant). Also, a rotary platform is a physical thing satisfying a particular notion (Lindsay). The “particular notion” is the holding and positioning of cows for milking during the milk extraction cycle. In addition, it is possible to remove a platform and relocate it, giving weight to the concept of the separateness of the platform from its surroundings. As noted above, a rotary platform consists of both a platform and a drive mechanism and associated equipment. Given this, it might be suggested that the platform is a separate asset from the drive mechanism, etc. However, the more logical approach is to view them as one physical thing which satisfies a particular notion. This is because of the close proximity of the two items – they are physically linked by the drive wheels – and the fact that the platform cannot perform any function without the motor that drives it. The drive mechanism is an integral part of the rotary platform, as opposed to simply being another item used in conjunction with it – as is the milking plant. In this way, the rotary platform might be compared with assets such as a lift or escalator in a commercial building, a chair lift on a ski field, or a baggage handling conveyor at an airport. These other assets with their respective drive motors and mechanisms are each treated as one complete asset and not separated into lift compartment (or chair) and lift motor, escalator “steps” and drive mechanism, or conveyor and drive mechanism. The rotary platform does not form part of, and is distinct from, the milking plant and the other equipment within the dairy shed. Although, the platform has some physical links to certain parts of the milking plant, it does so only to provide structural support for those items of plant. Conclusion The rotary milking platform is a separate asset from the dairy shed complex, the “premises” or “setting” where the milking operation is conducted, and is distinct from other pieces of equipment used in the milking process, e.g. the milking plant. The drive machinery forms a subsidiary and integral part of the platform and is therefore part of the larger asset. The milking platform (including its drive mechanism, etc.) is a physical thing forming a particular notion, i.e. the rotation of cows to assist in their efficient milking. It is physically distinct from both the dairy shed in which it is housed and from the equipment used to actually milk the cows. This conclusion is supported by the fact that platforms may be removed and sold as a single asset. It is also a significant item when compared with the other equipment used in a rotary milking operation. Dairy shed, yard and surrounds It has been concluded that the milking plant (including the cleansing unit) is a separate, single asset. The same applies to a number of other items used in the milking process, i.e. the wash down unit, water heaters, milk storage vats. It has also been concluded that the rotary platform and associated drive mechanism together form a separate asset. As these assets comprise essentially all the equipment used in the dairy shed, it follows that the balance is the dairy shed itself. In line with the authorities which considered the distinction between premises and plant, the dairy shed may be viewed as being the “setting” in which the milking operation is conducted, rather than part of the process itself. The dairy shed provides shelter, and houses the milking plant and other equipment used in the milking process. It is acknowledged that for a herringbone system it might be argued that the dairy shed, in the sense of the barriers which are set in the concrete floor of the shed and formed in a herringbone shape to hold the cows ready for milking, has an “active” role in the milking process. But even if this were correct, which might render the dairy shed “plant”, this does not change the conclusion that it is a separate asset from the milking plant and other equipment. The distinction IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 2 (February 2000) 20 between setting and plant is useful in terms of drawing a distinction between different aspects of a taxpayer’s business operation. However, it does not necessarily follow that where the setting is found to be plant it is indistinguishable from other items of plant. Having determined that the dairy shed is a separate asset, issues then arise in identifying exactly what makes up the dairy shed complex. In particular, as to whether the concrete base of the shed and surrounding yards, and the pipe work railings generally used to enclose the yard which adjoins the shed, form part of the “dairy shed” or are separate items in their own right. This is particularly important because it has been suggested that: •the concrete is “hardstanding”: listed as a depreciable land improvement in its own right by virtue of the definition of “depreciable property” and Schedule 16, and •the pipe work railing surrounds of the yard are fences, in terms of section DO 3, or section DO 4 (and Schedule 7). Is the dairy shed yard part of the dairy shed or a separate asset? Initially, it is necessary to look at the layout and construction of a typical dairy shed complex. The dairy shed yard (sometimes called the “milking” or “holding” yard) is the enclosed area attached to the dairy shed, and extends beyond the entrance and exit of the bails of the shed where the cows are held before and after milking. The base of the yard is usually a concrete pad. The yard is generally bounded by galvanised steel piping uprights which are embedded into the concrete at intervals with either piping rails, or a top piping rail and stranded heavy gauge wire at lower levels. The piping rails and stranded wire link the uprights to form the barrier to contain the cows within the yard. There is usually a gate where the cows enter the yard from the stock race to keep them in the yard. As well, or instead, there may be a moving or revolving gate that keeps the cows moving towards the front of the yard and entrance into the shed proper. The revolving gate (usually found in circular yards) can also be used to keep two herds sharing the same shed separate. The gates are usually made of piping similar to the yard surrounds. Water pressure or a small electric motor operates the moving gates. In some dairy sheds instead of a moving gate, an overhead set of wires that carry a small electric charge are lowered behind the last cows, moving them forward by an electric-powered pulley system. In the case of a herringbone shed, the concrete pad and piping barriers usually continue uninterrupted from the yard into and through the shed proper to form the base of the shed, the bails for holding the cows, and the outlet at the other end. With the rotary shed, the pad and piping while also usually continuing into the shed itself, generally have a natural break at the edge of the revolving platform. It has been concluded that the dairy shed forms the “setting” or “premises” for the milking operations. The dairy shed yard is similarly part of the setting for the milking operations. However, although part of the setting, it does not automatically follow that the yard is part of the dairy shed premises, with the shed and yard together constituting one single asset. To be so regarded, the yard must be an integral part of the dairy shed “premises” or an “entirety” with it and not a separate asset. Based on the reasoning in Lindsay, the dairy shed yard and dairy shed must be together “a physical thing which satisfies a particular notion”. Generally, the dairy shed yard adjoins the dairy shed. As already outlined, usually the concrete pad forms both the surface of the yard and the floor of the shed. Even with rotary sheds the concrete pad also forms part of the base or support for the rotary platform. Similarly, the piping barriers usually continue from the yard, through the shed, to also form the bails for holding the cows, and the outlet at the other end. Their uprights are set into the concrete base of both the yard and shed, except for the rotary shed where the piping making up the bails is attached to the rotary platform. Many sheds, particularly of the herringbone type, have several open sides, giving rise to even less of a division between the shed and the yard. Therefore, the “particular notion” satisfied by the shed and yard is the provision of the setting for the milking operation. In other words the dairy shed complex, i.e. the shed and surrounding yards, is the premises where milking takes place, enclosing the cows and plant necessarily involved in that process. With the rotary shed, the integrated nature of the yard and shed proper is arguably less clear because the platform forms the base on which the cows stand for milking – rather than the floor of the shed. However, the floor of the shed also forms a support for the platform, again suggesting that the yard and shed form one asset. Further support for the conclusion that the yards form part of the dairy shed complex is found in the Dairy Industry Regulations 1990 that define a “farm dairy” as: (a)Means a dairy where milking animals are milked; and (b)Subject to paragraph (c) of this definition, includes - (i) Any stockyard, milking yard, stable, stall, or shed associated with a farm dairy; and IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 2 (February 2000) 21 (ii)Any dairy associated with a farm dairy where milk extracted in the farm dairy is collected, filtered, deposited, separated, cooled, or stored, or treated or stabilised to prepare for transport; but (c)Does not include a place (not being a dairy where milking animals are milked) where milk is processed, or treated, otherwise than by being collected, filtered, separated, stirred, or cooled, or treated or stabilised to prepare for transport: Stock races A further point is whether it is possible to distinguish the dairy shed and its yard from its surroundings; in particular the races leading to and from the complex. The stock race is the track or path along which the cows walk from the paddocks to the dairy shed (and vice versa), ending at the entrance to the dairy shed holding yard. This race may run for some considerable distance through the farm and/or along farm road frontages. It is designed to confine the herd during its daily treks to and from the dairy shed, and prevent undue damage to pastures. The race may be constructed of a variety of materials. The surface is often shingle, although other materials such as compacted crushed limestone or pumice rock may be used. Part of the race near the dairy shed yard entrance or exit may occasionally have a concrete surface. The race is bordered on either side by a fence that is generally of post and wire construction. The point at which the race ends and the dairy shed yard begins is fairly easily to see. This division exists not only physically but also in terms of functionality. The race is a form of road or path used for the herd to walk to and from the dairy shed complex. On the other hand, the dairy shed complex including the yard is the actual setting for milking. The generally used construction materials and the purpose of the race distinguish it from the dairy shed complex. Although the race may be part of the general setting for dairy farming, this does not make it part of the actual milking operation. Its function can be compared with that of a forestry company road for transporting logs to the sawmill. Such a road is a separate asset from the sawmill and mill yard itself. It is adjacent to, rather than an integral part of, any other assets which together make up the wider premises. Similarly, this might be likened to the racing track that formed a separate asset within the wider racing complex in Auckland Trotting or the taxpayer’s premises in Case N8, of which the concrete-making batching plant formed only part. Is the yard or any part of it “hardstanding” in terms of Schedule 16? Under section EG 1(1), a taxpayer is allowed a deduction in an income year for any depreciable property owned by the taxpayer at any time during an income year. “Depreciable property” is defined in section OB 1 as: in relation to any taxpayer, - (a)Means any property of that taxpayer which might reasonably be expected in normal circumstances to decline in value while used or available for use by persons - (i) In deriving gross income; or (ii) In carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income; but (b)Does not include - ... (ii)Land (excluding buildings and other fixtures and such improvements as are listed in Schedule 16): ... (vi)Property the cost of which is allowed as a deduction under any of sections BD 2(1)(b)(i) and (ii), DJ 6, DJ 11, DL 6, DM 1, DO 3, DO 6, DO 7, DZ 1, DZ 3, EO 5, EZ 5, and EZ 6, or by virtue of an amortisation or other similar deduction allowed under any section of this Act such as sections DJ 9, DL 2, DO 4, DO 5, and EO 2, other than sections EG 1 to EG 15 and section EG 18: ... (viii)Property the cost of which was or is allowed as a deduction in any income year to any other taxpayer under any of sections DO 3, DZ 2, DZ 3 and DZ 4 of this Act (or any of sections 127, 127A and 128 of the Income Tax Act 1976 or sections 119, 119D and 119G of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954): (Emphasis added) In this way depreciation is expressly not permitted for land (because land, as such, does not depreciate: see Case G11 (1985) 7 NZTC 1,035). However, certain land improvements listed in Schedule 16 are depreciable. In addition, certain land improvement/development expenditure incurred in respect of farming, agriculture, aquaculture or forestry is deductible under the various amortisation provisions, including section DO 4. Land improvements qualifying for depreciation listed in Schedule 16 include “hardstanding”. The schedule of economic depreciation rates set out in Determination 1: “Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number 1” (see Appendix to Ta x Information Bulletin Vol. Four, No. 9, April 1993, pp. 26–104) lists the basic economic depreciation rates for all depreciable property. Hardstanding is included in the “buildings and structures” section as having an estimated useful life of 50 years and DV rate of 4% or SL rate of 3%. No definition of “hardstanding” is provided in the Act. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 2 (February 2000) 22 The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1993) includes the following definition: n. 1 hard standing an area of hard material for a vehicle to stand on when not in use. It is understood that the rationale behind the reference to hardstanding in Schedule 16 was to provide for areas described as hardstanding within certain industry groups – such areas essentially being concrete or bitumen based “pads” on the ground, e.g. wharf tarmac, car pads, etc. The focus was on non- farming industries, but the intention was not to exclude hardstanding where it arose in a farming context, provided that a deduction was not available elsewhere under the Act, e.g. section DO 4. (This approach is borne out to some extent by an example included in TIB Vol. Five, No. 12 (May 1994) regarding the distinction between the “amortisation provisions” for farming, agriculture, forestry, etc., (including the precursor to section DO 4) and the general depreciation regime.) Hardstanding is referred to in passing in Case N8 in the context of the various valuations of the premises (to determine if there had been an increase in capital value) undertaken by the parties: The Z plant including the batching controls had a replace- ment cost value of $1,142,500 and an indemnity value as at that date of $1,087,200. For insurance purposes Mr A valued the Z plant at 31 March 1988, at $1,000,000. In exhibit 3 he estimated the total replacement cost of the Z plant at $1,918,000. That excludes siteworks, drainage, hardstanding and building permit. Areas around a farm may generally be thought of as being hardstanding in the sense that they have been made firm (usually by concreting) to prevent animals or vehicles from creating a “bog”. Such areas might include parts or all of certain farm roads and tracks, areas adjacent to yards or farmhouses. However, these do not include the concrete base of a dairy shed yard. In the usual case there is no demarcation between the concrete base of the dairy shed and the concrete base of the adjoining yard. In addition, the pipe work is embedded in the concrete base of the yard and typically continues seamlessly inside the shed. It is also reasonable to assume that the concrete for the entire complex was laid at the same time that the shed was erected. The better view is that the yard, including its concrete base, is part of the dairy shed complex. Two further supporting reasons for this view are: •the items listed in Schedule 16 are generally all “free-standing” assets, not usually situated immediately adjacent to, or as closely associated with, a building or buildings in the way the yard is in this case, e.g. bores and wells, bridges, culverts, dams, fences, reservoirs, retaining walls, roads, spillways, swimming pools, tanks, and tunnels. (Chimneys are perhaps the only item in the list more likely to be connected to a building. However, given that the Schedule is designed to include items which would otherwise be excluded from the regime as fixtures adhered to land, the better view is that the reference to chimneys is intended to cover free-standing, rather than integrated, chimneys such as those used in businesses involving the use of furnaces.) •feeding platforms and feeding yards are separately referred to in Part A of Schedule 7 that relates to section DO 4. These platforms and yards often comprise concrete bases. It is reasonable to assume that these bases would not be dealt with separately under the general depreciation regime, suggesting that the base is an integral part of the yard, to be dealt with along with the yard. By analogy, the same reasoning applies to the concrete base of a dairy shed yard. Are pipe railings part of the dairy shed yard? Typically, in a dairy shed complex the yard adjoins the dairy shed and the concrete pad forms both the surface of the yard and the floor of the shed. The piping barriers are usually continuous, and have their uprights set into the concrete base of both the yard and shed. Inside a rotary shed the piping is attached to the rotary platform. In Auckland Trotting, the Court of Appeal considered whether the rails forming the sides of the replaced track were an integral part of the track: concluding that they were. This was distinct from the lighting system that was merely adjacent to the track: a logical distinction as the track could not function as a running track without the rails to contain the horses. The lighting system, however, performed a wholly separate function – principally to provide for night racing. The sides of the yards are considered similar to the rails of the racing track – they form an integral part of the yarding system, whose function is to contain the cows before milking. A yard would not serve its purpose without that feature. Whether items associated with a building were part of the building setting, or a separate item such as plant, was considered in Case 101 (1964) 11 CTBR (N.S.) 587. In that case the Board, in relation to pipeline connections of a bakery building to a water supply, said (at page 603): Rather are such things commonly regarded as part of the “setting” of a building - being such things so much appurte- nant or incident to a building simply as a building that they IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 2 (February 2000) 23 cannot appropriately be described as “plant”. ... They are, I think, fairly described as an integral part of a building as premises from which, without disintegration or disconnec- tion (sic) they are inseparable. In the case of the dairy shed it can be argued that the pipe work surrounds of the yard and the pipe work bails are so much “appurtenant” to the dairy shed building as to be an integral part of it. They are inseparable from the yard. To remove them would require breaking up the concrete securing them into the yard. This suggests that they are not a separate asset but part of the yard, i.e. the pipe railings are lodged into and form an integral part of the function of the yard. Similarly, in Barclay a majority of the House of Lords were satisfied that the sides of the dry dock, along with the associated machinery for winching etc., formed one asset. The majority were not satisfied that the two constituents of the dry dock facility could be separately treated. In addition, in some situations the pipe work railings may extend into the dairy shed, providing even stronger support for the conclusion that the railings are part of the cowshed complex. Are the pipe railings fences? It has been suggested that the pipe work railings surrounding the dairy shed yard are “fences”, for the purposes of sections DO 3 or DO 4. If the pipe work is accepted as being a fence for the purposes of section DO 3, all expenditure on fences is fully deductible and there is no need to consider the capital/revenue tests. If not a fence, those tests are still applicable. Section DO 3 states: Any taxpayer who in any income year is engaged in any farming or agricultural business on any land in New Zealand shall be allowed a deduction of the amount of any expendi- ture incurred by the taxpayer in that year, being expendi- ture that is not deductible otherwise than under this section or under section DO 4, in – ... (g)The construction on the land of fences for agricul- tural purposes, including the purchase of wire or wire netting for the purpose of making new or existing fences rabbit proof. Section DO 4 allows a deduction, on an annual depreciated basis, for expenditure incurred on certain land improvements specified in Part A of Schedule 7: (1)Any taxpayer who carries on any farming or agricultural business on any land owned by that taxpayer in New Zealand shall in any income year other than the income year in which that taxpayer sells or otherwise disposes of that land, be allowed a deduction in respect of any expenditure of any of the kinds specified in Part A of Schedule 7 incurred by the taxpayer or by any other taxpayer in preparing or otherwise developing that land, and being expenditure which is of benefit to the business in that income year. Item 13 of Part A of Schedule 7 states: 1.The construction on the land of fences, including the purchase of wire or wire netting for the purpose of making new or existing fences rabbit proof. Schedule 7 sets out the percentage of diminished value of expenditure allowed as a deduction: the percentage stipulated for item 13 is 10%. Schedule 7 also refers to: 15. The construction on the land of feeding platforms, feeding yards, plunge sheep dips, or self-feeding ensilage pits. No definition of the word “fence” is provided in the Act. The same phrase as appears in section DO 3, and Schedule 7, is used in section DZ 2 dealing with expenditure on land used for forestry purposes, and DZ 3 dealing with certain farming and agricultural expenditure for the 1990-1991 income year and earlier (it includes some items in section DO 3 and some additional items). “Fences” are also referred to in section DZ 4 which deals with expenditure incurred by persons engaged in aquaculture in the 1990-1991 income year or earlier. The Oxford English Dictionary (2nd ed., 1992) includes the following definition: Fence n...5. a. An enclosure or barrier (e.g. a hedge, wall, railing, palisade, etc.) along the boundary of a field, park, yard or any place which it is desired to defend from intruders. sunk fence: one placed along the bottom of a depression in the ground; sometimes applied to a ditch. Often preceded by a qualifying word, as: gun-, pale-, quick-, ring-, snake-, wire-, etc. fence, for which see those words. The Concise Oxford Dictionary (9th ed., 1995) states: Fence n. 1 a barrier or railing or other upright structure enclosing an area of ground, esp to prevent or control access. Black’s Law Dictionary (6th ed., 1990) states: Fence: A hedge, structure, or partition, erected for the purpose of enclosing a piece of land or to divide a piece of land into distinct portions, or to separate two contiguous estates. An enclosure about a field or other space, or about any object; especially an enclosing structure of wood, iron or other materials, intended to prevent intrusion from without or straying from within. Halsbury’s Laws of England states: Although fences are frequently used to mark the situation of boundaries, none the less they are primarily guards against intrusion, or barriers to prevent persons or animals straying out, and therefore in this sense the term includes not only hedges, banks, and walls but also ditches. The Fencing Act 1978 includes the following definitions: IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 2 (February 2000) 24 “Fence” means a fence, whether or not continuous or extending along the whole boundary separating the lands of adjoining occupiers; and includes all gates, culverts, and channels that are part of or are incidental to a fence; and also includes any natural or artificial watercourse or live fence, or any ditch or channel or raised ground that serves as a dividing fence: “Adequate fence” means a fence that, as to its nature, condition, and state of repair, is reasonably satisfactory for the purpose that it serves or is intended to serve: The Fencing of Swimming Pools Act 1987 states: “Fence” means a fence that complies with the require- ments of the \[building code in force under the Building Act 1991 in respect of swimming pools subject to this Act;\] and includes any part of a building and any gates or doors forming part of the fence; and “fenced” has a correspond- ing meaning: The Impounding Act 1955 states: “Fence” means an adequate fence within the meaning of the Fencing Act 1978; and “fenced land” means land enclosed within such a fence: The nature of “fences” has been considered by the courts. In the old case of Ellis v Arnison (1822) 1 B&C 70, 107 ER 27 the Court considered whether a ditch was a fence according to an Inclosure Act. The Court held that they could not “say that a ditch may not be in legal construction a fence”. In argument it was stated that the “strict definition of the term ‘fence’ means nothing more than a sufficient guard to fend or keep off, or shut out.” (pp. 27, 28). In Nussey v Provincial Bill Posting Company and Eddison \[1909\] 1 Ch 734, the Court held unanimously that the erection of a permanent advertising hoarding along the boundary of the plaintiff’s premises was a fence in breach of the relevant fencing covenant. In Urban Housing Co v Oxford City Council \[1940\] 1 Ch 70, the Court rejected (at page 81) the proposition that “the phrase ‘fence or other enclosure’” would not include a wall. However, in Lahey v Hartford Fire Insurance Co \[1968\] 1 OR 727 the opposite was found. That case involved a claim on a fire insurance policy for damage caused to a retaining wall after a fire in a nearby building. The insurance policy covered buildings that included fixtures, fences, and garden improvements. The Court held that the wall was not a fence as the parties when entering into the insurance policy had meant fence to mean “a structure which encloses wholly or partially some piece of property so as to impede ingress or egress. It may be composed of anything so long as it creates a line of obstacle serving this purpose.” (at page 728) The wall was not a fence according to this definition, but rather “a retaining wall to prevent the subsidence of 654 into 656.” (at page 729.) From the above it would appear that the ordinary meaning of “fence” is very broad and essentially involves: •Any enclosure, barrier, railing or other upright structure (including a hedge, wall, palisade, or ditch) situated along the boundary of a field, park, yard, or any place, especially designed to divide a piece of land or an area into distinct portions and/or to prevent or control access; that is, such a structure intended to prevent intrusion from without or straying from within. It appears that it may be made of any material, e.g. wood, iron, or other materials, as long as it creates a line of obstacle serving this purpose. As the pipe work railings surrounding a dairy shed yard could be described as a “barrier or railing situated along the boundary of a yard designed to prevent straying from within”, it is acknowledged that the pipe work railings are fences in the broad sense of that word. However, because “fence” has such an expansive ordinary meaning, it is necessary to consider the legislative background to the enactment of the precursors to sections DO 3 and DO 4 to determine whether it is reasonable to conclude that Parliament intended such a broad meaning to apply. The background to sections DO 3 and DO 4 can be traced back to the 1950s and legislation designed to provide incentives to the farming industry. The provision for the deduction of certain development expenditure was first mentioned in the 1950 Budget. It was noted there: As an incentive to increased primary production and a direct encouragement to the development of farm land the Government proposes that certain developmental expendi- ture be allowed as a deduction for taxation purposes. Under this provision expenditure such as the cost of clearing scrub, weeds, and other growth detrimental to the land and also the cost of cultivating and seeding additional pastures may be claimed as a deduction. The Government will also make provision to enable farmers actively engaged in farming to claim as a deduction for taxation an amount not exceeding £200 in any income year for expenditure incurred in such items as draining, making fences rabbit-proof, access tracks, earthen dams, repairing flood or erosion damage, and constructing landing strips to facilitate aerial top dressing. (Emphasis added) These proposals were included in the Land and Income Tax Amendment (No. 2) Act 1950. Section 9 of that Act read: 9.(1) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in section eighty of the principal Act, any taxpayer engaged in any farming or agricultural business on any land in New Zealand shall, in calculating the assessable income derived by him from that business in any income year be entitled to deduct - ... IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 2 (February 2000) 25 (b)Any expenditure incurred in that business during the income year, and not deductible otherwise than under this section, in- ... (vii) The construction on the land of fences, including the purchase of wire or wire netting for the purpose of making new or existing fences rabbit proof ... There were two parts to this section – the first part gave a complete deduction for certain expenditure, the second gave a deduction up to £200 – fences were included in the second part. The Hansard reports of the second reading to the bill state: Clause 9 gives effect to another proposal in the Budget with regard to the allowance to taxpayers who are primary producers, of certain developmental expenditure as a deduction for income-tax purposes...Some of that expendi- ture would be deductible in the ordinary course as a recurring expense, but when land is newly acquired or is being broken in for a farm the existing law would regard such expenditure as being of a capital nature and not deductible. The underlying idea of this clause is to give encourage- ment to the development of second-class land, with consequent increase in production. (Emphasis added) Prior to 1963, the upper limit of £200 for fencing and other developmental expenditure had been increased to £400. In the 1963 Budget it was noted: Our best prospect of expanding agricultural production in the immediate future is to increase expenditure on the development of existing farms....farm investment and other development expenditure have fallen...To reverse this trend and to lay the foundations for continued growth of output, expenditure which will raise the productive capacity of our farms must be stimulated. Tax Incentives for Farm Development It has been decided therefore to treat all types of farm development expenditure that may be charged against income for tax purposes on a more liberal basis... The present limit of £400 in respect of expenditure on fencing, drainage, irrigation, and similar projects will be abolished for three years....The limit of £400, which was necessarily arbitrary, has tended to restrain development of the all-important marginal hill country which often requires large expenditure to bring it to full production. (Emphasis added) In this way the deduction limit of £400 was abolished, initially for three years but subsequently regularly extended. Nothing further happened in this area until 1986. In that year the precursor to section DO4 (section 128A) was first inserted into the Income Tax Act 1976 by the Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 4) 1986, and applied from 1 April 1987. The policy behind the introduction of this section is noted in Hansard: Taxation Reform Bill (No. 2), Introduction. Minister of Finance. Clauses 6, 12,13, and 15 deal with farm development expenditure and forestry taxation. The current deduction allowable for farming and forestry development expenditure is to be phased out and replaced with a new depreciation regime on land improvements. Taxation Reform Bill (No. 2), second reading. Minister of Finance. Part I of the Bill also deals with the phase-out of farm development expenditure. It will be replaced by a new depreciation scheme, thus providing the same treatment of farm assets that is allowed to assets in other sectors. The Bill introduces a neutral tax system that will enable farmers to get on with the business of farming and make invest- ments for the real reasons, without being attracted by the subsidies and concessional tax provisions that distort the tax base and force up costs and land values. At the same time as section 128A was introduced, section 127 (now section DO3) was amended so as to phase out farm development expenditure deductions by April 1991. However, this action was reversed by the Tax Reform Bill (No. 3) 1990. \[Note: The Tax Reform (No. 3) Bill was introduced in December 1990 and taken through the House in 1991 during which time it appears to have been referred to as the Tax Reform Bill 1991.\] Although reversing the decision to completely phase out deductions for development expenditure, the Government was also keen to reduce the various incentives and deductions previously available to the primary production sector. In the context of the deduction for fencing, the intention seems to have been to reinstate a full deduction, but only when the fencing was for the purposes of subdividing land. The document “Introductory Copy: Tax Reform Bill 1991” included the following statements: Clause 21 amends section 127 \[now section DO 3\] of the Act to allow full deductibility of certain types of expendi- ture incurred on land used for farming and agricultural purposes, such as...the fencing of land for the purpose of dividing use of the land. The amending clause read: 21 Certain expenditure on land used for farming or agricultural purposes -.... (A1) Any taxpayer engaged in any farming or agricultural business on any land in New Zealand shall, in calculating the assessable income derived from that business in the income year commencing on the 1 st day of April 1991 or in any subsequent year, be entitled to a deduction of the amount of any expenditure incurred by the taxpayer in that year, being expenditure that is not deductible otherwise than under this section or under section 128A of this Act, in- ... (f)The fencing of the land for the purpose of dividing the use of that land. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 2 (February 2000) 26 In December 1990 the Minister of Revenue had said in his introductory speech: Clause 21 will provide immediate deductibility for expendi- ture incurred on...the fencing of land for subdivision. Under the present legislation, from 1 April 1991 those items of expenditure would have been required to be capitalised and written down by way of depreciation in accordance with the thirteenth schedule to the Act. (Emphasis added) The Report to Finance and Expenditure Select Committee on Submissions on the Taxation Reform Bill (No. 3) noted that the following submissions had been made in relation to clause 21: (n)As the manifesto proposal that the fencing of land for subdivision, or as in the legislation “the dividing the use of that land” is not clear so should just read fencing. (o)To provide that all fencing of land should be deductible, such as holding paddocks and boundary fencing as the phrase fencing for “dividing the use of the land” is unclear. The report commented that: (n) and (o): It is agreed that the fencing deduction provision is not clear. It is recommended that the provi- sion be clarified by referring to the construction of a fence thus excluding temporary fencing such as electric fences. However the issue of subdividing the land cause most concern. It is not clear whether this includes bound- ary fences dividing land between farms, only new fences dividing existing paddocks, whether divided paddocks must be put to different uses, or whether replacing an existing fence with a new one will satisfy the provision. It is considered that the problem can best be addressed by amending paragraph (f) to- “(f)The construction on the land of fences”. (Emphasis added) The report went on to recommend: (b)that all construction on the land of fences should be deductible as the current proposal of only fences subdividing the use of land is unworkable During the Bill’s second reading, the Minister of Revenue discussed the issues raised by the submissions: The proposed amended section 127 in clause 13 implements a National Party policy commitment to allow immediate deductibility for certain development expenditure on farms....There is a problem in that it is hard to make a distinction between capital and revenue. When a farmer puts up a fence it could be a new fence, the replace- ment of an existing fence, or, it could be a consider- able improvement on what was there before, in which case part of it could be regarded as capital. But that distinction is completely impractical to make in the real world and for that reason we have decided to allow it to be completely deductible. (Emphasis added) In the third reading the Minister of Revenue clarified that “genuinely capital” expenditure would continue to be treated as such: Changes were made to the categories of development expenditure. In practice those are causing considerable problems, which result from the difficulty in so many cases of making a distinction between capital expense and revenue expense. That was not clear under the old rules, and this rule should clarify the matter once and for all. Items that are genuinely capital expenditure, such as sheep-yards and covers, frames for crops, and so on, will continue to be treated as they were under the old Act. (Emphasis added) Section 127 as enacted read: (A1) Any taxpayer engaged in any farming or agricultural business on any land in New Zealand shall, in calculating the assessable income derived from that business in the income year commencing on the 1st day of April 1991 or in any subsequent year, be entitled to a deduction of the amount of any expenditure incurred by the taxpayer in that year, being expenditure that is not deductible otherwise than under this section or under section 128A of this Act, in - ... (g)The construction on the land of fences for agricul- tural purposes, including the purchase of wire or wire netting for the purpose of making new or existing fences rabbit-proof. Notwithstanding these amendments to section 127, section 128A (now section DO 4) continued to provide depreciable rates for certain types of land improvements, including fencing. This was to ensure that taxpayers who had moved to treating certain land improvements under that provision, rather than under section 127, could continue to do so. It was also because section 127 was narrower than section 128A – the former only referring to fencing for agricultural purposes. The wording of section 127 as regards fencing was not altered with the enactment of the Income Tax Act 1994. From this background it is considered that the original intention behind the precursors to section DO 3 and DO 4 was to promote the development of unutilised and/or unproductive (“second-class”) farming land. The flavour of the Hansard and Budget statement comments from 1950 is that of opening up pastoral land, e.g. clearing scrub, weeds, cultivating and seeding, draining, access tracks, earthen dams, repairing flood or erosion damage, and constructing landing strips for top dressing aircraft, so as to develop newly acquired or unbroken land. This culminated in legislation that referred to “the construction on the land of fences, including the purchase of wire or wire netting for the purpose of making new or existing fences rabbit proof”. Arguably, the reference to “on the land” tends to confirm this focus on opening up and developing grazing land, rather than simply any development of farming land. The reference to rabbit-proofing new or IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 2 (February 2000) 27 existing fences also indicates a focus on fences used for dividing open land. Arguably, the 1963 Budget Statement comments also focus on “development” of land with references to breaking in marginal hill country. However, by 1991 it appears that the legislation had broadened to permit deductions for certain capital costs involved in farming, with the emphasis not necessarily being on the development of new or difficult land. The government of the day’s aim seems to have been on limiting deductions for fencing to those relating to subdividing land, but this proved to be too difficult a task and wording almost identical to that used in the past was enacted. However, it does not appear that the problem was seen as being a choice between giving deductions for a broad range of barriers that farmers had treated as being fences, and conventional fences, but rather the types of conventional fencing to include, i.e. only those which divided paddocks versus other fences such as boundary and holding paddock fences. Again, although far from conclusive, the focus seems to have been on fences used to surround open land. Arguably, this is borne out to some degree by the comments made about “sheep yards”, apparently thought of as a distinct matter, and the fact that Schedule 13 at the time separately referred to “feeding platforms” and “feeding yards”. As discussed, “fences” is not defined and has a common meaning potentially wide enough to encompass the pipe work. However, on balance the better view is that it does not apply here for the following reasons: •The reference to “construction on the land” tends to suggest that Parliament had conventional fencing in mind, i.e. free-standing fences made of wood and wire used principally as paddock boundaries. This is supported by the legislative history of the provision, and particularly the early focus on open land development. It is also supported by the reference to rabbit-proofing – something which would be generally unnecessary in the context of a concrete based yard such as a milking shed yard – involving wire and wire netting. •This view is supported to some extent by exactly the same wording being used in section DZ 2 in the context of forestry, where it might be reasonable to expect that fencing would be of the conventional type, and not involve yards of any description. •That Parliament did not have yards as such in mind, i.e. that it did not view them in some way as being a collection of fences, is also apparent from the 1991 Hansard references to sheep yards, and the fact that Schedule 7 and its precursors all refer separately to feeding yards. •There is also the practical difficulty of isolating expenditure on the pipe work from the general costs of constructing a milking shed. It seems unreasonable to assume that Parliament meant for farmers to separate the cost of the pipe work from the total (depreciable) cost of the dairy shed complex, especially where, as seen, such pipe work may run inside the shed and/or form a part of the infra-structure by supporting the milking machinery. The yard will also comprise any gates (including the backing gate) forming part of the pipe work structure. The motorised drive unit for the backing gate is also part of the yard. The cost of replacing the motor unit with one of the same capacity will be on revenue account. This is because the motor unit is only a minor part of the total dairy shed complex. Conclusion The dairy shed complex (building and yard) is the asset. The concrete base of the yard and supporting pipe work including bails and rails and any gates, are part of and are integral to the overall complex. The cost of their construction should be capitalised to the cost of the shed. The dairy shed complex is distinct from the stock races. The race generally abuts the dairy shed yard, but serves a distinct function: to provide a hardened track along which the cows walk to and from the dairy shed. It is not accepted that the concrete base of the dairy shed yard is hardstanding, and thereby separately depreciable. The better view is that the reference to hardstanding in Schedule 16 is to free-standing concreted or other hardened areas used for standing animals or vehicles. In this situation the concrete base of the yard forms an integral part of that yard: itself part of the dairy shed complex. This is consistent with the treatment of concrete-based feeding platforms and yards, which are classed as complete assets rather than in-part consisting of hardstanding. Separate expensing for the pipe work, bails and rails, in terms of section DO 3, is not available. Although it is accepted that the word “fence” has a wide ordinary meaning, it is necessary to take into account the context in which the word is used in the legislation, the nature of a dairy shed, views expressed in cases regarding the integrated nature or entirety of assets, and the legislative background. Given these considerations, on balance, the pipe work forms part of the dairy shed asset itself and is not a “fence” under IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 2 (February 2000) 28 section DO 3 or section DO 4. Undergrounding electricity reticulation to dairy sheds In the late 1980s as part of the electricity supply industry reforms, ownership of most electricity supply lines running from the pole on farmers’ and other landowners’ road boundaries to farm buildings, passed to the landowners at no cost. Since that time farmers have generally been responsible for all costs of: maintaining the lines on their property, installing any new lines or extending existing lines, and/or placing the lines underground. This category of expenditure therefore relates to the electricity reticulation system running from the edge of a farmer’s property to, among other buildings, the dairy shed. The issue is whether this system can be seen as being a separately identifiable asset or entirety in its own right, or if in this context it forms part of the dairy shed or other farm buildings. As discussed, in identifying an asset it is important to identify “a physical thing which satisfies a particular notion.” The focus is on a “physical thing”, rather than the operational significance or the economic value of the subject matter. The fact that a particular physical thing realises its economic value only when used in conjunction with other “things” or business systems, does not mean it is not to be regarded as a separate asset the replacement of which is on capital account. It will always be a question of fact, degree, and impression as to what is included or excluded in an entity or asset. The focus is, however, on finding a significant physical asset that will either function by itself or is clearly divisible in size or function from other assets that make up the premises or business of the taxpayer. An electricity reticulation system situated on a farmer’s land is a distinct physical thing satisfying a particular notion, i.e. the supply of electricity to the farm. Although the lines, whether underground or overground, will be joined to the dairy shed (and other buildings), they do not form an integral part of those buildings in the way that the yard or pipe work does. The lines are both physically distinct from the building and perform a distinct function, i.e. the supply of electricity. The authorities show that the fact that the reticulation system only realises its economic value when used in conjunction with other assets, does not mean that it is not a separate asset in its own right. For example, Goddard J in Hawkes Bay Power rejected (at page 13,701) the taxpayer’s argument that its total reticulation system constituted the relevant asset, rather than just the urban residential distribution system, because none of the constituent components of those systems could function alone. Part A of Schedule 7 also tends to confirm this approach, in that it lists the cost of erecting electric power lines or telephone lines as a separate item. The fact that, until the electricity industry reforms, electricity lines from farm boundaries to farm buildings were the property of the local electrical supply authority is also indicative of the lines being a separate asset, not forming part of the dairy shed or any other building asset. In Case N8 the wiring between the batching plant and the administration sections of the premises were referred to: Bathgate J concluding that this “link” did not make the two assets one entirety. His Honour did not however comment on the status of the wiring itself, i.e. whether it stood alone or formed part of the two entities he had identified (at page 3,070): I consider the supervisor’s office, the dispatch office and the control room, which were all housed in a separate and detached building from the ground bins, elevators and tower, to be a separate and distinct entity from the ground bins, elevators and tower plus its contents. The only connection between the two were the electrical wiring connections and the less tangible connections of electrical controls, administration and supervision from one to the other. (Emphasis added) It is acknowledged that, depending on the particular configuration of a dairy farm’s power reticulation system, it could be argued that the supply running from the edge of the farmer’s property to the dairy shed is an asset distinguishable from the rest of the farm power supply system. This argument might be especially sustainable if in a particular case the supplies are independently metered or distinct in some other way, e.g. the land on which the dairy shed is situated is physically apart from land on which other buildings to which power is supplied are sited, or the needs of the dairy operation are so great as to demand a different system from that supplying the rest of the farm. However, usually the farm power reticulation system is one integrated “network”. Conclusion The entire dairy farm electricity reticulation system is the asset to which expenditure on repairs or alterations is measured. The asset may possibly be the power supply to the dairy shed alone if this is distinct from the supply to the rest of the farm. Summary of conclusions on identification of asset It is considered that: •The milk extraction and cleansing unit together form a single asset, i.e. the milking plant. •The milking plant is capable of being considered an “entirety by itself” and not merely a “subsidiary part” of the entire collection of plant found in a dairy shed. Other IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 2 (February 2000) 29 items of plant typically located in the dairy shed, e.g. the water heaters, storage vats and wash down units, are separate plant performing distinct, albeit related, functions. •The rotary milking platform of a rotary milking system is a separate asset from the dairy shed building itself which is the “premises” or “setting” where the milking operation is conducted, and is also distinct from other pieces of equipment used in the milking process, e.g. the milking plant. The drive mechanism and motor form a subsidiary and integral part of the platform and should be treated as part of the entire asset, rather than as separate items. •The dairy shed yard and the dairy shed itself, together constitute a single asset making up the dairy shed complex. The dairy shed complex is the “premises” or “setting” where the dairy farmer’s milking operation is conducted, as distinct from the plant or equipment housed within it. •The concrete base of the dairy shed yard should not be treated as separately depreciable. It forms an integral part of the dairy shed complex, in terms of function and physical proximity, and is not hardstanding for the purposes of Schedule 16. •The pipe work railings surrounding the dairy shed yard (and any other barriers making up the dairy shed complex) are also an integral part of the dairy shed complex, i.e. the shed and/or the yard. They form the sides of the yard and/or the barriers within the shed for containing the cows while they are being milked. The pipe work, i.e. bails and rails, are not fences for the purposes of section DO 3. •The stock race leading to the dairy shed complex does not form part of this asset, but is a separate asset, both physically and also in terms of the function it performs. The race generally abuts the dairy shed yard, but serves a distinct function: to provide a hardened track along which the cows walk to and from the dairy shed. •A dairy farm electricity reticulation system is a separate asset as distinct from the milking shed or other farm buildings. The capital/revenue distinction – specific assets This part of the statement covers the treatment of expenditure on “repairs”, maintenance, and renewals (adopting the same categories of assets as used in the previous “identification of the asset” section). Having identified the relevant asset, the aim is to ascertain the nature, extent, and cost of the work undertaken in relation to a particular asset and then determine whether the work has remedied fair wear and tear (deductible repairs), or whether that asset has been improved, altered, or so substantially changed that it amounts to a new asset (capital). The assets so far identified usually consist of a number of individual items or parts, capable of experiencing differing levels of repairs and maintenance alone or in combination. Consequently, determining whether certain expenditure is deductible will always be a question of fact and degree, given the particular circumstances. The borderline between a repair and an improvement of a capital nature may be difficult to determine. The test is essentially whether the act to be done is one that in substance is the renewal or replacement of defective parts, or the renewal or replacement of substantially the whole (Wakely & Wheeler). Milking and other associated plant It was concluded above that the “milking plant” includes all those items of plant commencing with the cups attached to the cow and ending with the pipe from which the milk flows into the storage vat, including the cleansing unit. It is possible to identify numerous items of expenditure arising in relation to the operation of milking plant. The following is a typical selection, addressing whether those items are deductible. Minor items forming part of the milking plant The milking plant consists of many integrated parts. A number of those parts are relatively small when compared with the entire plant, and are used in the overall operation in such a way that their repair or replacement is fairly frequent when compared with the repair or replacement of larger items. These parts include all the rubberware, the pvc/plastic pipe work used in the plant, the wash or mixing bath, and the jetter washers. Also included are minor fittings forming part of some of the larger items, e.g. the replacement of “O” rings in a pulsator, gaskets and other fittings forming part of the milk filter unit. The replacement cost of these items will be on revenue account. The regular recurrence of the expenditure on such replacements, and the fact that it does not produce assets or advantages that are of an enduring benefit, point to the expenditure being revenue in nature. Pulsators These units operate a cyclical time delay in the IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 2 (February 2000) 30 vacuum fed to the milking cups that gives rise to the milking action. The cups are held in place on the cow’s teats by a constant vacuum, but the vacuum itself will not extract the milk and a “squeezing” or pulsating action is necessary. Each pulsator unit generally services two sets of cups. Pulsators are either analogue (old technology) or electronic (new technology) and are largely maintenance-free. The most common repair involves replacing “O” rings, i.e. small circular gaskets. The cost of replacing a full set of pulsators with a new set of the same type and capacity would be on revenue account and deductible. This is because a set, or all the sets of pulsators together, forms only a subsidiary part of the milking plant. The pulsators do not constitute a sufficiently significant part of the milking plant that their replacement could be regarded as a renewal, reconstruction, or replacement of the whole, or substantially the whole, of the plant. In that situation there has been no overall improvement to the milking plant or an increase in its capacity, i.e. no additional cows can be milked within a given time. The plant has simply been restored to its original function. The renewal of the pulsation unit by replacing the pulsators with new ones has not necessarily extended the life of the milking plant as a whole. Although expenditure on replacing all the pulsators would presumably be fairly infrequent (as they have a relatively long useful life), this could still not be described as being of a “once-and-for-all nature” producing assets or advantages of an enduring benefit. They are enduring to the extent that there will be a reduction in repairs and maintenance required in relation to the pulsators in succeeding years, but the same can be said of many repairs and maintenance expenditure items. This does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that the expenditure is on capital account. It cannot be said that the replacement of the pulsators with new ones of the same capacity whether of the same type or different models using the same technology, has done more than at most restore that part of the milking plant to its “as new” condition. Conclusion It is considered that the replacement of the pulsation units would be in substance the renewal or replacement of defective parts, rather than a renewal or replacement of substantially the whole (per Wakely and Wheeler). It is expenditure that does no more than restore an asset to an “as new” condition, rather than create a new asset. It is not considered that the replacement of all the pulsators at one time would involve significant reconstruction resulting in an operationally superior asset. Nor would it necessarily significantly increase the overall value of the milking plant. However, the situation might be different if the replacement of the pulsation units formed part of a wider programme of replacement and/or upgrade (c.f. Case N8 and Sherlaw). It would then be relevant to ascertain the taxpayer’s underlying intention in undertaking the replacement (Auckland Gas; Hawkes Bay Power). However, a programme of replacement and/or upgrade will usually be distinct from a programme designed simply to maintain an asset in good working order over its useful life, e.g. a periodic replacement of worn and wearing rubberware to ensure that untimely and costly breakdowns do not occur). Replacement of analogue pulsators with electronic pulsators An issue arises as to whether the same conclusion holds if a farmer changes all the pulsation units with new technology, e.g. moving from an analogue system to electronic vacuum pulsators. The question then is whether the “upgrading” of the pulsator units is an extensive enough renewal of the milking plant asset when considered as a whole, to fall on capital account. It is worth noting here the following comments from Wakely and Wheeler: The question of repair is in every case one of degree, and the test is whether the act to be done is one which in substance is the renewal or replacement of defective parts, or the renewal or replacement of substantially the whole. In that case, the judge in discussing the difference between a repair and a renewal said (at page 923): “Repair” and “renew” are not words expressive of a clear contrast. Repair always involves renewal; renewal of a part; of a subordinate part. A skylight leaks; repair is effected by hacking out the putties, putting in new ones, and renewing the paint. A roof falls out of repair; the necessary work is to replace the decayed timbers by sound wood; to substitute sound tiles or slates for those which are cracked, broken, or missing; to make good the flashings, and the like. Part of a garden wall tumbles down; repair is effected by building it up again with new mortar, and, so far as necessary, new bricks or stone. Repair is restoration by renewal or replace- ment of subsidiary parts of a whole. Renewal, as distinguished from repair, is reconstruction of the entirety, meaning by the entirety not necessarily the whole but substantially the whole subject-matter under discussion. (Emphasis added) In Case N8 Bathgate J drew the distinction in these terms (page 3,073): If a repair does not significantly improve the asset or make it different in kind by changing its character, and thus increase its value or extend its useful life, and does no more than restore it to its original condition, then that is more likely to be a deductible item of repair and maintenance. The expenditure would generally be deductible also if the expense is for an amount that is regularly incurred by reason of ordinary wear and tear, or the expense is small and subordinate in nature in relation to the whole value of the asset involved. On the other hand work resulting in a significant increase in value of the asset, a change in its IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 2 (February 2000) 31 character or kind, of an amount not regularly incurred, or substantial in amount in relation to the value of the asset prior to the work, may be more likely to be capital expenditure of the nature not allowed as a deduction... The ready mixed concrete plant in Case N8 provides some analogies with a milking plant, although on a much larger scale. Both are assets or entireties made up of a number of subsidiary units, each performing a function that is one step in an overall process. In Case N8, very few working parts of the concrete mixing process were untouched and not renewed or replaced to some extent. However, in the situation being considered here only the pulsators are being replaced, albeit with modern technology. The replacement is therefore not on the same scale in relation to the total entity, i.e. the milking plant. Using the language in Lurcott v Wakely and Wheeler, the replacement of the pulsators in the milking plant seems to be the “renewal or replacement of subsidiary parts of a whole”. It does not amount to “reconstruction of the entirety, meaning by the entirety not necessarily the whole, but substantially the whole subject-matter under discussion”, i.e. the milking plant. However, against this is the change in the character of the milking plant brought about by the change from the old mechanical pulsation units to the new electronic units. In a number of R&M cases where individual parts of the larger asset have been replaced using more modern materials or technology, the expenditure has been held to be on revenue account and not an improvement of the asset. As Willy J said in Case T43 (at page 8,292): If the only way to effect a repair is to renew that part of the building – even extensive renewal as in Conn v Robins Bros, then the work remains a repair and not an improve- ment ... The fact that the repair will continue the life of the building does not convert the expenditure into capital. Indeed that is the whole purpose of effecting the repairs. In Case T43 the TRA held that reasonably extensive “repairs” to a recently purchased commercial building were not an improvement. The repairs included replacing a leaking fibrolite roof with corrugated iron, replacing rotten sections of floor joists, and covering the partly rotten floorboards with a new covering of particle board. A dilapidated wall was re-clad and re- framed, and stormwater drains re-routed and renewed. The TRA decided the evidence established that as the work carried out was a repair to existing works and not the creation of a new work, it could then be properly said that the building had been maintained in its original form by the repair work. The Robins Bros decision, cited in Case T43, is one often referred to where the distinction between repairs and improvements is being considered. In that case, the company carried out extensive repairs to premises it leased (as the lessee). These included replacing the slate roof with an asbestos roof, replacing some roofing timbers, inserting steel girders to support the upper storey, replacing rotten floor boards with a concrete floor, and replacing shop windows with windows of a different type. The Court held the expenditure to be on revenue account, Buckley J commenting (at page 274): In the light of that circumstance it seems to me that this was expenditure incurred by the company with a view to enabling it to continue to earn profits from its business, not by acquiring some asset for that purpose but by putting the company’s existing asset into a state of repair which would enable it to continue to use that asset. No doubt in the course of carrying out these works certain structural alterations were made, as one would expect with any extensive repair of a building over 400 years old, when repairs were being carried out at a time when building techniques have completely altered. But the fact that there were alterations in the structural details of the building does not seem to me to be a good ground for proceeding upon the basis that the work produced some- thing new. On the contrary, I think it is implicit in the Commissioner’s finding that the result of this work was not to produce something new but to repair something which had previously existed. Upon that basis it seems to me that there is no ground for regarding this expenditure as a capital expenditure. It was expenditure incurred for the purpose of enabling the company to continue to earn its profits, and was therefore in my judgment expenditure which would properly be chargeable to income. (Emphasis added) These cases indicate that if the work undertaken affects only some parts of the entire asset and brings that asset back up to a fully functioning capacity, the work is more likely to be found to be of a revenue nature. It has also been accepted that replacement of a part with a more modern version, which may be more effective, does not necessarily mean the cost of the part is on capital account. The replacement of the pulsators has similarities with the position in Robins Bros in that the alterations to the milking plant are being made using new technology that was not available when the plant was first constructed. Although the change to an electronic system reflects an enhancement in terms of the advantages brought by new technology, it has not resulted in a change in capacity, i.e. throughput. In this regard the authorities show that an improvement in the level of anticipated future repairs does not equate to an upgrade of a capital nature, but merely reflects improved technology and the advantages that come from having a newer part. Revenue treatment of the costs of replacing old parts with new using modern material is also supported by the decisions of Morcom v Campbell-Johnson \[1956\] 1 QB 106, 115 and W Thomas & Co Pty Limited v FCT (1965) 115 CLR 58. In W Thomas & Co Pty it was held by the Australian High Court that (at page 72): It may sometimes be convenient for some purposes to contrast a “repair” with a “replacement” or “renewal”. But IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 2 (February 2000) 32 repairs to a whole are often made by the replacement of worn-out parts by new parts. Repair involves the restora- tion of a thing to a condition it formerly had without changing its character. But in the case of a thing considered from the point of view of its use as distinct from its appearance, it is restoration of efficiency in function rather than exact repetition of form or material that is significant. Blanchard J expressed similar sentiments in Auckland Gas Co where he said in his conclusions on the capital/revenue question (at page 15,022): If work of a maintenance character had been done on the joints and corroded sections of pipe had been replaced, the cost involved would certainly have been deductible, even if it was done according to a programme intended eventually to restore the whole of the low pressure part of the network to an “as new” condition, with the benefit being long lasting. .... (We include in this the cost of replacement of corroded sections with piping or new jointing with greater resistance to corrosion and leak free because of new technology. As Mr Farmer said, the fact that the use of new technology will reduce future mainte- nance bills does not mean that the cost of the work must be charged to capital.) (Emphasis added) In the present situation the repair of the whole, the milking plant, is occurring by “replacement of worn- out parts by new parts” as discussed in W Thomas & Co Pty. Therefore, this involves “the restoration of a thing to a condition it formerly had without changing its character” because the milking plant still incorporates a pulsation unit with the same capacity. That is, in looking at the milking plant “from the point of view of its use as distinct from its appearance, it is restoration of efficiency in function rather than exact repetition of form or material that is significant”. It is understood that in some cases there may be some additional operational advantages with the new electronic units, e.g. the ability to record each cow’s milk production. Where this occurs there may be a stronger argument that the new system is an improved one as compared to the old system. This will depend on the facts of the individual case. Conclusion Where analogue pulsation units are replaced by electronic pulsation units this will generally be on revenue account given that: •such a replacement relates only to a subsidiary part of the entire asset, being the milking plant •the electronic system does not increase capacity, i.e. throughput •the reason for the change in the type of system is likely to be more of a reflection of changes in the relevant technology, than a desire to enhance the plant. However, this may not be so if the replacement coincided with the replacement of other parts of the plant or some kind of general “upgrade”. Seen together, the expenditure might be considered to be on capital account; as was the case in Case N8. It would not matter that the programme of upgrading occurred at one time, or over a period of years as in Auckland Gas (see Blanchard J’s comments on p.15,024). Stainless steel milk pipes The steel milk pipes carry milk from the cup units through a releaser milk pump, filter, and cooler to the vat. Stainless steel pipes have an extremely long life and require little maintenance beyond the replacement of minor items such as rubber joints and joining hoses, (already considered above). Given their long life, it is considered that the replacement of these pipes will only arise as part of a dairy shed complex being upgraded and therefore would be on capital account. The replacement of a damaged section of stainless steel pipe, in the rare instances where that would be necessary, e.g. damage caused by a cow, is the same as that relating to the replacement of rubber hoses (considered above). Such expenditure on the pipes is probably not of a regular or recurring nature given its infrequency (although, arguably, the risk of such damage is a constant one directly related to daily operations). However, the part replaced would be so small in relation to the entire milking plant asset (or even the milk pipes themselves) as to be unlikely to give rise to an enduring benefit of any kind. Therefore, such expenditure will be on revenue account and be deductible as an ordinary business expense. Milk filters The milk filter consists of a stainless steel unit containing disposable gauze filters replaced at each milking. The stainless steel unit has an extremely long life and repairs are minimal. The replacement of gauze filters is a revenue cost as an ordinary, on-going business expense. Some, generally larger sheds, may have two milk filters. The inclusion of an additional filter would seem to occur only for the reason of increasing the capacity of the milking plant and is likely to be accompanied by upgrading of other parts of the plant. Accordingly, the cost of introducing a further filter or filters is capital in nature. Milk cooler The milk cooler is made up of a series of thin metal plates with a honeycomb network through them, encased by heavy metal plates at each end bolted together. The cooler operates in a similar way to the cooling system of a car radiator with pressure-fed cold water passing through the veins of the unit to cool the milk as it passes through. Such units have a long life with little maintenance required, although servicing may be necessary from time to time. It is understood IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 2 (February 2000) 33 that servicing occurs fairly infrequently (approximately every five years) and is generally carried out by specialists who replace small fittings, e.g. gaskets, and resealing. The cost of servicing a milk cooler, although infrequent, is a revenue expense, and that even if a new or reconditioned cooler of the same capacity were purchased, this would still be on revenue account. Although physically quite large, the cooler performs a relatively small part of the milking plant process, and its replacement would be no more than “renewal or replacement of subsidiary parts of a whole” (Wakely and Wheeler). However, in practice, as is the case with the milk filter unit, replacement is more likely to occur only as part of a general upgrade of some kind. In these circumstances the cost is likely to be on capital account (Case N8). Milk receiver/Air intercepter Both types of can are made of stainless steel and vary in size depending on the size of the milking operation. The milk receiver is the first collection point of milk taken from the herd. It fills to a certain level, before probes inside it (operating similar to a float system in a trough) trigger the releaser milk pump to pump the milk through the pipes to the milk filter and cooler. These cans are constructed for a long life, generally lasting the life of the shed. The see-through bolted on solid plastic covers at one or both ends may deteriorate through exposure to UV rays. The cost of replacing these covers is low. The replacement of the plastic covers is a revenue expense. Although, such expenditure may be infrequent, the part replaced would be so small in relation to the milking plant asset (or even the receiving cans themselves) that it would involve only “renewal or replacement of a subsidiary part” of the asset and would not amount to “reconstruction of the entirety” (Wakely and Wheeler). Any replacement of the receiving cans as a whole would seem to be required only when there is a need to increase the capacity of the milking plant. For example, where the capacity of the shed itself has been increased because of the increased size of the herd. As such, replacement of the receiving cans is part of an expansion to the entirety of the milking plant and would generally be on capital account. Pumps/electric motors Milking plant usually includes at least three different types of pump, each with an associated electric motor. The three types of pump are: •Releaser milk pump The releaser milk pump is situated adjacent to the milk receiver and pumps milk from that reservoir through the pipes to the milk filter. It might generally be expected to have a useful life in excess of 10 years. •Vacuum pump This pump is usually situated in the milk receiving area of the shed. It provides the vacuum or suction through a series of air pipes/lines to the milking cups to remove the milk from the cow, and then draws the milk through pipes to the milk receiver. It would also be expected to have a useful life in excess of 10 years. •Plant wash water pump This pump forms part of the cleansing unit and is connected to the pipes from the wash bath. It is used for pumping the succession of cold water, hot water and detergents through the milking unit to cleanse it. Such pumps require little maintenance. Replacement of a single pump The replacement of a single pump will be on revenue account because: •The expenditure restores the asset (the milking plant), both in function and form, to its original standard without improvement. Indicatively, this places the expenditure on revenue account. (If the pump had been replaced with one of an increased capacity, this could be said to result in a permanent improvement to the milking plant (Rhodesia Railways and Highland Railway) or an “upgrading” of the plant (Auckland Gas Co) and thus be on capital account.) •No “new” asset has been acquired. The pump, although relatively expensive to replace, does not form a substantial enough portion of the milking plant for it to be said that its replacement “renews” the milking plant. Neither can it be said that the milking plant has been improved. The old pump has been replaced with a pump of exactly the same capacity. The “new” asset is to be assessed from the base of the “old” asset in good repair (per Hodgins v Plunder & Pollak (Ireland) Ltd \[1957\] IR 58). Because it is rare for this type of component to require replacement, it might be argued that the payment has been made “once and for all for the enduring benefit of the taxpayer’s trade” (British Insulated and Helsby Cables Ltd v Atherton \[1926\] AC 213; 10 TC 155, BP Australia et al ), and the expenditure is therefore on capital account. However, because the pump is not a substantial enough component of the overall milking plant, it is considered that its replacement will not alone extend the life of the milking plant asset to any marked degree so as to give rise to an enduring benefit. However, the cost may be capital expenditure IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 2 (February 2000) 34 where, for example, replacement of a single pump: •involves a new pump that is more powerful or offers some other superior performance level or feature; or •occurs as part of a programme of more widespread renewal, upgrading, and/or extension of the milking plant (whether or not occurring at the same time). Repairs/replacement of several items of milking plant It was concluded above that the milking plant is one asset. However, that does not mean that replacing a component part of the milking plant will always be a repair and therefore revenue expenditure. The position becomes less clear when more than one component is replaced at, or near, the same time. It is acknowledged that there are an infinite number of types and combinations of repairs and replacements that may occur to milking plant, and it is not possible to deal with them all. The only workable approach is to provide some examples and outline the principles to be applied and likely outcomes, so these can be used in considering other situations. Two examples are provided by way of illustration. Example 1 Releaser milk pump replaced and vacuum pump repaired The replacement of a single vacuum pump with a new pump was considered above. The following considers a case where two pumps fail within a short period. The releaser milk pump is replaced with a new pump at a cost of approximately $7,000. The performance of the pump has gradually deteriorated throughout the previous season, but it has been possible to manage with lower milk volumes at that time. With an increase in milk volumes due in the new season, the farmer decides to replace the pump, although it could be repaired. Though the new releaser milk pump is of the latest design, it offers no increase in capacity over that of the old pump when it was new. A month into the new season the vacuum pump fails. It would cost the farmer several thousand dollars to replace it with a new one. The farmer has a serviceman remove the vacuum pump and install a loan pump while the failed pump is repaired. The repairs will extend the pump’s life by several years. In applying the case law tests outlined earlier, the following comments can be made. •As with the replacement of a single pump, although two pumps are involved the expenditure can be said to do no more than restore the asset (the milking plant), both in function and form, to, at most, its original standard without improvement. Indicatively, therefore, this places the expenditure on revenue account. The expenditure on the pumps has not resulted in any increased capacity that could be said to result in a permanent improvement to the milking plant. •Arguably, no “new” asset has been acquired. Although expenditure on two pumps has been outlaid, the character of the milking plant has not changed (c.f. Case N8 or Highland Railway). Although costly to replace, the releaser milk pump does not by itself form a substantial enough portion of the milking plant for it to be said that its replacement “renews” the milking plant. This remains so, even when that replacement is considered along with the repairs to the vacuum pump. There is no programme of systematic renewal or upgrading. The events were unconnected. •It cannot be said that the milking plant has been improved beyond its original condition. The old releaser milk pump has been replaced with a pump of exactly the same capacity. The repairs to the vacuum pump have simply restored it to its usual condition, rather than extended its useful life. Indicatively, this places the expenditure on revenue account. •As with the single pump scenario, because it is rare for both these components to require replacement or major repair, it is possible to argue that the payments have been made once and for all for the enduring benefit of the taxpayer’s trade (British Insulated and Helsby Cables Ltd, BP Australia). It could be said that the expenditure should therefore be on capital account. However, the counter to this argument is the fact that the replacement of one pump and repair of the other are not substantial enough for it to be said that they will, by themselves, extend the life of the milking plant asset to any marked degree. For these reasons, the cost of the replacement of one pump and the repair of the other would, in the particular circumstances outlined, be on revenue account. Example 2 Replacement of vacuum and releaser milk pumps and pulsators As in Example 1, a dairy farmer is in the position of having to replace a vacuum pump. However, the farmer would also like to replace a number of other items at the same time ie, the pulsators and uplift pump, although they are not causing major problems. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 2 (February 2000) 35 As the dry season is approaching, the decision is made to replace all three components while the plant is not being used. All are to be replaced with components of the same capacity. As with the first example, the asset, against which the expenditure is to be measured, is the milking plant. Having decided that these components are part of a larger asset, it is then necessary to apply the case law tests against the expenditure incurred: •Expenditure that does no more than restore an asset to an “as new” condition, rather than create a new asset, will be deductible whether this is done within one income year, or over a number of years. However, if expenditure is on renewal, replacement, or reconstruction of substantially the whole of an asset, this is more than a repair and is non-deductible. This applies even if the asset gives no greater performance and/or has no greater life span than that of the replaced asset. Here the vacuum pump, the uplift pump, and the pulsation units are being replaced. Together these items are largely responsible for the milk extraction process – suggesting that something more than repair is being undertaken – and together their replacement has the flavour of “reconstruction of substantially the whole” (Wakely and Wheeler). •The renewal of major components, as opposed to their maintenance in a serviceable condition, can be indicative of the expenditure falling on capital account. An assessment has to be made of whether the work is of sufficient substance to place the expenditure on capital account. This will always be a question of fact and degree, and more difficult to determine in situations where the asset has not been improved in any way. •In determining whether certain work comprising repairs and or replacements of a large number of component parts is capital or revenue in nature, it is important to ascertain the taxpayer’s overall intention, i.e. to repair or to totally improve or reconstruct. Here the farmer chose to replace all of the items: the vacuum pump because it could not continue to be used; and the uplift pump and pulsation units because it was convenient to do so. It might be said that the farmer’s intention was simply to keep the milking plant going by replacing items that had worn out or would require significant repairs, i.e. there was no concerted decision to “improve” or remodel the plant. However, conversely the replacements constitute such a significant part of the total plant that the decision to replace them at the same time suggests something more than an intention simply to repair (Case N8). •Work resulting in a significant increase in value of the asset, a change in its character or kind, or involving an amount not regularly incurred, or substantial in relation to the value of the asset prior to the work, is more likely to be capital expenditure. In this case the new items will not give rise to a change in character or kind. However, it appears that the cost overall will be reasonably significant in relation to the whole. It might also be argued that the replacement of three items of equipment at the same time in this way is not in the nature of a recurrent expense. •Authorities such as Case N8 suggest that it may in the context of a total project be artificial to dissect the work into capital and revenue categories, or to further dissect a purported revenue category into capital and non-capital items. It is necessary to look at the entire asset and see what existed before and after. In this example, before the expenditure the milking plant included one major item that was essentially unusable. After the replacements, the milking plant has largely been renewed through the replacement of three major items: the overall effect is one of renewal. Although part of the old milking plant asset remains, for all practical purposes the replacement of these critical components means that a largely “new” asset has been created. •The farmer chose to replace the pulsators and uplift pump at the same time as the vacuum pump. Case law (Colonial Motors) makes it clear that there is no deduction available for notional repairs – the cost of replacement will be on capital account, although repairs on the existing part would have been revenue in nature. The replacement of such a substantial portion of the milking plant would tend to, on the particular facts of this example, be on capital account. However, the result in this example would be different if the milk pump and pulsators were also in a poor state of repair and the farmer simply chose to wait until the dry season to effect repairs and/or replacement of these parts. The cases tend to indicate that where the taxpayer’s intention is simply to maintain or replace defective items, even where this is carried out in one income year (or at the same time) this will not amount to a substantial change to the whole. The correct treatment will always be a question of fact and degree. Upgrading the milking plant A dairy operation may be upgraded, usually to IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 2 (February 2000) 36 increase production. For example, a 16 a-side herringbone shed is converted into a 20 a-side herringbone operation. This would usually involve extending the herringbone pit and shed roof, plus the addition of new sets of droppers and clusters. An upgrade would also occur if a herringbone operation were converted to a rotary system. The extent of the cost of an upgrade appears to be a function of how compatible the old layout and equipment is to the new equipment, and the extent to which some of the existing plant may be incorporated into the new system, e.g. milk pipes and coolers having sufficient capacity to deal with increased volumes. In all these situations the milking plant would be improved beyond its original state or condition. As such, and on the basis of the authorities (e.g. Highland Railway, Case N8) the cost would clearly fall on capital account. The payments would be made “once and for all for the enduring benefit of the taxpayer’s trade” (e.g. British Insulated and Helsby Cables Ltd and BP Australia). Other equipment situated in the dairy shed It was concluded above that the milking plant is distinct from a number of other items of equipment possibly found in the dairy shed, e.g: the wash down unit; water heaters; milk storage vats; refrigeration unit; drenching system; plant wash down unit; yard wash down unit; and vat washing unit. The repair and/or replacement of these items must be considered separately from the milking plant and the dairy shed. It is accepted that the cost of repairs to, or replacements of, subsidiary parts making up these assets will be revenue in nature (e.g. repairs to or replacement of sections of the water hose or pipes that form part of the wash-down unit). However, the complete replacement of such an asset (e.g. the water heater) with a new one would amount to the replacement of the entirety, i.e. a new asset, and the cost will be on capital account (Wakely and Wheeler). Rotary platforms It was earlier concluded that in a rotary dairy shed it is the rotary milking platform together with its associated drive mechanism and motor that is the asset satisfying the “entirety” test. Repairs The cost of any repairs to the rotary platform, drive mechanism or motor will be on revenue account, including the replacement of minor items, e.g. the hard rubber wheel that turns the platform, or the steel rollers on which a conventional steel platform rests. Replacement of the platform It is understood that replacement of the entire rotary platform is rare. It is most likely to occur only if a rotary cowshed is being expanded in size because of a significant increase in the size of the milking herd and the need to increase the milking plant capacity. The platform itself is by far the largest part of the rotary milking platform asset. Based on the authorities it is clear that its replacement would be on capital account, given that it would involve the reconstruction or renewal of substantially the whole of the rotary platform asset (Wakely and Wheeler, Auckland Trotting Club, Lindsay and Case N8). The platform is a significant and distinct part of the entire rotary system in terms of both sheer size and value. This would apply whether or not the new replacement platform holds more cows than the old one. As held in a number of cases (e.g. Case N8) it is not necessary that there be an increase in the capacity of the asset over that which existed previously, if the replacement is so significant that it amounts to a substantial change to the entire asset. Seemingly, the position would also be unaffected by use of part or all of the old drive machinery to rotate the new platform (Case N8). Replacement of the drive mechanism or motor As seen, whether the expense of replacing a component part will be on capital or revenue account is always one of fact and degree. The test is whether the act to be done is one that in substance is the renewal or replacement of defective parts, or the renewal or replacement of substantially the whole (Wakely & Wheeler). Case L68 concerned, inter alia, the deductibility of the cost of replacing a fishing vessel’s engine. Deane J concluded that this cost was capital in nature. Although his Honour appears to have taken into account the terms of section 115 of the Income Tax Act 1976, which expressly provided for depreciation of “expenditure of a capital nature” incurred in acquiring, installing, or extending any equipment or machinery that was to be used in a fishing boat, he also concluded that the cost of acquiring the engine was, according to ordinary principles, on capital account. His Honour noted (at page 1,401): Whether expenditure is for “repairs or alterations”, or is more substantial and capital in nature, appears to depend on the scale and significance of the work done, when related to the asset to which it occurs. The larger and more signifi- cant the work, relative to the whole, the more probable it is that capital expenditure is involved. Much then depends on the scale and significance of the totality against which the comparison is to be made. It may be an entire capital enterprise, or it may be some lesser part. Various measures have been adopted in the cases to decide whether it is one or the other. In Samuel Jones and Co (Devondale) Limited v IR Commrs (1951) 32 TC 513 the Scottish Court of Session made a physical, commercial, and functional analysis of the asset being repaired relative to the totality of assets. In the Auckland Trotting Club case the Court of IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 2 (February 2000) 37 Appeal did not accept that approach (at p 976), and deliberately took a more restricted perspective. The court adopted, at p 975, the method stated by Kitto J in Lindsay v FC of T (1961) 106 CLR 377 at p 384: “where the question is whether expenditure has been for repairs, and ... one asks what is the entirety which it is relevant to consider, one is looking not for a profit-earning structure or entity, as such, but for a physical thing which satisfies a particular notion.” The Court thought, at p 976, that one indicator might be whether the entity repaired or replaced was “a part perfectly clearly divisible from the rest”; and that the answer in each case must be one “essentially of fact and of degree” (adopting dicta of Findlay J in Margrett v Lowestoft Water and Gas Co (1935) 19 TC 481 at p 488). Deane J went on to apply those principles to the deductibility of the cost of replacing the fishing boat engine: When the work done on the two vessels in the present case is viewed from the perspective of that cumulative test, and that derived earlier from sec 115(1), the nature of the expenditure seems to be tolerably clear. The motor of the “M”, in my view, was, and is, capital plant. As the source of the vessel’s motive power it was, and is, an essential, and relatively very substantial, aspect of the whole. Yet it was not, and is not, part of the fabric of the vessel. It could be detached from the vessel, independ- ently traded as a commodity, and replaced, as indeed happened. The replacement also seems to me to have been capital in nature. It was an entire substitution, an order of magnitude greater than a repair, or maintenance. There may have been no improvement in function. Indeed the replacement motor was less powerful than the first. What seems more significant to me is that the life of the new motor was expected to be, and will be, much longer than could have been achieved by repair of the old motor. Deane J concluded that the asset in question was the vessel, i.e. the engine was a part of that larger asset. He then appears to have taken three factors into account in determining whether the replacement of the engine was a capital or revenue expense, i.e. the importance of the part replaced to the operation of the whole; the size of the part as compared with the whole asset; and whether the part could be removed from the whole asset and independently traded. Applying those factors in this case: •The motor is clearly fundamentally important to the operation of the platform because it provides the power to turn the platform during milking. In this respect it seems directly analogous to an engine of a fishing vessel. However, conversely it would be correct in the case of most parts of a wider asset that they are necessary to the overall functionality of the asset in question. •The rotary platform itself is by far the largest part of the rotary system asset, i.e. the motor is a relatively small part of that asset. Deane J concluded that the engine of the vessel was “relatively substantial” as regards the whole boat. Apparently he did not require that the part under consideration should make up more than 50% of the total asset, or any other particular proportion, but that the asset must be of some reasonable size when compared to the overall size of the asset. A rotary motor is generally no bigger than one metre square, whereas a platform is at a minimum twenty metres in circumference. Therefore, in terms of sheer size, it is difficult to say that the motor makes up a relatively substantial part of the whole. In addition, the cost of replacing a rotary motor is small in comparison to the overall value of the rotary platform unit. Although, cost is not determinative of the issue, relative cost can be relevant. •The third point considered by Deane J was whether the part could be removed and independently traded. The electric motor is detachable, and would be tradeable in its own right as it could be used for various purposes. For these reasons it is considered that the replacement of the motor will generally be a revenue cost. However, the installation of a more powerful electric motor in the drive machinery to replace the old motor would constitute an improvement in the rotary platform asset, and would clearly be on capital account (Western Suburbs Cinemas and Highland Railways). In practice, the replacement of the entire drive mechanism would be less likely to occur than replacement of the motor. It is more likely that the drive mechanism would be repaired over time with replacements of subsidiary parts. The cost of such repairs and replacement parts would be deductible. However, in the event that an entire drive mechanism was replaced, the cost would be capital in nature for the same reasons referred to above in respect of the platform. Furthermore, the drive mechanism forms a larger part of the entire rotary system asset than the motor, and is a more integrated part of the rest of the system, given that the drive mechanism is connected to the platform, whereas the motor essentially stands alone. Dairy shed and yard It has been concluded that the yard and dairy shed together constitute a single asset making up the dairy shed complex. The dairy shed complex is the “premises” or “setting” where the dairy farmer’s milking operation is conducted and satisfies the “entirety test”. Repairs and/or alterations relating to the dairy shed complex asset fall into three different broad situations: Repairs to the complex resulting from fair wear and tear IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 2 (February 2000) 38 The cost of such repairs will be on revenue account, e.g. repairs to: replace a section of wire or pipe work; straighten a bent pipe, or to fix the weld or bolts which may have broken. The need or occasion calling for the expenditure will be the events arising from the daily operation of the dairy milking system. The payments do not give rise to an enduring benefit when compared to the entire complex. Complete replacement of a damaged pipe work gate leading to or from the yard or shed will also be on revenue account. Such a replacement would be a replacement of a component part of an asset. In terms of the dairy shed complex, it would be a minor part, and would be far from “a reconstruction of the whole, or substantially the whole of the asset” (Wakely and Wheeler and Auckland Trotting Club). Alterations to the shed and/or yard to extend it in size It is relatively common for dairy farmers to extend their existing dairy shed, rather than to build a completely new one when they increase the size of their herd. In a herringbone system this can be done without major reconstruction of the existing shed by simply expanding the shed to hold an increased number of cows. Generally, this involves extending the existing base of the shed at one end including the central pit, extending the existing roof to cover it, adding additional bails, and adding to the milking plant according to the number of additional cows accommodated at each cycle by the extension. As in relation to milking plant, this constitutes an improvement to the asset beyond its original state or condition. As such, and on the basis of cases such as Highland Railway, the cost would fall on capital account. It would give rise to an enduring benefit in terms of increased capacity, and would relate to the structure of the operation rather than the income earning process. Alterations to the shed and/or yard to modify the herd flow The deductibility of such costs will depend on the scale of the alterations, and will always be a question of fact and degree. If the changes made and costs involved are minimal, on the basis of the capital/ revenue tests identified in BP Australia, such costs would be revenue in nature. The focus is on improving the daily efficiencies of the milking process, rather than changing the overall structure to give rise to an enduring benefit. However, if changes are more substantial, e.g. the pipe work is completely dismantled and rearranged requiring relaying concrete to secure the new system, the cost involved would be capital in nature. In such a case the emphasis would have moved from simply improving the efficiency of the daily operation of the milking process (i.e. the income-earning process), to changing a part of the fixed assets which form the structure of the business. Whereas with minor alterations, perhaps made a number of times to reflect the changing needs of the daily operation, changes involving more substantial work are unlikely to be made on a recurring basis. Again, this is more suggestive of a capital expense, which should be added to the cost of the dairy shed structure and depreciated over time. Undergrounding the electricity supply to cowsheds Earlier it was concluded that the electricity supply lines leading to a dairy shed (and other farm buildings) are the asset against which expenditure on repairs or alterations is to be measured. Ordinary “repairs” to overhead lines This expenditure will commonly involve repairs to parts of the overhead line or lines that run from the road boundary to the dairy shed and other farm buildings, rather than renewal or replacement of the entire line. It will include, for example, mending or replacing individual power poles, cross-arms, stays, insulators, or wires where they have been damaged by storm or accident or have rotted or otherwise deteriorated over time. These costs, which have come about through ordinary “wear and tear”, will be on revenue account as they clearly satisfy the tests for deduction as an ordinary business expense. They are likely to be recurrent, and will give rise to no greater benefit than the continued efficient operation of the power reticulation system. New, renewed, or extended overhead lines Generally, cost will be on capital account if: •an entirely new overhead line is run from the farm boundary to a new dairy shed, or an old line to an existing shed is replaced (and the old line is then pulled down); or •an existing line is extended, e.g. from the site of an old to a new dairy shed. In the first situation a “new” asset has been constructed. The cost of the new line should be capitalised (and “amortised” at 10% DV in line with clause 14 of Part A to the Seventh Schedule). If the asset (the old line) has been completely replaced or “renewed” and not “repaired”, the cost should also be on capital account. This is consistent with the observations of Buckley LJ in Wakely & Wheeler: “Repair” and “renew” are not words expressive of a clear contrast. Repair always involves renewal; renewal of a part; of a subordinate part. .... Repair is restoration by renewal or replacement of subsidiary parts of a whole. Renewal, as distinguished from repair, is reconstruction of the entirety, meaning by the entirety not necessarily the whole but substantially the whole subject matter under discussion. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 2 (February 2000) 39 (These words were quoted with approval in the decision of the Court of Appeal in Auckland Trotting Club among other cases.) This situation can be distinguished from cases such as Sherlaw, and similarly from Conn v Robins Bros where significant repairs were held to be on revenue account. In that case, although the repairs were extensive, sizeable parts of the old asset remained. The extended power lines in the second situation constitute a “permanent improvement” in, or addition to, the asset. On the basis of principles established in cases such as Lindsay and Highland Railways, the cost of such an addition is not a repair and would fall on capital account. This is the position irrespective of whether the extended line results in the taxpayer deriving an increase in income (Highland Railways). It is of relevance to note that Goddard J in Hawkes Bay Power warned (at page 13,705) against any suggestion that the replacement of old overhead lines with new overhead lines simply to restore the asset to its original condition would necessarily be on revenue account. In her view this was “too one-dimensional an approach” - the issue must always be one of scale and degree. Replacing overhead lines with underground cables Usually, overhead electricity lines are replaced with an underground cable in one of two situations: •The overhead line is in a poor state of repair, e.g. partially rotted poles, and instead of replacing the poles or repairing a section of overhead line the farmer elects, or is required, to install underground cable. •The existing overhead line is susceptible to storm or other damage, and the farmer replaces it with underground cable. Where, for whatever reason, a farmer decides to replace the overhead line with an underground cable, on the basis of recent authority the cost will be on capital account. The “undergrounding” will involve the “reconstruction of the entirety” of the asset in question (the electricity supply line the farmer owns) and its replacement with a new and improved asset. In Poverty Bay Electric Power Board the Court of Appeal confirmed the earlier High Court decision of Ellis J that the cost of undergrounding power lines was on capital account. Blanchard J noted at page 15,007: .... we are satisfied that the work .... was intended to produce such a different and operationally superior asset for the Board that it is impossible to regard it as anything but a capital improvement. Nor is it possible to divide the work into capital and non-capital portions, for what was substituted underground was entirely new. Reference has already been made to the characteristics of the underground cabling which make it different from and superior to overhead lines and led to the Judge’s conclusion that the work was not repairs and maintenance. In that case the overhead lines were replaced by new and significantly different underground cables. The replacements were physically larger, of greater capacity, and otherwise operationally more efficient. The Court of Appeal found that what was achieved went well beyond restoring the old lines to an “as new” state. A similar result was reached in the earlier High Court decision in Hawkes Bay Power. Again, the court considered that the replacement of one asset with an entirely new asset would be on capital account. It is considered that the principles applied in these cases apply equally to the situation of dairy farmers who, for whatever reason, place their electricity supply underground. On the findings of the cases, it would seem irrelevant to the capital/revenue issue whether farmers have chosen freely to convert from overhead to underground systems, or have been in some way compelled to do so due to the attitude or actions of local authorities. In both cases, a new and different asset of enduring benefit to the farmer results, indicating that the expenditure is capital in nature. Summary of conclusions reached on the application of capital/revenue principles to specific assets: Milking plant •The replacement of minor items forming part of the milking plant, e.g. rubberware, pvc piping, the wash or mixing bath, and the jetter washers will be on revenue account. The same applies to the replacement of minor fittings forming part of some of the larger items, e.g. the replacement of “O” rings in a pulsator, gaskets, and other fittings forming part of the milk filter unit. •The replacement of one or all of the pulsator units will be on revenue account. The same situation arises when analogue pulsators are replaced with more modern technology in the form of an electronic system. •Given the long life of the stainless steel pipe work which forms part of a milking plant, its total replacement is unlikely to occur other than as part of an upgrade of the plant and would therefore be on capital account. The cost of repairs to parts of the piping, including the replacement of sections of pipe due to wear and tear, will be on revenue account. •The same approach applies to the milk filter, milk coolers, and the milk receiver/air IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 2 (February 2000) 40 intercepter, i.e. total replacement is unlikely to occur other than as part of an upgrade the cost of which would be on capital account. If an entire cooler should need replacing, other than as part of a general upgrade, the cost will be on revenue account. On-going servicing costs will also be deductible, as will the cost of replacing the gauze filters forming part of the milk filter unit. The same applies to the plastic covers used to cover the milk receiver and air intercepter. •The replacement of a single pump (vacuum, milklift, or water pump) forming part of the milking plant will generally be on revenue account. This result would change if the replacement involves a more powerful pump or is made as part of a programme of widespread renewal, upgrading, and/or extension of the milking plant (whether or not occurring at the same time). These factors are all indicative of the expenses being on capital account. •The situation is not as straightforward when a number of items forming part of the milking plant are replaced or repaired at, or about, the same time. By way of example, the cost of the replacement of one pump and the repair of the another will generally be on revenue account. However, the replacement of vacuum and milk pumps and the pulsator units would constitute a change to a substantial part of the milking plant and would be on capital account. •Consistent with decisions such as Case N8, costs incurred for a general upgrade of a dairy shed complex, e.g. to increase capacity, will be on capital account. •The replacement of other items of equipment situated in the dairy shed, e.g. the wash down unit; water heaters; milk storage vats; refrigeration unit; drenching system; plant wash down unit; yard wash down unit; and vat washing unit will be on capital account. The cost of repairs to these items will be deductible. Rotary platform system •The cost of repairs, not involving a replacement of the entire platform or motor/drive mechanism, will be on revenue account. Such repairs will mainly involve servicing the motor and drive mechanism. It is possible that the pipe work forming part of the platform may require minor repair work from time to time. In both cases the nature of the work reflects on-going maintenance requirements rather than a capital improvement. •The cost of replacing the entire platform will be on capital account. Such a replacement would amount to a substantial change to the asset when viewed as a whole. The likelihood of replacing the platform, other than as part of a wider upgrade of the dairy operation, is minimal as platforms are anticipated to have a long, useful life. •However, the electric motor that powers the platform may well need to be replaced over the life of the rotary system. It is considered that the cost of replacing the entire motor will be on revenue account. The replacement of the motor does not amount to a change to a substantial part of the whole. However, a replacement of the drive mechanism in its entirety will be on capital account, although it is presumed that this would be a less frequent event as the mechanism is comprised of a number of working parts that are more likely to be repaired and replaced individually over time. The on-going servicing costs of these items will be deductible. Dairy shed and yards •The cost of replacing or repairing a section of wire or pipe work will be deductible. The complete replacement of a damaged pipe work gate leading to or from the yard or shed will also be on revenue account, as will repairs to the concrete surface of the dairy shed yard. •The cost of extending the size of an existing dairy shed constitutes an improvement and will be capital in nature. •The ability to deduct the cost of alterations to the dairy shed complex to improve herd flow will be a matter of degree, i.e. minor changes will be deductible but more major alterations will be capital, e.g. if the pipe work is completely dismantled and rearranged, involving relaying concrete to secure the new system. Undergrounding the electricity supply to cowsheds •The cost of ordinary, on-going repairs to existing overhead power lines supplying power to the dairy complex will be deductible, e.g. replacing an individual pole, whereas the cost of replacing an entire overhead system with new poles and wires or extending an existing line will generally not be deductible. •Based on the decisions in Poverty Bay Electric and Hawkes Bay Power, the cost of replacing an overhead system with an underground system will be a capital expense. Recently acquired plant IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 2 (February 2000) 41 If a farmer has recently acquired a dairy farm, or secondhand milking plant or other equipment to incorporate into a dairy shed, deductibility may be affected as repairs to recently acquired assets are a special case. Repairs that may otherwise be deductible may be held to be on capital account when an asset has been acquired at a lower cost because of deferred maintenance. The Law Shipping Co Ltd v IRC (1924) 22 TC 621 (Court of Session, Scotland) concerned the purchase of a ship in need of repair. At the time the vessel was acquired it was about to sail on a freight voyage and was due for a periodical survey to ascertain its seaworthiness. Following the survey the taxpayer upgraded the ship. It was considered that most of the repairs related to the condition of the ship at the time it was purchased. The Court held that the expenditure related to the defects in the vessel at the time it was acquired and was therefore capital in nature and non- deductible. The Court also concluded that had the repair work not been required, the purchase price would have been higher. The repairs were necessary to remedy an “inherited legacy of disrepair”. Law Shipping Co was considered by the New Zealand Supreme Court in a case on appeal from the High Court of the Cook Islands: Collector of Inland Revenue, Cook Islands v AB Donald Limited \[1965\] NZLR 679. The taxpayer had purchased an ocean-going vessel, and after a short period of trading carried out substantial repairs. The issue was whether the cost of those repairs was deductible. Woodhouse J reversed the earlier decision. In his view the issue did not turn on whether the vessel could be operated immediately on purchase, but rather as to the cause of the need to repair – in this case this arose out of the operation of the vessel prior to acquisition by the taxpayer. Therefore, to the extent that the work remedied an inherited legacy of disrepair, or went beyond the restoration of wear and tear arising out of the taxpayer’s own use of the vessel, the result was an improvement, and was just as much a part of the ship’s establishment as a capital asset as the purchase price (at page 684). Another decision on this issue is Odeon Associated Theatres Limited v LJ Jones \[1972\] 1 All ER 681. That case concerned the purchase of a chain of cinemas in a relatively poor state of repair after the Second World War. The Court found that the need for repair did not affect the price paid, as the cinemas were still a fully effective profit-earning asset. Law Shipping was distinguished on the basis that here the repairs were carried out over a ten-year period. Although it was true that a portion of the expenditure had been incurred shortly after the cinemas were acquired, the repair work did not affect the use of the cinemas. The cost of the repairs was held to be deductible. These cases highlight the fact that the need for the repair work should arise out of the purchaser’s, and not the vendor’s, use of the relevant asset. If the purchase price paid for an asset is lower so as to take into account the need for immediate repair work, the cost of such repairs will be on capital account. If this were shown to be the case in the acquisition of a dairy farm, or secondhand milking plant or other equipment, the same principles would apply. Comments on technical submissions received Submissions were received on a number of the key issues addressed by this statement. These were fully considered, but not necessarily agreed with. Submissions received as regards the deductibility of the cost of replacing a rotary platform motor were taken into account resulting in the conclusion set out above that such an expense will be deductible. A number of submissions were received in relation to Example 2. These submissions were given careful consideration and resulted in the example being modified to indicate a distinction between the situation where the taxpayer chooses to replace a significant portion of the entire asset where only some of the items are in need of repair, and one where a number of individual parts are in a poor state of repair necessitating repair or replacement and the taxpayer chooses to effect such work at one time because it is convenient to do so. It will however, always be a question of fact and degree in a particular taxpayer’s case, as to whether the facts show that the expenditure is more in the nature of on-going repairs, rather than a renewal of substantially the whole. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 2 (February 2000) 42 NEW LEGISLATION INCREASE IN THE TOP PERSONAL TAX RATE These new tax rates will apply for the 2000-01 income year and subsequent income years. Extra emolument rate Section NC(2)(5) and Schedule 19 of the Income Tax Act 1994 In line with the increase in the top personal income tax rate, the top extra emolument rate for lump sum payments such as bonuses, back pay, redundancy and retirement payments will increase to 39%. This higher rate will apply if the sum of the extra emolument and the annualised value of salary or wages paid to the employee by that employer in the previous four weeks is more than $60,000. In circumstances where the higher extra emolument rate is not compulsory, an employee has the choice to elect to have the 39% rate apply to any extra emolument payments. This will ensure that taxpayers do not have an end-of-year tax liability because their extra emolument was under-deducted at source. This situation could arise if a taxpayer’s annual income was over $60,000 and he or she received an extra emolument and has other income not taxed at source. Extra emolument rates Income does not exceed $38,00021 cents Income exceeds $38,000 but does not33 cents exceed $60,000(also elective) Income exceeds $60,00039 cents (also elective) The 39% extra emolument rate will apply to extra emolument payments on or after 1 April 2000. Secondary employment earnings Section NC8 and Schedule 19 of the Income Tax Act 1994 Employees who earn secondary employment income will be able to elect a 39% PAYE withholding rate. This rate should be used by taxpayers whose annual income is more than $60,000 and who also earn secondary employment income. The ability to elect this higher rate will prevent an end-of-year tax liability if secondary employment earnings were under- deducted at source. Introduction From 1 April 2000 the top personal income tax rate will increase from 33% to 39% for income over $60,000, and the fringe benefit tax rate from 49% to 64%. Related changes will also apply to the extra emolument rate for lump sum payments, the withholding rate for secondary employment, and the resident withholding tax rate on interest. Therefore, a set of new rules for calculating provisional tax during the next two income years has been introduced to ensure that payments reflect the increased top personal income tax rate. Background Since 1 April 1990 New Zealand has had a two-step statutory income tax scale. The 1998-99 income tax year had a bottom tax rate of 19.5% on income up to $38,000 per annum and 33% on income exceeding that. Key features Increase in the top personal tax rate Schedules 1 and 19 of the Income Tax Act 1994 The statutory income tax rates for individuals (including unincorporated bodies) will be: Income not exceeding $38,00019.5 cents Income exceeding $38,000 but not33 cents exceeding $60,000 Income exceeding $60,00039 cents The effective marginal tax rates (taking into account the Low Income Rebate) will be: Income not exceeding $9,50015 cents Income exceeding $9,500 but not21 cents exceeding $38,000 Income exceeding $38,000 but not33 cents exceeding $60,000 Income exceeding $60,00039 cents IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 2 (February 2000) 43 The secondary employment earnings tax deduction codes will be as follows: Tax DeductionWithholding TaxWho Should CodeRateUse This Code “S”21 centsTaxpayers with secondary employment earning of $38,000 or less “SH”33 centsTaxpayers with secondary employment earnings whose annual income is over $38,000 but does not exceed $60,000 “ST”39 centsTaxpayers with secondary employment earnings whose annual income is over $60,000 The increased rate and the new tax deduction codes will apply to tax deducted from secondary employment earnings for pay periods ending on or after 1 April 2000. Resident withholding tax on interest Section NF2A and Schedule 14 of the Income Tax Act 1994 Section 25 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Under these changes taxpayers who earn interest will be able to elect a 39% resident withholding rate. It is expected that this rate will be used by taxpayers with income over $60,000 so that they can have the correct tax deducted at source and prevent an end-of-year tax liability. The non-declaration rate will reduce from 45% to 39% from 1 April 2000. The non-declaration rate applies to those who do not give the interest payer (such as a bank) their IRD number. For taxpayers who provide the interest payer with their IRD number but do not elect a resident withholding tax rate, the rate will be 19.5%. Resident withholding tax rates on interest Resident withholdingWho should elect to use tax ratethis rate 19.5%Taxpayers whose annual income is $38,000 or less 33%Taxpayers whose annual income is over $38,000 but does not exceed $60,000 39%Taxpayers whose annual income exceeds $60,000 39%Taxpayers who do not provide their IRD number The higher resident withholding tax rate and reduced non-declaration rate apply to interest paid on or after 1 April 2000. The rules allowing taxpayers to elect a higher resident withholding rate have been amended to cater for the election of the 39% rate. This change applies from 24 December 1999 so that interest payers can put in place systems enabling taxpayers to make elections before 1 April 2000. The rules setting out the information to be shown on resident withholding tax deduction certificates will be amended to reflect the introduction of the elective 39% resident withholding tax rate. Provisional tax Sections MB1A, MB2AA, MB2AB of the Income Tax Act 1994 Individuals and other persons to whom the individual tax rates apply (such as unincorporated bodies) who use the “uplift factor” to calculate their provisional tax will have new rules for calculating provisional tax during the 2000/01 and 2001/02 income years. This change will ensure that provisional tax payments due during these years reflect the increased tax rate and will apply to provisional taxpayers whose annual income is over $60,000. These rules will require taxpayers to calculate their residual income tax for the 1999-00 (or if the 1999-00 tax return has not been filed, the 1998-99 tax return) as if the new tax rates applied in calculating the residual income tax. If they receive beneficiary income, salary or wages or interest for which a tax credit is allowed in calculating the residual income tax, and that income would be subject to the higher tax rate (that is the amount earned from that source is over $60,000), the tax credit should be adjusted to take into account the higher tax credit. The “uplift factor” is then applied to the residual income tax calculated taking into account the new tax rates. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 2 (February 2000) 44 The following example shows the calculation that will be required to calculate the 2000-01 provisional tax using the “uplift factor”. A taxpayer has filed her 1999/00 tax return which shows an annual salary of $80,000 (PAYE $21,270) plus business profits of $20,000. Taxable income$100,000 Income tax liability using 2000/01 tax rates$30,270 ($27,870 as per tax return plus $2,400 ($40,000 x 0.06) Less tax credits ($21,270 as per tax$22,470 deduction certificate plus $1,200 ($20,000 x 0.06) Residual income tax based on 2000/01 tax$7,800 rates 2000/01 provisional tax is 105% of $7,800$8190 These rules will apply for the 2001-02 income year to taxpayers calculating provisional tax on the basis of their 1999-00 residual income tax because they have not filed their 2000-01 tax return. Taxpayers who have not filed their 1999-00 income tax return and who choose to use the “uplift factor” to calculate their provisional tax will follow the same rules as those that have filed their 1999 - 00 return but will use a 110% uplift factor instead of 105%. It is recommended that taxpayers who use the estimation option to calculate their 2000-01 provisional tax use the new rates in calculating their provisional tax to minimise their exposure to use of money interest that may be payable on any under-payment of provisional tax. These provisional tax changes may have implications for trustees of trusts in calculating 2000-01 and 2001-02 provisional tax for beneficiaries whose income from the trust is more than $60,000 and Maori authorities with less than 20 beneficiaries. These changes apply to the payment of provisional tax for the 2000-01 and 2001-02 income years. Early balance date provisional taxpayers As these changes apply for the 2000-01 income year, they will apply to payments due prior to 1 April 2000 for early balance date individual provisional taxpayers. For example: •A person with a balance date of 2 October 2000 will pay provisional tax in February 2000, June 2000 and October 2000 using the new rates. Fringe benefit tax Sections ND1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 The fringe benefit tax rate will increase from 49% to 64% for fringe benefits provided or granted on or after 1 April 2000. Because fringe benefit tax is calculated on the after-tax value of the benefit, it is grossed up to give a rate of 64% (64% = \[0.39/\[1 – 0.39\]\]). For those employers who provide fringe benefits to shareholder-employees on an income year basis, the increased rate will apply from 1 April 2000 on the annual value of the fringe benefits provided or granted in the 1999-00 or 2000-01 income year, pro-rated for the period after 1 April 2000. For example, a company has elected to pay fringe benefits provided to its shareholder-employees on an income year basis (1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000). The annual value of fringe benefits provided is $10,000. The value of the benefits pro-rated on a daily basis is as follows: Value of benefits provided or granted to 31 March 2000 (subject to tax at 49%) is $7513.66 Value of benefits provided or granted on or after 1 April 2000 (subject to tax at 64%) is $2486.34. Tax return filing Sections 33A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 The rules that govern which individuals have to file tax returns or receive income statements have been amended to reflect the increase in the threshold at which the top personal tax rate applies (from $38,000 to $60,000). New provisions require taxpayers to file a tax return or receive an income statement if their total annual income is more than $60,000 and they received interest, dividends, extra emoluments and/or secondary employment income of more than $200 that was taxed at a withholding rate of less than 39%. Application dates •Amendments to the top personal tax rates, payments of provisional tax and tax return filing requirements will apply from the 2000-01 income year. •Fringe benefit tax amendments will apply for benefits provided on or after 1 April 2000. •Amendments to secondary employment earnings will apply for pay periods ending on or after 1 April 2000 •Amendments to the extra emolument rate and resident withholding tax on interest will apply for payments made on or after 1 April 2000. However, from 24 December 1999, taxpayers can elect which rate they want to apply to their interest payments made on or after 1 April 2000. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 2 (February 2000) 45 USE OF MONEY INTEREST RATES The use of money interest rates payable on underpayments and overpayments of tax and duties are being increased in line with current market interest rates. The new rates are: •Underpayment rate: 10.84% (currently the rate is 10.59%) •Overpayment rate:4.67% (currently the rate is 3.38%) The new rates apply from 8 March 2000, the commencement date for interest relating to the third instalment of provisional tax for standard balance date taxpayers. The rates are reviewed regularly to ensure they are in line with market interest rates. They were last changed in March 1999. Changes since then have not been required because market interest rates were steady. The new rates are consistent with the 90 day bill rate and the base lending rate. The new rates were enacted by Order in Council on 31 January 2000. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 2 (February 2000) 46 USE OF MONEY INTEREST - PROVISIONAL / TERMINAL TAX PAYMENTS In the above situations the payment will firstly be applied to unpaid tax. If the payment exceeds the unpaid tax, the balance of the payment will be applied in payment of any debit UOMI. Should the payment exceed both the unpaid tax and debit UOMI, the amount by which it exceeds the unpaid tax and UOMI will be overpaid tax, for which credit UOMI will be calculated. •The payment is made after the terminal tax due date. Any payment made after the terminal tax due date will firstly be applied to any debit UOMI and then to tax. Application date The amendments to section 120L are effective from the 1998-99 income year. Section 183CA TAA allows for a cancellation of the difference between the UOMI that has been calculated for the 1997-98 year, and the amount that would be payable, had the provisions of section 120L also applied to that year. UOMI will be recalculated for the 1997-98 and 1998-99 years, applying the payments as set out above. Legislation (Sections 120F(1) and 120L(2) & (3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994) The purpose of subsections 120L(2) & (3) TAA, is to determine the amount of unpaid or overpaid tax, in respect of each instalment date, for provisional taxpayers. UOMI is calculated on the unpaid or overpaid tax. Subsection (3) allows a taxpayer, when making an income tax payment, to specify which provisional tax instalment the payment is to be applied to. If the taxpayer does not specify how the payment is to be applied, subsection (2) requires the Commissioner to apply the payment to the instalment the Commissioner considers it relates to. Introduction Inland Revenue acknowledges the major contribution from the Institute of Chartered Accountants in identifying problems with UOMI calculations, and working with us to find workable solutions. The policy intent behind use of money interest (UOMI) has always been 1 •“Interest \[UOMI\] will be calculated daily and will not compound, nor will interest be subject to late payment penalty. .......” •“Payments received will be applied to any interest owing before reducing the tax debit. .......” There have been some recent changes to section 120L TAA and also some fine tuning to the department’s FIRST system to ensure they appropriately reflect that policy intent. This has given rise to the need to correct some statements of account, via changes that are being implemented progressively from February 2000 to June 2000. Key features When a taxpayer makes an income tax payment, the total payment will be credited towards their income tax liability except in the following situations: •The taxpayer has made a payment to cover both their unpaid tax and debit UOMI, e.g. to clear their account balance within the 30 day grace period from the issue of a Notice of Assessment •Inland Revenue otherwise believes the taxpayer has made a payment intended to cover both the unpaid tax and debit UOMI, evidenced by the payment being made after their income tax return was filed and being for an amount that exceeds their terminal tax liability. 1 Taxpayer Compliance, Standards and Penalties 2, published in 1995 at paragraphs 11.09 and 11.10. GENERAL INTEREST ITEMS IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 2 (February 2000) 47 Effectively, any payment to which section 120L(2) or (3) applies must be applied at the time of payment to tax, not UOMI. Section 120F TAA sets down a priority for the payment of debit UOMI, and the Commissioner’s rights where credit UOMI has been applied to an account. Section 120F(1) requires that, where a taxpayer has unpaid tax and debit UOMI for a return period, any payment made for that tax and interest, must first be applied to the interest. Section 120L provides an override in certain circumstances. Application The provisions of subsections 120L(2) & (3) will apply to any payment of provisional tax, including voluntary provisional tax payments. Any payment made on or before the terminal tax date for the year, will be applied to unpaid/overpaid tax for the purposes of calculating UOMI. When the income tax return for the year is filed, the residual income tax for the period can be determined. A payment made after the return is filed (and on or before the terminal tax date), may result in the tax becoming overpaid. Where the tax becomes overpaid after the income tax return is filed, any accumulated debit UOMI will be collected from the overpayment (see “Payment of UOMI” below). This will deal with the situation where a payment is made for the unpaid tax and debit interest, for example within 30 days of a Notice of Assessment being issued, in order to qualify for an interest cancellation. The payment in excess of the tax will be used to pay the UOMI. The provisions of section 120F(1) will only be applied to any payment made after the terminal tax date. Any payment made after the terminal tax date, will firstly be applied to any accumulated debit UOMI. Any balance of the payment will be applied to the tax after the interest has been cleared. Payment of UOMI (Section 120G of the Tax Administration Act 1994) Section 120G TAA states: 120G PAYMENT DATE 120G Except where a tax law provides otherwise, interest payable by a taxpayer to the Commissioner on unpaid tax is payable immediately and without the need for a demand. UOMI charged on unpaid tax is payable immediately. However, unless a credit is available in the account, no steps will be taken to collect the interest until after the terminal tax date. Where, before terminal tax due date, a taxpayer has overpaid tax, as the result of a payment made after their income tax return was filed, any debit UOMI will be offset from that overpayment. If the tax has been overpaid by payments made with or before the return was filed, and the overpayment is refunded or transferred, sufficient credit will be retained to cover any debit UOMI as at the date of the refund or transfer. Any debit UOMI not satisfied after the offset of tax credits by the terminal tax date, will be collected from any subsequent payments for that period (under section 120F(1)), or by normal recovery procedures. Late payment penalties and UOMI Late payment penalties will not be charged on any debit UOMI that is not paid by the terminal tax date. Interest will not be charged on any unpaid UOMI. Calculation of UOMI The Department will calculate UOMI on a single “rolling daily balance” of unpaid or overpaid tax. The rolling daily balance will be “debited” with the residual income tax deemed due at the relevant provisional tax instalment dates. Payments will be applied to the balance at the date they are made. The amount of the payment applied to the balance is explained above. Any interest calculated will not form part of the rolling balance, but rather will accumulate as a separate balance. Offsetting debit and credit interest (Section 120F(4) of the Tax Administration Act 1994) It is possible for a taxpayer to have unpaid tax and overpaid tax at different times during the same income year. A taxpayer can therefore be both liable to pay UOMI, and entitled to receive UOMI in the same year. Where a taxpayer is liable to pay interest and entitled to receive interest in the same period, the amounts will be offset and a net interest figure will be posted to the account.

These costs are used by livestock owners to value livestock on hand at the end of the income year where the owners have adopted the national standard cost (NSC) scheme to value any class of livestock. The NSC scheme reflects the national average costs of production of various types and classes of livestock. Farmers using the scheme apply national standard costs to stock bred on the farm during the year and to immature animals on hand at the beginning of the year. Livestock they buy are valued at their purchase price. The average of these costs is used to find the closing value of livestock on hand. NATIONAL STANDARD COSTS FOR SPECIFIED LIVESTOCK DETERMINATION 2000. This determination may be cited as “The National Standard Costs for Specified Livestock Determination, 2000”. This determination is made in terms of section EL 3A of the Income Tax Act 1994. It shall apply to any specified livestock on hand at the end of the 1999-2000 income year, where the taxpayer has elected to value that livestock under the national standard cost scheme for that income year. For the purposes of section EL 3A of the Income Tax Act 1994, the national standard costs for specified livestock for the 1999-2000 income year are as set out in the following table.

NOTIFICATION OF A PENDING AUDIT OR INVESTIGATION INV-260 141G. REDUCTION IN PENALTY FOR VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE OF TAX SHORTFALL— 141G(1) A shortfall penalty payable by a taxpayer under any of sections 141A to 141E may be reduced if, in the Commissioner’s opinion, the taxpayer makes a full voluntary disclosure to the Commissioner of all the details of the tax shortfall, either— (a)Before the taxpayer is first notified of a pending tax audit or investigation (referred to in this section as “pre-notification disclosure”); or (b)After the taxpayer is notified of a pending tax audit or investigation, but before the Commissioner starts the audit or investigation (referred to in this section as “post-notification disclosure”). 141G (2) The Commissioner may from time to time— (a)Specify the information required for a full voluntary disclosure; and (b)The form in which it must be provided. 141G (3) The level by which the shortfall penalty is reduced— (a)For pre-notification disclosure is 75%: (b)For post-notification disclosure is 40%. 141G (4) A taxpayer is deemed to have been notified of a pending tax audit or investigation, or that the tax audit or investigation has started, if— (a)The taxpayer; or (b)An officer of the taxpayer; or (c)A shareholder of the taxpayer, if the taxpayer is a close company; or (d)A tax adviser acting for the taxpayer; or (e)A partner in partnership with the taxpayer; or (f)A person acting for or on behalf of or as a fiduciary of the taxpayer,— is notified of the pending tax audit or investigation, or that the tax audit or investigation has started. Introduction This Standard Practice Statement (SPS) considers the application of Section 141G of the Tax Administration Act 1994. It defines what Inland Revenue actions constitute an audit or investigation. This SPS also outlines the Commissioner’s practice when notifying a taxpayer that an audit or investigation is pending in accordance with section 141G. All legislative references are to the Tax Administration Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. Summary Any Inland Revenue examination of a taxpayer’s financial affairs verifying compliance with the tax laws is an audit. However, not all Inland Revenue contact with a taxpayer merely regarding their tax affairs will necessarily lead to an audit. Therefore when Inland Revenue is notifying a taxpayer that a tax audit or investigation is pending this fact will be clearly brought to the attention of the taxpayer. Application This SPS applies for the period from 1 st March 2000 to 1 st March 2002 Legislation A shortfall penalty payable by a taxpayer, under any of sections 141A to 141E, may be reduced in accordance with section 141G where the taxpayer makes a full voluntary disclosure to Inland Revenue regarding the details of the shortfall. If the disclosure is made before the taxpayer is first notified of a pending tax audit or investigation the penalty is reduced by 75%. Where a taxpayer makes a full voluntary disclosure after the taxpayer is notified of a pending tax audit or investigation, but before the Commissioner starts the audit or investigation, the penalty is reduced by 40%. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 2 (February 2000) 59 141G (5) An audit or investigation starts at the earlier of— (a)The end of the first interview an officer of the Department has with the taxpayer or the taxpayer’s representative after the taxpayer receives the notice referred to in subsection (4); and (b)The time when— (i) An officer of the Department inspects informa- tion (including books or records) of the taxpayer after the taxpayer receives the notice referred to in subsection (4); and (ii) The taxpayer is notified of the inspection. Background Although the compliance and penalties regime is no longer new, Inland Revenue is required to constantly review and refine its procedures to ensure that its operational practices are in line with the legislation. In some situations taxpayers have been uncertain whether contact from Inland Revenue has been notification of a pending tax audit. These cases have highlighted problems that may arise in relation to Inland Revenue’s approach to giving notification of an audit in accordance with section 141G. For example, a taxpayer may be told over the phone that Inland Revenue intends to review or check their tax affairs and, not realising the conversation to be notification of an audit, may make a voluntary disclosure expecting the full 75% pre-notification reduction in penalty. However, Inland Revenue considers the disclosure to be a post notification voluntary disclosure and grants only a 40 % reduction in penalty. Standard Practice What is an Audit? An audit is any examination of a taxpayer’s financial affairs that checks that the taxpayer has paid the correct amount of tax and is complying with the tax laws. An audit may simply be a check of a GST registration, or it may be a full examination of business records. Various types of audit activity are undertaken by Inland Revenue. These include all activities: for example income tax audits, investigations, payroll audits, GST refund checks, payroll and GST registration checks and any other type of review. Each type of audit is done differently, although the basic procedures are the same. For example, a payroll audit may take only one visit, while an investigation often takes longer and needs more work at the taxpayer’s place of business. Therefore, any Inland Revenue examination of a taxpayer’s financial affairs verifying compliance with the tax laws is an audit. For further information about audits please see the Inland Revenue pamphlet IR 297, “Inland Revenue audits, information taxpayers need about audits”. Notification of an audit Not all Inland Revenue contact with a taxpayer merely regarding their tax affairs will necessarily lead to an audit. Therefore when Inland Revenue is notifying a taxpayer that a tax audit or investigation is pending this fact will be brought clearly to the attention of the taxpayer. Inland Revenue may give verbal or written notification to a taxpayer of a pending audit or investigation. Only Inland Revenue can give a taxpayer notification of Inland Revenue’s intention to carry out an audit. The time of notification of an audit or investigation will be at the earlier of the date of receipt by the taxpayer or agent of the written advice or the time of a telephone call or visit from Inland Revenue advising that an audit is pending. Terms used when notifying a taxpayer of a pending audit or investigation Inland Revenue is not restricted by section 141G to the use of prescribed terms or phrases when notifying taxpayers that an audit or investigation is pending. While the use of the words “audit” or “investigation” when notifying a taxpayer of a pending audit is strongly recommended they are not essential. Numerous terms may be used, including, but not limited to: review, verify, check, inspection, audit or investigation, i.e. any activity that suggests that Inland Revenue intends to verify that the taxpayer has complied with their tax obligations. However, no matter what terms are used it must be clear on the face or tenor of the communication that an audit or investigation is being commenced into the affairs of the taxpayer. An audit is “pending” if Inland Revenue has decided that it will audit a taxpayer and has notified the taxpayer of that intention but that audit has not yet commenced. Notification of a pending audit is when Inland Revenue tells a taxpayer that they are definitely going to be audited. Inland Revenue may contact a taxpayer to make inquiries where it does not yet intend to audit, such as transfer pricing questionnaires or requesting information to carry out a tax “risk analysis” of a corporate. This is not notification of a pending audit, as Inland Revenue has not made a definite decision to audit that taxpayer and it is not notifying the taxpayer that an audit will be commenced. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 2 (February 2000) 60 Problems may arise where verbal notification has been given but the taxpayer disputes what they were told during the phone call or meeting. To avoid these situations Inland Revenue staff will record when notification was given. Standard Practice Statement INV-250, Voluntary Disclosures, published in the Tax Information Bulletin: Volume ten, No.3, contains further information about the making of voluntary disclosures. Also available is the Inland Revenue booklet IR282, “Putting your tax affairs right”. Details of audit required Standard Practice Statement INV-250 considers the situation where a taxpayer has been notified that a particular tax type or period of their affairs is to be audited and then makes a voluntary disclosure regarding another tax type or period for which notification of an audit has not been given. In this case the taxpayer will qualify for the pre-notification voluntary disclosure reduction in penalty for that other tax type or period. Therefore, notification of an audit will inform the taxpayer, firstly, that they are being audited and, secondly, which areas of their tax affairs are to be audited. This also means that taxpayers will be informed as to the direction and focus of an audit as it progresses. If the focus of the audit widens during the audit and other issues and periods are to be reviewed, the taxpayer will be notified of this change in scope of the audit. If Inland Revenue intends to audit all areas of a taxpayer’s tax affairs, the taxpayer will be notified accordingly. This means that any subsequent voluntary disclosure for any period or tax type would be a post-notification disclosure and a 40% reduction in penalty allowed. Making a voluntary disclosure where Inland Revenue already knows of the shortfall There are some circumstances where Inland Revenue will know that a taxpayer has not fulfilled their tax obligations therefore the taxpayer can not make a voluntary disclosure of this shortfall, as they are not telling the Department anything that it does not already know. There will not be a reduction in shortfall penalty where the taxpayer tries to make a voluntary disclosure but Inland Revenue already knows that there has been a tax shortfall and they have verification of that shortfall. For example: a registered employer has filed for the year but fails to account for PAYE. In this case the Inland Revenue system will show that the employer was meant to pay ‘x’ amount by the due date. If the employer fails to account they can not then disclose the failure to account and expect to get a reduction in penalty. Inland Revenue knows when the employer was meant to pay and how much was owed. The taxpayer can not disclose something to Inland Revenue that it already knows. Examples When a taxpayer is first notified of a pending audit: •“I intend to conduct an audit on. .... I will telephone you shortly to arrange a suitable time for the initial meeting.” • “I am ringing to advise that Inland Revenue intends to audit your...and I will be writing to you shortly about the audit.” •“I am ringing in relation to your recently filed GST return and your claim for a refund, Inland Revenue wishes to check this return before the refund is paid.” •“I am writing to inquire about a claim made in your... return” •“I am from Inland Revenue... I am a Payroll Investigator and I would like to examine your payroll records to see if you are complying.” Where taxpayer is not “notified”. •“Inland Revenue would like to visit you to discuss any issues you may wish to raise” •“Inland Revenue is likely to audit you some time in the next year as we have a high audit coverage in your industry” •“Inland Revenue would like to visit you and examine your records as part of our large company risk analysis programmes. Following the analysis this may, or may not, result in an audit. If an audit is to commence following this risk analysis I will advise you”. •Scenario - Inland Revenue makes inquiries of a head contractor and suspects an audit is needed on a subcontractor. Prior to Inland Revenue notifying the sub-contractor they are to be investigated the sub-contractor advises Inland Revenue that they intend to make a full voluntary disclosure.

We've given full references to each case, including the citation details where it has already been reported. Details of the relevant Act and section will help you to quickly identify the legislation at issue. Short case summaries and keywords deliver the bare essentials for busy readers. The notes also outline the principal facts and grounds for the decision. Where possible, we have indicated if an appeal will be forthcoming. These case reviews do not set out Inland Revenue policy, nor do they represent our attitude to the decision. These are purely brief factual reviews of decisions for the general interest of our readers. WHETHER OBJECTOR LIABLE FOR OUTPUT TAX ON THE SALE OF FARM The taxpayer’s position was that the company had purchased from unregistered vendors and made a second hand GST input claim. The Department accepted the land was not partnership property but that the objector and the trust would each be assessed with GST in respect of the sale. The taxpayer argued that all the activity regarding the 3/5 th’s interest was carried on by him in conjunction with the trust and through the partnership. The taxpayer submitted that neither partner leased nor licenced the land off the other because the partnership deed did not create a lease or licence or create a supply of the use of land. If no supply, then no taxable activity. The taxpayer submitted that at no time did he supply land, or right to use the land, to his co- owner or to the partnership. He did not carry on any activity except as a partner in the partnership. Decision Judge Barber found that in providing the partnership with land and livestock, the objector was carrying on a taxable activity and the sale was in the course or furtherance of that taxable activity. There was a supply of goods (the farming station) to the company which was from a registered person because the objector was registered for GST purposes with regard to another farming activity. It was not possible for the objector to separate his actions as a partner from his actions as a farm owner. (Case U19 (1999) 19 NZTC 9,186 at 9,193). Judge Barber found that, as in Bayly, (CIR v Bayly (1998) 18 NZTC 14,073) consideration had been provided for the act of the objector in placing his land to the use of the partnership, including, inter alia, rates and a share in partnership profits. Case:TRA Number 012/99. Decision Number 6/2000 Decision date:14 January 2000 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Keywords:Taxable activity, supply, partnership Summary Judge Barber found in essence that the landowners were de facto farming the land, and that act of farming was a taxable activity, so that the objector, as a registered person for GST purposes at the time of sale should have been assessed for output tax. Facts A substantial provincial farm station was owned by the objector farmer (“the objector”) as to 3/5 th’s and his family trust as to 2/5 th’s , as tenants in common. The objector set up a farming partnership, comprising himself and the family trust, in similar proportions as they owned the farm. A formal deed of partnership was entered into on 21 May 1977. The partnership never owned any stock (except natural accretions) until 1989, but was able to use the farm and stock. The objector was paid a wage as farm manager and shared in the net profits of the partnership. The farm was sold to the purchaser company in June 1994 and the partnership dissolved. The company shareholdings were similar to the farming partnership shares. The family trust was not registered for GST. The farmer objector was registered for GST in 1992 with another farming business enterprise. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 2 (February 2000) 63 The placement by the objector of his interest in the farm to the use of the partnership was a taxable activity for GST purposes. The objector was registered for GST purposes. That placement was a regular and continuous activity, which comes within the objector’s registration. The objector was engaged in that taxable activity prior to the sale of the property. The termination of that taxable activity upon the sale was deemed by section 6(2) to be carried out in the course of that activity. Accordingly, he was obliged to account to the Commissioner for output GST on the sale of his interest in the farming station in June 1994. WHETHER PAYMENT MADE TO TAXPAYER WAS REDUNDANCY PAYMENT OR RETIRING LEAVE Case:TRA Number 97/111. Decision Number 5/2000 Decision date:14 January 2000 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 Keywords:Redundancy v retirement payment Summary Judge Barber found that as a matter of fact, the objector was made redundant and did not retire and held that the Commissioner acted correctly in treating the ‘retiring leave’ as a ‘redundancy payment’. Facts The objector was an employee of a large company. The objector was advised by the company that his position was surplus to their requirements and was offered a redundancy package as set out in the applicable Employees Deployment Agreement. Pursuant to that agreement, the objector elected to take voluntary severance. The objector’s employment with the company ceased on 1 April 1993 and the objector received a lump sum payment on 8 April 1993. After employment ceased for the objector, a new award negotiation for the company was ratified and backdated to 1 April 1993. Pursuant to sections 21 and 46.5.4 of the new award, the objector made a request to the company for an extra entitlement payment amounting to a further 2 weeks salary for 27 years service. A further payment was made in the period 15 July 1993 and the objector received a letter from the company dated 2 August 1993 setting out the new mix of severance pay and retiring leave. The company made PAYE deductions from all the payments received by the objector at the extra emolument rates. Following assessment of the objector’s 1994 return of income for the year ended 31 March 1994 the objector considered that the company was incorrect in deducting PAYE from the retiring leave payment and sought a refund of that PAYE Decision Judge Barber found that there can be no doubt from the evidence that the objector was made redundant by the company, and his employment was severed on that basis on 1 April 1993. That was the nature of his severance from the company and it could not later be given a different character. More specifically, His Honour held that the true nature of the legal arrangements between the parties is that the payment to the objector was made under clause 46 of the first award, which dealt with employees whose positions have been declared surplus to requirements, i.e. made redundant. The objector was made redundant and in view of his past service became entitled, as a component of his voluntary severance payment, to a cash sum calculated in accordance with the scale for “retiring leave”. However, the objector did not retire. His Honour confirmed that it is the reason for termination of the employment, which determines whether concessionery tax relief is available to the objector. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 2 (February 2000) 64 The new award backdated to 1 April 1993 and the additional payments cannot change the nature of the objector’s severance from the company. Finally His Honour agreed with the Commissioner that this case falls squarely within the parameters of CIR v Lupton and is distinguishable from CIR v Cranson. LOSSES INCURRED IN FILM PARTNERSHIP INCREASED BY FRAUD Case:TRA Number 98/57. Decision Number 4/2000 Decision date:14 January 2000 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 Keywords:Improper transactions, losses from film investment Summary Judge Willy held that the Commissioner was correct in adjusting the tax losses claimed by the objector. Facts The objector was an investor in a partnership involved in the making of a film. He claimed losses from that investment in the 1982 and 1983 tax years. The Commissioner reviewed the claim and adjusted it down, but did not disallow it in its entirety. The adjustments were made because the Commissioner, after investigation, concluded that the total expenditure incurred by the Partnership was less than the amount claimed and the expenditure had been increased either by fraud or by way of an arrangement under sec 99 of the ITA 1976. The investigation revealed that certain expenditure was non-existent (alleged vehicle and film costs) and loans allegedly incurred to pay for the film were fictitious (a loan from a film company) or moved in a circle between the parties (a loan from the New Zealand Film Commission). Decision On the facts Judge Willy found a fraud had been perpetuated on the investors and the Commissioner. However, that the investors were the victims of a fraud did not enable them to claim losses not truly incurred by the partnership and the adjustments made by the Commissioner were affirmed as correct. His Honour accepted that a fraud had been perpetuated but did not accept that sec 99 was applicable where there was a fraud, as sec 99 presumes the documents and transactions entered into are genuine.

PRODUCT RULING - BR PRD 00/02 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by American Express International (NZ) Inc (“Amex”). Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section CI 2(1) and the definition of “arrangement” in section OB 1. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is that American Express corporate cardmembers participate in the American Express Membership Rewards programme (“Membership Rewards”). Under the Membership Rewards scheme, participating cardmembers earn points based on the dollar volume of their card charges. These can be redeemed for goods and services. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below: •The American Express group of companies operates a worldwide card based payment system business. As part of that business, Amex issues American Express cards which permit holders (“cardmembers”) to make purchases of goods and services with cards (“card charges”) at participating merchants worldwide and to take advantage of other valuable benefits and services. •Amex has established the American Express Corporate Card. Companies can initially apply to Amex for the right to enable their employees to apply to be Amex corporate cardmembers. If a company is approved by Amex, the company may approve employees to apply to Amex to be corporate cardmembers. If Amex approves the employee’s application, a corporate card is issued to the employee. •Amex originally designed and implemented the Membership Miles frequent flyer programme (“Membership Miles”) for all its cardmembers, under which participating cardmembers earned points based on the dollar volume of their card charges (“Amex points”) for redemption into frequent flyer programme points (“points”) of participating airlines. The converted Amex points could be combined with an individual’s existing other points with a chosen airline. Where sufficient points were accumulated (from both card spending and air travel) the individual could redeem the points for discounted or free air travel. •Amex subsequently designed and implemented Membership Rewards which replaced Membership Miles. Membership Rewards provides an expanded array of rewards, not previously available under Membership Miles, including gifts, services, dining rewards, accommodation, and outdoor experiences. Membership Rewards is available to all cardmembers, and not restricted to corporate cardmembers. •In implementing Membership Rewards, Amex notified employers of corporate cardmembers that corporate cardmembers previously enrolled in Membership Miles would automatically be enrolled in Membership Rewards. If employers did not agree with this, they could request that enrolment be terminated. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 3 (March 2000) 5 •Corporate cardmembers, not previously enrolled in Membership Miles, who wished to enrol in Membership Rewards, were required to contact Amex directly to enrol, provided they were not precluded from doing so by their employer. •Employers may decide at any time to apply for corporate cards to be issued to employees who are not already corporate cardmembers. These employees may then elect to enrol in Membership Rewards, provided their employer does not preclude them from doing so. •Companies who have not previously applied to Amex for the right to have corporate cards issued to approved employees are subject to the same joining procedure described previously in the context of Membership Miles. That is, employers can preclude employee cardmembers from participating in the Membership Rewards by indicating this on the initial company application. If employers do not preclude employees from participating, employee cardmembers are either automatically enrolled or can enrol by contacting Amex. Alternatively, employee cardmembers can elect not to participate in Membership Rewards by contacting Amex. •The introduction of Membership Rewards did not alter the contractual relationship between Amex and employee corporate cardholders, except to make available an extended array of benefits. •No enrolment fee is payable either by the company employer or the employee applicant to open a corporate card account with Amex, to use a corporate card, or to be a member of the Membership Rewards programme. An annual fee is payable by the employee cardmember for the use of the card. This fee is based on the number of corporate cards issued to employees and varies for each business. An annual fee is also paid by the employee cardholder to participate in the Membership Rewards programme. •The contract under which Amex issues corporate cards is between Amex and the employee. The employee is the “applicant” for the issue of a corporate card. The legal right to purchase goods and services using the card is the employee’s. The legal obligations in respect of card charges are primarily the employee’s. •The contractual arrangement described in the above paragraph may only give rise to obligations for the employer in some instances in the case of default of payment by corporate cardmembers. The company and employees may agree with Amex that, in the case of default: •the company and the employee are jointly and severally liable for card charges; or •the company is liable only in respect of “approved” expenditure (“limited liability”), and the employee is solely liable for the remainder; or •the employee is solely liable in respect of all card charges. •The above arrangements only apply in the case of default by employees. In the case of default, the employee remains legally liable for card charges under both joint and several liability and limited liability. The company may have a right of claim against the employee. This Ruling does not consider whether any fringe benefit (as defined in section CI 1) arises from the corporate employer agreeing in some cases that in the case of default: •The company and the employee are jointly and severally liable for card charges; or •The company is liable in respect of “approved” expenditure. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: •The same terms and conditions apply to corporate cardmembers who participate in Membership Rewards as apply to any other cardmember who participates in the programme. •The employers of employees who participate in Membership Rewards offered by Amex will not be in any way involved in negotiating with Amex the type of rewards that may be provided for or granted by Amex to the employees, or any of the terms of those rewards. •The employers will provide no consideration to Amex for offering Membership Rewards to their employees. Nor will Amex provide consideration to the employers. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 3 (March 2000) 6 •Nothing in: A. any statement made by or on behalf of Amex; B. any document or other communication between Amex and any corporate employers and or employees; C. any internal Amex documentation or communication; or D. any legally enforceable or non-enforceable documentation affecting the Arrangement - to the extent it addresses or is directly or indirectly relevant to the Arrangement as described in this Ruling between any of Amex, the corporate employers, or the employees of those corporates, will be inconsistent with the Arrangement as described in the Ruling or any materials that have been disclosed to Inland Revenue prior to this Ruling being signed. Assumption made by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following assumption: •Employers will maintain the remuneration package of any employee participating in the Membership Rewards programme to the level it would have been set at if the programme benefits were not obtained by that employee. There will be no difference between the remuneration levels of employees who participate in the Membership Rewards programme promoted by Amex and those who do not. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to the assumption stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •There is no arrangement between Amex and employers of corporate cardmembers for Amex to provide or grant benefits through the Membership Rewards programme to the corporate cardmembers. •For the purposes of the FBT rules (as defined in section OZ 1(1)), section CI 2(1) will not apply to the entitlement of benefits received by corporate cardmember employees under the Membership Rewards programme. •Accordingly, employers of corporate cardmembers are not liable for FBT on any benefits which employees may obtain through the Membership Rewards programme. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2002. This Ruling is signed by me on the 13th day of January 2000. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 3 (March 2000) 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 3 (March 2000) 8 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS This section of the TIB contains interpretation statements issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. These statements set out the Commissioner’s view on how the law applies to a particular set of circumstances when it is either not possible or not appropriate to issue a binding public ruling. In most cases Inland Revenue will assess taxpayers in line with the following interpretation statements. However, our statutory duty is to make correct assessments, so we may not necessarily assess taxpayers on the basis of earlier advice if at the time of the assessment we consider that the earlier advice is not consistent with the law. TRANSFERABLE TERM FISHING QUOTA – ACQUISITION AND CONVERSION: SECTIONS 104, 104A, 106, AND 107A, INCOME TAX ACT 1976 •If a TTQ is able to be depreciated, is the conversion of a TTQ to an ITQ a “disposal” in terms of the Act? Background By the early 1980s, fishing pressure had reduced the size of a number of New Zealand’s major fisheries stocks. The Quota Management System (“QMS”) was introduced in 1986 through amendments to the Fisheries Act 1983. The aim of the QMS was to conserve major fisheries’ stocks and improve the economic efficiency of the industry. Fish species are managed under the QMS through ITQ. An ITQ is the right to catch a specified quantity of quota species each fishing year within a Quota Management Area (“QMA”), in perpetuity. Due to the many Maori claims pending in relation to the various fisheries, Government agreed that for spiny rock lobster (Jasus edwardsii) and packhorse rock lobster (Jasus verreauxi), transferable term quota would be allocated instead of individual transferable quota. This necessitated the removal of the existing quota in respect of rock lobster from an ITQ and putting these into a separate category of their own, being TTQ. Rock lobsters were the only species of fish subject to the TTQ system. The original allocation of TTQ was made by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (“MAF”), in most instances at no cost to the holder. TTQ were subsequently traded on the open market. TTQ were first introduced as from 1 April 1990 under the Fisheries Amendment Act 1990 (No.2). Legislation provided for TTQ to have a term life of 25 years expiring on 31 March 2015. This prevented further Summary All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1976 unless otherwise stated. This interpretation statement sets out the Commissioner’s view on how the cost of a Transferable Term Fishing Quota (“TTQ”) is to be treated for income tax purposes. The main focus is first, whether the cost of acquiring a TTQ is deductible, and secondly whether a TTQ is “depreciable property” within the definition provided for in the Income Tax Act 1976 (“the Act”). This statement concludes that any expenditure incurred in acquiring a TTQ is not deductible under section 104 as the expenditure is capital expenditure under section 106(1)(a). As expenditure is not deductible under section 104, the provisions of section 104A will not apply. It has also been concluded that a TTQ is “depreciable property”, being fixed life intangible property, by virtue of it being “a right to use land” within the 22nd Schedule of the Act. When a TTQ is converted to an Individual Term Quota (“ITQ”), it is not a “disposal” for the purposes of section 117(10). The issues The issues considered in this interpretation statement are: •Is the acquisition of a TTQ (at a cost) deductible expenditure, and if so, can the cost be amortised. If not, what is the correct treatment of the expenditure? •Is a TTQ a “right to use land” within the 22nd Schedule and therefore able to be depreciated? IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 3 (March 2000) 9 allocations being made on a permanent basis before the Crown and Maori reached final agreement on a Deed of Settlement for all commercial fishing claims. It was envisaged that this would allow sufficient time for Maori grievances to be settled while not detrimentally affecting the catching capabilities of the commercial fishery. As from 1 October 1996, TTQ and the relevant interests attached to them were converted to ITQ. No compensatory payments were made in respect of the conversion. As TTQ were, in most instances, originally allocated to holders at no cost, the issues in this statement relate solely to TTQ acquired at a cost, which, in most instances therefore, will be acquisitions subsequent to that initial allocation. The TEO (in newsletter No 45 (20 September 1991)), stated that the Department’s policy (Technical Rulings Para 20.14.6.6) was to treat payments in relation to TTQ as a lease and allow the amount paid for the quota to be amortised over the time TTQ was held. Owing to some interpretative difficulties arising in practice, this statement aims to clarify the law as it relates to the acquisition and subsequent conversion of TTQ. Legislation Income Tax Act 1976 Section 104 states: In calculating the assessable income of any taxpayer, any expenditure or loss to the extent to which it- (a)Is incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income for any income year; or (b)Is necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purposes of gaining or producing the assessable income for any income year- may, except as otherwise provided in this Act, be deducted from the total income derived by the taxpayer in the income year in which the expenditure or loss is incurred. Section 104A states: (1) For the purposes of this section- “Accrual expenditure”, in relation to any person, means any amount of expenditure incurred on or after the 1st day of August 1986 by the person that is deductible under this Act other than expenditure incurred- (a)In respect of trading stock; or (b)In respect of any financial arrangement; or (c)In respect of a lease to which section 222A to 222D or section 222E of this Act apply; or (d)Pursuant to a binding contract entered into before 8:30 p.m. New Zealand Standard Time on the 31st day of July 1986: (2) The amount of the unexpired portion (if any) of any amount of accrual expenditure of any person to be taken into account in any income year shall be- (a)Where the expenditure relates to the purchase of goods, the amount of expenditure incurred on goods not used in the production of assessable income: (b)Where the expenditure relates to payment for services, the amount of expenditure incurred on services not performed: (ba)Subject to subsection (2B) of this section, where the expenditure is incurred by way of monetary remu- neration for services that have been performed, the amount of such expenditure that has not been paid in the income year or within such further period as is specified in subsection (2A) of this section: (c)Where the expenditure relates to a payment for, or in relation to, a chose in action, the amount that relates to the unexpired part of the period in relation to which the chose is enforceable. (3) Where any person has incurred any accrual expenditure, that expenditure shall be deductible when it is incurred in accordance with the provisions of this Act but the unex- pired portion (if any) of that expenditure shall be taken into account in ascertaining the assessable income of the person for the income year in which that expenditure is incurred and subsequent income years. (4) The amount of the unexpired portion of any amount of accrual expenditure of any person at the end of an income year shall be included in the assessable income of the person for the income year and such amount shall be deductible in the following year. Section 106(1) states: Notwithstanding anything in section 104 of this Act, in calculating the assessable income derived by any person from any source, no deduction shall, except as expressly provided in this Act, be made in respect of any of the following sums or matters: (a)Investment, expenditure, loss, or withdrawal of capital; money used or intended to be used as capital; money used in the improvement of premises occupied; interest which might have been made on any such capital or money if laid out at interest; the acquisition price of any financial arrangement (as defined in section 64B(1) of this Act) to which sections 64B to 64M of this Act applies: Provided that this paragraph shall not deny a deduction in respect of any amount of expenditure deemed to be expenditure pursuant to sections 64B to 64M of this Act: Section 111 states: (1) Where a taxpayer has acquired any property from an associated person (as defined in section 245B of this Act) entitled to a deduction in respect of the depreciation of the property, irrespective of whether or not any deduction has in fact been allowed to that associated person, the Commis- sioner shall not allow to the taxpayer any greater deduction in respect of the depreciation of the property than that which would have been allowed to the associated person if the associated person had retained the property: IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 3 (March 2000) 10 Provided that where any amount so allowed as a deduction to the associated person has been dealt with under section 117 of this Act, the Commissioner may allow to the taxpayer a deduction in respect of the depreciation of the property based on the aggregate of the total of all amounts so dealt with and the amount of that depreciated value of the property immediately before it was acquired by the taxpayer. (2) This section shall not apply where the Commissioner is of the opinion that the circumstances are such that a deduction in respect of the depreciation of the property based on the actual price or other consideration given for the property should be allowed. Section 117(7) states: Subject to this Act, where any depreciable property has been disposed of— (a)Other than in accordance with a matrimonial agreement; and (b)Along with any other property; or (c)For a consideration that the Commissioner believes is not the market value; or (d)In accordance with subparagraph (ii) or subparagraph (iii) of paragraph (a) of the definition of the term “disposal” in subsection (10) of this section,— the Commissioner shall deem the property to have been disposed of for a consideration equal to the property’s market value or, if the market value cannot be ascertained, for a consideration specified by the Commissioner. “Annual depreciation rate” is defined in section 107A(1) as: “Annual depreciation rate”, or “annual rate”, in relation to any depreciable property of a taxpayer, is the rate applying in respect of that property and that taxpayer pursuant to— (a)Section 108G of this Act, in the case of fixed life intangible property (not being excluded depreciable property): (b)Section 108H of this Act, in the case of excluded depreciable property: (c)Section 108D of this Act, in the case of other depreciable property acquired before the end of the taxpayer’s 1994-95 income year: (d)Section 108E of this Act, in the case of international aircraft acquired in the taxpayer’s 1995-96 income year or any subsequent year: (e)Section 108F of this Act, in the case of other depreciable property acquired in the taxpayer’s 1995- 96 income year or any subsequent year: The annual depreciation rate for fixed life intangible property in section 108G states: The annual depreciation rate for any fixed life intangible property of a taxpayer (not being excluded depreciable property) shall be the rate, expressed as a decimal and rounded to two decimal places (with numbers at the midpoint or greater being rounded up and other numbers being rounded down), calculated in accordance with the following formula: 1 legal life where “legal life” means the legal life of the property at the time at which it was acquired by the taxpayer. “Depreciable intangible property” is defined in Schedule 22 as being the following: 1.The right to use a copyright. 2 .The right to use a design or model, plan, secret formula or process, or other like property or right. 3.A patent or the right to use a patent. 4 .The right to use land. 5.The right to use plant or machinery. 6.The copyright in software, the right to use the copyright in software, or the right to use software. 7.The right to use a trademark. 8 .Management rights and licence rights created under the Radiocommunications Act 1989. “Depreciable property” is defined in section 107A(1) as: “Depreciable property” in relation to any taxpayer, - (a)Means any property of that taxpayer which might reasonably be expected in normal circumstances to decline in value while used or available for use by persons - (i) In gaining or producing assessable income; or (ii) In carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing income; but (b)Does not include - (i) Trading stock (as defined in section 85(1) of this Act) of the taxpayer: (ii)Land (excluding buildings and other fixtures and such improvements as are listed in the Twenty- first Schedule to this Act): (iii) Financial arrangements, as defined in section 64B of this Act: (iv)Intangible property other than intangible property which is of a type listed in the Twenty- second Schedule to this Act, which Schedule describes intangible property that has – (A) A finite useful life that can be estimated with a reasonable degree of certainty on the date of its creation or acquisition; and (B) If made depreciable, a low risk of being used in tax avoidance schemes: (iva)Property which the taxpayer has elected to treat as low value property under section 108O of this Act: (v) Property the cost of which is deductible under any of sections 104, 127, 131, 134 to 139, 142, 143, and 214F of this Act, or by virtue of an amortisation or other similar deduction available under any section of this Act (such as sections 128A, 128B, 128C, 144, and 222E) other than sections 108 to 108N and section 113A: IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 3 (March 2000) 11 (vi)Property which will not, in respect of the taxpayer, decline in value as a result of any right of the taxpayer to receive any compensation for any such decline in value on disposition of such property: “Disposal” is defined in section 117(10) as: (a)Includes— (i) The acquisition of property of a taxpayer by any person empowered to do so by statutory authority: (ii)Ceasing to use in New Zealand and taking out of New Zealand for use outside New Zealand any property of a taxpayer in respect of which a first-year allowance has been granted under section 112 of this Act (other than under subsection (8) of that section), except where the Commissioner is satisfied that - (A) The property has been taken out of New Zealand only temporarily; and (B) The property will, after its return to New Zealand, be used in or for the purpose of a business in New Zealand: (iii) In any income year, any change of use, or change of location of use, occurring in a preceding income year, as a consequence of which the application of section 108A of this Act gives rise to a nil deduction on account of depreciation for that subsequent income year, in which case the property shall be deemed to have been disposed of on the first day of that subsequent income year and no deduction on account of depreciation shall be claimed in that subsequent income year: (iv) Any event whereby the rights which constitute or are part of an item of intangible property will no longer be able to be exercised, at any time, by the taxpayer who owns that property: (v) Any event as a consequence of which the property is irreparably damaged; but (b)Does not include, in the case of intangible property, the disposal of that property as part of an arrange- ment to replace it with property of the same type. “Excluded depreciable property” is defined in section 107A(1) as: “Excluded depreciable property” means, in respect of any taxpayer, any depreciable property- (a)That was used or was available to be used by the taxpayer for any purpose whatever within New Zealand, other than as trading stock, before the 1st day of April 1993; or (b)For which a binding contract for its purchase or construction was entered into by the taxpayer before the 16th day of December 1991; or (c)That is or has been in respect of the taxpayer a qualifying asset within the meaning of section 108N (1) of this Act; or (d)To the extent that the property is or has been in respect of the taxpayer a qualifying improvement within the meaning of section 108N of this Act; or (e)That is an intangible asset that was used or was available for use by the taxpayer before the 1st day of April 1993;- but does not include any item of property in existence at the end of the 1992-93 income year that was permitted by the Commissioner to be accounted for in that income year using any of the standard value, replacement value, or annual revaluation methods: “Fixed life intangible property” is defined in section 107A(1) as: any intangible property that- (a)Is depreciable property; and (b)Has a legal life which could reasonably be expected, on the date of the creation or acquisition of the property, to be the same as the property’s remaining estimated useful life. “Legal life” is defined in section 107A(1) as: “Legal life”, in respect of any intangible property and the owner of that property, means the number of years and any monthly fraction thereof that the property may remain or continue to remain in existence by virtue of the contract or statute that creates the property for the owner assuming any rights of renewal or extension that are essentially unconditional, or conditional on the payment of pre- determined fees, are exercised: Fisheries Act 1983 “Transferable term quota” is defined in section 2 of the Fisheries Act 1983 as: means quota that confers on the holder the right to take rock lobster at any time in the period of 25 years beginning on the 1st day of April 1990 (being quota that may be transferred as if it were individual transferable quota allocated under Part IIA of this Act). Section 28BA(1) states: The taking of rock lobster in the quota management areas described in the Third Schedule to the Maori Fisheries Act 1989 is hereby declared to be subject, for the period of 25 years beginning on the 1st day of April 1990, to the quota management system established under this Part of this Act. Section 28OA(3) further describes a TTQ by saying: Subject to subsection (4) of this section \[which requires a fishing permit to be held\], each transferable term quota shall enable the holder, or if there is more than one holder, the combined holders, and any lessee or lessees of the rights to take rock lobster under the quota, to take in total within the quota management area concerned in any year rock lobster, or rock lobster of the species shown in the quota, up to a tonnage shown in the quota. Section 334 of the Fisheries Act 1996 states: (1) All transferable term quota (within the meaning of the Fisheries Act 1983) that- (a)Was owned by any person immediately before the commencement of this section; and IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 3 (March 2000) 12 (b)Relates to packhorse rock lobster or spiny rock lobster in a particular quota management area- is hereby declared to be individual transferable quota under Part IIA of that Act for the species in that quota management area. (2) The conversion of quota by subsection (1) of this section does not constitute an allocation of new quota for the purposes of any enactment or rule of law. (3) All quota allocated under section 28OA of the Fisheries Act 1983 after the commencement of this subsection, as a result of an appeal to which section 335(1) of this Act applies, shall be allocated in the form of individual transfer- able quota under Part IIA of the Fisheries Act 1983. (4) All individual transferable quota to which this section applies shall be perpetual even though it has been converted from quota that has been declared by section 28BA of the Fisheries Act 1983 to be subject to the quota management system established under the Act for a period of 25 years commencing on the 1 st day of April 1990. (5) For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared that sections 28E and 28OE(1)(a) of the Fisheries Act 1983 do not apply and have never applied to transferable term quota under the Fisheries Act 1983 or to individual transferable quota for rock lobster created under this section. \[Emphasis added\] “Territorial Sea” is defined in the Territorial Sea, Contiguous Zone and Exclusive Economic Zone Act 1977 as: In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires; The territorial sea of New Zealand comprises those areas of the sea having, as their inner limits, the baseline described in sections 5 and 6 \[and 6A\] of this Act and, as their outer limits, a line measured seaward from that baseline, every point of which line is distant 12 nautical miles from the nearest point of the baseline. And section 7 of the above Act states: Subject to the grant of any estate or interest therein (whether by or pursuant to the provisions of any enactment or otherwise, and whether made before or after the commencement of this Act), the seabed and subsoil of submarine areas bounded on the landward side by the low- water mark along the coast of New Zealand (including the coast of all islands) and on the seaward side by the outer limits of the territorial sea of New Zealand shall be deemed to be and always to have been vested in the Crown. The “Continental Shelf” is defined in the Continental Shelf Act 1964 as: The seabed and subsoil of those submarine areas that extend beyond the territorial limits of New Zealand, throughout the natural prolongation of the land territory of New Zealand, to the outer edge of the continental margin, or to a distance of 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured (as described in sections 5 and 6 \[and 6A\] of the Territorial Sea and Economic Zone Act 1977) where the outer edge of the continental margin does not extend to that distance. Section 3 of the same Act states: All rights that are exercisable by New Zealand with respect to the continental shelf and its natural resources for the purpose of exploring the shelf and exploiting those resources are hereby vested in the Crown. Application of the Legislation Is the cost of acquiring a TTQ deductible? Various possible interpretations exist as to the correct treatment of the cost of a TTQ. One interpretation is that the cost may be fully deductible under section 104. If this is so, then the amount paid for the TTQ would be either deductible in full in the year of expenditure, or, more likely, able to be amortised over the period it is held, in terms of section 104A. This section 104A interpretation would also mean that, on the disposition of a TTQ, any unexpired portion of expenditure, as at the date of conversion to an ITQ, would not be required to be added back as income under section 104A(4). The effect of this interpretation would be that a deduction for the full amount of the acquisition cost has been made. A second interpretation is that the cost of a TTQ is not fully deductible in terms of section 104 because it is capital expenditure in terms of section 106(1)(a). In this situation, the cost of a TTQ cannot be amortised over the period it is held, under section 104A, and, ordinarily, any loss incurred by the taxpayer on the disposition of a TTQ will be a capital loss. This interpretation would also mean that there is no unexpired portion of expenditure as at the date of conversion. NOTE: If a taxpayer was buying and selling TTQ as part of a business activity, e.g. dealers, traders etc., the treatment of the costs of acquiring TTQ is likely to be different. Thirdly, if a TTQ is considered to be a capital asset in terms of section 106(1)(a), it may be able to be depreciated. General capital v revenue principles In CIR v Thomas Borthwick & Sons (1992) 14 NZTC 9,101, Richardson J described the governing approach to the capital/revenue distinction to be the observations of Lord Pearce in BP Australia Ltd v FCT (\[1966\] AC 224). In BP Australia the general approach to the question of whether a payment is a capital or revenue expense was outlined by Lord Pearce at p.264: The solution to the problem is not to be found by any rigid test or description. It has to be derived from many aspects of the whole set of circumstances some of which may point in one direction, some in the other. One consideration may point so clearly that it dominates other and vaguer IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 3 (March 2000) 13 indications in the contrary direction. It is a commonsense appreciation of all the guiding features which must provide the ultimate answer. Although the categories of capital and income expenditure are distinct and easily ascertainable in obvious cases that lie far from the boundary, the line of distinction is often hard to draw in border-line cases; and conflicting considerations may produce a situation where the answer turns on questions of emphasis and degree. That answer: “depends on what the expenditure is calculated to effect from a practical and business point of view rather than upon the juristic classification of the legal rights, if any, secured employed or exhausted in the process” (per Dixon J. in Hallstroms Pty. Ltd. v F.C. of T. (1946) 72 C.L.R. 634 at p.648). In BP Australia, Lord Pearce applied the tests formulated in Sun Newspaper Limited and Associated Newspapers Ltd v FCT ((1939) 61 CLR 337) to determine whether payments made by BP to secure trade tie agreements were capital or revenue. In that decision Dixon J set out three important matters to take into account, namely: •the character of the advantage sought, and in this its lasting qualities may play a part; •the manner in which it is to be used, relied upon or enjoyed, and in this and under the former head recurrence may play its part; and •the means adopted to obtain it; that is, by providing a periodical reward or outlay to cover its use or enjoyment for periods commensurate with the payment or by making a final provision or payments so as to secure future enjoyment. In CIR v LD Nathan & Co Ltd (\[1972\] NZLR 209) the taxpayer company claimed a deduction for the payment of goodwill which had been made in the course of a take-over of another company. The Court of Appeal rejected the claim on the ground that a payment for goodwill is an outgoing of a capital nature. North P identified six tests applicable in border line cases, which have been enunciated in a number of the leading decisions, namely: •the tests of recurrence; •the distinction between fixed and circulating capital; •the distinction between the business entity or structure or the profit-yielding subject as contrasted with the process by which it operates or is operated in order to obtain regular returns by means of regular outgoings or outlays; •whether the expenditure was made not only once and for all but with a view to bringing into existence an asset or advantage for the enduring benefit of a trade; •whether the expenditure is an ordinary expenditure of the regular conduct of the business or an organisation for earning profits; and •the nature of the asset obtained or sought in which its enduring character may play a part. North P delivered the judgment of the Court, and in the course of his judgment his Honour said at p.215: In this case a good deal was made of the fact that the import licences held by Entricans were reviewed each year and a purchaser would have no assurance that the licences would be renewed or indeed that the categories therein mentioned would not be altered or indeed substantially reduced. Likewise, there was no guarantee that Entrican’s customers would be willing to do business with Nathans and therefore it was argued there was no certainty of Nathans deriving an enduring benefit from the contract. In my opinion, there is no substance whatever in either of these contentions. I cannot do better than adopt the words of Rich J in the well known Australian case, Sun Newspaper Limited and Associated Newspapers Ltd v FCT (1939) 61 CLR 337: “The purpose (of the payment) was to buy opposi- tion and secure so far as possible a monopoly. The fact that the benefit was not perpetual does not deprive it of its capital attributes. If physical assets of a terminating or wasting description were bought, no one would say on that account that the money was a revenue expenditure.” In the Commissioner’s view, TTQ are the business structure from which any income would be derived. The ability to derive income from a rock lobster operation is only possible by virtue of the taxpayer being in possession of a TTQ. The acquisition cost of a TTQ is a once-only expenditure which brought into existence an asset for the enduring benefit of a trade. The fact that TTQ were not perpetual and only had a limited life of 25 years does not mean that TTQ were not capital in nature (CIR v LD Nathan). Those receiving a TTQ are receiving a valuable right that is clearly providing an enduring benefit to the business. On this basis, it is considered that, because a TTQ is a capital asset, the expenditure in acquiring a TTQ is expenditure of a capital nature and is precluded from deduction under section 104 by virtue of section 106(1)(a). As a result of this conclusion, the cost of a TTQ cannot be amortised under section 104A, because section 104A only applies where expenditure is ordinarily deductible under the Act (whereas TTQ are capital in nature). Is a TTQ “depreciable property”? The current depreciation regime was introduced into the Income Tax Act 1976 as taking effect from the 1993/ 1994 income year. Included as part of the regime were certain types of intangible assets, listed in the 22nd Schedule. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 3 (March 2000) 14 Prior to the current depreciation regime, no provision was made for the depreciation of intangible property of any kind. The ability to depreciate intangible property that existed before the new regime was introduced is denied by the definition of “excluded depreciable property”, as provided for at section 107A, which specifically excludes depreciable property used or available to be used prior to 1 April 1993. Depreciation on intangible assets only applies to those assets acquired after 1 April 1993. As TTQ were first created in 1990, it is only those TTQ acquired after 1 April 1993 that would meet the “depreciable property” definition. To come within the definition of “depreciable property”, the following criteria need to be satisfied: •The property is depreciable intangible property of a type within the 22nd Schedule •The property might reasonably be expected, in normal circumstances, to decline in value while used or available for use; and •The property has been used in deriving gross income; or •The property has been used in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income. The intangible property listed in the 22nd Schedule is as follows: 1.The right to use a copyright. 2 .The right to use a design or model, plan, secret formula or process, or other like property or right. 3.A patent or the right to use a patent. 4 .The right to use land. 5.The right to use plant or machinery. 6.The copyright in software, the right to use the copyright in software, or the right to use software. 7.The right to use a trademark. 8 .Management rights and licence rights created under the Radiocommunications Act 1989. 9.A consent granted under the Resource Management Act 1991 to do something that otherwise would contravene sections 12 to 15 of that Act (other than a consent for a reclamation), being a consent granted in or after the 1996-97 income year. 10.The copyright in a sound recording, if the copyright was produced or purchased by the taxpayer on or after 1 July 1997, and copies of the recording have been sold or offered for sale to the public. A fishing quota provides the owner with the right to catch a defined percentage of the Total Allowable Commercial Catch and therefore potentially, the only category from this schedule which could be considered to apply to fishing quota, is the “right to use land”. Is the use of fishing quota the “right to use land” within the 22 nd Schedule? In order to be depreciable property, a TTQ must be depreciable intangible property and therefore it must come within Schedule 22, i.e. it must be the right to use land. Rock lobster, which are the only species of fish subject to the TTQ system, are generally sourced from an area close to the foreshore and are largely found in and around rocks, which are on the sea-bed. They may be collected in any one of three ways: by diving, potting and hand-gathering, but generally, the most favoured is the potting method, which results in the largest catches. Potting takes place in areas where the rocks are easily reached for the purpose of placing pots. Therefore, it is necessary to decide whether the right to use the sea-bed in the area where the lobster are located constitutes a right to use land. Neither “right to use land” nor “land” are defined in the Act for the purposes of Schedule 22. “Land”, however, is defined in section 67 in relation to profits or gains from land transactions as: (a)Any estate or interest in land, whether legal or equitable, corporeal or incorporeal, freehold or chattel; and (b)Any option to acquire land and any such estate or interest in land;- but does not include a mortgage. This definition relates to interests, and in this respect is concerned with the “rights” in land, not what things are considered to actually be land for the purposes of TTQ. We are concerned with what goes to make up land, that is, its composition and in this regard, this definition provides no assistance. “Land” is also defined in a number of other Acts, e.g. Marine Farming Act 1971, Resource Management Act 1991, Foreshore and Seabed Endowment Revesting Act 1991, that are consistent with an interpretation that land includes the seabed. These definitions, however, are only defined for purposes of those particular Acts – they are not specifically shown to apply for tax purposes. In the absence of a specific definition of “land” in the Income Tax Act stating what land includes or is composed of, and the fact that the definitions in other legislation apply only to those particular Acts, it is necessary to consider the common law meaning of “land” as to whether the rights in waters include rights to the land below them. If, therefore, it can be established in common law that these rights extend to IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 3 (March 2000) 15 include that land beneath the water, then, by analogy, any right the Crown has granted to fish in a particular area of water will also include a corresponding right to use or take from the land. Case law on water rights A number of cases have considered water rights and whether these extend to include the land below the water. In Attorney General for the Province of British Columbia v Attorney General for the Dominion of Canada \[1914\] AC 153, the Privy Council had to consider whether the legislature of British Columbia could authorise the Government of the Dominion to grant fishing leases and licenses in both tidal and non- tidal waters, and below the low water mark and in parts of the open sea. Therefore, the case concerned the authority of the legislature of British Columbia. The legislature of British Columbia had granted to the Government of the Dominion a strip of land known as the railway belt. This railway belt included both tidal and non-tidal waters. In discussing what had passed under the grant of the railway belt, the Privy Council said at pp.167-168: \[Their Lordships\] are unable to see any ground for constru- ing the grant of the railway belt as excluding such lands situated within it as are covered with water. The solum (ground) of a river bed is a property differing in no essential characteristic from other lands..... ...In the present case, therefore, their Lordships entertain no doubt that the title to the solum and the water rights in the Fraser and other rivers and lakes so far as within the belt are at present held by the Crown in right of the Dominion, and that this title extends to the exclusive management of the land and to the appropriation of its territorial revenues. It remains to consider the conse- quences as regards fishing rights. These are, in their Lordships opinion, the same as in the ordinary case of ownership of a lake or river bed. The general principle is that fisheries are in their nature mere profits of the soil over which the water flows, and that title to a fishery arises from the right to the solum. A fishery may of course be severed from the solum, and then it becomes a profit a prendre in alieno solo and an incorporeal heriditament.....But apart from the existence of such severance by grant or prescription the fishing rights go with the property in the solum. The authorities treat this broad principle as being of general application. They do not regard it as re- stricted to inland or non-tidal waters. They recognise it as giving to the owners of land on the foreshore or within an estuary or elsewhere where the tide flows and reflows a title to fish in the waters over such lands, and this is equally the case whether the owner be the crown or a private individual. But in the case of tidal waters (whether on the foreshore or in estuaries or tidal rivers) the exclusive character of the title is qualified by another and paramount title which is prima facie in the public. \[emphasis added\] Their Lordships went on to say (at p.171): It follows from these considerations that the position of the rights of fishing in the rivers, lakes, and tidal waters (whether in rivers and estuaries or on the foreshore) within the railway belt stand prima facie as follows: In the non- tidal waters they belong to the proprietor of the soil, i.e. the Dominion, unless and until they have been granted by it to some individual or corporation. In the tidal waters, whether on the foreshore or in creeks, estuaries, and tidal rivers, the public have the right to fish, and by reason of the provisions of the Magna Carta no restriction can be put upon that right of the public by an exercise of the preroga- tive in the form of a grant or otherwise. It will of course be understood that in speaking of this public right of fishing in tidal waters their Lordships do not refer in any way to such fishing by kiddles, weirs, or other engines fixed to the soil. Such methods of fishing involve a use of the solum which, according to English law, cannot be vested in the public, but must belong to the Crown or some private owner. The Privy Council drew a distinction between tidal and non-tidal waters. Non-tidal waters are those such as lakes, rivers and other inland waterways, excluding those parts of rivers and other waterways which meet the sea, and as such, are tidal. Tidal waters include these areas where non-tidal waters meet tidal waters, at the mouths of streams and in estuaries, as well as the sea coast. The open seas appear to fall into a separate category. It held that, in respect of non-tidal waters, the right to grant fishing rights is a property right, and as such, exists with the owner of the underlying land. It is a private property right. In the case of rivers, this may well exist with private individuals, but in the case of lakes, the title to the underlying land is typically reserved to the Crown. On the particular facts of the British Columbia case, this meant that the right was a property right over which the Government of British Columbia had exclusive authority, except that the Government of British Columbia had specifically granted ownership of the particular land in question back to the Government of the Dominion. In respect of tidal waters, Viscount Haldane said: But in the case of tidal waters (whether on the foreshore or in estuaries or tidal rivers) the exclusive character of the title is qualified by another and paramount title which is prima facie in the public...... So far as the waters are tidal the right of fishing in them is a public right subject only to regulation by the Dominion Parliament. In respect of the rights relating to the open seas, the Privy Council said that it did not propose to express an opinion on the question of whether the Crown has a right of property in the bed of the sea below low water mark. However, it went on to say (at p.173): Their Lordships have already expressed their opinion that the right of fishing in the sea is a right of the public in general which does not depend on any proprietary title, and that the Dominion has the exclusive right of legislating with regard to it. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 3 (March 2000) 16 In re Ninety-Mile Beach \[1963\] NZLR 461, the New Zealand Court of Appeal considered whether the Maori Land Court had jurisdiction to consider claims over the foreshore. The Court of Appeal did not actually consider whether the foreshore was land, but it is implicit from their discussions that they clearly considered it to be so. The following are some examples: ...the question we are asked to consider in this appeal is whether the jurisdiction of the Maori Land Court to investigate the title to customary land and to issue freehold orders in respect thereof extends to the investigation of title to and the issue of freehold orders in respect of land lying between mean high water mark and mean low water mark... (p.466). The main submission made by the Solicitor General was that on the assumption of sovereignty by her majesty Queen Victoria, the foreshore of the lands of New Zealand including the land in question became and has ever since remained vested in the Crown, and that the Maori Land Court-as it is now called- has not and never did have jurisdiction to investigate the title to land below the high water mark. (p.467) Has the Maori Land Court jurisdiction to investigate title to, and to issue freehold orders in respect of the foreshore- namely that part of the land which lies between the mean high water mark and the mean low water mark? (p.474) The facts were that on 13 December 1864 the Crown had made a grant of land on the foreshore at Timaru down to the low water mark... (p.476) The issue of ownership of the river bed was also considered in re the bed of the Wanganui River \[1955\] NZLR 419, where the Court of Appeal considered the river bed to be land. Cooke J said (at p.429): ...by the Treaty the soil of the bed became vested in the Crown as part of its demesne \[domain\] lands and unaffected by any native customary title. North J went on to say (at pp.461-463): I can see no justification for the Solicitor General’s argument that some distinction is to be drawn between dry land and land covered with water; both were tribal territory, and both had their uses and served the needs of the tribe. ...It seems to me however, to be clear, that this section recognised the possibility of the existence of rivers running through the tribal lands, and in the absence of any statutory provision excluding the soil of the bed of the rivers from the tribal customary lands, it is difficult to imagine that such river beds could have been excluded from a certificate of title granted to a tribe in respect of its tribal lands. It is implicit in the two New Zealand cases above that there is no distinction between title to bare land and title to land over which water is flowing. The rights which attach to waters are derived from the rights to the land below such waters. However, the nature of the particular land being looked at in these cases is such that it would normally be subject to the Land Transfer Act 1952, whereby the owner would, in effect, hold a title to the land, regardless of whether water flowed over it or not. The rights to a TTQ are rights in the open sea, an area not subject to the Land Transfer Act and this may be of significance. In British Columbia, the Privy Council, whilst recognising that, prima facie, the right to fish in tidal waters or open seas is primarily a public right, held that the Dominion (in whom the title was vested, in this instance the Crown of New Zealand) may legislate against this right. This means that the proprietary right to the territorial waters is vested in the Crown. Legislation of this nature has been effected by the provisions of section 7 of the Territorial Sea, Contiguous Zone, and Exclusive Economic Zone Act 1977, which states that the sea-bed to the outer limits of the territorial waters is vested in the Crown, and as such, is a legal interest. As referred to earlier, the area where rock lobster are gathered is within the territorial waters of New Zealand, meaning that the area where rock lobster are gathered is vested in the Crown. If, as the Privy Council considered to be the case in British Columbia, the title to a fishery arises from the right to the solum, then this right arises by virtue of there being an interest in the solum. Hence, the Crown, by virtue of it having the legal interest in the land, also has title to the fishery above such land. The enactment of the Fisheries Act 1983 (and the subsequent amending Acts) specifically provided the Crown with sole rights to grant to others the right to take species of fish from particular waters. In addition, the Fisheries Act also provided for the holder of a fishing quota to transfer by way of sale or lease the rights held in a TTQ. On the basis of the British Columbia case, the Crown has the ability to permit others to fish in the Crown’s solum, i.e. to take some of its interest in the land (the fish). This raises the question of whether the right to take fish is the right to use land. Is the right to take fish a “right to use land”? The meaning of the “right to use land” should be considered from the perspective of its context for the purposes of Schedule 22. Schedule 22 allows the depreciation of certain intangible assets used by the taxpayer in the income earning process. This means that the intangible “right to use land” must be a right which is exercised in the course of the taxpayer deriving his or her income. A fishing quota confers on the holder a right to take fish, whose sale provides income to the holder. However, the issue is whether the right to use the water to take fish, means that it is a right to use the land below that water. From all three cases referred to IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 3 (March 2000) 17 earlier it has been established that, where there is title to an area, that area is defined by reference to the sub- soil, and therefore forms part of that title. As stated above, the Crown has vested in it the territorial waters and the sea-bed below such waters. On this basis, we consider that a fishing quota, which confers on the holder the right to use the waters for the purpose of taking the entitlement of fish, also includes the right to use the land below those waters. This is on the basis that the “right to use” is the right to use the land to the extent necessary to exercise the rights conferred by the fishing quota. Additionally, in the case of rock lobster it can also be argued that, as the lobster’s habitat is usually on the sea-bed or rocks resting on the sea-bed, the lobster themselves are gathered from the land. This conclusion holds equally for all other species of fish. Is a TTQ a profit à prendre? It could be argued that a TTQ, being a right to use land, is a profit à prendre. A profit à prendre (a right to take profits from the land) also includes a right to use land as it confers on the holder a right to take from the water, including the land below it. However, a profit à prendre is an interest in land, which is a tangible right. Therefore, although a TTQ has many of the same characteristics as a profit à prendre, the better view is that a TTQ is not a profit à prendre. To elaborate on this view, it is necessary to determine what distinguishes a TTQ from a profit à prendre. The first characteristic of a profit à prendre is that it is a right to take something off land. The cases have held that this extends to taking fish from water which flows over land. In Fitzgerald v Firbank \[1987\] 2 Ch 96, the plaintiffs held an exclusive right of fishing with rod and line for a specified period in a certain part of a river. The plaintiffs succeeded in bringing an action for trespass against the defendants, who had polluted the river by way of discharge of clay and gravel-washings. The pollution resulted in fish being driven almost entirely out of the plaintiff’s fisheries, interfered with the natural spawning process, deprived the fish of food and rendered the remaining fish unsuitable to take. Lindley LJ cited with approval the dictum in Smith v Kemp (1693) 2 salk.637 on the subject of “piscary” where the Court said: If a grant be de liberia piscaria, the grantee shall have the property of the fish there, and shall maintain trespass for fishing there. Lindley LJ went on to say (at p.99): The right to fishing includes the right to take away fish unless the contrary is expressly stipulated. I have not the slightest doubt about that. Therefore, the plaintiffs have got a right of some sort as distinguished from a mere revocable licence. What is that? It is a good deal more than an easement; it is commonly called a profit à prendre. It is of such a nature that he can bring an action for trespass at common law for the infringement of those rights. The second characteristic of a profit à prendre is that it is an interest in land. This means that the profit à prendre needs to have been created by a person with a legal interest in the land. Section 90 of the Land Transfer Act 1952 also specifically provides for the registration of the interest in a profit à prendre on the legal title to the land. In this respect, a profit à prendre confers rights of a possessory nature. As a result of this legal interest, the owner of a profit à prendre can bring an action for trespass at common law for an infringement of those rights. However, although both a TTQ and a profit à prendre have these similar features, the right of action in respect of each is not the same. A person holding the rights in a profit à prendre can bring an action for trespass for an infringement of those rights, because a profit à prendre is a property right and the right is actionable as a right in rem. This feature can be distinguished from a TTQ where, if an unauthorised person was fishing in the quota area or prevented a TTQ holder from exercising his or her rights in any manner, no action for trespass is available to the holder of a TTQ. The legal right of action (e.g. prosecution action) for any unauthorised conduct (e.g. trespass) lies with the Crown, exercised by the Ministry of Fisheries on behalf of the Crown. In addition to this, the rights in a TTQ, in contrast to those in a profit à prendre, are not registerable under the Land Transfer Act because the territorial waters and land below such waters are not subject to that Act. The case law referred to above indicates that, generally, a fishing right is a profit à prendre. However, based on the analysis above, we consider that the rights in a TTQ, whilst similar to those in a profit à prendre, can be sufficiently distinguished so as to conclude that a TTQ is not an interest in land and therefore, not a tangible interest in land. Can the property be reasonably expected in normal circumstances to decline in value? In order to be “depreciable property”, property must also meet a further test, i.e. the requirement that it might reasonably be expected to decline in value while used or available for use. In the Commissioner’s view, as a TTQ existed for a fixed term only, prima facie, the value of such quota would reasonably be expected to decline, in terms of resale value, as the term came closer to an end. However, it is acknowledged that extraneous factors such as economic conditions and scarcity of rock lobster may also directly affect the value of the quota during the term of the right, so that at a given point in IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 3 (March 2000) 18 time the value may fluctuate upwards or downwards. The fact that property may fluctuate in value over the period of its life was recognised by the Valabh Committee in their report “Tax Accounting Issues” (Feb 1991) which recommended the inclusion of fixed life intangible property in the definition of “depreciable property”. It said (at p.111): In general, the approach adopted by the Commissioner has been to exclude from the class of depreciable property those assets that are not used in the derivation of assessable income, as well as those assets that are not expected “systematically” to decline in value over the estimated useful life of the asset. This approach has not resulted in the exclusion of assets that exhibit an increase in their nominal value at some stage over their useful life. Assets that are expected to fall in value over their estimated useful lives are still depreciable even if they increase in value at certain times during that period. However, it has resulted in the exclusion of certain “investment” assets that can be expected to appreciate in value over most of the asset’s life (such as, original works of art, vintage cars etc.), even though it is recognised that the value of those assets at the end of their useful lives will inevitably be less than their original cost. It is noted that two tests are to be applied when considering an expectation of decline: •The decline must be reasonably expected. •Consideration is made having regard to normal circumstances. “Reasonably”, as an adverb, is not defined specifically in the Concise Oxford Dictionary. However, “reasonable” is stated to mean: 1. having sound judgment; moderate; ready to listen to reason. 2. In accordance with reason, not absurd. 3. Within the limits of reason; not greatly less or more than might be expected. The “reasonable expectation” is that from the point of view of the person who is purchasing or intending to purchase, in this instance, a TTQ. This is because it is only this person who is concerned with whether a TTQ would appreciate or decline in value. A factor most likely to be taken into account by an intending purchaser when making any purchase decision. This also means that it is an initial test, taken at the time of acquisition. A similar test is provided for in the penalties regime where, in assessing whether a taxpayer has exercised “reasonable care”, the effort required of the taxpayer is commensurate with that of a reasonable person in the taxpayer’s circumstances. On this basis an interpretation of the dictionary definitions above would mean that the taxpayer is only expected to exercise such an expectation based on practical or sensible factors, and relative to what a taxpayer in that person’s position would be expected to know. “Normal” is defined in the Concise Oxford Dictionary as meaning: conforming to a standard; regular, usual, typical. “Normal circumstances” are circumstances which, according to past practice have shown a typical pattern or outcome. Exceptional factors which may arise or be present when considering a “reasonable expectation” are not ones that are required to be considered in “normal circumstances”. In summary, the words “can be reasonably expected” and “in normal circumstances” mean that whether there is likely to be a decline in value of an asset over the period it is held, is to be regarded from the point of view of the ordinary taxpayer who is purchasing a TTQ. In the absence of exceptional circumstances, such “reasonable expectation” will therefore need to be based on historical evidence of whether, in the past, these type of assets have generally declined in value over the period they are held. Whether an asset appreciates or declines in value is relative to the particular class of asset and any exceptional circumstances at the time, and such tests are to be appropriately determined in the context of each asset. The legislation makes it clear that a TTQ can only exist for a period of 25 years, and apart from normal market fluctuations in value according to supply and demand, it could be reasonably expected that the value of the quota would, in normal circumstances, decline over this period whilst being used or available for use. In view of this, and the earlier conclusion that TTQ are a “right to use land” within the 22nd Schedule, TTQ are “depreciable property” within the definition provided for in section OB 1 of the Act. However, the definition of “depreciable property” in referring to intangible property of the type listed in the 22nd Schedule also states that such Schedule describes intangible property which: 1.has a finite useful life that can be estimated with a reasonable degree of certainty on the date of its creation or acquisition; and 2.has, if made depreciable, a low risk of being used in tax avoidance schemes A literal reading of the words “such schedule describes” suggests that this is a direction to the 22nd Schedule which describes what one might find there. On this basis, a literal reading suggests this wording is merely an ancillary point, in this instance, adding description to the types of assets covered by the 22nd Schedule, as an aid to interpretation. Additionally, the type of factors described in 1 and 2 above would not, in ordinary circumstances, be factors which Parliament would expect the taxpayer to have to consider. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 3 (March 2000) 19 Adopting this interpretation means that these are tests to be applied by Parliament, through its advisors, prior to the addition of the asset category to the 22nd Schedule. However, it is possible that these two requirements are not in fact tests to be applied by Parliament’s advisors prior to the addition of the asset category to the 22nd Schedule, but are additional tests which fall to the taxpayer to satisfy, after it has been established that the asset is one of the types within the 22nd Schedule. As the meaning of this provision is not clear, it is necessary to consider whether TTQ would meet these requirements if in fact, they are additional requirements to be satisfied. Finite useful life In respect of the first element, it must be possible to determine a finite life for the asset at its creation or date of purchase. In regards to TTQ, the definition of Transferable Term Quota in section 2 of the Fisheries Act 1993 states that a right to take rock lobster is conferred for a period of 25 years beginning on the 1st day of April 1990. The rights conferred allow the collection of rock lobster up to a certain tonnage per year. This means the quota can be re-used in each of the 25 years on a continual basis. Therefore, a TTQ has a useful life for the whole of its existence, that is, 25 years. As the life of a TTQ has been written into legislation at the date of creation, this element has been satisfied as a matter of fact, and would in all likelihood be known to any prospective purchaser. It would definitely be known to Inland Revenue. For these reasons, we consider that either the taxpayer or Inland Revenue can determine this factor as it relates to TTQ at the time of creation, or, for purchasers, post creation. Low risk of being used in tax avoidance schemes The type of situation possibly envisaged by this provision would be where the asset is sold at an inflated value. Generally, these types of arrangements take place between associated persons. However, the legislation provides a remedy for this situation in section 111 \[EG 17\]. On this basis, it can be inferred that a possible situation which section 111 does not specifically cover, is where the sale price of an asset is inflated between non-associated persons. However, there is a possibility that the Commissioner could apply the provisions of section 117(7) \[EG 19(7)\] to deem the property to have been disposed of for a consideration equal to the property’s market value. In the case of a TTQ, it would not have been possible for a taxpayer to purchase the asset for the purpose of being used in a tax avoidance scheme. This is because the asset has never previously been held to be depreciable property, and therefore could never have been originally acquired by a taxpayer for any tax avoidance purpose relating to depreciation. In addition to this, TTQ are no longer in existence and therefore it is not now open to any taxpayer to acquire a TTQ, and hence cannot be used for the purposes of any future tax avoidance scheme. Based on the wording of the legislation, the correct interpretation is that where an asset has been included in the 22nd Schedule it has already met the two requirements above, and therefore these factors are not required to be considered separately in relation to any of the types of assets included in the 22nd Schedule. These factors have already been considered before the asset has been added to the 22nd Schedule. Excluded depreciable property Although a TTQ can be considered to come within the definition of “depreciable property”, it must not be depreciable property which is “excluded depreciable property”. “Excluded depreciable property” is defined as depreciable property: (a)That was used or available to be used by the taxpayer for any purpose whatever within New Zealand, other than as trading stock, before the 1st day of April 1993; or (b)For which a binding contract for its purchase or construction was entered into by the taxpayer before the 16th day of December 1991; or (c)That is or has been in respect of the taxpayer a qualifying asset within the meaning of section 108N (1) of this Act; or (d)To the extent that the property is or has been in respect of the taxpayer a qualifying improvement within the meaning of section 108N of this Act; or (e)That is an intangible asset that was used or was available for use by the taxpayer before the 1st day of April 1993;— but does not include any item of property in existence at the end of the 1992-93 income year that was permitted by the Commissioner to be accounted for in that income year using any of the standard value, replacement value, or annual revaluation methods: Assets considered to be “excluded depreciable property” include assets used or available for use prior to 1 April 1993. This means that only those TTQ acquired after that date can be depreciated. Having determined that TTQ are depreciable property, provided they were acquired after 1 April 1993, the next issue is the rate of depreciation that applies to these assets. The definition of “annual depreciation rate” states that the rate to be applied in the case of “fixed life intangible property” is, pursuant to section 108G, calculated as the fraction of one over the legal life of the asset. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 3 (March 2000) 20 In order to be “fixed life intangible property” the property must be depreciable property and have a legal life which could reasonably be expected, on the date of creation or acquisition to be the same length as the property’s remaining estimated useful life. As it has already been established earlier that a TTQ is depreciable property, it now needs to be established that a TTQ has a “legal life” equal to its “useful life”. “Legal life” is, in respect of intangible property and the owner of that property, the number of years and any monthly fraction thereof that the property may remain or continue to remain in existence by virtue of the contract that creates the property for the owner assuming any rights of renewal or extension that are essentially unconditional, or conditional on the payment of pre-determined fees, are exercised (section 107A(1)). TTQ were created pursuant to section 28AB of the Fisheries Act 1993 for a period of 25 years beginning on 1 April 1990. The legal life, therefore, expires on 31 March 2015. As the tonnage available to be caught under the quota system remains constant throughout each of those 25 years, and ceases on the same date as the legal life, it can be said that the useful life of a TTQ is equal to its legal life. On this basis, a TTQ meets the definition of “fixed life intangible property” and is subject to such rate as provided for in section 108G. The rate set out for fixed life intangible property in section 108G is the formula, “one over the legal life”. The depreciation rate will be calculated on a straight- line method, from the date of acquisition and with regard to that period remaining up until 31 March 2015. In summary, a TTQ is depreciable property as it is a “right to use land” within the 22nd Schedule and the rate of depreciation is that rate provided for in section 108G. The ability to depreciate will only apply to those TTQ acquired on or after 1 April 1993. Having determined that a TTQ is “depreciable property”, it is necessary to now look at the effect of the conversion of a TTQ to an ITQ as from 30 September 1996, and whether this constituted a “disposal” in terms of the legislation. If in fact the conversion of a TTQ to an ITQ constitutes a “disposal”, any depreciation claimed in those years from 1 April 1993 until 30 September 1996 will need to be taken into account when determining any income tax liability, that is, a depreciation “clawback”. If a TTQ is able to be depreciated, is the conversion of a TTQ to an ITQ a “disposal”? In order for a TTQ to be a “disposal” on its conversion to an ITQ, it will need to satisfy one of the provisions within the definition of “disposal” in section 117(10). Two provisions within this section relate to intangible property that could potentially apply to TTQ. These are that a “disposal”: •Includes any event whereby the rights which constitute or are part of an item of intangible property will no longer be able to be exercised, at any time, by the taxpayer who owns that property. •Does not include, in the case of intangible property, the disposal of that property as part of an arrangement to replace it with property of the same type. Is the conversion of a TTQ an event whereby the rights which constitute or are part of an item of intangible property mean that it will no longer be able to be exercised, at any time, by the taxpayer who owns that property? Although “disposal” is defined specifically in relation to depreciation, the words of the legislation state that the definitions given are inclusive. This means that the definition of “disposal” in section 117(10), which includes the two factors above, is not exhaustive. In view of this, it is necessary to also look at the meaning given to the word at common law. The meaning of the word “disposal” or “disposition” has been considered in a number of jurisdictions. In Ward v CIR \[1955\] NZLR 361, Gresson J referred to the meaning given to “disposition” by the House of Lords in Duke of Northumberland v AG \[1905\] AC 406. He said: \[It\] is clear that the terms “disposition” and “devolution” must have been intended to comprehend and exhaust every conceivable mode by which property can pass, whether by act of parties or by act of the law. In FCT v Wade \[1951\] 84 CLR 105, the High Court of Australia had to consider whether diseased cattle, destroyed compulsorily and for which compensation had been received, had been disposed of “by sale or otherwise”. On the meaning of “disposed” Dixon and Fullager JJ said: The words “disposed of” are not words possessing a technical legal meaning, although they are frequently used in legal instruments. Speaking generally, they cover all forms of alienation. In Grey v IRC \[1958\] 2 All ER 428, Lord Evershed MR said: The word “disposition” is one of wide import, general rather than precise. Many context could no doubt be found in which the word or its derivatives would cover any means whereby the owner of any right or property succeeded in getting rid of that which he formally enjoyed.....The meaning of the word must be discerned from and as I think limited by the context. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 3 (March 2000) 21 The House of Lords affirmed the judgment, but no specific comment was made on the general meaning of disposition. Victory Hotels Ltd v MNR \[1962\] CTC 614 concerned the timing of when a business had been disposed of. The Court said that “disposed of” as used in the relevant section meant: “to part with”, “to pass over the control of the thing to someone else” so that the person disposing no longer has the use of the property. In Coles Myer Ltd v Commissioner of State Revenue 98 ATC 4,537, Ormiston JA considered the meaning of the word “transfer”. However, in his judgment, he distinguished a transfer from a disposition. He said that transfer “is not a mere disposition, a ridding oneself of the right or interest”. The case law above supports the view that, for a disposition to occur, all that is required is an alienation of property. However, other cases support the view that there must be intention and activity on the part of the disposer and that the property must remain in existence after it has been disposed of. These further requirements are discussed in Wade (referred to above), where the High Court of Australia held that diseased cattle had not been disposed of “by sale or otherwise”. The Court reasoned: Such a thing involves no voluntary act on the part of the taxpayer, no alienation of property on his part and, except for the fact that it is authorised by law and compensation is payable, can hardly be differentiated from the destruction of the assets by external force or accident. In Henty House Property Ltd (in voluntary liquidation) v FCT 10 ATD 231, a building was resumed by the Commonwealth from the taxpayer who received a lump sum payment as compensation. In considering the meaning of the phrase “disposed of, lost or destroyed”, the Full High Court said: No doubt the notion primarily conveyed by the words “disposed of” is the notion of a disposition by the taxpayer; but it is not necessarily so confined, and the use of the passive voice, without specific words of restriction referring to the person by whose act the disposal takes place, leaves ample room for a construction in keeping with the general tenor of the section, and with its place in the scheme which ss 54 to 62 provide. The entire expression “disposed of, lost or destroyed” is apt to embrace every event by which property ceases to be available to the taxpayer for use for the purpose of producing assessable income, either because it ceases to be his, or because it ceases to be physically accessible to him, or because it ceases to exist. In the context of s 59 there is ample reason for rejecting a narrow construction. In particular, the words “is disposed of” are wide enough to cover all forms of alienation, as Dixon and Fullagar JJ remarked in FCT v Wade, and they should be understood as meaning no less than “becomes alienated from the taxpayer,” whether it is by him or by another that the act of alienation is done. Neither the words themselves nor the setting in which they appear afford any support for the view that cases of involuntary alienation fall outside their meaning. It is obvious that the case for a construction of the expression “disposed of” as extending to compulsory acquisition is even stronger. The words “disposed of” are not technical words. They mean disposed of in a commer- cial sense. Similar words in other acts have been given a very wide meaning in suitable contexts. Compulsory acquisition was also considered in New Zealand in Public Trustee v CIR \[1961\] NZLR 1034. The issue was whether land compulsorily acquired under the Public Works Act was a disposition for the purposes of section 79(1)(c) of the Income Tax Act which is now section CD 4. In discussing the issue Hutchinson J, of the Supreme Court, said: In their ordinary meanings, “sale” and “disposition” require intention and activity on the part of the person selling or disposing. It was put thus by Viscount Simmonds, in relation to the words “sale” and “sold”, in Kirkness v John Hudson & Co Limited \[1955\] All ER 345: “To say of a man who has had his property taken from him against his will and been awarded compensation in the settlement of which he has had no voice, to say of such a man that he has sold his property appears to me to be as far from the truth as to say of a man who has been deprived of his property without compensation that he has given it away. Alike in the ordinary use of language and in its legal concept a sale connotes the mutual assent of two parties.” ... It was put thus in the High Court of Australia, in relation to the word “disposed”, in Henty House Pty. Ltd. v. Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1953) 5 A.I.T.R. 557: “No doubt the notion primarily conveyed by the words ‘disposed of’ is the notion of a disposition by the taxpayer...” (ibid., 560) and by Fullager J., in the same case: “The term ‘disposed of’ is not a technical term, and its ‘ordinary’ “or ‘popular’ meaning does not, to my mind, cover a case in which a person is deprived of his property against his will or without his consent”. But, of course, those words may bear an extended meaning if the context requires it. There has been case law considering disposition in relation to the redemption of shares. In Case Q52, Barber J found that the redemption of the shares was a “disposition” for the purposes of section 65(2)(e). The taxpayers had not bought the shares for resale, but had bought them for redemption at a higher price than they had paid for them. The redemption involved a transfer of property - the shares on redemption were not extinguished, as they would remain part of the authorised share capital of the company. That redemption should have resulted in a profit which Barber J considered would have been assessable. This meant that the transaction was revenue in character so that the loss should be deductible. Barber J had this to say about what amounts to a disposition in this context (at p.5,298): IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 3 (March 2000) 22 I agree with Mr Wood that when redeemable preference shares are redeemed there is the fulfilment of a contract between the company and the shareholder rather than a sale and, after redemption, the former shareholder no longer has any interest in the shares. I do not think that the shares can be regarded as being extinguished because they remain part of the authorised capital of the company and can be re-issued to someone else. While there is no sale by the shareholder to the company at the time of redemption, I consider that the property in the shares does pass from the shareholder to the company. The shareholder has parted with his rights in return for a redemption payment. That seems to me to be a disposition in terms of the above statement of Gresson J in Ward v CIR \[\[1965\] NZLR 367,370\] and in terms of the various dictionary definitions. It may seem that Public Trustee v CIR \[\[1961\] NZLR 1,034\] and Railway Timber Co Ltd v CIR \[(1976) 2 NZTC 61,172\] run counter to my view in that they seem to require a positive act from the disponer. I respectfully agree with Hutchinson J when he said at p.1,042 of Public Trustee v CIR: “In their ordinary meanings, ‘sale’ and ‘disposition’ require intention and activity on the part of the person selling or disposing.” However, I do not think that this is an ordinary situation, and, in any case, I consider that there has been “intention and activity” on the part of the objectors. They always intended redemption for 6c more than they paid and they intended to enter into the activity of completing redemp- tion procedures with the company. Had that arrangement been completed, the profit should have been returned as assessable under the second limb of s 65(2)(e). In terms of Inglis, this means that the transaction was revenue in character so that the loss should be deductible. However, Willy DJ in Case Q57 did not seek to rely on the shares remaining in the hands of the company. His Honour rejected any argument that there was no disposition because the shares once redeemed were no longer in existence on the basis that continuing existence of the property disposed of was a necessary feature of the notion of disposition. His Honour preferred to rely on the authorities which emphasised the broad meaning of “disposition” (e.g. Wa rd) - an approach he considered had been supported by Barber J in Case Q52. Willy DJ considered that the passing of the shares from the shareholder back to the company clearly created a new legal and equitable interest in that property, i.e. there was passing of property, because the company on the one hand would be relieved of a liability to pay for the cost of the moneys acquired from the investing public, and the investor on the other hand had received back his money plus a capital profit. In his Honour’s view the emphasis in the authorities was on the mode by which the property passed, not what became of the property after it had passed. He considered this latter point to be irrelevant. In summary, case law shows that the elements required to be present in order for a disposition to exist are: •A “disposition” and/or “disposing of” property must involve total alienation of that property by the disposer. •Whether anything further must be established in terms of the ordinary meaning in a particular situation will depend on the context in which the concept is used, including whether the relevant statutory provision expressly extends the meaning - extending the meaning tends to suggest that the ordinary meaning is narrower. •Generally, a disposition will involve the disposing of property that is already in existence at the time of the disposal. •A disposition usually needs to be intended by the disposer and be something that the disposer is actively involved in, as opposed to being something unilaterally done by a third party. This is the notion of the disposer doing the alienating, rather than being passive and the disposee or some other party making the alienation occur. •The requirement that there be some degree of “dealing with” the property being disposed of by the disposer is closely linked to the requirement that the property being disposed of must stay in existence following the disposal from one party to another. However, this does not seem to be an absolute requirement given that the courts have held that disposition may arise even though the disposal results in the extinguishment of the property. To recap on the elements of a TTQ: a TTQ was created by virtue of section 28BA of the Fisheries Act 1983. This declared rock lobster to be subject to the quota management system for a period of 25 years from 1 April 1990. The allocation of tonnages of rock lobster for TTQ was made primarily to those persons who already held licences to fish for rock lobster under the ITQ system using as a basis the proportion that the commercial catch of that person over the last 6 years bore in relation to the total commercial catch in that quota management area. The QMS under Part II of the Act specifies the total allowable catch for all species of fish. Section 28CA states that the total allowable commercial catch for rock lobster is that which appears in the final column of the Second Schedule of the Maori Fisheries Act 1989. Section 28D provides that the Minister may vary the tonnages from time to time according to certain considerations. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 3 (March 2000) 23 As from 1 October 1996, TTQ are no longer in existence. Sections 28BA and 28EA of the Fisheries Act 1983 (which declared rock lobster subject to quota fishing and made provision for subsequent allocation) were repealed by section 314 of the Fisheries Amendment Act 1996 (No.88). In the same amendment, section 334 provided for the treatment of TTQ as a result of the change in legislation. It states that the conversion from TTQ to ITQ is not a new allocation. Applying the criteria emanating from the case law above as being required in order for there to be a disposition of a TTQ: •The conversion of a TTQ is not a total alienation of the rights or interests in that property. All of the rights or interests that existed under a TTQ remain undisturbed after the conversion to an ITQ, except that there has been a variation to the term, i.e. the number of years that the fishing quota is valid for. •The rights or interests that existed under a TTQ are still the same rights or interests under an ITQ (i.e. the ability to catch or harvest a certain amount of rock lobster in a certain area), except that the term has changed, i.e. the quota no longer has an ending date. This is supported by the words in section 334(2) Fisheries Act 1996: “The conversion of quota by subsection (1) of this section does not constitute an allocation of new quota for the purposes of any enactment or rule of law”. •That a court is unlikely to extend the ordinary meaning of “disposition” unless clearly a number of requisite elements, in particular total alienation, could be satisfied. •That the disposition (conversion) was not intended by the holder of such quota and the holder had no active involvement in its disposal. It is arguable that the holder, at the date of acquisition, was aware that a TTQ may have a limited life, but, in any event, it is not sustainable to argue that the purchaser of a TTQ would, ordinarily, have acquired that property with the purpose of resale. Ordinarily, a purchaser would have acquired a TTQ in order to catch rock lobster and, under the law prevailing at that time, this was the only means available. •That the conversion of a TTQ to an ITQ by operation of law did not involve any activity or degree of “dealing with” the property on behalf of the holder of a TTQ. As noted earlier, the wording of section 334(2) of the Fisheries Act 1996 also supports the view that the conversion is not a disposal, as it explicitly states that this conversion “is not a new allocation”. This confirms that Parliament did not intend there to be an alienation on conversion. On this basis, the conversion of a TTQ to an ITQ does not constitute a “disposal” for the purposes of this provision \[Fisheries Act 1983, subsection (2) - not a new allocation; subsection (4) - ITQ perpetual even though previously only for 25 years\]. The conversion of a TTQ to an ITQ is not a “disposal” because it is not an event whereby the rights which constitute or are part of an item of intangible property mean that it will no longer be able to be exercised, at any time, by the taxpayer who owned that property. It is not necessary to consider whether the conversion of a TTQ would be excluded from the definition of “disposal” by virtue of such disposition being part of an arrangement to replace it with property of the same type. In summary: •A TTQ is an asset of a capital nature, and therefore the costs of acquisition and any profit or loss on the sale of a TTQ are of a capital nature and therefore not deductible. •The cost of a TTQ is not deductible under section 104, and as the cost is not able to be amortised in terms of section 104A, no unexpired portion of the expenditure can be claimed on conversion to an ITQ. •A TTQ is a right to use land, as the courts have stated that the right to use or take from the water includes the land below such waters and, in addition to this, it may also be necessary to use the land in order to exercise the fishing rights. •A TTQ is “depreciable property” within the meaning of the Act pursuant to it being a “right to use land” within the 22nd Schedule. A TTQ acquired after 1 April 1993 can be depreciated from the date of acquisition up until 30 September 1996, in accordance with the formula in section 108G. •The conversion of a TTQ to an ITQ is not a “disposal” within the definition provided for in the Act. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 3 (March 2000) 24 Effect on whether the conversion of a TTQ to an ITQ is a “disposal” The effect of these conclusions is that the cost of a TTQ acquired after 1 April 1993 is able to be depreciated. However, this depreciation will cease as at 30 September 1996, being the date of the conversion to an ITQ. The conversion of a TTQ to an ITQ does not constitute a “disposal” in terms of section 117(10), and so any depreciation claimed in those prior years is not recoverable and there will be no gain or loss on conversion. No deduction of any kind is available for TTQ acquired prior to 1 April 1993, as TTQ were not included within “depreciable property”. Conclusions The overall effect is that qualifying taxpayers are unable to deduct the cost of acquiring TTQ, and any gain or loss on conversion is not assessable. Those taxpayers are, however, able to claim depreciation for a maximum period of three and a half years, being 1 April 1993 to 30 September 1996. Any depreciation claimed is not recoverable by Inland Revenue at the date of conversion, as there is no disposal. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 3 (March 2000) 25 NEW LEGISLATION REGULATIONS Legislative changes have been made in three areas by means of Orders in Council signed on 28 February 2000: Fringe benefit tax — prescribed rate of interest The rate of interest used to calculate fringe benefit tax for low-interest employment-related loans is being increased to 7.59% for the quarter beginning 1 April 2000. This replaces the existing rate of 6.5%. The rate is reviewed quarterly to ensure it is in line with market interest rates. It was last changed in January 1999. The new rates are consistent with first mortgage housing rates. Income Tax (Fringe Benefit Tax, Interest on Loans) Amendment Regulations 2000. Compulsory direct crediting of refunds arising from housekeeper and donation rebates From 1 April 2000 Inland Revenue will be required to direct credit refunds arising from housekeeper and donation rebates to taxpayers’ bank accounts. This measure follows the removal of the requirement for most salary and wage earners to furnish annual returns of income, also taking effect from 1 April 2000. In the absence of a return of income, the housekeeper and donation rebates will be claimed on a new form being introduced for that purpose. A bank account number into which the refund will be direct credited must be specified on that form. The compulsory direct crediting of refunds will benefit taxpayers by eliminating delays associated with the postal system and costs relating to the banking of cheques. Legislation enacted last year will see the compulsory direct crediting of refunds gradually extended to other tax types, by means of Orders in Council. Taxation (Direct Credit Refunds-Rebates) Regulations 2000. Student loan scheme - interest rates for 2000-01 On 18 February 2000 the Associate Minister of Education (Tertiary Education) announced that the student loan scheme total interest rate would be frozen at 7.0 percent for the year beginning 1 April 2000. The Order in Council gives effect to this announcement. The total interest rate has two components - the base interest rate and the interest adjustment rate. These are currently 5.3 percent and 1.7 percent respectively. From 1 April 2000 the base interest rate will be 6.1 percent and the interest adjustment rate will be 0.9 percent.

IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 3 (March 2000) 26 STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS These statements describe how the Commissioner will, in practice, exercise a statutory discretion or deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. INSTALMENT ARRANGEMENTS FOR PAYMENT OF TAX DEBT – RDC-6 When Inland Revenue accepts an instalment arrangement, Inland Revenue will issue written confirmation of the arrangement that will set out the taxpayer’s obligations and Inland Revenue’s obligations. Application This Standard Practice Statement applies from 1 April 2000. Legislation All legislative references are to the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) unless otherwise stated. Section 177 provides for relief in cases of financial hardship by way of remission or instalment arrangement. The provisions discussed are those that apply to instalment arrangements. The criteria for section 177 to apply are: •the application for relief must be in writing •the application must be for any amount that is, or is likely to become, liable for payment •the tax must be income tax imposed under section BB 1 Income Tax Act 1994 (ITA), and/or fringe benefit tax •the taxpayer must be in financial difficulties at the time of application •the relief must be necessary or desirable in order to maximise net present value •any arrangement must be in two or more instalments. The other related provisions of section 177 are: •relief may be cancelled •there is no right of objection or challenge •relief of more than $50,000 requires Ministerial approval. Introduction This Standard Practice Statement states the Commissioner’s practice on providing relief by way of instalment arrangement when taxpayers are in debt with Inland Revenue. It does not relate to instalment arrangements for payment of child support arrears by non-custodial or custodial parents. Summary The Tax Administration Act 1994 specifically allows for relief by way of instalment arrangement for income tax and fringe benefit tax. Other provisions of the Tax Acts give managerial discretion to Inland Revenue to enter into instalment arrangements for tax types other than income tax and fringe benefit tax. Applications for relief by way of instalment arrangement must be in writing. The taxpayer must be in financial difficulties at the time of application. The Commissioner will require relevant financial information to be provided in support of the application. When considering an application, Inland Revenue is required to consider whether the relief granted will maximise net present value for income tax and fringe benefit tax, or will lead to the collection of highest net revenue over time for other tax types. There is no legislative time limit for an instalment arrangement. However, arrangements will generally be over the shortest period of time in order to maximise the net present value of any recovery. Penalties and interest will continue to accrue during the term of the arrangement. However, if a taxpayer adheres to the conditions of the arrangement, the penalties will be cancelled from the date the arrangement was entered into. Interest cannot be cancelled and will remain payable. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 3 (March 2000) 27 Other relevant legislation is contained in: •section 6A TAA - the care and management of taxes •section 156 TAA - the mode of recovery of unpaid tax •section 183B TAA - cancellation of late payment penalties under instalment arrangement. Standard Practice Instalment arrangements for income tax and fringe benefit tax Application for relief to be made in writing Legislation states that an application for relief must be made in writing. However it is consistent with Inland Revenue’s strategic business direction for discussion on ways of repaying tax debts (including instalment arrangements), to be held over the telephone. Inland Revenue may discuss repayment amounts, timeframes and surrounding circumstances with the taxpayer but any arrangement cannot be accepted by Inland Revenue without an application in writing. Any discussion held over the telephone will be subject to receipt of the written application and supporting documentation. A taxpayer may start making voluntary payments immediately, before an arrangement has been agreed to (refer to IR 262 Let us help you pay your bill ...). However any cancellation of penalties only applies from the date the arrangement is agreed to (refer below “Entering into an arrangement”). Amount that is, or is likely to become, liable for payment A taxpayer may make application for an instalment arrangement for any amount that is in arrears, or any amount that will become due for payment. In practical terms, a taxpayer making payments towards a tax debt before that amount is due, does not need to enter into an instalment arrangement unless the amount owing will not be paid prior to the due date (refer to IR 262 Let us help you pay your bill ...). If a taxpayer determines that an amount will be outstanding after the due date, then that taxpayer should apply to Inland Revenue prior to the due date for a pre-emptive instalment arrangement to receive the full benefits of the cancellation provisions (refer to “Cancellation of penalties” below for more information). Income tax imposed under section BB 1 Income Tax Act 1994 and fringe benefit tax Section 177 applies to income tax imposed under section BB 1 ITA and fringe benefit tax. Section BB 1 ITA refers to income tax imposed on taxable income. Section 177 therefore also applies to provisional tax instalments (section MB 12(1) ITA), non-resident withholding tax (section NG 17(2) ITA) and specified superannuation contribution withholding tax (section NE 7(2) ITA) as these revenues are specifically deemed to be income tax under section BB 1 ITA. Financial difficulties at the time of application Section 177 provides for relief for taxpayers who are in financial difficulty at the time of application. Inland Revenue considers “financial difficulties” arise when a taxpayer’s financial position is such that debts cannot be paid on time, and either: •there is a real prospect that creditors will be able to have the taxpayer put into liquidation, or adjudged bankrupt; or •the taxpayer’s debts are a substantial limitation on carrying out normal income producing activities. (For further discussion on ‘financial difficulties’ refer to Tax Information Bulletin Volume Six, No. 14, June 1995.) In order for Inland Revenue to determine if a taxpayer is in financial difficulty, the following information must be provided by the taxpayer: Individuals not in business •a statement of financial position (IR 40) Individuals in business (including partners and trustees) •a statement of financial position (IR40\*) •a cashflow forecast (IR40A\*) Non-individuals •a written request for an instalment arrangement setting out the proposal for repayment •a cashflow forecast for the next three months (IR40A\*) •a statement of assets and liabilities (IR110\*) \* At the time of preparation of this Standard Practice Statement new forms were being developed, namely a “Statement of financial position - business customers” and a “Twelve month cashflow forecast”. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 3 (March 2000) 28 On reviewing the information provided, and depending on the amount of debt and/or the length of time of the proposed arrangement, Inland Revenue may request a more detailed breakdown or further information. For example, asset valuations, profit and loss statements, balance sheets, lists of debtors and creditors. If a taxpayer has the ability to realise assets (eg the ability to refinance, sell property, or surrender insurance policies) to pay the debt, then an instalment arrangement may not be appropriate. However, the size of the debt and the length of time of the proposed arrangement will be taken into account by Inland Revenue when considering an application for an instalment arrangement. Where there are assets that could be realised (eg if the debt is only a few hundred dollars and will be paid within a couple of months, then Inland Revenue would not expect property, such as a house, to be sold, before accepting an instalment arrangement). Net present value When considering an application for an instalment arrangement, Inland Revenue will consider the net present value of the proposed payments. The net present value calculation recognises the time value of money – interest, as well as the probability of payment – risk. The proposed payments are discounted for the time value of money and for the likelihood of receiving the money. Inland Revenue needs to determine the amount, date, and probability of each payment and apply an appropriate discount rate. The discount rate is calculated from published Government stock rates. Inland Revenue uses a calculation that involves: •the amount of payment, multiplied by •the probability of payment (for risk), divided by •the discount factor appropriate to the term (for interest). In order to ensure the net present value of a recovery is maximised, the proposal then needs to be compared to the net present value of other options. To achieve this Inland Revenue will compare the net present value of an instalment arrangement against the net present value of other actions ie deferred collection or legal proceedings. Where a proposed instalment arrangement is for an amount less than $10,000 and for less than 12 months duration the Commissioner considers net present value to be maximised when the following conditions are met: •the proposed instalment arrangement would lead to a monetary return to Inland Revenue •write-off or remission would produce less return than the proposed instalment arrangement •legal proceedings would produce less return than the proposed instalment arrangement over the same duration •Inland Revenue would incur costs by taking legal proceedings Where the debt is greater than $10,000 or the proposed arrangement is for longer than 12 months, then a net present value calculation will be required. A detailed explanation (and examples) of the net present value calculation can be found in Tax Information Bulletin Volume Six, No.14 which sets out Inland Revenue’s practice for hardship remission applications. Entering into an arrangement Date arrangement is entered into The date the arrangement is “entered into” is taken into account when cancelling penalties. Inland Revenue considers two possible dates that can be used are: •the date the application is received •the date that additional information is received in support of the application. If an application is incomplete, and additional information is required, then that additional information needs to be received within a reasonable time if the original date is to apply. Inland Revenue considers “reasonable time” to be such length of time as may fairly, properly, and reasonably be allowed or required, having regard to the nature of the information required and to the surrounding circumstances. Generally Inland Revenue will require information to be received by a set date, therefore a date will need to be agreed to by Inland Revenue and the taxpayer. Otherwise, for practical purposes, the arrangement will start on the date that the complete information is received. Length of arrangement There is no legislative time limit for an instalment arrangement. However, the Commissioner considers it necessary and desirable, in order to maximise the net present value of any recovery, that instalment arrangements are over a shorter period of time, rather than a longer period of time. This is because the longer the period of time the greater the risk of non- payment and the greater the loss for time value of money. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 3 (March 2000) 29 Two or more instalments Any relief by way of arrangement must be in two or more instalments. An application to make a single lump sum at a future date will not meet the legislative requirements of an instalment arrangement. Instalments need not be at regular time intervals or of regular amounts however this may be preferable for ease of management. Cancellation of relief Legislation provides for relief to be cancelled if the information provided by the taxpayer is misleading to an extent which renders it inappropriate for the Commissioner to have provided that relief. By way of examples: •if a taxpayer advises they were paying rent but in fact they were paying a mortgage on their own home, and had equity in that home, it may not have been appropriate for the Commissioner to have granted relief. •another scenario could be where a taxpayer has a vested right to income or assets of a trust, and this was not disclosed to the Commissioner. The Commissioner will also cancel any relief granted if the Commissioner receives further information relating to the taxpayer’s affairs at the date relief was granted, which renders it inappropriate for the Commissioner to have granted relief. No right of objection or challenge There is no statutory right to challenge or object to any decision of the Commissioner to grant or cancel relief under section 177(1) or 177(3). However if a taxpayer does not agree with the Commissioner’s decision not to grant relief, the taxpayer has other review options open to them eg a request for review can be made to the Inland Revenue officer involved or to the Office of the Ombudsmen. Judicial review may also be an available option. Relief of more than $50,000 The Minister of Finance must approve any instalment arrangement over $50,000, either specifically with respect to a case, or generally with respect to any class of case. In July 1999 the Minister of Finance approved a class of case for instalment arrangements comprising taxpayers whom: •have income tax and fringe benefit tax debt greater than $50,000 •meet the criteria of section 177 •have a good compliance history •are likely to comply with their future tax obligations •have the ability to pay the debt. Taxpayers who meet all these criteria will not need to have their application for relief approved by the Minister. Where taxpayers do not meet these criteria and the Commissioner considers the taxpayer should have an instalment arrangement, the application will need to be approved by the Minister. Instalment arrangements for GST, PAYE and other revenues Care and management in conjunction with the recovery of unpaid tax As stated above section 177 only applies to income tax and fringe benefit tax. Inland Revenue considers that when the general recovery provisions, as provided for in section 156, are exercised in conjunction with the Commissioner’s discretion under section 6A, the Commissioner is allowed to enter into instalment arrangements for taxes not covered by section 177, if in the circumstances there is a reasonable basis for believing that such steps will result in the collection of the highest net revenue over time, having regard to the factors listed in section 6A(3). The Commissioner has exercised his discretion, and will accept instalment arrangements for other tax types, namely GST, PAYE, ACC, self-employed ACC, family assistance, child support deductions, student loan deductions and repayments, resident withholding tax, and gaming machine duty. Collection of highest net revenue over time The “collection of highest net revenue over time” is a complex concept. It is not defined in the Tax Acts and has yet to be absolutely defined by the Courts. However, it would appear to be more than just collecting “as much as possible in as short a time as possible”; consideration needs to also be given to the continuing collection of revenue over a longer period of time. For example, a taxpayer may be able to clear a tax debt by instalment over nine months by continuing in business, and by continuing business will be able to pay future taxes on time. However, in a similar example, a taxpayer may be able to clear a tax debt by instalment over nine months by continuing in business, but the future prospects of that business show that the taxpayer will not be able to meet future taxes on time. This creates the risk of future debt arising. In this instance, some other form of action (such as issuing legal proceedings) may result in the collection of highest net revenue over time. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 3 (March 2000) 30 When considering the collection of highest net revenue Inland Revenue will take into account: •whether the proposal is realistic •the taxpayer’s compliance history •the likelihood of future compliance •whether the taxpayer previously had and adhered to an instalment arrangement •whether the taxpayer has filed all required returns •whether the arrangement maximises the recovery from the taxpayer •protection of the integrity of the tax system (if a taxpayer is continuing in business, or has a continuing income stream which is not subject to source deductions, then future compliance must also be considered). Entering into instalment arrangements under care and management To ensure consistency, it is appropriate to have substantially the same criteria and processes for all instalment arrangements. Therefore the criteria the Commissioner will use for instalment arrangements for these tax types are: •any application for relief by way of instalment arrangement is to be made in writing •an application for relief must be for an amount that is, or is likely to become, liable for payment •the taxpayer must be in financial difficulties at the time of application - refer to page 3 of this Standard Practice Statement for the financial forms that are to be used •instalment arrangements must result in the collection of highest net revenue over time •any arrangement must be for two or more instalments There is no statutory right to challenge or object to the Commissioner’s decision. However if a taxpayer does not agree with the Commissioner’s decision, the taxpayer has other review options open to them eg a request for review can be made to the Inland Revenue officer involved or to the Office of the Ombudsmen. Judicial review may also be an available option. All arrangements Cancellation of penalties If an arrangement has been complied with, section 183B allows the Commissioner to: •reduce the first late payment penalty by 60% if the arrangement was agreed to before the due date •cancel any late payment penalties incurred on the debt during the term of the arrangement. As cancellation of penalties only applies if a taxpayer has complied with the taxpayer’s obligations under the instalment arrangement, the penalties are cancelled at the end of the arrangement. Penalties will continue to be shown on Statements of account until the end of the arrangement. Interest will continue to accrue and be payable on the debt, throughout the term of the arrangement, as provided by legislation. Conditions Inland Revenue will advise all the conditions of the arrangement, including: •automatic termination of the arrangement if the terms are not adhered to without prior agreement •all current taxes must be paid, and returns filed, by the due date •late payment penalties incurred during the course of the arrangement will be cancelled, providing all payments are made on time •interest will be charged and payable up to the date of payment in full (taxpayers should contact Inland Revenue for the final instalment amount) •any credits that arise in the taxpayer’s account will be offset against the amount owed. Adhering to the arrangement If a taxpayer cannot meet one of the payments by the agreed date, then they should contact Inland Revenue to advise the reason that the payment will not be made on time. Any late payment is a breach of the arrangement and Inland Revenue may cancel the arrangement, depending on the reason for the late payment and the number of payments missed. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 3 (March 2000) 31 Reviewing arrangements Where arrangements are over a long period of time, eg over 12 months, Inland Revenue considers it appropriate to review the arrangement and the taxpayer’s circumstances. Such a review will consider whether the instalment arrangement is still appropriate to the taxpayer’s financial circumstances. Making the payments Inland Revenue prefers that taxpayers pay their instalment arrangement on a regular basis by automatic payment from their bank account. Another option is to make payments to any WestpacTrust branch with cash or by cheque, or to send cheques to Inland Revenue by the agreed dates. Confirmation Confirmation of an instalment arrangement will be made in writing. The terms and conditions will be included. This Standard Practice Statement was signed by me on 8 March 2000.

These are purely brief factual reviews of decisions for the general interest of our readers. APPLICATION FOR EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE CASE STATED WITH THE TAXATION REVIEW AUTHORITY considered that there were exceptional circumstances justifying extending the time for filing. The relevant circumstances in this case were sufficiently beyond the control of the respondent because it elected to have the High Court become seized of the matter. It relied on the High Court deciding the appropriate forum but then found that the preference of that Court could not be implemented without the respondent’s present application to the Authority. Therefore, the Authority decided that the statutory lacuna referred to must be overcome by granting an extension of time to enable the respondent to file the cases stated in the Authority rather than in the High Court. The respondent’s application was granted and the time for filing was extended to 31 March 2000. The application of the objectors that the Authority direct the respondent to allow their objections was declined. Case:TRA Numbers 97/47-97/74. Decision Number 7/2000 Decision date:4 February 2000 Act:Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Review Authority Regulations 1994 Facts Two applications were before the Authority. The first was an application dated 6 November 1997 filed by the respondent, pursuant to Regulation 8 of the Taxation Review Authority Regulations 1994, for an extension of time to enable cases stated for each of the 28 objectors to be filed with the Authority. The second was an application by the objectors for an order directing the respondent to allow the objections. Although counsel for the objectors sought to have the objections heard by the Authority from the outset, the respondent endeavoured to have them heard in the High Court and followed statutory procedure to that effect. Justice Baragwanath felt it appropriate that the objections be heard before the Authority. By then the cases stated, although filed in time in the High Court, had become out of time for filing in the Registry of the Authority due to a statutory lacuna. Decision The Authority considered that there was no statutory process enabling the High Court to transfer the cases stated to the Authority. This meant that the respondent needed to apply for an extension of time to file the cases in the Authority. The Authority IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 3 (March 2000) 33 INTEREST CHARGED ON INCOME TAX PAYMENT SHORTFALLS – WHETHER INLAND REVENUE BREACHED NATURAL JUSTICE; CHALLENGES TO DEPARTMENT’S ASSESSMENT BARRED BY SECTION 120I(1) Decision His Honour Judge Barber expressed some difficulty understanding the thrust of the Disputants’ argument. They seemed to contend throughout that the GST component had been erroneously assessed to them as income in the 1997 year, and that they were in a tax credit situation. His Honour concluded that the substance of the grievance was however with the law regarding the calculation of provisional tax payments and the calculation of interest on any shortfall. His Honour held that the Department’s assessments were arithmetically and procedurally correct, and that interest had been properly charged on the shortfalls in question. Regarding the ability of a Disputant to challenge such an impost, he upheld the Commissioner’s submissions that section 120I(1) clearly bars any such challenge. He stated: “... the interest in issue is not a tax, but a use of money charge” and that he had no jurisdiction to deal with that issue. His Honour further added that “\[n\]one of these matters involve any breach of natural justice by the IRD, or anyone else, towards the objectors”. Case:TRA Number 003/99. Decision Number 8/2000 Decision date:3 March 2000 Act:Tax Administration Act 1994 Keywords:Interest on shortfalls Summary Judge Barber found for the Commissioner, reinforcing the wording of section 120I(1). Facts The Disputants subdivided their farm and sold two of those sections in the 1997 tax year. There was a mistake made regarding the GST liability arising from the sale; the Disputants initially considered the sales to be of ‘going concerns’. Subsequently, the Disputants recovered $25,555.55 (the GST component) from the purchasers. This amount was erroneously returned as income in the Disputant’s 1998 tax return. In the 1998 tax year the Disputants sold more properties than they had anticipated so, as well as increasing the third provisional tax payment, they made an additional payment in order to meet their increased tax liability. Despite that, there remained a shortfall of each Disputant’s residual income tax liability. The Disputants requested however that their 1997 taxable income be reduced by $25,555.55. This request was not actioned as the Department considered the income from property sales in that year to be correctly declared. In 1998 the Disputants filed another adjustment request, realising the erroneous inclusion of the GST component in that year’s income return. This request was actioned by the Department and the adjustment had the effect of lessening the shortfall for each Disputant. There remained small shortfalls however, and interest was charged on this under Part VII of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The Disputants felt that they had acted in good faith and that it was contrary to “pure natural justice” to have to pay interest on the shortfall.

COMMISSIONS RECEIVED BY LIFE AGENTS ON OWN POLICIES AND FAMILY POLICIES – INCOME TAX IMPLICATIONS PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 00/01 Note (not part of ruling): The issue dealt with by this ruling was covered in public ruling BR Pub 96/9A, published in TIB Volume Eight, No.8, (November 1996). BR Pub 96/9A also dealt with the fringe benefit implications arising from discounted life insurance premiums. These arrangements are now the subject of two separate rulings, with the fringe benefit issue being covered in BR Pub 00/02. A single commentary accompanies both rulings. In addition to the separation of the arrangements into two rulings, some formatting changes have also been made. The period of application of the rulings is from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2004. BR Pub 96/9A applied up until 31 December 1999. •Cash commissions received by a life agent on the life agent’s own life policy or a family life policy are gross income under section CD 3 (if the life agent is an independent contractor) and section CH 3 (if the life agent is an employee). When a life agent sets off commissions on such policies against premiums payable on these policies, the amount of commission set off is gross income under section CD 3 or CH 3. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2004 to the receipt of cash commissions and the set off of commissions, occurring within that period. This Ruling is signed by me on the 29th day of March 2000. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CD 3 and CH 3. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is as follows: •The receipt by a life agent of cash commissions on the life agent’s own life policy or family life policy, or the set off of commissions on such policies against premiums payable on the life agent’s own life policy or family life policy. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 4 (April 2000) 5 DISCOUNTS ENJOYED BY LIFE AGENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES ON LIFE POLICY PREMIUMS – FRINGE BENEFIT TAX IMPLICATIONS PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 00/02 The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2004 to the enjoyment of discounts by a life agent or by members of the life agent’s family, occurring within that period. This Ruling is signed by me on the 29th day of March 2000. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Note (not part of ruling): The issue dealt with by this ruling was covered in public ruling BR Pub 96/9A, published in TIB Volume Eight, No.8, (November 1996). BR Pub 96/9A also dealt with the taxation of commissions received by life agent on their own policies and on family policies. These arrangements are now the subject of two separate rulings, with the taxation of commissions issue being covered in BR Pub 00/01. A single commentary accompanies both rulings. In addition to the separation of the arrangements into two rulings, some formatting changes have also been made. The period of application of the rulings is from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2004.

Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section CI 1(h). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is as follows: •The enjoyment of discounted premiums by a life agent on a policy on the life agent’s own life or that of a family member or the enjoyment of discounted premiums by members of the life agent’s family on a family life policy. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement The Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows: •When a life agent enjoys discounted premiums on a policy on the life agent’s own life or that of a family member, or persons associated with the life agent receive discounted premiums on family life policies, the discounted premium will be a fringe benefit under section CI 1(h). The life insurer will be liable for fringe benefit tax (FBT) on the taxable value of the benefit. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 4 (April 2000) 6 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULINGS BR PUB 00/01 AND BR PUB 00/02 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Rulings BR Pub 00/01 and BR Pub 00/02. The subject matter covered in these Rulings was previously dealt with by BR Pub 96/9A and in TIB Volume Eight, No.8, (November 1996), at page 6. These Rulings apply for the period from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2004. Background Public Ruling BR Pub 96/9A dealt with the income tax and fringe benefit consequences of life agents who take out life policies on their own lives and on the lives of their families. The period of application for that Ruling expired on 31 December 1999. In short the Ruling concluded that: 1.Cash commissions received by a life agent on the life agent’s own life policy or on a family life policy are gross income; 2.Discounted premiums enjoyed by a life agent or by family members on policies on their respective lives are fringe benefits. The Commissioner has reconsidered his conclusions reached in BR Pub 96/9A and is satisfied that these conclusions are correct. However, instead of reissuing the ruling, he has decided that it is legally appropriate to issue two rulings to cover the two arrangements, ie the receipt of commissions and the enjoyment of discounted premiums. These rulings will apply for the period from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2004. Legislation Section CD 3 states: The gross income of any person includes any amount derived from any business. Section CH 3 states: All monetary remuneration derived by a person is gross income. Section OB 1 defines “employer” and “employee” for the purposes of the FBT rules. “Employee” means: ...a person who will receive, receives, or has at any time received, or who will be, is, or has at any time been entitled to receive, a source deduction payment... “Employer” means: ...a person who will pay, pays, or has at any time paid, or who will be, is, or has at any time been liable to pay, a source deduction payment... “Source deduction payment” is defined in section OB 2(1) as: ...a payment by way of salary or wages, an extra emolu- ment,... or a withholding payment. Section CI 1 defines “fringe benefit”. Under section CI 1(h), a fringe benefit includes any benefit that consists of: Any benefit of any other kind whatever, received or enjoyed by the employee in the quarter or...income year,- being, as the case may be...a benefit that is used, enjoyed, or received, whether directly or indirectly, in relation to, in the course of, or by virtue of the employment of the employee (whether that employment will occur, is occurring, or has occurred) and which is provided or granted by the employer of the employee;... Section CI 3 provides the methods for calculating the value of a fringe benefit. When services are provided to an employee, and the services are provided as part of the employer’s business, the fringe benefit is valued in accordance with section CI 3(10)(a): Where the services were provided by the employer of the employee where the employer of the employee, as part of that employer’s business, normally provides such services for payment, the price for which, at the time when the services were so provided to the employee, services identical or similar to those services were customarily provided by the employer of the employee to a member of the general public in the open market in New Zealand on ordinary trade terms between buyers and sellers independent of each other: Section GC 15(1) states: For the purposes of the FBT rules, where any benefit which, if it were provided for or granted to an employee would be a fringe benefit, is provided or granted by the employer of the employee,...for or to a person other than the employee of the employer, the employee of the employer and the other person being associated persons, that benefit shall be deemed to be a benefit provided for or granted to the employee by the employer of the employee. For the purposes of section GC 15 “associated person” is defined in section OD 7(1). That section states: For the purposes of this Act, unless the context otherwise requires, at any time associated persons or persons associ- ated with each other are- ... (c)Two persons who are at the time relatives;... Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 4 (April 2000) 7 “Relative” is defined in section OB 1: (a)Except in the international tax rules, in relation to any person, means any other person connected with the first-mentioned person by blood relationship, marriage, or adoption; and includes a trustee of a trust under which a relative has benefited or is eligible to benefit; and for the purposes of this paragraph- (i) Persons are connected by blood relationship if within the fourth degree of relationship: (ii)Persons are connected by marriage if one is married to the other or to a person who is connected by blood relationship to the other: (iii) Persons are connected by adoption if one has been adopted as the child of the other or as a child of a person who is within the third degree of relationship to the other: Application of the Legislation 1.Cash commissions received by life agents on their own policies or family policies “Income” is not a term of art and has to be examined in accordance with ordinary concepts and usages (Scott v C of T (1935) 35 SRNSW 215 at page 219). The courts have identified several criteria that are considered to be the hallmarks of receipts of an income nature. The High Court in Reid v CIR (1983) 6 NZTC 61,624 at page 61,629 described the criteria as follows: •Income is something which comes in; and •Income imports the notion of periodicity, re- occurrence and regularity; and •Whether a particular receipt is income depends upon its quality in the hands of the recipient. An important feature of income is that it is something that comes in. This was emphasised in Lambe v IR Commrs (1933) 18 T.C. 212 where Finlay J said at page 217: Of course income may be of various sorts,...but none the less the \[income\] tax is a tax on income. It is a tax on what in one form or another goes into a man’s pocket. That is the general principle. Cash commissions received by life agents on own policies or family policies come in, in the same way that commissions from the sale of policies to unrelated third parties come in. The major determinant in many cases is the periodic nature of the payment. Generally, commission income is periodic in nature. However, this in itself is not enough. It is necessary to consider the relationship between the life insurer and the life agent to determine the quality of the commission in the hands of the life agent. Alternative arguments One possible argument is that commissions received by life agents on their own policies are not income but are the proceeds from mutual transactions. Mutual transactions The general principle of income tax known as mutuality starts from the premise that a person cannot make a profit from trading with himself or herself, or with a body or association of persons of which the person is a member. In Sydney Water Board Employees’ Credit Union Ltd v FC of T (1973) ATC 4,129 Barwick J said: The description “mutuality principle” is used, unfortunately as I think, to express the reason for the conclusion that the return to a taxpayer of a share of the surplus of a fund to which he has contributed in common with others after its use for a purpose agreed between them is not income... What distinguishes the amount refunded in such circumstances from profit or income is that the payment is made out of moneys which are in sub- stance the moneys of the contributors. (At page 4,131.)(emphasis added). Prima facie the profits from mutual transactions are not gross income. There are numerous cases discussing the mutuality principle. Most discuss the situation where a person trades with a body or association of persons of which he or she is a member. There was some discussion of the principle that a person cannot trade with himself or herself in Dublin Corporation v M’Adam 2 T.C. 387 at page 397. The Court stated that: There must be, at least, two parties...If these two parties are identical, in my opinion there can be no trading. No man, in my opinion, can trade with himself; he cannot, in my opinion, make, in what is its true sense or meaning, taxable profit by dealing with himself; and in every case of this description it appears to be a question on the construction of the Act whether the two bodies - the body that supplies and the body or class that has to pay - were either identical, or, upon the true construction of the Act, must be admitted to have been held by the Legislature to be identical... Does the mutuality principle apply? Although the life agent is the person who causes the commission to be paid by taking up the policy on that person’s life or the lives of the person’s family, the commission is not a return of the life agent’s own money. The commission comes from a source outside of the life agent, ie from the funds of the life insurer. The life agent is paid the commission for introducing business to the life insurer, not for taking out the policy and paying the premiums. Case law indicates that the mutuality principle only applies when a person trades with himself or herself, ie there is only one party to the transaction giving rise to the income. Here there are two parties to the transaction. The commission arises from the sale of a life insurance product by one party (the life insurer) to another party (the life agent). It does not matter that Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 4 (April 2000) 8 the life insurance product is sold by the life insurer through the life agent. There are still two parties to the transaction. Mutuality principle – conclusion The mutuality principle does not apply to commissions received by life agents on their own policies. Discount on premiums It may also be argued that cash commissions received by life agents on own policies should be regarded as discounts from the premiums payable under the policy and not as gross income. For example, a life agent takes out a policy on her life. The premium is $1,000. The life agent receives a cash commission of $200. The $200 can be seen as a discount, ie the ‘real’ cost of the policy is $800. As discussed in the background to the Rulings, this was the view taken in Commissions on Life Insurance sold to Agent’s Family in TIB Volume Four, No.10 (May 1993). The treatment of cash commissions as reductions or discounts from the premiums payable under the policies is not supported by the legislation. The commission payment arises from an arrangement between the life agent and the life insurer. The life agent receives the commission for introducing business to the life insurer, not for taking out the policy and paying the premiums. Conclusion Cash commissions received by life agents on own policies or family policies are gross income under section CD 3 or CH 3. 2.Life agents’ commission is set off Life agents may set off commissions on own policies or family policies against the premiums payable on their own policies. Under section EB 1(1), an amount is deemed to have been derived by a person although it has not actually been paid to, or received by the person, or already become due or receivable, if that amount: ...has been credited in account, or reinvested, or accumu- lated, or capitalised, or carried to any reserve, sinking, or insurance fund, or otherwise dealt with in the person’s interest or on the person’s behalf. Case law has established that income is derived under section EB 1 when the taxpayer does not receive a payment of that income, but some other monetary benefit moves to the taxpayer. This has been found to occur when income that would otherwise have been paid to the taxpayer is diverted for uses that are of benefit to the taxpayer (Dunn v C of IR (1974) 1 NZTC 61,245). When life agents set off the commission, the amount of commission is gross income under section CD 3 or CH 3. The commission (which would otherwise have been paid to the agent) is diverted for uses that produce other financial benefit to the life agent, ie payment of the premiums on own policies. The practice of setting off commissions on policies may also occur in respect of policies sold to third parties. For example, a life agent sells a policy to an unrelated third party and becomes entitled to a commission. Instead of being paid the commission, the life agent sets the commission off against premiums payable on own policies. Here, the commission, although not paid to the life agent, is derived by the life agent and is therefore gross income. 3.Charging of discounted premiums to life agents on own policies or to members of life agents’ families on family policies It is common for life insurers to allow life agents to receive lower commissions in order to discount premiums to prospective clients. The Commissioner understands that if a life agent agrees that no commission entitlement will arise on the sale of a policy, there is a corresponding reduction in the premiums payable under that policy. The Commissioner also understands that when life agents agree that no commission entitlement will arise on their own policies or on family policies, the premiums payable under those policies are reduced. Life agents who agree that no commission entitlement will arise on policies sold to third parties are not assessable on any notional commission, ie the amount of commission that would have been received. As discussed, an important feature of income is that it is something that comes in. When a life agent agrees that no commission entitlement will arise no income comes in. This must also be the case when life agents agree that no commission entitlement arises on their own policies or family policies. As the life agent receives no commission, no income arises. Alternative arguments An important feature of income is that it is something that comes in. When life agents agree that no commission entitlement will arise on their own policies no money comes in. They do not receive a cash commission. However, if a life agent decides to either take the commission, or agree that no entitlement will arise and receive a discounted premium on a policy on the agent’s own life or that of his or her family, the issue of convertibility arises. In particular, does the fact that the life agent can receive the commission in Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 4 (April 2000) 9 lieu of the discounted premium mean that the discounted premium is convertible into money, and therefore assessable? Case law The principle of convertibility was initially laid down in Tennant v Smith \[1892\] 3 T.C. 158. Tennant involved a bank employee who received a benefit in the form of rent-free accommodation. The issue was whether the accommodation was assessable under Schedule E of the UK legislation (by virtue of the words “salaries, fees, wages, perquisites or profits payable”). The Court held that the taxpayer would only be taxable if what he received was convertible into money, ie was money or money’s worth. Because the taxpayer could not sublet the accommodation or turn it to pecuniary account in any other way, he was not taxed. The principle of convertibility has been discussed and applied by the New Zealand courts on a number of occasions. See C of IR v Parson (No. 2) (1968) NZLR 574, Stagg v Inland Revenue Commissioner (1959) NZLR 1,252, and Dawson v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1978) 3 NZTC 61,252. The convertibility test is normally satisfied by demonstrating that the benefit may be sold or exchanged for money. (In Stagg the value of holiday airfares given to an employee was held not to be assessable income of the employee. The employee could not sell the fares or require the company to give him the equivalent cash value.) However, it is clear from case law that there are other ways in which convertibility can be satisfied. See Abbott v Philbin \[1961\] 2 All E.R. 763 and Heaton (Inspector of Taxes) v Bell \[1969\] 2 All E.R. 70. The principle of convertibility was considered by the New Zealand Supreme Court in Dawson. The taxpayer subscribed for debenture stock under a debenture holders’ colour television plan. Under that plan a person could subscribe for debenture stock and would receive in return a TV free of hire for five years. No interest was payable on the debentures. The Commissioner argued that the use of the TV set was the substitution of one form of a benefit for another, ie interest, and that in taking the hire of the set rather than the payment of interest, the taxpayer received a benefit which could be valued in terms of money. McMullin J said at page 61,258: In the view which I take of this matter, it is of some importance to note that Objector did not apply for a television set as an alternative to an interest-bearing investment. It is true that it was open to him initially to choose to invest in interest-bearing stock as, I have no doubt, many other investors did, but he completed his application for a television set and a television set only. The Court held that the benefit that the taxpayer received was that he did not have to pay rental for the TV. That benefit did not constitute income in the ordinary sense because the benefit received by the taxpayer was not in monetary form, nor was it capable of being sold, surrendered, assigned, or mortgaged for money or money’s worth. Arguably Dawson provides some support for the view that the receipt of a discounted premium is convertible into money or money’s worth, the discounted premium being a substitution for the commission. It may be implied from the Court’s comments in Dawson that if the taxpayer had the option of investing and receiving either a TV set or an interest-bearing investment, and in fact received a TV set, the benefit would be convertible into money. However, the better view is that discounted premiums are not convertible into money or money’s worth. The fact that a life agent initially has the choice of receiving a commission, or not receiving a commission and enjoying a discounted premium, is not relevant. The issue of convertibility is considered at the time the taxpayer receives the benefit. If a life agent chooses to receive a commission, no question of convertibility arises as the commission is money. However, when a life agent chooses to receive a discounted premium, it is the discounted premium itself that must be convertible into money or money’s worth. At the time the discounted premium is received it cannot be converted into money. Therefore, the convertibility principle does not apply. Conclusion When life agents receive discounted premiums on own policies or members of their families receive discounted premiums on family policies, the amount of the discount is not gross income of the life agent. 4.FBT and discounted policies A life insurer who provides discounted premiums to life agents on policies on their own lives or on the lives of their families or to members of their families on family policies may be liable to FBT. For the purposes of FBT a life agent is an “employee”, regardless of whether the life agent is an employee or an independent contractor at common law. Employee vs independent contractor The terms “employee”, “employer” and “employment” are defined for FBT purposes by reference to the PAYE system. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 4 (April 2000) 10 Section OB 1 defines “employee” for the purposes of the FBT rules as: ...a person who will receive, receives, or has at any time received, or who will be, is, or has at any time been entitled to receive, a source deduction payment... Section OB 2(1) defines “source deduction payment” as: ...a payment by way of salary or wages, an extra emolu- ment,... or a withholding payment. “Withholding payment” is defined in section OB 1 as: ...a payment which is declared by regulations under this Act to be a withholding payment for the purposes of the PAYE rules: Under section 4 of the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979, all payments of the classes specified in the Schedule to the regulations are withholding payments for the purposes of the PAYE rules. Included in Part A of the Schedule are commissions or other remuneration to insurance agents or sub-agents, or to salesmen. A life agent who is an employee at common law is an “employee” for the purposes of FBT because of receiving a source deduction payment, namely salary and wages. A life agent who is an independent contractor at common law is also an “employee” for the purposes of FBT because of receiving a source deduction payment, namely withholding payments. Discounts on family policies If an employer provides a benefit to an associated person of any of the employer’s employees, ie a member of the life agent’s immediate family (and the benefit would have been a fringe benefit if provided to an employee), section GC 15(1) deems the benefit to be a benefit provided to the employee. For the purposes of section GC 15, “associated person” is defined in section OD 7(1). An “associated person” includes two persons who are at the time relatives. A relative of a life agent is any person connected with the life agent: •By blood relationship (if within the fourth degree of relationship); or •By marriage (persons are connected by marriage if one is married to the other or to a person who is connected by blood relationship to the other); or •By adoption (persons are connected by adoption if one has been adopted as the child of the other or as a child of a person who is within the third degree of relationship to the other). Is there a fringe benefit? As discussed above, when a life agent agrees that no commission entitlement will arise and enjoys a discounted premium, that discounted premium is not gross income of the life agent. A discounted premium that represents a reduction in charges other than commission is also not gross income. A discount is not regarded as gross income. Income is something that comes in, not something that is saved from going out (see Tennant Lord Halsbury at page 165). The issue then is whether discounted premiums received by life agents on own policies or discounted premiums received by members of their families on family policies constitute fringe benefits. Analysis Section CI 1 defines “fringe benefit” for the purposes of the FBT rules: In the FBT rules, “fringe benefit”, in relation to an employee and to any quarter...or income year, means any benefit that consists of- ... Any benefit of any other kind whatever, received or enjoyed by the employee in the quarter or...income year,- being, as the case may be...a benefit that is used, enjoyed, or received, whether directly or indirectly, in relation to, in the course of, or by virtue of the employment of the employee (whether that employment will occur, is occurring, or has occurred) and which is provided or granted by the employer of the employee;... It is clear from these opening words that in order to be a fringe benefit there must be some benefit to the employee, provided or granted by the employee’s employer. A life agent may have a discretion to reduce his or her commission in order to reduce premiums on policies sold to members of the public. In this case it may be argued that when life agents do not charge a commission on their own policies and receive discounted premiums, no benefit arises to the life agents because the benefit is also available to members of the public. If a life agent purchases a life insurance policy at full value, ie the full amount of premiums are payable, there is no benefit to the life agent or his or her family. However, when a commission is not charged the full amount of premium is not paid. If a life agent agrees that no commission entitlement will arise, be it on an own policy or a policy sold to a member of the public, the amount of premium payable under the policy is reduced. This reduction in premium is clearly a benefit to the life agent and the public alike. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 4 (April 2000) 11 A life agent who enjoys a discounted premium, when the discount represents a reduction in charges other than commission, clearly receives a benefit. The benefit is the receipt of the services of the employer (the life insurance policy) for less than market value. Therefore, discounted premiums received by life agents on own policies and discounted premiums received by members of their families on family policies are fringe benefits under section CI 1(h). Note that sections CI 1(e) and CI 1(f) do not apply to discounts received by life agents (or associated persons) on own policies or family policies. The policies sold by the life agent are not “sick, accident, or death benefit funds” as defined in section CB 5(2) (see CI 1(e)), nor is the discount a “specified insurance premium” as defined in section OB 1. The life insurer does not pay the life insurance premiums of the life agent or the agent’s family on the life agent’s own policies or family policies (see section CI 1(f)). Value of the benefit The Act provides methods for valuing a fringe benefit. Specific provisions exist for determining the value of services provided to an employee when they are provided as part of the employer’s business. Here the benefit is the provision of a life insurance policy at less than market value. The life insurer is in the business of selling such life insurance policies to the general public. Therefore, section CI 3(10)(a) applies to determine the value of the benefit. The extent to which the benefit is subject to FBT will depend on the extent to which the discounts provided to life agents or members of life agents’ family, are greater than the discounts available to members of the general public. It is a question of fact whether the price paid for the policy by the life agent is the same as is customarily paid by a member of the general public in the open market on ordinary trade terms between buyers and sellers independent of each other. There will be no taxable value if the amount paid by the employee is the same as, or exceeds, the price customarily paid by a member of the general public in the open market on ordinary trade terms between buyers and sellers independent of each other. Expenditure on account of an employee The Ruling covers the situation when an employer (the life insurer) provides a benefit to the employee or associated person (the life agent or relative) by discounting the premiums payable by the life agent on the insurance policy. It does not seek to address the situation when the life insurer pays the life insurance premium of a life agent. When a life insurer pays a life agent’s insurance premiums, that expenditure will be expenditure on account of an employee if the employee is liable to pay the insurance premiums. Expenditure on account of an employee is monetary remuneration and is assessable income to the employee. When a life insurer pays a life agent’s insurance premiums, and the life insurer is liable for those premiums, that expenditure is a fringe benefit (unless expressly excluded from the definition of fringe benefit in section CI 1).

BOAT LIFT STORAGE SYSTEMS DRAFT GENERAL DEPRECIATION DETERMINATION No general economic depreciation rate exists for boat lift storage systems: submersible devices that lift small boats clear of the water for cleaning, maintenance, and/or storage. The device is operated by positioning the boat over the lift, and air is then forced into two flotation chambers. The lift rises, lifting the boat clear of the water to enable cleaning or maintenance to be carried out. The lift can also be used to store a boat, rather than leaving it in the water for prolonged periods. The Commissioner proposes to issue a general depreciation determination that will insert a new asset class of “Boat Lift Storage System (Inflatable)” into both the “Leisure” industry category and the “Lifting” and “Transportation” asset categories, with a depreciation rate of 22% D.V. (15.5% S.L.), based on an estimated useful life of 8 years. The draft determination is reproduced below. The proposed new depreciation rates are based on the estimated useful life set out in the determination and a residual value of 13.5%.

Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 4 (April 2000) 14 2000 INTERNATIONAL TAX DISCLOSURE EXEMPTION ITR11 Introduction Section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) requires people to disclose interests they hold in foreign entities. Under section 61(1) of the TAA, a person who has a control or income interest in a foreign company or an interest in a foreign investment fund (FIF) at any time during the income year must disclose the interest held. However, section 61(2) allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to exempt any person or class of persons from this requirement if disclosure is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules (as defined by section OZ 1) contained in the Income Tax Act 1994 (ITA). Under section 61(2), the Commissioner has issued an international tax disclosure exemption which applies for the income year ended 31 March 2000. This exemption may be cited as “International Tax Disclosure Exemption ITR11”, and the full text appears at the end of this item. Scope of exemption The scope of the 2000 disclosure exemption is the same as the 1999 exemption. Interests held by residents Disclosure is required by residents for these interests: •an interest held in a FIF •an “income interest of 10% or greater” held in a foreign company. The disclosure obligation applies to all foreign companies regardless of the country of residence. An “income interest of 10% or greater” is defined in section OB 1 of the ITA. For the purposes of determining exemption from disclosure it includes these interests: 1.An income interest held directly in a foreign company 2.An income interest held indirectly through any interposed foreign company 3.An income interest held by an associated person (which is not a controlled foreign company) as defined by section OD 8 (3) of the ITA. Example If a husband and wife each hold an income interest of 5% in a Cayman Islands company, the interests would not be exempt from disclosure because the husband and wife are associated persons under section OD 8(3)(d). Under the associated persons test they are each deemed to hold the other’s interests, so they each hold an “income interest of 10% or greater” which must be disclosed. They are not required to account for attributed foreign income or loss under the controlled foreign company rules. However, they would have to account for FIF income or loss under the FIF rules. In this example the husband and wife must disclose their interests as interests in a foreign company and as interests in a FIF. However, only the FIF interests should be disclosed on an IR 4H series form (see “Overlap of interests” below). Foreign company interests A resident who holds a control or income interest in a foreign company must disclose that interest, regardless of the company’s country of residence. The 2000 international tax disclosure exemption also makes no distinction about residence, and any interest in a foreign company which is an “income interest of 10% or greater” must be disclosed. Disclosure is to be made on an IR 4G “Interest in a Foreign Company Disclosure Schedule” form. The disclosure exemption makes no distinction on the residence of a foreign company for these reasons: •Attributed (non-dividend) repatriation rules apply to an “income interest of 10% or greater” in a controlled foreign company (CFC) regardless of the CFC’s country of residence. •To identify tax preferences applied by the taxpayer (whether or not specified in Schedule 3, Part B of the ITA) in respect of an interest held in a foreign company which is resident in a Schedule 3, Part A of the ITA jurisdiction (i.e., Australia, Canada, Federal Republic of Germany, Japan, Norway, United Kingdom and the United States of America). •The requirement for a CFC which is resident in a country not listed in Schedule 3, Part A of the ITA to attribute foreign income or loss from 1 April 1993. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 4 (April 2000) 15 Foreign investment fund interests An interest in a foreign entity must be disclosed if it constitutes an “interest in a foreign investment fund” specified within section CG 15(1) of the ITA. These types of interest must be disclosed: •Rights in a foreign company or anything deemed to be a company for the purposes of the ITA (eg a unit trust). •An entitlement to benefit from a foreign superannuation scheme. •An entitlement to benefit from a foreign life insurance policy. •An interest in an entity specified in Schedule 4, Part A of the ITA (no entities were listed when this TIB went to press). However, any interest that does not fall within the above types or which is specifically excluded as an interest in a FIF under section CG 15(2) does not have to be disclosed. The following are listed in section CG 15(2) as exemptions from what constitutes an interest in a FIF: •An “income interest of 10% or greater” in a CFC. •An interest in a foreign company that is resident and liable to income tax in a country or territory specified in Schedule 3, Part A of the ITA (i.e., Australia, Canada, Federal Republic of Germany, Japan, Norway, United Kingdom and the United States of America). •An interest in an employment-related foreign superannuation scheme. •A qualifying foreign private annuity, unless an election has been made to remain within the FIF regime, by the due date for filing the person’s 2000 tax return. See Inland Revenue’s booklet Overseas Private Pensions (IR 258A) for more information. •Interests in foreign entities held by a natural person, if the aggregate cost or expenditure incurred in acquiring the interests remains under $20,000 at all times during the income year. •An interest held by a natural person in a foreign entity located in a country where exchange controls prevent the person deriving any profit or gain or disposing of the interest for New Zealand currency or consideration readily convertible to New Zealand currency. •An interest in a foreign life insurance policy or foreign superannuation scheme acquired by a natural person before he or she became a New Zealand resident for the first time, for a period of up to four years. There is more information on exemptions from the FIF rules in Inland Revenue’s “Foreign investment funds” booklet (IR 275B). A resident who holds an interest in a FIF at any time during the 2000 income year must disclose the interest and calculate FIF income or loss on the form “Interest in foreign investment fund disclosure schedule and worksheet” (IR 4H). The FIF rules allow a person four options to calculate FIF income or loss (accounting profits method, branch equivalent method, comparative value method and deemed rate of return method), so the Commissioner has prescribed five forms under the IR 4H series to disclose and calculate FIF income or loss from an interest in a FIF using one of the methods. Overlap of interests A situation may arise where a person is required to furnish a disclosure for an interest in a foreign company which is also an interest in a FIF. For example, a person with an “income interest of 10% or greater” in a foreign company which is not a CFC is strictly required to disclose both an interest held in a foreign company and an interest held in a FIF. However, to meet the disclosure obligations only one disclosure return (either the IR 4G form or the appropriate IR 4H series form) is required for each interest a person holds in a foreign entity. Here are the general rules for determining which disclosure return to file: 1.Use the appropriate IR 4H series form to disclose all FIF interests, and in particular: •an interest in a foreign company which is not resident in a Schedule 3, Part A country and is not a CFC (regardless of the level of interest held) •an income interest of less than 10% in a CFC which is not resident in a Schedule 3, Part A country •an interest in a foreign life insurance policy or foreign superannuation scheme, regardless of the country or territory in which the entity was resident. 2.Use the IR 4G or IR 4GS form to disclose an “income interest of 10% or greater” in a foreign company (regardless of the country of residence) that is not being disclosed on the appropriate IR 4H series form. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 4 (April 2000) 16 Disclosure is not required on either the IR 4G or IR 4H forms for an income interest of less than 10% in a foreign company (whether a CFC or not) which is also not a FIF interest. An example is an interest which is excluded under the Schedule 3, Part A exemption of the FIF rules. Interests held by non-residents The 2000 disclosure exemption excludes the need for interests held by non-residents in foreign companies and FIFs to be disclosed. This would apply for example to an overseas company operating in New Zealand (through a branch) in respect of its interests in foreign companies and FIFs. The purpose of the international tax rules is to make sure that New Zealand residents are taxed on their share of the income of any overseas interests they hold. However, under the international tax rules, non- residents are not required to calculate or attribute income under the CFC regime (section CG 6(1) of the ITA 1994). In addition, under section CG 16(4) of the ITA 1994 a non-resident is not to be treated as deriving or incurring any FIF income or loss. The disclosure of non-residents holdings in foreign companies or FIFs is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules. Summary The 2000 international tax disclosure exemption removes the requirement of a resident to disclose an interest held in a foreign company (if the interest is not also an interest in a FIF) that does not constitute an “income interest of 10% or greater” (ie it is less than 10%). The disclosure exemption is not affected by the foreign company’s country of residence. Further, an interest in a FIF must be disclosed. The 2000 disclosure exemption also removes the requirement for a non-resident to disclose interests held in foreign companies and FIFs. Persons not required to comply with section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 This exemption may be cited as “International Tax Disclosure Exemption ITR11” 1.Reference This exemption is made under section 61(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. It details interests in foreign companies in relation to which any person is not required to comply with the requirement in section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to make disclosure of their interests, for the income year ending 31 March 2000. This exemption does not apply to interests in foreign companies which are interests in foreign investment funds, unless that interest is held by a non-resident of New Zealand. 2.Interpretation In this exemption, unless the context otherwise requires, expressions used have the same meaning as in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 or the international tax rules (as defined by section OZ 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994). 3.Exemption (i)Any person who has an income interest or a control interest in a foreign company (not being an interest in a foreign investment fund), in the income year ending 31 March 2000, is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 in respect of that interest and that income year, unless the interest held by that person during any accounting period of the foreign company (the last day of which falls within that income year of the person), would constitute an “income interest of 10% or greater”, as defined by section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994, as if the foreign company was a controlled foreign company. (ii)Any non-resident person who has an income interest or a control interest in a foreign company or an interest in a foreign investment fund in the income year ending 31 March 2000, is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 in respect of that interest and that income year if either or both of the following apply: •No attributed foreign income or loss arises in respect of that interest in that foreign company by virtue of section CG 6(1) of the Income Tax Act 1994, and/or •No foreign investment fund income or loss arises in respect of that interest in that foreign investment fund by virtue of section CG 16(4) of the Income Tax Act 1994. This exemption is made by me acting under delegated authority from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue pursuant to section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This exemption is signed on the 7th day of April 2000. Max Carr National Manager, Corporates Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 4 (April 2000) 17 FOREIGN CURRENCY AMOUNTS – CONVERSION TO NZ CURRENCY The tables in this item list exchange rates acceptable to Inland Revenue for converting foreign currency amounts to New Zealand currency under the controlled foreign company (CFC) and foreign investment fund (FIF) rules for the 12 months ending 31 March 2000. The conversion rates for the first six months of each income year are published in the Tax Information Bulletin following the end of the September quarter, and the rates for the full 12 months rates at the end of each income year. To convert foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for any country listed, divide the foreign currency amount by the exchange rate shown. Table A Use this table to convert foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for: •branch equivalent income or loss under the CFC or FIF rules under section CG 11(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994 •foreign tax credits calculated under the branch equivalent method for a CFC or FIF under section LC 4(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act 1994 •FIF income or loss calculated under the accounting profits, comparative value (except if Table B applies) or deemed rate of return methods under section CG 16(11) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Key X Y x is the exchange rate on the 15th day of the month, or if no exchange rates were quoted on that day, on the next day on which they were quoted. y is the average of the mid-month exchange rates for that month and the previous 11 months. Example 1 A CFC resident in Hong Kong has an accounting period ending on 31 December 1999. Branch equivalent income for the period 1 January 1999 to 31 December 1999 is 200,000 Hong Kong dollars (HKD). HKD 200,000 ÷ 4.1091 = NZ$48,672.46 A similar calculation would be needed for a FIF using the branch equivalent or accounting profits methods. Example 2 A taxpayer with a 31 March balance date purchases shares in a Philippines company (which is a FIF) for 350,000 pesos on 7 December 1999. Using the comparative value or deemed rate of return methods, the cost is converted as follows: PHP 350,000 ÷ 20.3788 = NZ$17,174.71 Alternatively, the exchange rate can be calculated by averaging the exchange rates “x” which apply to each complete month in the foreign company’s accounting period. Example 3 A CFC resident in Singapore was formed on 21 April 1999 and has a balance date of 30 November 1999. During this period, branch equivalent income of 500,000 Singapore dollars was derived. (i)Calculating the average monthly exchange rate for the complete months May-November 1998: (0.9496 + 0.9195 + 0.8833 + 0.8872 + 0.8911 + 0.8560 + 0.8610) ÷ 7 = 0.8925 (ii)Conversion to New Zealand currency: SGD 500,000 ÷ 0.8925 = NZ$560,206.16 Table B Table B lists the end of month exchange rates acceptable to Inland Revenue for the 12 month period ending 31 March 1999. Use this table for converting foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for: •items “a” (market value of the FIF interest on the last day of the income year) and “c” (market value of the FIF interest on the last day of the previous income year) of the comparative value formula •foreign tax credits paid on the last day of any month calculated under the branch equivalent method for a CFC or FIF under section LC 4(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 4 (April 2000) 18 Example 4 A New Zealand resident with a balance date of 31 December 1999 held an interest in an FIF resident in Thailand. The market value of the FIF interest at 31 December 1999 (item “a” of the comparative value formula) was 500,000 Thailand baht (THB). THB 500,000 ÷ 19.5650 = NZ$25,555.84 Note: If you need an exchange rate for a country or a day not listed in these tables, contact one of New Zealand’s major trading banks. Round the exchange rate calculations to four decimal places wherever possible.

(April 2000) 22 ACCIDENT INSURANCE AMENDMENT ACT 2000 AND THE ACCIDENT INSURANCE TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS ACT 2000 Introduction Legislation introduced in December last year providing for the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) to be the sole insurer for workplace accidents from 1 July 2000 was enacted on 25 March 2000. The new ACC legislation has resulted in minor amendments to tax legislation. From 1 April 2000 private insurers cannot write any new accident insurance contracts and from that date the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) will cover new employers and uninsured employers. All employers will be covered by the ACC from 1 July 2000. Private insurers will remain responsible for the (continuing) cost of workplace accidents that occur between 1 July 1999 and 30 June 2000 for which they have provided cover. Background The Government has enacted legislation to return the provision of insurance cover for workplace accidents to the ACC from 1 July 2000. Recently the insurance cover for workplace accidents had been opened up to competition from private insurers. Inland Revenue will continue to collect the following on behalf of the ACC: Residual claims levy. Payable annually by employers, the self-employed and private domestic workers. It funds the continuing cost of work-related injuries sustained before 1 July 1999 and non-work injuries sustained before 1 July 1992. Earners’ account levy. Payable annually by the self- employed. It funds the continuing cost of non-work injuries sustained between 1 July 1992 and 1 July 1999. Earner premium. Payable by all employees, including shareholder-employees and private domestic workers. It provides employees with continuing cover from the ACC for non-work injuries. The earner premium includes the earners’ account levy and is collected by Inland Revenue as a component of PAYE deductions from employers or as part of the end-of-year return for the self-employed. Key features The main changes relating to taxation are outlined below. Because the ACC will be the sole provider of accident insurance cover for workplace accidents, a new section has been inserted into the Income Tax Act 1994 to specify when the employers’ premium is deductible. New section ED 1B provides that the employers’ premium is deductible in the income year the premium becomes due and payable. Special rules apply when the taxpayer is a client of an agent and has an extension of time for filing income tax returns. To enable the ACC to identify liable employers and assess the premium payable by those employers, a new section has been added to the Accident Insurance Act 1998. New section 281G allows the ACC to seek information from Inland Revenue on employers and the total salary and wages paid. Other tax-related changes are very minor. Application date The new section ED 1B of the Income Tax Act 1994 and the new section 281G of the Accident Insurance Act 1998 apply from 1 April 2000.

WHETHER SUBSEQUENT AMENDING ASSESSMENTS SUPERSEDE EARLIER ONES; WHETHER AUTHORITY CAN CONSIDER OBJECTIONS TO EARLIER ASSESSMENTS; WHETHER BASF PRINCIPLE PREVENTS COMMISSIONER ISSUING FURTHER ASSESSMENTS ONCE ASSESSMENT OBJECTED TO Case:Dandelion Investments Limited v CIR Decision date:6 March 2000 Act:The Income Tax Act 1976 Keywords:Assessments, BASF principle Summary The Court of Appeal upheld the judgment of the High Court and dismissed the objector’s appeal. Facts This was an appeal from the High Court judgment of Chambers J (reported at (1999) 19 NZTC 15,317). The Commissioner had made a series of assessments relying on section 99 (now section BG1). The assessment objected to was the second of four assessments made. The objector argued that each assessment was replaced by the one following and that the Commissioner was statute barred from relying on the last in the series as it was greater than the very first assessment made. Thus, as the second assessment was “cancelled” or “superseded” by a later one the Authority should allow the objection made to that assessment. The objector also argued that the BASF principle applied to prevent the Commissioner from issuing a further assessment once one had been objected to (this is derived from (1995) 17 NZTC 12,136). Decision The Court Of Appeal rejected the argument that the latest assessment, being outside the 4 year period, must be compared to the first assessment ever done to determine whether or not it is greater than that assessment. The point was described as “novel” by the objector. The Court of Appeal replied they did not imagine that anyone has previously considered it worth arguing. The Court of Appeal also found that the words “the assessment” include all lawful amendments to that original assessment. Therefore an assessment outside the 4-year period is compared to the last valid assessment (being, in this case, the amended assessment). Thus an amended assessment does not cancel or supersede an earlier assessment but changes it: “The amendment changes the earlier assessment in some respect or respects but it should not be regarded as necessarily completely replacing the earlier assessment. There may be cases in which this is what occurs. But in the more conventional situation the original assessment and its amendment or amendments have to be understood in combination.” Therefore, a change to an earlier assessment on a basis differing from the basis of objection does not prevent the objection proceeding: if it did the Court Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 4 (April 2000) 25 considered such a result “ridiculous”. So the Authority had the ability to consider and determine the objection to an earlier assessment that had subsequently been amended. “...we can see no basis in terms of the statutory scheme, any specific statutory provision, or any case law, upon which we should hold that an amendment has automatic and inevitable effect of removing altogether from contention the assessment which it is amending.” The Court of Appeal found that the BASF principle was inapplicable in this case. The principle acts to prevent the Commissioner altering a stance taken in a matter now before the TRA or Court. This was to prevent injustice to taxpayers. But the Court of Appeal said that: “If, while a case stated is pending, a further assessment is made which has no effect on the matters at issue on the case stated, the BASF principle cannot avail the taxpayer. The further assessment does not in such circumstances prejudice the taxpayer’s position on the case stated at all.” The Court bemoaned the use of delaying tactics and emphasised the need for a “firm approach to this sort of tactical manoeuvring” favouring litigation procedures that are “simple and straightforward”. The objector claimed that the payments were a donation by the lessor to the objector to do with as it wished and therefore were not subject to GST. Decision Judge Barber held that the payments were in fact consideration for the objector entering into the lease and therefore were subject to GST. His Honour found that overall the evidence, especially the documentary evidence, supported the contention that the payments were consideration for a service supplied by the objector, namely the entering into of the lease agreement. Judge Barber placed emphasis on the fact that none of the documents, such as the lease agreement, the deed of lease and various letters negotiating the lease both to and from the objector, ever stated that the payments were to be a donation to the objector. Many of those documents also stated that the payments were to be used by the objector to renovate and repair the premises. WHETHER PAYMENT TO RELIGIOUS ORGANISATION ON ENTERING INTO LEASE AGREEMENT WAS A CONSIDERATION SUBJECT TO GST OR A DONATION Case:TRA Number 97/092. Decision Number 9/2000 Decision date:14 March 2000 Act:The Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Keywords:Payment, taxable supply Summary Judge Barber upheld the Commissioner’s assessments. Facts The objector, a religious organisation registered for GST, received a $20,000 payment from the owner and lessor of a building on signing a long-term lease to use part of that building. The payment was made in two instalments of $10,000. The Commissioner assessed the objector for GST of $2,222.22 on the basis that the payments were consideration for a taxable supply, namely, the objector entering into the lease agreement. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 4 (April 2000) 26 Judge Barber found on the evidence that the payment was conditional on two levels: 1.The payment was conditional upon the objector entering into the lease agreement with the Landlord. 2.The payment was conditional on its use by the objector for renovating and repairing the lease premises. There was some conflicting evidence between the lessor, who appeared as a witness for the Commissioner, and the objector. His Honour observed that the objector was entirely credible, but referred to the confusion and misunderstanding between the objector and the lessor as to the nature of the payments. Judge Barber concluded that the bulk of the evidence supported the Commissioner’s contentions. The employer commenced a restructuring process in 1988 with effect from 1 July 1989. At that time the objector was approaching his optional retirement date of 18 July 1990 and his compulsory retirement date of 18 July 1995. As a result of the restructuring the objector was placed in a different position to that he had occupied previously. This position attracted a lower salary but, in consideration of this, he was paid an abating equalisation allowance. The objector considered he had been disadvantaged by the restructuring and resisted accepting the position offered. On 11 November 1991 the objector received an ultimatum from the employer to work in the new position, or face dismissal. On 28 February 1991, as a result of the ultimatum, the objector gave three months notice of his intention to retire. The objector commenced an action in the Employment Court against his former employer alleging that the termination of his employment amounted to an unjustifiable constructive dismissal. On 11 November 1991 the Employment Court found that the objector had suffered a personal grievance by virtue of his unjustifiable constructive dismissal and awarded him the following damages under the Labour Relations Act 1987: WHETHER EMPLOYMENT COURT AWARD FOR UNJUSTIFIABLE DISMISSAL ASSESSABLE AS MONETARY REMUNERATION; WHETHER LEGAL EXPENSES DEDUCTIBLE Case:TRA Number 97/93. Decision Number 11/2000 Decision date:20 March 2000 Act:The Income Tax Act 1976 Keywords:Deductibility of legal expenses, monetary remuneration Summary Judge Barber found in favour of the Commissioner and held that the Commissioner was correct in assessing the objector for income tax. Facts In the 1993 income year the taxpayer received an Employment Court award totalling $126,000 for unjustifiable constructive dismissal by his former employer. The Commissioner assessed the objector for income tax on $96,000 of the total award on the basis that it was monetary remuneration. The Commissioner also disallowed the objector’s deduction in respect of legal fees incurred. The circumstances leading up to the objector’s constructive dismissal and subsequent award for damages are summarised below: Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 4 (April 2000) 27 •Loss of wages due to date of hearing (section 229)$46,000 •Humiliation etc (section 227(c)(i))$30,000 •Loss of benefits (section 227(c)(ii)) $ 50,000 $126,000 Decision Judge Barber found in favour of the Commissioner on both issues. The objector argued that he received the payment as damages for a personal grievance and not as an entitlement under his employment contract. He submitted that none of the amount awarded pursuant to the Employment Court award was compensation for loss of office or loss of employment, and accordingly did not come within the definition of ‘monetary remuneration’ in section 2 of the Income Tax Act 1976. The objector also submitted that the payment came within the definition of ‘redundancy payment’ in section 68(1) of the Income Tax Act 1976. At the time of the award redundancy payments received concessional tax treatment. Judge Barber found on the facts that there was no reason to find other than that the objector was bound by his claim in the Employment Court that he was unjustifiably dismissed. His Honour held that the objector did not retire, as termination of his employment was in fact involuntary. His Honour found that the award under the Labour Relations Act 1987 did come within the definition of ‘monetary remuneration’ in section 2 of the Income Tax Act 1976. Judge Barber also found that the award did not come within the definition of ‘redundancy payment’ in section 68(1) of the Income Tax Act 1976. Judge Barber held that the payment was not made (either causally or temporally) on the occasion of the termination of the objector’s employment. His Honour found that the payment simply did not have the character of a redundancy payment in its overall factual context. The $96,000 was held to be awarded for a combination of loss of wages and loss of benefits in respect of or in relation to the employment of the objector and therefore it was assessable as monetary remuneration. His Honour upheld the submissions of the Commissioner that the objector was not entitled to deduct his legal fees because the incurring of those fees related to income from employment. From the income year commencing 1 April 1988, no deduction is allowed for expenditure incurred in the production of income from employment as defined in section 105(1) of the Income Tax Act 1976. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 4 (April 2000) 28 WHETHER EMPLOYMENT COURT AWARD FOR LOSS OF BENEFIT ASSESSABLE AS MONETARY REMUNERATION; CAPITAL PAYMENTS MAY BE ASSESS- ABLE IF MONETARY REMUNERATION The Commissioner agreed in his submissions that the method of calculation of the compensation was not determinative: in determining the nature of any receipt one must look at the loss for which it is compensation. Judge Barber agreed, noting the Employment Court’s finding that the objector was compensated for a loss of skills and experience which the denied standards position offered. The Commissioner conceded that the payment had the character of capital, relating as it did to the objector’s income earning structure. His Honour upheld the Commissioner’s submissions that payments of a capital nature do not escape assessment if they fall within the definition of ‘monetary remuneration’. He considered the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Shell New Zealand Limited v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,303, and his own decision in Case L92 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,530. He did not go so far as to term the receipt an item of capital, but confirmed that its nature was immaterial if captured by the definition of ‘monetary remuneration’. His Honour held that the receipt was clearly “... a benefit in money in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of the taxpayer.” His Honour rejected the Commissioner’s alternative proposition that the receipt was “... compensation for loss of office...” being compensation for the loss of ability to render services of a more senior nature. His Honour preferred the orthodox approach to the concept: “... because the objector did not lose his job ie what he had.” The Authority rejected the objector’s argument that the payment was in respect of a ‘de facto restraint’. His Honour found that the payment clearly reflected money lost ‘one way or another’; it was clearly in respect of or in relation to a contract of employment, and that it was also ‘some kind of emolument’. Case:TRA Number98/047. Decision Number 10/2000 Decision date:15 March 2000 Act:The Income Tax Act 1976 Keywords:Employment, compensation, “monetary remuneration”, “benefit in money”, loss of office, capital Summary Judge Barber found for the Commissioner by consent without formal hearing but after full written submissions. Facts The objector is an airline pilot who received a compensation payment of $10,000 from the Employment Court in an action against his employer. The Employment Court found that the objector had been wrongfully treated by his employer in that he was not appointed to a flight standards position when he should have been. Although retaining his employment as a senior captain, the airline had used various unwarranted grounds to deny the objector a promotion. The Employment Court awarded the objector the sum under section 227(c)(ii) of the Labour Relations Act 1987, for the loss of a benefit which he might reasonably have expected to have attained. The Commissioner assessed the objector on the sum awarded and contended that the payment was assessable under sections 65(2)(b) of the Income Tax Act 1976, being monetary remuneration. The objector contended the sum is an item of capital and therefore not assessable. Decision The objector made extensive reference to the decision of the Employment Court, stressing that the mechanism by which the award was determined, ie reference to loss of future income, was not determinative of the nature of the loss. He submitted that the compensation was awarded for loss of a ‘tenure’ which was an item of capital. He further submitted that the compensation was awarded in respect of a ‘de facto restraint of trade’. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 4 (April 2000) 29 COMMISSIONER ENTITLED TO PRIORITY FOR GST DEBTS OF PARTNERSHIP WHERE PARTNERS ADJUDGED BANKRUPT Case:CIR v Official Assignee Decision date:23 March 2000 Act:The Goods and Services tax Act 1985 Summary The Commissioner was successful in his appeal from the High Court Facts On December 1998, Mr and Mrs Mehrtens were both adjudged bankrupt. They were the only partners in a partnership registered with the Commissioner of Inland Revenue for the purposes of accounting for GST. When Mr and Mrs Mehrtens were adjudged bankrupt their partnership owed GST of $9,887.65, together with penalties of $3,979.37. On or about 8 January 1999 the Commissioner filed two proofs of debt with the Official Assignee in relation to the partners’ debts and penalties. The proofs of debt claimed priority for the GST debts but not the penalties. By separate notices dated 29 March 1999, the Official Assignee advised the Commissioner that it rejected the claim for priority of the GST debts. Accordingly, the Official Assignee advised that he would defer payment of the Commissioner’s claim until all personal creditors were paid in full pursuant to section 106 of the Insolvency Act 1967. In fact, the Official Assignee did not receive any personal claims on the estates of Mr and Mrs Mehrtens (aside from claims for accident compensation levies, penalties and income tax). Mr and Mrs Mehrtens have, however, approximately 60 unsecured creditors through the partnership of the estate who are collectively owed a sum in the region of $220,000. Approximately $20,000 is available for distribution to creditors. Decision The Commissioner is entitled to priority under section 42. The Court of Appeal held that while “association” is defined under section 17A to include a partnership, section 17B only applies where the association has been liquidated. As the partners in this case were each adjudged bankrupt, section 17B does not apply.

The Commissioner can issue binding rulings in certain situations. Inland Revenue is bound to follow such a ruling if a taxpayer to whom the ruling applies calculates tax liability based on it. For full details of how binding rulings work, see our information booklet Guide to Binding Rulings IR 715 or the article on page 1 of Tax Information Bulletin Vol 6, No 12 (May 1995) or Vol 7, No 2 (August 1995). You can order these publications free of charge by downloading them from our website at www.ird.govt.nz NOTICE OF EXTENSION OF PUBLIC RULING 1.This is a notice of extension of a public ruling made under section 91DD of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 2.Public ruling No 97/10 entitled “Importers and GST input tax deductions” was signed on 22 October 1997 and notice of its making appeared in the Gazette of 30 October 1997. A copy of the ruling appeared in Inland Revenue’s Ta x Information Bulletin Vol 9, No 11 (November 1997). 3.Public ruling No 97/10 originally applied to claims for input tax deductions on GST levied by the New Zealand Customs Service on goods imported into New Zealand between 1 April 1997 and 31 March 2000. The ruling now applies to claims for input tax deductions between 1 April 2000 and 31 March 2005. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE “UNIT TRUST” AND “QUALIFYING TRUST” DEFINITIONS Notice of non-renewal of public ruling BR Pub 95/5A Ruling number and publication details: BR Pub 95/5A appeared in Vol 8, No 10 (December 1996) of Inland Revenue’s Tax Information Bulletin at page 15. Ruling title: Relationship between the “unit trust” and “qualifying trust” definitions. Ruling application period: Applies from the 1997—98 income year to the 1999—2000 income year. Date of this notice: 20 April 2000. The Commissioner has determined that upon expiry the above-referenced public ruling will not be re- issued. It is considered that the legislation on the subject matter covered by the ruling is clear. The non-renewal of the ruling should not be taken as indication of change to the interpretation of the legislation as set out in the ruling. The Commissioner’s view on the issue remains the same. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 5 (May 2000) 5 BAD DEBTS—WRITING OFF DEBTS AS BAD FOR GST AND INCOME TAX PURPOSES PUBLIC RULING—BR Pub 00/03 •in the case of a company (other than one falling within the above class), by an executive or other responsible officer of the company with the authority to do so, making the appropriate bookkeeping entries in the books of account of the company recording the debt as written off; and •in the case of a taxpayer (other than a company) that maintains double-entry accounts, by an authorised person making the appropriate bookkeeping entries in the books of account of the business recording the debt as written off; and •in the case of a taxpayer who is an unincorporated sole trader or small unincorporated business taxpayer who does not maintain double-entry accounts, by the taxpayer noting, in the bookkeeping records of the taxpayer setting out the amount owed by the bad debtor, that the debt has been written off, and the date of the writing off. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: 1.An income tax deduction is permitted in terms of section DJ 1(a)(iii) of the Income Tax Act. 2.A deduction from GST output tax is permitted in terms of section 26(1)(c) of the GST Act. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2004. This Ruling is signed by me on the 20th day of April 2000. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Note (not part of ruling): This Ruling is essentially the same as public ruling BR Pub 96/3A, published in Ta x Information Bulletin Vol 8, No 10 (December 1996), but this Ruling’s period of application is from 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2004. Some formatting changes have also been made. BR Pub 96/3A applies up until the end of the 1998—1999 income year. This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references to the Income Tax Act are to the Income Tax Act 1994 and all references to the GST Act are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. This Ruling applies in respect of section DJ 1(a)(iii) of the Income Tax Act and section 26(1)(c) of the GST Act. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the writing off of a debt (or part of a debt) as a bad debt, for income tax and/or GST purposes, in the following circumstances: •An existing debt is owing to the taxpayer; and •The debt is adjudged as “bad” when, having considered the facts objectively, a reasonably prudent business person would conclude that there is no reasonable likelihood that the debt will be paid; and •The records kept by the taxpayer comply with the record keeping requirements contained in the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the GST Act; and •The bad debt is “written off” in accordance with the accounting and record keeping systems maintained by the taxpayer, involving, at a minimum, write-off: •in the case of a large corporate or business taxpayer who maintains a computerised bad debts system, by an authorised person making the appropriate entry in that system recording the debt as written off; and Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 5 (May 2000) 6 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR PUB 00/03 financial arrangement where the accruals rules apply to the taxpayer in respect of the financial arrangement, the bad debt is not a loss of capital subject to section BD 2(2)(e); and (iii) The debt is proved to the satisfaction of the Commissioner to have been actually written off as a bad debt by the taxpayer in the income year; and (iv) In any case where- (A) The taxpayer is a company; and (B) The debt is owed by a company (referred to in this subparagraph as the “debtor”); and (C) The application of the amount giving rise to the debt is taken into account in calculating a net loss (referred to in this subparagraph as the “resultant loss”) of the debtor or any other company funded (directly or indi- rectly) by the debtor; and (D) Any one or more amounts have been offset under section IG 2 of this Act or section 191A of the Income Tax Act 1976 by the taxpayer (or by any other company which is at any time in the income year in which the resultant loss is incurred in the same group of companies as the taxpayer), in any income year commencing on or after 1 April 1993 and preceding the income year in which the bad debt is written off, in respect of the resultant loss,— the debt exceeds the aggregate of the amounts so offset. Section DJ 1(a)(iii) sets out one of the requirements to be satisfied to get a bad debt deduction, namely that the debt must be proved to the satisfaction of the Commissioner to have been actually written off as a bad debt by the taxpayer in the income year. It is this part of the income tax bad debt deduction provision that is addressed in the Ruling and discussed more fully in the Application of the legislation section of this commentary. Other section DJ 1(a) requirements (in summary form) that must also be satisfied are: •Section DJ 1(a)(i)—If the debt is an amount owing under a financial arrangement and the accruals rules apply to the taxpayer in respect of the financial arrangement, a deduction must be allowed under section EH 5. However, any such bad debt deduction is still conditional on satisfaction of the section DJ 1(a)(iii) requirement that the debt is proved to the satisfaction of the Commissioner to have been actually written off as a bad debt by the taxpayer in the income year. \[NOTE: The accruals rules have recently been rewritten by This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in public ruling BR Pub 00/03 (“the Ruling”). Background The Income Tax Act and the GST Act allow taxpayers and/or registered persons a deduction for bad debts if certain criteria are met. Criteria common to both Acts are the requirements that a debt must be both bad and written off before any deduction can be made. The issues that arise when claiming a bad debt deduction are: when a debt is considered bad, and what is required to write off a debt as bad. These issues were previously dealt with in public ruling BR Pub 96/3A and that ruling has been replaced by this Ruling from 1 April 1999. The previous ruling concluded that a debt (or part of a debt) must be both bad and written off before any person can claim an income tax deduction or a deduction from GST output tax (assuming that other legislative requirements in the GST Act and the Income Tax Act are also satisfied). The Ruling sets out the tests to apply in deciding whether or not a debt is “bad” and what is sufficient “writing off” of a bad debt. Legislation—Income Tax Act Section BD 2(1)(b) allows a deduction for any expenditure or loss incurred by a taxpayer in deriving the taxpayer’s gross income or necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving the taxpayer’s gross income. However, notwithstanding section BD 2(1)(b), section DJ 1(a) prohibits the deduction of bad debts, except where and to the extent that a number of requirements are met. Section DJ 1 The relevant part of section DJ 1 of the Income Tax Act, in force at the date of commencement of this Ruling (1 April 1999), states: Except as expressly provided in this Act, no deduction is allowed to a taxpayer in respect of any of the following sums or matters: (a)Bad debts, except where and to the extent that,— (i)In the case of a debt which is an amount owing to the taxpayer in respect of a financial arrange- ment where the accruals rules apply to the taxpayer in respect of the financial arrangement, a deduction is allowed under section EH 5; and (ii) In any case other than that of a debt which is an amount owing to the taxpayer in respect of a Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 5 (May 2000) 7 the Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1999. Section DJ 1 as set out above has also been amended with effect from 20 May 1999 to take account of consequential changes made by that Act. A more detailed discussion about bad debts that arise where the accruals rules apply, and the changes made by the above Act, appears at the end of this commentary.\]; and •Section DJ 1(a)(ii)—If the debt is not an amount owing in respect of a financial arrangement to which the accruals rules apply, the bad debt must not be a loss of capital that is subject to section BD 2(2)(e); and •Section DJ 1(a)(iv)—If the taxpayer is a company and the debt is owed to that company by another company (“the debtor”) and •the amount giving rise to the debt is taken into account in calculating a loss incurred by the debtor or any other company funded by the debtor; and •any amounts of that loss have been offset under the group company loss offset provisions in section IG 2, or section 191A of the Income Tax Act 1976, by the taxpayer (or any other company in the same group as the taxpayer in the year the loss is incurred), in any income years from 1993—94 and preceding that in which the bad debt is written off, the deduction allowed for the bad debt is the amount by which the debt exceeds the total amounts offset. Bad debts recovered Under section CE 1(1)(d), amounts received by a person on account of a bad debt for which a deduction has previously been allowed to the person are included as gross income of the person. Legislation—GST Act Section 26 The relevant part of section 26(1) of the GST Act states: Where a registered person - (a)Has made a taxable supply for consideration in money; and (b)Has furnished a return in relation to the taxable period during which the output tax on the supply was attributable and has properly accounted for the output tax on that supply as required under this Act; and (c)Has written off as a bad debt the whole or part of the consideration not paid to that person,- that registered person shall make a deduction under section 20(3) of this Act of that portion of the amount of tax charged in relation to that supply as the amount written off as a bad debt bears to the total consideration for the supply: Section 26 is the main provision applying to bad debts for GST purposes. The section applies to registered persons who account for GST on an invoice or hybrid basis. It also applies to registered persons who account for GST on a payments basis when the relevant supply is by way of a hire purchase sale or a door-to-door sale. Section 26(1) allows a registered person to make a deduction from output tax for that portion of the amount of tax charged in relation to a supply as the amount written off as a bad debt bears to the total consideration for the supply. To claim the deduction, the registered person must satisfy a number of criteria. Section 26(1)(c) sets out one of these, namely that the registered person must have written off as a bad debt the whole or part of the consideration not paid to that person. The other section 26(1) criteria (in summary form) also to be satisfied are that the registered person must have: •Section 26(1)(a)—Made a taxable supply for consideration in money (from which the bad debt arose); and •Section 26(1)(b)—Furnished a return in relation to the taxable period during which the output tax on the supply was attributable, and properly accounted for the output tax on the supply. A proviso is effective if goods are supplied under a hire purchase agreement to which the Hire Purchase Act 1971 applies. In this case the registered person makes a deduction from output tax of the tax fraction (being the tax fraction applicable at the time the hire purchase agreement was entered into) of that portion of the amount written off as a bad debt as the cash price bears to the total amount payable under the hire purchase agreement. A special provision exists for registered persons who supply contracts of insurance relating to earthquakes, wars, and fires (see section 26(1A)). Application of the legislation As indicated earlier, criteria common to both the Income Tax and GST Acts are the requirements that a debt must be both bad and actually written off before any deduction can be made. This section of the commentary is therefore divided into two parts, discussing firstly the tests to apply in deciding whether or not a debt is “bad”, and secondly what is sufficient “writing-off” of a bad debt. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 5 (May 2000) 8 First requirement–debt must be “bad” A debt must be “bad” before it can be written off and before any deduction can be claimed for that debt. Whether or not a debt (or part of a debt) is bad is a question to be determined objectively, rather than a question to be determined by the subjective opinion of any particular individual. The objective test that any person should ask himself or herself in deciding whether or not a debt is bad, is whether a reasonably prudent business person would conclude that there is no reasonable likelihood that the debt will be paid. This objective test was outlined by Tompkins J in the High Court decision of Budget Rent A Car Ltd v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,263, at 12,269: The term “bad debt” is not defined in the Act. It, there- fore, should be given its normal commercial meaning. It is a question of fact to be determined objectively. A debt becomes a bad debt when a reasonably prudent commercial person would conclude that there is no reasonable likelihood that the debt will be paid in whole or in part by the debtor or by someone else either on behalf of the debtor or otherwise. A similar test was outlined by Barber DJ in Case N69 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,541, at 3,548: Naturally, the debts in question must be “bad” to be written off as bad in terms of s. 106(1)(b). This is a question of fact. Generally, an application of that criterion will not be difficult as the debtor will be insolvent. However, the debtor does not need to be insolvent for the debt to be bad. It is only necessary that there be a bona fide assessment that the debtor is unlikely to make payment of the debt. If there is a clear understanding or arrangement that there be long term credit, and if the taxpayer believes that the terms of the credit will be met, then the debt cannot be treated as bad because it is merely a situation of deferred payment. In my view, as well as the need for the writing off to be made bona fide, the circumstances must indicate to a reasonable and prudent business person that, on the balance of probability, the debt is unlikely to be recovered. This is an objective test. The creditor taxpayer may, of course still hope for recovery and is quite entitled to institute recovery proce- dures. It is not necessary to have taken recovery or legal steps. ... It does not follow from the taxpayer hoping for or seeking recovery that a debt is not bad. However, usually, when a debt is assessed as bad, in terms of the type of criteria I have outlined, hopes or efforts of recovery will be futile. The decision in Case N69 was cited with approval by Doogue J in the High Court decision of Graham v CIR, Edwards Graham Ltd & Edwards v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,107, at 12,111. As is evident from the quotations above, different wording is used by the High Court in Budget Rent A Car and the TRA in Case N69 to describe the test of when a debt can be considered written off as bad. To summarise these differences, in Budget Rent A Car the words used were “no reasonable likelihood” that the debt (or part of the debt) will be paid, whereas in Case N69 the words used were that “on the balance of probability, the debt is unlikely to be recovered”. Despite the apparent difference between the words used in the tests applied in Case N69 and in Budget Rent A Car, Barber DJ in Case T27 (1997) 18 NZTC 8,188, at 8,194 stated that his approach in Case N69 was confirmed in Budget Rent A Car. In saying this Barber DJ first cited his own statement containing the test referred to from Case N69 and immediately followed this by stating: That approach was confirmed in Budget Rent A Car Ltd v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,263 and on that point Tompkins J said at 12,269: and then citing the objective test from that case included above. Barber DJ regards the “tests” as the same. The Commissioner agrees with this view. At the time of deciding whether a debt is bad, a person will therefore need to have sufficient information to enable a reasonably prudent business person to form the view that there is no reasonable likelihood that the debt will be paid. The facts needing to be gathered depend on the circumstances surrounding any particular case. While no factor is decisive in itself, factors that are likely to be relevant in most instances are: •The length of time a debt is outstanding – the longer a debt is outstanding the more likely it is that a reasonably prudent business person would consider the debt to be bad. •The efforts that a creditor has taken to collect a debt – the greater the extent to which a person has tried (unsuccessfully) to collect a debt, the more likely it is that a reasonably prudent business person would consider the debt to be bad. •Other information obtained by a creditor - a creditor may have obtained particular information about a debtor, eg through business or personal networks, that would be a factor in leading a reasonably prudent business person to conclude that a debt is bad. For example, a creditor may know that the debtor is in financial difficulties and has defaulted on debts owed to other creditors. A debtor does not need to be insolvent for a debt to be bad (although this will often be the case). Taxpayer’s opinion A debt becomes a bad debt when a reasonably prudent business person objectively concludes that there is no reasonable likelihood that the debt will be paid. In many instances, a taxpayer’s considered opinion will suffice. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 5 (May 2000) 9 However, the Commissioner also recognises that taxpayers have a financial interest in treating a debt as bad. Writing off a debt as bad entitles a taxpayer to: •A deduction in calculating income for income tax purposes, worth up to 39% of the debt, depending on the taxpayer’s marginal income tax rate: •A GST deduction from output tax of the tax fraction of the debt. Because of this, the Commissioner may inquire into the decision to treat a debt as bad in the course of tax audits or other enquiries. It is desirable, therefore, that taxpayers document and retain evidence in relation to their decisions to treat debts as bad to show that they made reasonable decisions. Documentation may include noting down the information from which the decision was made that the debt was bad, and keeping copies of any correspondence relating to the debt. Information required The amount of information required to decide whether a debt is bad depends on the particular circumstances of each case. If the amount involved is small, a reasonably prudent business person is likely to make limited enquiries and take limited recovery action. Particular knowledge or information obtained by a taxpayer may also reduce the need for enquiry. In the final analysis however, the test is always whether the taxpayer has sufficient information to reasonably draw the conclusion that there is no reasonable likelihood that the debt will be paid, even if further or any recovery action were to be taken. Recovery action A creditor is likely to have taken recovery action in most cases before a deduction for a bad debt is made, although it is not a requirement that such action be taken before a decision is made that a debt is bad. However, it is through taking recovery action that most creditors will form an opinion as to whether a debt is bad. While recovery action is being taken, a debt can only be considered bad to the extent that a reasonably prudent business person would consider there is no reasonable likelihood that the debt will be paid. In some instances, taking recovery action may carry with it the reasonable expectation of recovery of some part of the amount involved. However, this will not always be the case. The decision to take recovery action and the extent of that action will depend on the circumstances surrounding any particular case. In some cases, the creditor may take no or only limited recovery action because enough information is held to form a reasonable view that the debt is bad. The amount of information needed depends on the circumstances. Conversely, the creditor may take recovery action even when a reasonable view has been formed that the debt is bad. For a number of reasons the creditor might take recovery action even when it is believed that there is no reasonable likelihood that the debt will be recovered. This may be the case, for example, when the creditor has a policy of pursuing debtors to a certain extent to discourage customers defaulting on debt. Provision for doubtful debts Persons in business who provide credit often find it prudent to make some provision for the likelihood that some of their debtors will not pay. This allowance is generally calculated by estimating a percentage on the basis of past history, and applying that percentage to the total amount of debts owed to the business at balance date. Bad debts are individually identifiable debts that are unlikely to be recovered (in practical terms). The provision for doubtful debts is an estimate of the amount that will become bad debts in the future. The Income Tax Act and the GST Act do not allow any deduction for provisions for doubtful debts. Debts that are partially bad In some cases there may be no reasonable expectation that the debt will be fully recovered, but there may be a reasonable expectation of partial recovery. In this case the part that the creditor has no reasonable expectation of recovering is a bad debt. It is only that part of the debt that the creditor is entitled to write off as bad and claim as a deduction for income tax and GST purposes. Examples of when a debt is/is not bad Example 1 A supplier has supplied goods on credit to Mr B. Mr B owes the supplier $2,000 for the goods. The supplier knows that Mr B has left town, and that mail addressed to him is returned marked “Gone No Address”. In this case it is reasonable to assume that the debt will not be recovered. The money owed by Mr B is a bad debt. Example 2 C owes $100,000 to a company. The credit controller for the company has considered the likelihood of default on every loan currently owing to the company. The credit controller has estimated the likelihood of default for C to be 5%, and wants to know if the company can consider $5,000 of that loan (5% of the $100,000 owing) to be a bad debt. Making an estimate of the likelihood of default on debts is not sufficient for a debt (or a percentage thereof) to be bad. It is not reasonable to assume that the debt is bad. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 5 (May 2000) 10 Example 3 A local dairy has supplied $64 worth of bread and cigarettes to Mrs D on credit. Mrs D used to call into the shop every other day, but has not called into the shop for eight weeks and the dairy has heard that someone else is living in the house Mrs D used to rent. The $64 is still owing. Given the relatively small amount owing and the information known to the dairy, it is reasonable for the dairy to make no further enquiries. On the basis of the dairy’s information, it can be assumed that the money is unlikely to be recovered. It is a bad debt. However, if the sum involved was somewhat larger, it may be reasonable to expect the dairy to make some further enquiry. Example 4 A solicitor has done work for Mr O and billed him for $1,700. The solicitor is on the Board of Trustees of the school attended by Mr O’s children. The solicitor has sent out a number of reminder bills because the bill is four months overdue, but has had no response. Several of the solicitor’s friends and associates have mentioned that Mr O is in financial difficulty and has had one of his vehicles repossessed. The solicitor’s office clerk has noted that Mr O’s name has been cited in the Gazette several times over recent months in respect of court action for unpaid debts. It is reasonable for the solicitor to characterise Mr O’s debt as a bad debt. Example 5 A debtor of Mr F is a company in liquidation. Mr F has given the liquidator notice of a debt of $10,000 owed for goods and services supplied. Mr F is an unsecured creditor. The liquidator has held a meeting of creditors. Mr F attended the meeting and received formal notice of the outcome of the meeting. The liquidator has stated that unsecured creditors will probably receive something between 45 and 50 cents in the dollar. It is reasonable for Mr F to assume that $5,000 of the total debt is bad. He is entitled to write off that part of the debt that is bad in the income year in which he received the formal notice, and to claim a deduction for income tax and GST purposes. Example 6 The same facts exist as in Example 5, but at a later date Mr F receives a letter from the liquidator who advises that the estimate of the likely recovery has been revised. It is now expected that unsecured creditors will be paid between 70 and 75 cents in the dollar. This does not affect the answer given above in Example 5. Also, it has no effect on Mr F’s GST return or income tax return if Mr F has claimed a deduction for the bad debt. If at any stage Mr F receives payment of any part of the 50 cents in the dollar written off, Mr F must: •include it as gross income in the income tax return for the year in which it is received (this will give rise to an income tax liability unless there are losses to offset against it, and may give rise to a provisional tax liability, depending on the taxpayer’s circumstances); and •account for GST on the amount recovered in the same proportion as Mr F was allowed a deduction from output tax when the bad debt was written off. Second requirement–debt must be “written off” The Income Tax Act and the GST Act allow taxpayers and/or registered persons deductions for writing off bad debts. It is not enough that a debt is bad: the bad debt must also be actually written off. Writing off the bad debt is important because this will fix the time at which the deduction can be made. Note that there is no requirement that a debt be written off in the year it becomes bad. As Tompkins J in the High Court decision of Budget Rent A Car Ltd v CIR (supra) at 12,271 stated: A debt is not normally deductible. It does not become a deductible debt if and when it becomes a bad debt. It becomes a deductible debt, if it has been incurred in the production of assessable income, when it is written off. It is the writing off that converts the debt into a deductible debt. It follows that the crucial time is the time of the writing off, not the time the debt becomes a bad debt. It also follows that the income year referred to in s 106(1)(b) is not the year the debt became bad. In my view, the income year referred to is the year during which the bad debt was “actually written off”. There is no provision in the Act that requires the bad debt to be written off in the year the debt became bad. Had that been the intention of the legislature, it would have said so ... Barber DJ in the Taxation Review Authority discussed the requirement to write off bad debts in Case N69 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,541. Barber DJ said at 3,547: I consider it elementary that the writing off of a debt as bad requires something more than the mere recognition by the taxpayer, or one or more of its executives, that a debt is unlikely to be paid. It could be reasoned that only a decision of the taxpayer to write off a debt is needed, subject to the debt being bad. However, I consider that, in terms of sec 106(1)(b), book-keeping steps must also be taken to record that the debt has been written off. Desir- ably, the steps would comprise a directors’ resolution, if the taxpayer is a corporate, and appropriate book-keeping entries. However, it would be adequate for a responsible officer or executive of a corporate or business to merely make the appropriate book-keeping entries if he or she has that authority. An unincorporated sole trader or small unincorporated business would not, of course, have a directorate so that book entries by the trader or his or her manager will suffice. In my view, it is not possible to write off a debt as bad without the making of authorised journal entries in the books of account of the business. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 5 (May 2000) 11 In Case T48 (1998) 18 NCTC 8,325 the Taxation Review Authority held that for a private individual trader, as distinct from an incorporated company, words on ledger cards such as “written off” with the relevant date are sufficient to indicate that the debt had been actually written off as bad. The taxpayers did not have to meet any other book-keeping requirements. Taxpayers must therefore be able to clearly show that the debt has been actually written off as bad. Case law indicates that the minimum requirements to satisfy the actually written off as bad test may vary for different classes of taxpayer based on the differing nature and level of sophistication of the taxpayer’s accounting records. However, no matter what form a taxpayer’s books of account or accounting records may take, those existing in respect of a debt owed by a bad debtor must record that the taxpayer, or an authorised person on behalf of the taxpayer, having decided the debt is bad, has written off the debt accordingly. The minimum requirements considered necessary to meet the written off test for various classes of taxpayer are as follows. The bad debt is “written off” in accordance with the accounting and record keeping systems maintained by the taxpayer, involving, at a minimum, write-off: •in the case of a large corporate or business taxpayer who maintains a computerised bad debts system, by an authorised person making the appropriate entry in that system recording the debt as written off; and •in the case of a company (other than one falling within the above class), by an executive or other responsible officer of the company with the authority to do so, making the appropriate bookkeeping entries in the books of account of the company recording the debt as written off; and •in the case of a taxpayer (other than a company) that maintains double-entry accounts, by an authorised person making the appropriate bookkeeping entries in the books of account of the business recording the debt as written off; and •in the case of a taxpayer who is an unincorporated sole trader or small unincorporated business taxpayer who does not maintain double-entry accounts, by the taxpayer noting, in the bookkeeping records of the taxpayer setting out the amount owed by the bad debtor, that the debt has been written off, and the date of the writing off. Further details of the specific form the necessary write off of a bad debt may take in the creditor taxpayer’s books are outlined in the next section of this commentary. It is the writing off that determines the time when a deduction for a bad debt can be claimed. The necessary writing off must therefore take place before the end of the income year or GST taxable period in which the bad debt deduction is claimed. Writing off a bad debt cannot be backdated. Therefore, if there are numerous debts to review, it is important to allow sufficient time for this exercise, as well as for completing all necessary “writing off” accounting entries before the end of an income year or GST taxable period, to enable any bad debts to be deducted in that year or GST taxable period. In all cases the business records kept by the taxpayer must comply with the requirements of section 22 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and section 75 of the GST Act. Accounts kept by taxpayers Most taxpayers in business keep double-entry accounts. If a person keeps double-entry accounting records, the bad debt must be struck out of the records on which the double-entry accounts are based. If debtors ledgers are maintained, the writing off will be able to be clearly shown by the appropriate bookkeeping entries having been made in the debtors ledger by authorised persons. Generally, this means that the balance in the debtors ledger for the individual debtor must be reduced by the amount of the bad debt. No matter what processes are followed in the course of preparing a person’s double-entry accounts, it is the completion of the appropriate authorised entry(s) actually writing off a debt (which it has been decided is bad in accordance with the tests already outlined) that is essential to deductibility. In cases where a taxpayer does not keep double-entry accounting records and/or does not keep a debtors ledger, the person must write the debt off according to the form of records used. This means that whatever the form of records used, those showing the amount owed by the bad debtor must clearly record that the creditor, having made the decision that the debt is bad (in accordance with the tests already outlined), has written the debt off accordingly. Particular examples of bad debts accepted by the Commissioner as having been written off are: •If a taxpayer’s only records of debts are copies of invoices issued, placing the invoice in a “bad debts” file and indicating on the invoice whether all or part of the invoiced amount is bad and the date, is sufficient. •If a taxpayer’s only records of debts are copies of invoices and copies of statements of account issued from a duplicate account book, marking the copy of the final statement sent out “bad debt – written off” (noting the amount of the debt that is bad and the date) is sufficient. Alternatively, it would also be sufficient for the Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 5 (May 2000) 12 taxpayer to place the relevant invoice in a “bad debts” file indicating on the invoice whether all or part of the invoiced amount is bad and the date this was done. Keeping records for credit control or other purposes For a variety of reasons, a creditor may keep a separate record of bad debts written off. For example, the records may be necessary if the creditor should ever have the opportunity of collecting the debt in the future, or the creditor may want to keep a record of problem customers to avoid future difficulties. As long as these records are quite separate from the accounting base records they will not affect the write off. If the creditor ceases to recognise the debt as an asset for accounting purposes by removing it from the accounting base records, it is written off. More than one set of accounts Some businesses have more than one set of accounts. For example, a company may prepare: •financial accounts for financial reporting purposes to satisfy the requirements of the Companies Act 1955 or 1993; and •management accounts as a basis for management decision-making and control. The sets of accounts may be prepared in quite different ways. For example, statutory requirements are set out in the Financial Reporting Act 1993 for preparing financial reports that are not required when preparing management accounts; and management accounts may be prepared on the basis of estimates for some elements in order to provide very quick reports. When the different sets of accounts rely on the same underlying debtor records, no difficulty arises. As long as the creditor ceases to recognise the debt as an asset for accounting purposes by removing it from the accounting base records, it is written off. However, if the debt is still recognised as an asset in the underlying records, it is not written off. If the different sets of accounts rely on different underlying debtor records (which is very rare), the creditor should refer to the accounts that are relied on to represent the firm’s financial position. For a company, these will be the accounts used to satisfy the company’s financial reporting obligations under the relevant Companies Act. Examples of when a bad debt is/is not written off General facts These facts apply to all the following examples: •The taxpayer’s income tax balance date is 31 March. •The only question is whether a debt has been written off. All other criteria are satisfied. •The debt is for goods and services supplied for money. •The supply has been included in the taxpayer’s gross income for income tax purposes. In the examples where the taxpayer is a GST-registered person, the following additional facts apply: •GST returns are filed on a two-monthly invoice basis. •The supply has been included in a GST return. Example 1 The taxpayer maintains a debtors ledger and is not registered for GST. The debtors ledger is updated on 31 March 1999. The entries made include the journal entry writing off the bad debt. The bad debt is deductible in the year ending 31 March 1999. Example 2 The taxpayer maintains a debtors ledger and is not registered for GST. The debtors ledger is written up on 1 April 1999. The entries written up include the journal entry writing off the bad debt. The bad debt is deductible in the year ending 31 March 2000. Example 3 The taxpayer does not maintain a debtors ledger and is registered for GST. There is no indication on her underlying debtor records to show the status of the debt. She has claimed a deduction from output tax for the bad debt in her GST return for the taxable period ending 31 January 1999. That return was prepared in February 1999. The taxpayer is not entitled to the deduction from GST output tax. She is not allowed a deduction for the bad debt in the income year ending 31 March 1999. Claiming the deduction from output tax for GST purposes is not a sufficient writing off of the bad debt. Example 4 The taxpayer does not maintain a debtors ledger and is not registered for GST. The taxpayer’s only records of debts owing to him are copies of issued invoices. The taxpayer maintains only rudimentary books of account, and his unpaid debtors are represented by loose-leaf filing of accounts and/or invoices issued in a ring- binder file. When a debt is paid it (the account and/or invoice) is transferred to a separate file. The taxpayer ceases sending accounts for the debt in question in February 1999, putting a line across the copy of the last statement sent out in respect of the debt and marking it “Final” and leaves it in the unpaid debtors file. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 5 (May 2000) 13 The taxpayer is not entitled to a deduction for the bad debt in the year ended 31 March 1999. Simply marking the last statement issued as “Final” and leaving it in the unpaid debtors file does not amount to writing off of the debt. Example 5 The taxpayer does not maintain a debtors ledger and is not registered for GST. His only records of debts owing are copies of invoices and statements issued. In February 1999 the taxpayer became aware that a debt was bad. He stopped sending out statements for the debt and took no other action on it. In particular, he sent out no statements on the account in February and March 1999. The taxpayer continued to send out statements on all the other debts owing, including overdue accounts. The taxpayer keeps carbon copies of the statements of account in the duplicate account book from which the statements for issue are prepared. The taxpayer has tagged the final statement sent out in respect of the debt, circling the amount payable and marking it “bad debt – written off – February 1999”. The taxpayer is allowed a deduction for the bad debt in the year ending 31 March 1999. The cessation of statements of account, recorded by their absence in the duplicate account book, and the tagging and marking of the final statement, amount to writing off the debt in his accounting system. Example 6 The taxpayer maintains a debtors ledger and is not registered for GST. She wrote up the debtors ledger on 31 March 1999. The entries written up include a journal entry writing off a bad debt. Her accountant prepares her accounts in June 1999. In the course of preparing the accounts, the accountant makes a general ledger entry recognising the bad debt as a result of the debtors ledger entry made by the taxpayer on 31 March 1999. The bad debt is deductible in the year ending 31 March 1999, because the underlying accounting record of the debt was altered to recognise the bad debt on 31 March 1999. Example 7 The taxpayer does not maintain a debtors ledger and is not registered for GST. Her only records of debts owing are copies of invoices issued. On 15 March 1999 she placed the invoice for the debt in question in a file marked “BAD DEBTS” noting on the invoice next to the total amount “debt bad – filed 15/3/99”. The amount of trade creditors in the taxpayer’s balance sheet as at 31 March 1999 includes the bad debt. The taxpayer’s profit and loss statement for the year ending 31 March 1999 includes as income the sale that has become a bad debt. The profit and loss statement does not recognise any expense for bad or doubtful debts. The taxpayer’s income tax return for the year ending 31 March 1999 includes the profit and loss statement and a “tax reconciliation statement” showing the difference between the accounting income and the amount she believes to be income for income tax purposes. The tax reconciliation statement includes a deduction for the bad debt. The taxpayer is not allowed a deduction for the bad debt. Although the debt has arguably been written off in the underlying accounting records, she has not ceased to recognise the debt as an asset for accounting purposes. Accruals rules General The accruals rules in Subpart EH of the Income Tax Act provide rules for the timing and recognition of income derived and expenditure incurred in respect of “financial arrangements”. The accruals rules have recently been rewritten by the Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1999. The amendments made by this Act apply, in general, to financial arrangements entered into on or after 20 May 1999. The changes made in relation to the allowable deductions for bad debts are discussed later in this item. Two general changes made by the amendment Act are: •The creation of divisions of rules, one applying to financial arrangements entered into before 20 May 1999, and those that were entered into on or after 20 May 1999. These are referred to as Division 1 and Division 2 respectively. •Division 1 financial arrangements are referred to as coming within the accruals rules, while Division 2 financial arrangements are referred to as coming within the accrual rules. The requirement in section DJ 1(a)(iii) that a debt “is proved to the satisfaction of the Commissioner to have been actually written off as a bad debt by the taxpayer in the income year”, must be satisfied before any deduction can be claimed for a bad debt under the accrual(s) rules (sections EH 6(4) and EH 54(1)). Accordingly, the tests used in deciding whether or not a debt is “bad” and what is sufficient “writing off” of a bad debt, apply equally to debts for which a bad debt deduction arises under the accrual(s) rules. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 5 (May 2000) 14 DIVISION 1: Financial arrangements entered into before 20 May 1999 Although the significant accrual(s) rules changes made by the Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1999 apply to financial arrangements entered into on or after 20 May 1999, the rules as they affect arrangements entered into before that date have also been rewritten. As part of this process, the accruals bad debt deduction provisions, formerly in section EH 5, have been re-enacted as section EH 6. Apart from the inclusion of headings for each sub-paragraph and necessary updating of some references to other new section and subsection numbers referred to, there are no wording changes between the former section EH 5 and the new section EH 6. What is a financial arrangement? A “financial arrangement” is widely defined and means a debt or debt instrument or an arrangement under which a person receives money in consideration for the provision of money to any person, either at a future time, or when an event occurs (or does not occur) in the future. Essentially, a financial arrangement is any transaction that involves deferral of the giving of consideration. Mortgages, bank and other loans, commercial bills, and treasury stock are examples of debt-type financial arrangements. Certain specific exceptions are created, and they are designated as “excepted financial arrangements”. This category includes equity-type instruments (debentures, shares), insurance contracts, employment contracts, games of chance, short term credit agreements and options. Those debts falling within the “excepted financial arrangement” definition have their deductibility as bad debts considered under section DJ 1(a). The main type of financial arrangement, in relation to bad debts, that is excluded from the Division 1 definition of “financial arrangement”, is likely to be a short term trade credit. Short term trade credits are an “excepted financial arrangement”. “Short term trade credit” is defined as: ... any debt for goods or services where payment is required by the vendor- (a)Within 63 days after the supply of the goods or services; or (b)Because the supply of the goods or services is continuous and the vendor renders periodic invoices for the goods or services, within 63 days after the date of an invoice rendered for those goods or services: Therefore, a short term trade credit is a debt for goods or services owed to a vendor within 63 days after supply or, where the supply is continuous, the vendor expects payment within 63 days after the date an invoice is issued for those goods and services. Arrangements entered into before the introduction of the accruals rules are also excluded from the definition of “financial arrangement”. What this means as far as a deduction for bad debts is concerned is that the deduction for bad debts arising in respect of a short term trade credit is considered under the general bad debt deduction provision in section DJ 1(a) and not under the accruals rules’ section EH 6. Revenue bad debts Section EH 6(1) will only apply in limited circumstances to a cash basis holder. A cash basis holder is a natural person for whom either the total value of all financial arrangements held by that person will not exceed $600,000 or the income derived during the income year from financial arrangements does not exceed $70,000. Furthermore, the difference between the income that would be returned under the accruals rules, and the income returned as a cash basis holder, must not exceed a $20,000 deferral threshold. Section EH 6(1) permits a person to deduct an amount written off as a bad debt in respect of a financial arrangement where and to the extent that: •the person derives gross income in respect of the financial arrangement under: •section EH 1 – one of the methods of calculating accrual income; or •section EH 3(4) – the adjustment required in any year when a person ceases to be a cash basis holder; or •section EH 4 – the base price adjustment calculated in the year a financial arrangement matures or is transferred; or •section EH 8 – the post facto adjustment for financial arrangements which have the effect of defeating the intent and application of the accruals regime; and •the amount written off is attributable to that gross income. In other words, a bad debt comprising income from a financial arrangement previously returned by the taxpayer under the accruals rules is allowed as a deduction under section EH 6(1). The purpose of the base price adjustment is to ensure that all income derived and all expenditure incurred is taken account of for that financial arrangement when it is either sold, matures, is remitted or transferred. The post facto adjustment is used to recalculate assessable income or any loss incurred in respect of the financial arrangement using the yield to maturity method in certain circumstances where: Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 5 (May 2000) 15 •any amount payable under the financial arrangement is determined, according to the terms of the financial arrangement, at the discretion of the holder or the issuer, or any other person who is an associated person of the holder or the issuer; and •when exercising this discretion the change in the amounts payable under the financial arrangement does not reflect changes in economic, commodity, industrial or financial indices or banking or commercial rates; and •the making of such a financial arrangement is not a generally accepted commercial practice; and •the effect of the arrangement is to defeat the intent and application of the accruals rules. “Yield to maturity” is a method of spreading income and expenditure over the life of the financial arrangement. Under the Income Tax Act, where the parties to a transaction are in a close relationship with each other they are classed as associated persons: for example relatives, partnerships and individuals that hold majority interests or voting rights in a company. Association is measured by reference to voting and, where applicable, market value interests, rather than to nominal and paid-up capital. The relationship of association is defined in section OD 7(1). Section EH 6(4) provides that the requirement in section DJ 1(a)(iii), that a debt “is proved to the satisfaction of the Commissioner to have been actually written off as a bad debt by the taxpayer in the income year”, must still be satisfied before any deduction can be claimed. Capital bad debts Section EH 6(2) provides for the deduction of the capital or principal element of a financial arrangement in certain circumstances. Section EH 6(2) allows a person a deduction for an amount written off as a bad debt in respect of a financial arrangement (not being an amount deductible under section EH 6(1)) where: •the person carries on a business comprising the holding or dealing in such financial arrangements and the person is not associated with the person owing the amount written off (see section OD 7 for test of association); or •the financial arrangement is a trade credit and the person carries on the business of dealing in the goods or services for which the trade credit is a debt. “Trade credit” is defined in section OB 1 to mean any debt for goods and services, other than a short term trade credit. As with Revenue bad debts above, section EH 6(4) requires (through section DJ 1(a)(iii)) that a debt “is proved to the satisfaction of the Commissioner to have been actually written off as a bad debt by the taxpayer in the income year” before any deduction can be claimed. Security payments Under section EH 6(3), if a person receives a security payment for a loss and a deduction is not otherwise allowable for the loss, the person may be allowed a deduction for the loss up to the amount of the security payment. The purpose of section EH 6(3) is to avoid the situation where the person is taxed on the security payment but does not receive a deduction for the loss incurred. A “security payment” means money received by, and that is gross income of, the holder of a security arrangement for any loss suffered because that arrangement is not performed. A “security arrangement” is a financial arrangement that secures the holder against failure of a person to perform their obligations under another arrangement. That other arrangement does not need to be a financial arrangement. A payment made under a guarantee is a security payment. DIVISION 2: Financial arrangements entered into on or after 20 May 1999 This section briefly outlines the effect of the changes made by the Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1999 in the context of deductions allowed for bad debts under the accrual rules. As stated above, the amendments apply, in general, to financial arrangements entered into on or after 20 May 1999. Allowable deductions for bad debts Deductions for bad debts under the accrual rules are now contained in section EH 54. Section EH 54, by and large, replicates the bad debt deduction provisions from the former section EH 5 (now re- enacted as section EH 6), while the security payments and share loss deduction provisions from these sections are now contained in section EH 55. The most significant changes as they relate to the deduction of bad debts, are: •The cash basis threshold is increased from $600,000 to $1,000,000 and income from investments from $70,000 to $100,000. In addition, the $20,000 deferral threshold, the maximum allowable difference between the income that would be returned under the accruals rules and the income returned as a cash basis holder, has been increased to $40,000. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 5 (May 2000) 16 •There is only one excepted financial arrangement for short-term agreements for the sale and purchase of property or services, unless a person elects otherwise, and this is for those agreements where settlement or performance must occur within 93 days. •Deductions are allowed for dealers or providers of goods and services when credit is extended under an agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services. Revenue bad debts Section EH 54(2) permits a person to deduct an amount written off as a bad debt in respect of a financial arrangement where and to the extent that: •the person derives gross income in respect of the financial arrangement; and •the amount written off is attributable to the income. Capital bad debts Section EH 54(3) provides for the deduction of the capital or principal element of a financial arrangement in certain circumstances. Section EH 54(3) allows a person a deduction for an amount written off as a bad debt in respect of a financial arrangement (not being an amount deductible under section EH 54(2)) where: •the person carries on a business that includes holding or dealing in financial arrangements that are the same or similar; and •the person is not associated with the person owing the amount written off. Bad debts–agreements for sale and purchase of property or services Section EH 54(4) allows a person a bad debt deduction (for an amount that is not allowed as a deduction under section EH 54(2) or (3)) where: •the financial arrangement is an agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services; and •the person carries on a business of dealing in the property or services that are the subject of the agreement. Previous rules applying to trade credits have been integrated with the rules for agreements for the sale and purchase of property, and these have also been extended to apply to the provision of services. As a result of the integration, the bad debt provisions are extended to taxpayers in the business of dealing in the goods or services that are the subject of the agreements for the sale and purchase of property or services. Transitional adjustments As mentioned earlier, the amended accrual rules (Division 2) apply to financial arrangements entered into on or after 20 May 1999. However, under section EH 17 taxpayers are able to elect to apply these new rules to financial arrangements entered into before that date (ie Division 1 financial arrangements). This will be useful if taxpayers wish to account for all arrangements on a similar basis. Further details of this option, and other changes to the accruals rules, are included in the full discussion on the amending legislation in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 11, No 6 (July 1999). Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 5 (May 2000) 17 PRODUCT RULING - BR PRD 00/03 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Edison Contact Finance Limited. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of: •The definition of “non-participating redeemable share” as defined in section CF 3(14); •Section CF 2; •Section CF 3(1)(b). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the issue of non-voting redeemable preference shares (“RPS”) by Edison Contact Finance Limited (“ECF”) to public investors. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. The Applicant 1.ECF is a special purpose company. It has been established to issue RPS to the public, and using the funds from that issue, to subscribe for RPS in Edison Mission Energy Taupo Limited (“EMETL”). All of ECF’s ordinary shares are currently held by TEA Custodians Ltd as trustee of a discretionary trust. EMETL can appoint and remove the trustees. The beneficiaries of the trust are charitable organisations in New Zealand. The Prospectus, dated 9 July 1999 (“the Prospectus”), states that the trustee does not guarantee the payment of dividends on the RPS, the attachment of imputation credits to the dividends, or the redemption (or the payment of any amount on the redemption) of the RPS. ECF may have at least one additional non- resident shareholder with voting interests in the future. 2.EMETL is a New Zealand company incorporated under the Companies Act 1993 (“Companies Act”). All of its ordinary shares are held by EME Royale, an unlimited liability company incorporated in New Zealand under the Companies Act 1993. The ultimate holding company of EME Royale is Edison Mission Energy (“EME”), a company incorporated in the US. The purchase of Contact shares by EMETL 3.On 24 March 1999, the Crown agreed to sell 40% of Contact Energy Limited (“Contact”) to EMETL for $1,208 million. The agreement was settled on 14 May 1999. Contact generates and retails electricity in New Zealand. Its major assets are electricity generation plants in New Zealand. EMETL has used the proceeds of RPS issued to ECF, with other financing, to fund its acquisition of Contact shares. Issue and terms of the ECF RPS 4.ECF began issuing RPS to investors at an issue price of $1 per share on 23 July 1999. ECF intended to issue up to 240 million RPS before closing the issue on or before 12 November 1999 (or a later date as agreed). 5.ECF has now fully issued 240 million $1.00 RPS to public investors. The number of RPS issued and the dividend rates on the RPS are as follows: Numbers of RPS issued in each tranche Expiry dateFully imputed Number of RPS dividend rate 30 June 20015.00%7,621,000 30 June 20015.30%8,608,000 30 June 20015.63%47,903,000 30 June 20025.50%18,118,000 30 June 20025.80%14,548,000 30 June 20026.03%9,908,000 30 June 20035.75%47,879,000 30 June 20036.20%66,908,000 30 June 20036.37%18,507,000 Total240,000,000 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 5 (May 2000) 18 6.ECF used the $240 million obtained from the issue of the RPS to subscribe for RPS issued by EMETL. The Terms of Issue of the RPS issued by ECF to the public are contained in the Prospectus. These terms are similar to those of the RPS issued to ECF by EMETL. 7.ECF’s constitution allows it to issue up to $400,000,000 of RPS. This Ruling only considers the issue of up to 240,000,000 RPS as part of the public issue described above. 8.The material terms of the RPS issued by ECF are as follows: Redemption •Holders of RPS are entitled, on the redemption of their RPS, to the “Redemption Amount”. The “Redemption Amount” is defined in clause 2 of the Terms of Issue as the issue price of the RPS. •Whole, not part RPS, will be redeemed. •There are three categories of RPS each scheduled to be redeemed on one of three dates specified in the Terms of Issue being either 30 June 2001 (Year 2 RPS), 30 June 2002 (Year 3 RPS), or 30 June 2003 (Year 4 RPS). It is proposed that 64,132,000 RPS will be redeemed on 30 June 2001, 42,574,000 RPS will be redeemed on 30 June 2002, and 133,294,000 RPS will be redeemed on 30 June 2003. The RPS may be redeemed early by ECF on the occurrence of an Event of Default or if the redeemable preference shares held by ECF in EMETL are redeemed early (clause 7 of the Terms of Issue). Dividends •Dividends on each RPS are payable semi- annually on 30 June and 31 December, or the next Business Day, or such other dates as may be approved by an Extraordinary Resolution of Holders (clause 3(a) of the Terms of Issue). The first dividend was paid on 31 December 1999 to those investors who initially subscribed for the RPS even if they no longer held the RPS at that time (clause 3(b) of the Terms of Issue). The dividend to be paid in regard to the final dividend period will be paid immediately before the payment of the redemption amount on that RPS (clause 3(e) of the Terms of Issue). If an RPS is redeemed before its scheduled redemption date, the period for calculating the final dividend will be shortened, and the final dividend will be paid immediately prior to redemption of the RPS. •The rate of dividend is fixed at the time the RPS are issued. The three categories of RPS (Year 2, Year 3, and Year 4 RPS) carry a number of different dividend rates. The specified dividend rate on each RPS does not change once that RPS is issued. The dividend rates for the RPS are listed in the chart above. •ECF will pay fully imputed dividends to the holder of each RPS (clause 3(f) of the Terms of Issue). ECF may also pay supplementary dividends to (actual or deemed) non-resident holders of RPS. Other •Holders of RPS have no rights to vote on a poll at a meeting of ECF on any resolution made by ECF as described in section 36(1)(a) of the Companies Act 1993, although the RPS holders may exercise class rights under section 117 of the Companies Act 1993 (clause 5.2 of the Terms of Issue). 9.The formula for calculating the dividend amount on the RPS is as follows (in the definition of “Dividend Amount” in clause 2 of the Terms of Issue): DA = IP x DR ÷ 2 Where: DA =the amount of dividend payable on each RP Share on each Dividend Payment Date; DR =the dividend rate agreed between the Company and the initial Holder, as subscriber, in accordance with the application for the RP Shares, expressed as a percentage rate per annum; IP =the Issue Price of the RP Share, provided that in the case of the first Dividend Period and the last Dividend Period (where the last Dividend Period does not end on 30 June or 31 December (or if applicable the next Business Day)) the Dividend Amount payable shall be calculated on the number of days elapsed in the Dividend Period ending on that date, calculated as follows: DA =IP x DR x DE R Where DA, IP and DR are as defined above, DE =the number of days during that Dividend Period; and R = 365 or, in the case of a leap year, 366. 10.Clause 7 of the Terms of Issue provides for the early redemption of the RPS. The RPS may be redeemed early if there is an Event of Default as defined in the Terms of Issue or if the RPS held by ECF in EMETL are redeemed early. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 5 (May 2000) 19 11.Events of Default under clause 7.1 of the Terms of Issue are : (a)Non-payment of redemption amount: The Company fails to pay any part of the Redemption Amount of any RP Share on its due date (or within two Business Days after its due date where non-payment on it due date has arisen solely by reason of a technical, computer or similar error outside the control of the Company); or (b)Non-payment: the Company fails to pay any Dividends or other amount due and payable under the RP Shares within five Business Days after its due date; or (c)Other breach: EMETL or EME commits any breach of, or omits to observe, any of the Financial Covenants and such breach or omission is not remedied within 30 days of EMETL or EME becoming aware of the breach or omission; (d)Cessation of business or dissolution: The Company, ECI, EMETL or Contact ceases or threatens to cease to carry on all or substantially all of its business or operations, or an application of an order is made, or a resolution is passed or proposed, for the dissolution of the Company, ECI, EMETL or Contact except, in each case for the purpose of, and followed by, an amalgamation or solvent reconstruction on terms previously approved in writing by an Extraordinary Resolution of Holders; or (e)Receiver, etc: an encumbrancer takes possession, or a trustee, receiver, receiver and manager, administrator, inspector under any companies or securities legislation, or similar official, is appointed in respect of the Company, ECI, EMETL or Contact of the whole of their respective assets; or (f)Statutory management: any step is taken to appoint, or with a view to appointing, a statutory manager (including the making of any recommendation in that regard by the Securities Commission) under the Corporations (Investigations and Management) Act 1989 in respect of the Company, ECI, EMETL or Contact or the Company, ECI, EMETL or Contact or any associated person (as that term is defined in that Act) of any of them is declared at risk pursuant to the provisions of that Act; or (g)Insolvency: the Company, ECI, EMETL, or Contact is declared or becomes bankrupt or insolvent, is unable to pay its debts when they fall due, or is presumed unable to pay its debts in accordance with section 287 of the Companies Act, or enters into dealings with, or for the benefit of, any of its creditors with a view to avoiding, or in expectation of, insolvency, or makes a general assignment or an arrangement, compromise or composition with or for the benefit of any of its creditors, or stops or threatens to stop payments generally; or (h)Analogous process: anything analogous, or having a substantially similar effect, to any referred to in paragraphs (d) to (g) inclusive occurs in relation to the Company, ECI, EMETL, EME or Contact under the laws of a jurisdiction other than New Zealand. Other relevant information 12.ECF’s only material assets are the RPS it has subscribed for in EMETL and a secured indemnity it has from Edison Contact Investments Limited (“ECI”) in respect of EMETL’s obligations under the EMETL RPS (page seven of the Prospectus). ECF’s material liability is under the RPS issued to the public. 13.A number of security arrangements have been entered into by ECF, EMETL, ECI, and other parties to ensure that the various obligations undertaken by the parties are fulfilled. One such arrangement is the ECI Indemnity Agreement entered into by ECF, EMETL, and ECI. Under this agreement ECI has indemnified ECF if EMETL fails to pay ECF certain amounts. EMETL has in turn agreed to indemnify ECI if it is required to pay ECF under the ECI Indemnity Agreement. 14.The Prospectus states that ECF is not an affiliate of EMETL or any other member of the EME group of companies, nor of Contact. The Prospectus also states that ECF is not managed or controlled by any member of the EME group of companies or Contact, although EMETL has the power to appoint and remove the trustee(s) of the discretionary trust holding the shares in ECF. 15.This Ruling does not consider or rule on any potential application of sections BG 1 and GB 1 to the Arrangement. Condition stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following condition: •The amount distributed on redemption of any RPS issued to the public (“the Redeemed RPS”) by ECF will be less than or equal to the “available subscribed capital” (as defined in section OB 1) for all the RPS of the same class as the Redeemed RPS. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 5 (May 2000) 20 How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to the condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •The RPS issued by ECF are “non-participating redeemable shares” as defined in section CF 3(14); •The amounts paid by ECF on redemption of the RPS pursuant to the Terms of Issue will be excluded from the definition of “dividends” in section CF 2 by section CF 3(1)(b). The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply from the commencement of the 1999 income year to the end of the 2004 income year. This Ruling is signed by me on the 20 th day of March 2000. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 5 (May 2000) 21 PRODUCT RULING - BR PRD 00/04 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Edison Contact Finance Limited. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of: •Section LE 2; •Section LE 3. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the issue of non-voting redeemable preference shares (“RPS”) by Edison Contact Finance Limited (“ECF”) to public investors. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. The Applicant 1.ECF is a special purpose company. It has been established to issue RPS to the public, and using the funds from that issue, to subscribe for RPS in Edison Mission Energy Taupo Limited (“EMETL”). All of ECF’s ordinary shares are currently held by TEA Custodians Ltd as trustee of a discretionary trust. EMETL can appoint and remove the trustees. The beneficiaries of the trust are charitable organisations in New Zealand. The Prospectus, dated 9 July 1999 (“the Prospectus”), states that the trustee does not guarantee the payment of dividends on the RPS, the attachment of imputation credits to the dividends, or the redemption (or the payment of any amount on the redemption) of the RPS. ECF may have at least one additional non- resident shareholder with voting interests in the future. 2.EMETL is a New Zealand company incorporated under the Companies Act 1993 (“Companies Act”). All of its ordinary shares are held by EME Royale, an unlimited liability company incorporated in New Zealand under the Companies Act 1993. The ultimate holding company of EME Royale is Edison Mission Energy (“EME”), a company incorporated in the US. The purchase of Contact shares by EMETL 3.On 24 March 1999, the Crown agreed to sell 40% of Contact Energy Limited (“Contact”) to EMETL for $1,208 million. The agreement was settled on 14 May 1999. Contact generates and retails electricity in New Zealand. Its major assets are electricity generation plants in New Zealand. EMETL has used the proceeds of RPS issued to ECF, with other financing, to fund its acquisition of Contact shares. Issue and terms of the ECF RPS 4.ECF began issuing RPS to investors at an issue price of $1 per share on 23 July 1999. ECF intended to issue up to 240 million RPS before closing the issue on or before 12 November 1999 (or a later date as agreed). 5.ECF has now fully issued 240 million $1.00 RPS to public investors. The number of RPS issued and the dividend rates on the RPS are as follows: Numbers of RPS issued in each tranche Expiry dateFully imputedNumber of RPS dividend rate 30 June 20015.00%7,621,000 30 June 20015.30%8,608,000 30 June 20015.63%47,903,000 30 June 20025.50%18,118,000 30 June 20025.80%14,548,000 30 June 20026.03%9,908,000 30 June 20035.75%47,879,000 30 June 20036.20%66,908,000 30 June 20036.37%18,507,000 Total240,000,000 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 5 (May 2000) 22 6.ECF used the $240 million obtained from the issue of the RPS to subscribe for RPS issued by EMETL. The Terms of Issue of the RPS issued by ECF to the public are contained in the Prospectus. These terms are similar to those of the RPS issued to ECF by EMETL. 7.ECF’s constitution allows it to issue up to $400,000,000 of RPS. This Ruling only considers the ability of ECF to achieve section LE 3 holding company status in relation to the issue of up to 240,000,000 RPS, as described above. 8.The material terms of the RPS issued by ECF are as follows: Redemption •Holders of RPS are entitled, on the redemption of their RPS, to the “Redemption Amount”. The “Redemption Amount” is defined in clause 2 of the Terms of Issue as the issue price of the RPS. •Whole, not part RPS, will be redeemed. •There are three categories of RPS each scheduled to be redeemed on one of three dates specified in the Terms of Issue being either 30 June 2001 (Year 2 RPS), 30 June 2002 (Year 3 RPS), or 30 June 2003 (Year 4 RPS). It is proposed that 64,132,000 RPS will be redeemed on 30 June 2001, 42,574,000 RPS will be redeemed on 30 June 2002, and 133,294,000 RPS will be redeemed on 30 June 2003. The RPS may be redeemed early by ECF on the occurrence of an Event of Default or if the redeemable preference shares held by ECF in EMETL are redeemed early (clause 7 of the Terms of Issue). Dividends •Dividends on each RPS are payable semi- annually on 30 June and 31 December, or the next Business Day, or such other dates as may be approved by an Extraordinary Resolution of Holders (clause 3(a) of the Terms of Issue). The first dividend was paid on 31 December 1999 to those investors who initially subscribed for the RPS even if they no longer held the RPS at that time (clause 3(b) of the Terms of Issue). The dividend to be paid in regard to the final dividend period will be paid immediately before the payment of the redemption amount on that RPS (clause 3(e) of the Terms of Issue). If an RPS is redeemed before its scheduled redemption date, the period for calculating the final dividend will be shortened, and the final dividend will be paid immediately prior to redemption of the RPS. •The rate of dividend is fixed at the time the RPS are issued. The three categories of RPS (Year 2, Year 3, and Year 4 RPS) carry a number of different dividend rates. The specified dividend rate on each RPS does not change once that RPS is issued. The dividend rates for the RPS are listed in the chart above. •ECF will pay fully imputed dividends to the holder of each RPS (clause 3(f) of the Terms of Issue). •If ECF elects to be a section LE 3 holding company, ECF may also pay supplementary dividends to (actual or deemed) non-resident holders of RPS. Other •Holders of RPS have no rights to vote on a poll at a meeting of ECF on any resolution made by ECF as described in section 36(1)(a) of the Companies Act 1993, although the RPS holders may exercise class rights under section 117 of the Companies Act 1993 (clause 5.2 of the Terms of Issue). 9.The formula for calculating the dividend amount on the RPS is as follows (in the definition of “Dividend Amount” in clause 2 of the Terms of Issue): DA = IP x DR ÷ 2 Where: DA =the amount of dividend payable on each RP Share on each Dividend Payment Date; DR =the dividend rate agreed between the Company and the initial Holder, as subscriber, in accordance with the application for the RP Shares, expressed as a percentage rate per annum; IP =the Issue Price of the RP Share, provided that in the case of the first Dividend Period and the last Dividend Period (where the last Dividend Period does not end on 30 June or 31 December (or if applicable the next Business Day)) the Dividend Amount payable shall be calculated on the number of days elapsed in the Dividend Period ending on that date, calculated as follows: DA =IP x DR x DE R Where DA, IP and DR are as defined above, DE =the number of days during that Dividend Period; and R = 365 or, in the case of a leap year, 366. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 5 (May 2000) 23 10.Clause 7 of the Terms of Issue provides for the early redemption of the RPS. The RPS may be redeemed early if there is an Event of Default as defined in the Terms of Issue or if the RPS held by ECF in EMETL are redeemed early. 11.Events of Default under clause 7.1 of the Terms of Issue are : (a)Non-payment of redemption amount: The Company fails to pay any part of the Redemption Amount of any RP Share on its due date (or within two Business Days after its due date where non-payment on it due date has arisen solely by reason of a technical, computer or similar error outside the control of the Company); or (b)Non-payment: the Company fails to pay any Dividends or other amount due and payable under the RP Shares within five Business Days after its due date; or (c)Other breach: EMETL or EME commits any breach of, or omits to observe, any of the Financial Covenants and such breach or omission is not remedied within 30 days of EMETL or EME becoming aware of the breach or omission; (d)Cessation of business or dissolution: The Company, ECI, EMETL or Contact ceases or threatens to cease to carry on all or substantially all of its business or operations, or an application of an order is made, or a resolution is passed or proposed, for the dissolution of the Company, ECI, EMETL or Contact except, in each case for the purpose of, and followed by, an amalgamation or solvent reconstruction on terms previously approved in writing by an Extraordinary Resolution of Holders; or (e)Receiver, etc: an encumbrancer takes possession, or a trustee, receiver, receiver and manager, administrator, inspector under any companies or securities legislation, or similar official, is appointed in respect of the Company, ECI, EMETL or Contact of the whole of their respective assets; or (f)Statutory management: any step is taken to appoint, or with a view to appointing, a statutory manager (including the making of any recommendation in that regard by the Securities Commission) under the Corporations (Investigations and Management) Act 1989 in respect of the Company, ECI, EMETL or Contact or the Company, ECI, EMETL or Contact or any associated person (as that term is defined in that Act) of any of them is declared at risk pursuant to the provisions of that Act; or (g)Insolvency: the Company, ECI, EMETL, or Contact is declared or becomes bankrupt or insolvent, is unable to pay its debts when they fall due, or is presumed unable to pay its debts in accordance with section 287 of the Companies Act, or enters into dealings with, or for the benefit of, any of its creditors with a view to avoiding, or in expectation of, insolvency, or makes a general assignment or an arrangement, compromise or composition with or for the benefit of any of its creditors, or stops or threatens to stop payments generally; or (h)Analogous process: anything analogous, or having a substantially similar effect, to any referred to in paragraphs (d) to (g) inclusive occurs in relation to the Company, ECI, EMETL, EME or Contact under the laws of a jurisdiction other than New Zealand. Other relevant information 12.ECF’s only material assets are the RPS it has subscribed for in EMETL and a secured indemnity it has from Edison Contact Investments Limited (“ECI”) in respect of EMETL’s obligations under the EMETL RPS (page seven of the Prospectus). ECF’s material liability is under the RPS issued to the public. 13.A number of security arrangements have been entered into by ECF, EMETL, ECI, and other parties to ensure that the various obligations undertaken by the parties are fulfilled. One such arrangement is the ECI Indemnity Agreement entered into by ECF, EMETL, and ECI. Under this agreement ECI has indemnified ECF if EMETL fails to pay ECF certain amounts. EMETL has in turn agreed to indemnify ECI if it is required to pay ECF under the ECI Indemnity Agreement. 14.The Prospectus states that ECF is not an affiliate of EMETL or any other member of the EME group of companies, nor of Contact. The Prospectus also states that ECF is not managed or controlled by any member of the EME group of companies or Contact, although EMETL has the power to appoint and remove the trustee(s) of the discretionary trust holding the shares in ECF. 15.This Ruling does not consider or rule on any potential application of sections BG 1 and GB 1 to the Arrangement. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 5 (May 2000) 24 Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: •If ECF elects to be a section LE 3 holding company, it will give notice in writing to EMETL under section LE 3(2)(a) advising EMETL that it is a section LE 3 holding company. •ECF is not a member of a “consolidated group” (as defined in section OB 1). •At no time during the period for which this Ruling applies will ECF elect to revoke any notice of section LE 3 holding company status. •At all times during the period for which this Ruling applies, ECF will have the purpose, in keeping any notice of section LE 3 holding company status in existence, of enabling, directly or indirectly, the payment of a supplementary dividend to a person not resident in New Zealand. •ECF has at least one non-resident shareholder with a “voting interest” (as defined in section OB 1) in ECF. •Dividends derived by ECF on the RPS issued by EMETL are gross income under the Act. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to the conditions stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •ECF can elect to be a section LE 3 holding company and pay supplementary dividends to actual or deemed non-resident RPS holders for the purposes of section LE 2 and notice to elect to have that status will not be revoked under section LE 3(3). The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply from the commencement of the 1999 income year to the end of the 2004 income year.

Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 5 (May 2000) 25 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS This section of the Tax Information Bulletin contains interpretation statements issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. These statements set out the Commissioner’s view on how the law applies to a particular set of circumstances when it is either not possible or not appropriate to issue a binding public ruling. In most cases Inland Revenue will assess taxpayers in line with the following interpretation statements. However, our statutory duty is to make correct assessments, so we may not necessarily assess taxpayers on the basis of earlier advice if at the time of the assessment we consider that the earlier advice is not consistent with the law. MATRIMONIAL PROPERTY AGREEMENTS– GST IMPLICATIONS NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL between the tax consequences of a taxable activity and the tax consequences of a taxable activity conducted by a registered person. •It is also necessary to identify clearly exactly what is supplied under the matrimonial property agreement. Particular care may be required to ascertain the legal effect of the matrimonial property agreement and to identify the supply or the various supplies made by or pursuant to it. The transfer or passing of different types of interests in, or rights to or in respect of, property may give rise to different types of “supply” and might create supplies of different “goods” or “services”. It may also be necessary to consider whether the transfer of property under the matrimonial property agreement is an application of goods and services to which section 21(1) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 applies. •It does not distinguish supplies of money, which are not subject to GST. •It may be necessary in particular cases to distinguish supplies of secondhand goods, which may lead to particular consequences. In this regard it is noted that property supplied under a matrimonial property agreement may include choses in action, which are services for the purposes of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 and therefore cannot be secondhand goods. The Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 makes no specific provision for matrimonial property agreements. Ordinary GST provisions and principles apply in determining the GST consequences of a matrimonial property agreement. This withdrawal has effect on and after 29 May 2000. The Commissioner gives notice of the withdrawal of the item entitled “GST – Matrimonial Property Agreements”, published at page 1 in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 1, No 6 (December 1989) (“the withdrawn statement”). The withdrawn statement does not, in the Commissioner’s view, correctly reflect the law in a number of respects, including the following: •It is founded in part on the presumption that the Matrimonial Property Act 1976 gives the spouses in a marriage, by virtue of that marriage, property rights in each others’ property sufficient to found the presumption that a partnership exists when they enter into a matrimonial property agreement. That is incorrect because the Matrimonial Property Act 1976 does not, of itself, create a partnership between husband and wife. In particular, that Act does not create the relation between persons necessary to create a partnership in terms of section 4(1) of the Partnership Act 1908. •A matrimonial property agreement may be made between persons who are not married to one another and not associated persons. This may result in tax consequences that differ from those of a matrimonial property agreement between persons who are married to one another and are therefore associated persons. •The law regarding the transfer of a taxable activity as a going concern has been amended since the withdrawn statement was published, so that the conditions required for the zero- rating of such a supply are not specified in the withdrawn statement. •It is necessary to identify clearly the distinction Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 5 (May 2000) 26 FINANCIAL PLANNING FEES - INCOME TAX DEDUCTIBILITY If the investment is a financial arrangement, the accruals rules apply and the treatment of planning fees will depend on whether the financial arrangement was entered into before or after the Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1999 received its royal assent on 20 May 1999. Full details of how the “old” and “new” accrual rules apply to financial planning fees are discussed later. Planning fees will be non-deductible if the income derived from the investments is exempt income or non- assessable income. Fee categories The fees charged by financial advisers vary from one adviser to another, but generally can be separated into a number of categories. Financial planners give the fees they charge various names, but the crucial point is the nature of the fees charged and when they are incurred. The nature and the timing of when the fees are incurred will determine whether they are of a revenue nature and therefore deductible for income tax purposes, or whether they are of a capital nature and not deductible. The fees can be summarised as: ( a )Initial planning fees: Fees charged in relation to services provided by the adviser for the initial interview where the investor and the adviser discuss the investor’s investment goals, savings objectives, cash requirements, and life and general insurance requirements. The adviser then prepares a draft portfolio plan for the investor. Further interviews, discussions, and adjustments to the draft plan may follow until it is acceptable to the investor. ( b )Implementation fees: All fees for services associated with implementing the draft plan devised in (a). They will include any one-off up front fees paid to or made in respect of services or charges to advisers, administrators, executors, fund managers, etc., to purchase or acquire the investments. They include brokerage, and any payments to custodians on implementation of the plan or charges by fund managers for entry into the investments. (c)Administration fees: Generally described by advisers as “annual on-going” fees. They are charged by the adviser to cover the costs of maintaining records of the investor’s transaction with the adviser. This category also includes charges relating to the handling of cash for the investor, such as the withdrawal Summary All references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This interpretation statement considers the deductibility under section BD 2, of a range of financial planning fees charged to investors. In this regard the status of the investor will be important, ie whether the taxpayer is a passive investor, a speculative investor, or in the business of trading in investments. This statement replaces public ruling BR Pub 95/10 that appeared in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 7, No 7 (January 1996), and the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996 re-issue BR Pub 95/10A published in Ta x Information Bulletin Vol 8, No 10 (December 1996). The public ruling ceased to apply at the end of the 1998–1999 income year. Some of the conclusions in this statement differ from those in public ruling BR 95/10, reflecting experience and case law arising from decisions from the Taxation Review Authority (TRA) and the High Court since that ruling was issued. These changes will impact most on those investors coming within the definition of “passive investor” described in the statement. This category of investor will now, in certain circumstances, be entitled to deduct a greater range of fees than detailed in the earlier binding ruling. In general, financial planning fees will be deductible if they are incurred in deriving the taxpayer’s gross income, under section BD 2(1)(b)(i), or incurred in the course of carrying on a business for the purposes of deriving gross income under section BD 2(1)(b)(ii). Deductibility is prohibited if the fees are of a capital nature under section BD 2(2)(e). The deductibility of financial planning fees depends on whether the investment to which the fees are paid relates to: •an “excepted financial arrangement” (eg shares and options to purchase shares), or •a “financial arrangement” (eg bonds, bank loans, mortgages, and government stock). If the investment is an excepted financial arrangement, deductibility of fees will depend on whether the fee is part of the cost of the investment, and whether that investment is “trading stock” or “revenue account property” of a business or speculative investor respectively. The primary focus of this interpretation statement is on this type of investment. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 5 (May 2000) 27 and deposit in the investor’s account with the administrator, bank charges, and other administration fees. Also included are any fees or commissions charged by the adviser for collecting income from the investments and arranging this to be paid to or credited to the investor’s account with the adviser, or to the investor’s own bank account. ( d )Monitoring fees: Annual charges for monitoring and reporting to the investor on the performance of the portfolio (including the performance of the fund managers and the adviser) in terms of the investor’s goals and relaying this information to the investor. The adviser will, from time to time, report on the portfolio’s performance and relay this information to the investor. (e)Evaluation fees: Any fees for services relating to an evaluation of an existing portfolio. Typically, where an investor has an existing portfolio of investments and either seeks a financial adviser’s advice for the first time, or seeks confirmation that the portfolio’s performance is matching the goals originally set either by the investor or with the assistance of a financial planner at the initial planning stage. This is a more detailed examination of performance of the portfolio than simply monitoring performance and reporting to the client. It may or may not result in a recommendation from the adviser to make changes to investments within the portfolio to maintain the investor’s aims. (f)Replanning fees: Fees for services relating to the replanning of a portfolio arising from category (e) services due to changes to the investor’s objectives. This could entail minor changes, or the complete restructuring of investments and a change in investment strategy. Re-planning fees do not necessarily refer to advice supplied by the same adviser. The fees could be for advice by an adviser to a new client who had previously managed his or her own portfolio or had previously engaged a different adviser. Included in this category are any other fees as described in Initial planning fees at (a) above, when there has been a complete restructuring of investments. ( g )Switching fees: Fees related to the costs involved in selling existing investments and/or purchasing new investments arising from a recommendation by the adviser as a result of category (e) or category (f) services. The fees will be charged by the adviser for changing investments within the portfolio. Also included are any fees relating to the withdrawal in whole or in part from an existing portfolio. Financial planners may charge a global fee that will include fees for more than one of the above categories. It will then be necessary for the fees to be apportioned between the categories, based on the actual work done, to ensure the fees are correctly treated for deductibility purposes. A similar apportionment exercise needs to be undertaken in the case of “performance fees”, where an investor may have the option of being able to elect to pay a performance fee instead of fees for some or each of the categories noted above. Performance fees are a form of global fee paid to advisers based on how well the portfolio of investments selected by the adviser and agreed to by the investor, is performing against some predetermined measure. The calculation of the seven categories of fees noted above might be based on a standard fee structure, hours of work put in by the adviser, the amount of the investments made by the investor, or a combination thereof. Performance fees on the other hand, are calculated under some predetermined formula based on how well the investor’s portfolio, as recommended by the adviser, performs over a period of time. These fees could include a standard amount, plus a percentage based on the extent to which the level of growth or return from the portfolio exceeds previously agreed targets, or the fee could be based solely on a percentage of the returns/agreed targets. Irrespective of the name given to the fee, or the basis of its calculation, the income tax treatment of the fees will be determined having regard to the services performed in establishing, administering and altering the investor’s portfolio, based on the seven categories of services mentioned above. It may be that in certain cases the performance fee is paid in respect of all the seven categories of services, while in other instances the fee may be only for the services coming within some of the categories, eg the administration and monitoring fee categories. In view of this, it is not the description (label) that the adviser attaches to the fee charged that is relevant, rather it is what service(s) the fee is actually paid for that determines whether or not the fee is deductible. Performance fees are in reality no different to any other global or multi-service fee charged by an adviser . How the amount is apportioned among the categories of services is a question of fact to be determined in the circumstances of the particular case. Investor categories Investors fall within one of three categories: Passive investors: Persons whose primary aim is to derive dividend and interest income from a secure investment portfolio. There may also be a secondary hope or possibility that the investments will provide long-term capital appreciation. They will make Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 5 (May 2000) 28 Types of InvestorsPassiveSpeculativeBusiness changes to their investment portfolio from time to time to achieve this aim. Some investors may also be “actively” involved in monitoring their investment portfolios (or engage a financial adviser to do this for them) to ensure that the primary aim of maximising dividend and interest yield is maintained. The passive investor will not be in business as an investor, nor will the investor buy or sell investments for short-term gains (speculator). Speculative investors: Investors who acquire an investment with the intention of selling it for the purpose of making a profit from the transaction. These acquisitions and sales are generally of a one-off nature. Business investors: Persons are in the business of investing when the nature of their activity, and their intention in respect of that activity, is sufficient to amount to a business (as discussed later in this statement). The following table is a summary of the income tax treatment of financial planning fees as they apply to excepted financial arrangements (eg shares and share options and interests in unit trusts) discussed in this statement. The table also indicates when the fees will be deductible. The deductibility of fees relating to financial arrangements is discussed later.

This will be determined by the following: •Whether the taxpayer is a passive, speculative, or a business investor. •The nature of the service fees charged to the investor by the financial adviser, and whether these fees are on revenue or capital account. •If the fees are paid before the commencement of a speculative or business undertaking, whether the fees are “preliminary expenditure” and not deductible. •How the trading stock and revenue account property rules affect the deductibility of planning fees. •If the planning fees are “accrual expenditure”, how deductibility is affected. •If the investment is a “financial arrangement” as defined, whether the arrangement was entered into before or after 20 May 1999 - the date of royal assent of the Taxation (Accruals Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1999. If the arrangement was entered into before 20 May 1999, whether: •the investor is a cash basis holder or a non- cash basis holder, •the fees are contingent or non-contingent on the implementation of the financial plan. •if the fees are non-contingent, whether they are more or less than 2% of the “core acquisition price”. If the arrangement was entered into on or after 20 May 1999, whether: •the investor is a cash basis person. •the fees are non-contingent. If they are non-contingent, they are excluded from the accrual rules and treated under normal income tax deductibility rules. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 5 (May 2000) 29 Distinction between “excepted financial arrangements” and “financial arrangements” Given that the focus of this statement is on excepted financial arrangements, it is important to know the distinction between excepted financial arrangements and financial arrangements. Both terms are defined in the Act. In the context of this statement excepted financial arrangements are basically equity investments that rely on the profitability of the entity invested in to determine the return to the investor. Shares and share options are a more common form of excepted financial arrangements as far as investors are concerned. On the other hand, financial arrangements are debt instruments that will generally have a fixed rate of return in the form of interest. The definition in the Act describes a financial arrangement as any debt or debt instrument, or any arrangement whereby a person obtains money in consideration for a promise by any person to provide money at some future time or upon the occurrence or non-occurrence of some future event or events. It also includes any arrangement that is substantially similar in nature. Bonds, bank loans, mortgages and government stock are examples of financial arrangements. Background An investor who seeks advice from a financial adviser will be charged for the services provided. Whether any of these fees are deductible for income tax purposes will depend on the type of fee expense incurred and the type of investor who incurs the fee. When an initial financial plan has been devised, agreed to by the investor, and implemented by the adviser, that is not necessarily the end of the matter. Usually systems are in place that require the adviser’s continual involvement. Most financial advisers offer a continuing monitoring service that is generally part of an overall advisory package. The investments are often (but not always) placed in the care of a custodian (presumably for security reasons), the income derived from the investments passes to the adviser or custodian where it is placed in a trust account before being able to be drawn upon by the investor. The maintenance of these trust accounts by the adviser usually incurs costs that are charged to the investor. As part of the service, the adviser may monitor the portfolio to ensure that the aims of the investor are continually met. For this service the investor will often pay further fees. From time to time as part of this monitoring service the adviser can recommend changes to the investment mix. If the investor accepts these recommendations to change investments, further fees are incurred which may include brokerage and switching fees. It is the Commissioner’s view that public ruling BR Pub 95/10 has been useful in respect of the deductibility of expenditure incurred in deriving gross income by investors. However, despite the issue of the ruling there has been occasional uncertainty on how it should be applied. This is especially so for passive investors, and how the continuing on-going costs should be dealt with. Although some of these were discussed within the commentary definitions of the three categories identified, investors, especially passive investors, may have difficulty in applying the Ruling. It seemed logical to extend and further define the present three categories to make it easier for investors to decide whether or not the fees they pay are deductible. An issue that was not fully considered in BR Pub 95/10 was the deductibility of fees incurred by business and speculative investors before their activity commenced. Another issue not fully considered was the deductibility of fees once a speculative activity had commenced. These issues are now reconsidered, as are legislative changes to the trading stock rules and the accrual rules. Financial advisers charge for a number of services provided to their clients, sometimes using different names for these component services. The tax treatment of the fees depends not on the name given to the service, but on the nature of the service. To determine the correct tax treatment of a service, it is important to identify the exact service a financial adviser provides. The adoption of the expanded categorisation of fees in this statement is intended to make it easier for passive investors to determine whether the fees they pay will be deductible for income tax purposes. The categories correspond to the process usually followed when an investor seeks the assistance of a financial adviser. In some instances financial advisers will charge a global fee that may include fees for more than one of the categories of fees described in this statement. Then it will be necessary to apportion the fees into the appropriate fee categories in order to determine deductibility. In addition, since the issue of public ruling BR Pub 95/10, the question of the deductibility of financial planning fees has been considered in three cases before the Taxation Review Authority (TRA). One of these cases was appealed by the Commissioner and heard before the High Court. These cases have established a framework of case law that requires some amendments to the Commissioner’s position set out in BR Pub 95/10. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 5 (May 2000) 30 Legislation Deductibility Expenditure can be deducted from gross income if it is provided for in the Income Tax Act 1994. Section BD 2 states: An amount is an allowable deduction of a taxpayer - (a)if it is an allowance for depreciation that the taxpayer is entitled to under Part E (Timing of Income and Deductions), or (b)to the extent that it is an expenditure or loss (i) incurred by the taxpayer in deriving the taxpayer’s gross income, or (ii)necessarily incurred by the taxpayer in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving the taxpayer’s gross income, or (iii)allowed as a deduction to the taxpayer under Part C (Income Further Defined), D (Deductions Further Defined), E (Timing of Income and Deductions), F (Apportionment and Recharacterised Transactions), G (Avoidance and Non-Market Transactions), H (Treatment of Net Income of Certain Entities), I (Treatment of Net Losses), L (Credits) or M (Tax Payments). Prohibition on deductibility Section BD 2(2) qualifies the general deductibility test in section BD 2. Section BD 2(2)(e) prohibits the deduction of capital. It denies a deduction for expenditure: (e)of a capital nature, unless allowed as a deduction under Part D (Deductions Further Defined), E (Timing of Income and Deductions). Section BD 2(b) prohibits a deduction where the expense relates to exempt income, denying a deduction for expenditure: (b)incurred in deriving exempt income under Part C (Income Further Defined), D (Deductions Further Defined), or F (Apportionment and Recharacterised Transactions). Assessability Under section BD 1, certain types of income are assessable. Sections CD 3, CD 4, and CE 1 further define income. The following income types are relevant to this statement: •Business profits – section CD 3. •Personal property sales – section CD 4. •Interest, dividends, and annuities – section CE 1(1)(a). •Benefits from money advanced – section CE 1(1)(b). •Accruals income – section CE 1(1)(c). Definition “Business” - Includes any profession, trade, manufacture, or undertaking carried on for pecuniary profit: Qualified accruals rules The qualified accruals rules in Part EH provide rules for the timing and recognition of income derived and expenditure incurred in respect of financial arrangements. A financial arrangement is widely defined and means: a debt or debt instrument, an arrangement whereby a person receives money in consideration for a promise for repayment of that money at some future time or at the occurrence of any event, and any arrangements that are substantially similar. Bonds, bank loans, mortgages and government stock are examples of financial arrangements. The deductibility of financial advisers’ fees paid in respect of these financial arrangements is dealt with under the accruals rules and could result in a different tax treatment to investments such as company shares, which are not financial arrangements (ie they are “excepted financial arrangements”). The legislation provides a method for calculating the income (or loss) from financial arrangements. Basically, this methodology compares the total amounts paid out, with the total amounts received, from each financial arrangement. The difference is either gross income or expenditure incurred from the arrangement. Implementation fees paid to a financial adviser for the acquisition of a financial arrangement are included in the calculation of the income (or loss). This matter is further considered in this statement under the heading Qualified accruals rules and implementation fees. If a planning fee is paid in advance to cover future income years, the fees may be “accrual expenditure”, and deductibility may be spread over the number of years to which the fees relate. This too is discussed in more detail later in the statement under the heading Where the fee is “accrual expenditure”. Definitions “Accrual expenditure”, in section EF 1 and EF 4, in relation to any person, means any amount of expenditure incurred on or after 1 August 1986 by the person that is allowed as a deduc- tion under this Act, ..........., other than expenditure incurred - (a)In the purchase of trading stock; or (b)In respect of any financial arrangement; or (c)In respect of a specified lease, or a lease to which section EO 2 applies, or “Core acquisition price” (i)In relation to the holder of the financial arrangement, the value of all consideration provided by the holder in relation to the financial arrangement; or (ii)In relation to the issuer of the financial arrangement, the value of all consideration provided to the issuer in relation to the financial arrangement. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 5 (May 2000) 31 “Excepted financial arrangement” means any of the following arrangements: (includes) (f)In relation to a holder or an issuer, shares, other than withdrawable shares, or an option to buy shares, other than withdrawable shares, where those shares were or that option was acquired or issued by the person before 8.00 p.m. New Zealand Standard Time on 18 June 1987; (g)In relation to a holder or an issuer, shares, other than withdrawable shares, or an option to acquire or to sell or otherwise dispose of shares, other then withdrawable shares, where those shares were or that option was acquired or issued by the person after 8.00 p.m. New Zealand Standard Time on 18 June 1987: “Financial arrangement” - (a)Subject to paragraph (b), means - (i) Any debt or debt instrument; and (ii) Any arrangement (whether or not such arrange- ment includes an arrangement that is a debt or debt instrument, or an excepted financial arrangement) whereby a person obtains money in consideration for a promise by any person to provide money to any person at some future time or times, or upon the occurrence or non-occurrence of some future event or events (including the giving of, or failure to give, notice); and (iii)Any arrangement which is of a substantially similar nature (including, without restricting the generality of the preceding provisions of this subparagraph, sell-back and buy-back arrangements, debt defeasances, and assignments of income); - but does not include any excepted financial arrange- ment that is not part of a financial arrangement: (b) ... Trading stock Changes have been made to the tax rules regarding the valuation of trading stock. The Taxation (Tax Credits, Trading Stock, and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1998 made changes that will affect business and speculative investors. The amending legislation inserted a new subpart EE into the Income Tax Act 1994. The definition of “trading stock” has been clarified so that it is limited to anything that is manufactured, produced, or acquired and held for sale or exchange in the ordinary course of a business. Generally, commencing from the 1998–1999 income year, business investors will now be required to value their trading stock at cost or, in the case of an excepted financial arrangement where the stock is worthless, at a nil value under section EE 3. The previous valuation options of market value and replacement price are no longer available. For business investors, trading stock will not include any investment that is a financial arrangement to which the qualified accruals rules apply. However, excepted financial arrangements (shares, options and other equity type investments) must be valued at cost under section EE 13. For speculative investors, “revenue account property” (property that is either trading stock or would give rise to gross income of the investor when sold or disposed of) that is an excepted financial arrangement, must also be valued at cost. Under section EF 2(1A) these “costs” of acquiring revenue account property (the investments) are not allowed as a deduction until such time as the investments to which they relate are sold. Definition “Revenue account property” means, in respect of any person, property which is trading stock of the person or otherwise property in respect of which any amount derived on disposi- tion would be gross income of the person other than under section EG 19 (disposal of depreciable property): Legislation Section EE 5(1) A taxpayer, other than a small taxpayer, that is valuing closing stock at cost, must include all costs required to be included by generally accepted accounting principles and must allocate those costs to closing stock using methods acceptable under generally accepted accounting principles. Section EE 13 (1)An excepted financial arrangement that is trading stock must be valued at cost. (2)In calculating the value of an excepted financial arrangement that is trading stock or revenue account property, a taxpayer must use one of the cost-flow methods authorised in section EE 6. (3)An excepted financial arrangement that is trading stock may be valued at nil if it - (a)Has no current or likely future market value; and (b)Has been written off as worthless by the taxpayer. Section EF 2(1) Subject to subsection (2), a taxpayer must allocate an allowable deduction in respect of the cost of any revenue account property to the later of - (a)The income year in which the property is disposed of by the taxpayer; and (b)The income year (or years) in which the gross income is derived by the taxpayer in respect of the disposition of the property. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 5 (May 2000) 32 Types of investor The income tax treatment of initial planning, implementation, administration, monitoring, revaluation, replanning and switching fees differs, depending on whether the investor is: •a passive investor •a speculative investor •in the business of investing. These types of investor are defined for the purposes of this statement, and are discussed in more detail below. When is an investor a passive investor? A passive investor is a person whose primary aim is to derive dividend and interest income from a secure investment portfolio. There may also be a secondary hope or possibility that the investments will provide long-term capital appreciation. A passive investor will make changes to the investment portfolio from time to time to achieve this aim. Some investors may also be “actively” involved in monitoring their investment portfolios (or engage a financial adviser to do this for them) to ensure that the primary aim of maximising dividend and interest yield is maintained. The passive investor will not be in business as an investor, nor will the investor buy or sell investments for short-term gains (speculator). When is an investor a speculative investor? A speculative investor is someone who either: •acquires an investment with the intention of selling it; or •carries on or carries out an undertaking or scheme, involving the investment, entered into or devised for the purpose of making a profit. Profits derived or losses incurred in those circumstances are assessable under section CD 4 and deductible under section BD 2. Investors are not speculative investors simply because they would like to see their investment capital increase, or that they may sell their investment if the capital increases. Most passive investors fall within that description. It is the person’s dominant purpose that is important in this distinction. An investor may be a speculative investor in relation to one investment, and not in relation to another. For example, an investor has a number of financial arrangements and investments in unit trusts, and decides as a single transaction to buy some listed shares with the intention of selling them in the next month or so. The dominant purpose for buying the shares is for resale at a profit. In respect of the transaction the investor is a speculative investor. However, if a speculative investor regularly carries out activities of speculating in investments, the question arises as to whether those activities constitute a business of speculating. As discussed below, whether an investor is in business will be a question of fact in each case. An investor’s status as a speculator or in business may affect the deductibility of some planning fees. When is an investor in business? Section OB 1 defines “business” to include: any profession, trade, manufacture, or undertaking carried on for pecuniary profit. Whether a taxpayer is in the business of investing is dependent on that taxpayer’s fact situation. The tests and criteria established by cases such as Grieve v CIR (1989) 6 NZTC 61,682 and CIR v Stockwell (1992) 14 NZTC 9,191 are relevant to this question. The leading “business” case in New Zealand is that of Grieve. In that case the Court of Appeal concluded that there are two aspects to the concept of a business: •the nature of the activity; and •the intention with which the taxpayer undertakes the activity. This approach was followed in Stockwell. The decision in Stockwell is useful in determining whether an individual is in the business of investing. In Stockwell the Court of Appeal discussed, as obiter dicta, the question of when a taxpayer is in business. The Court observed that the question of whether a taxpayer was in business for tax purposes depended on whether the activities undertaken by the taxpayer were sufficiently continuous and extensive to constitute being a business. That is a question of fact and degree and is dependent upon the taxpayer’s particular fact situation. In Grieve, Richardson J set out some factors relevant to the inquiry as to whether a taxpayer is in business: •the nature of the taxpayer’s activities; and •the period over which the taxpayer engages in the activity; and •the scope of the taxpayer’s operations; and •the volume of transactions undertaken; and •the commitment of time, money and effort by the taxpayer; and •the pattern of activity; and •the financial results achieved by the activity. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 5 (May 2000) 33 These factors were reiterated by the Court of Appeal in Stockwell. The Court commented that the test is objective rather than subjective. Taxpayers’ intentions are, therefore, evidenced by their activities (the extent and continuity), not by their own personal view of their activities. In Stockwell the Court of Appeal also provided some observations or guidelines regarding the extent and continuity of activity required to constitute a business: •The fact that a taxpayer’s activity is sufficient to render his or her returns assessable under section 65(2)(e) (now section CD 4) does not mean that the activity is a business. •Where the taxpayer’s activity is merely a means of supplementing an already adequate income, the taxpayer is unlikely to be in the business from which that supplementary income is derived. •If the taxpayer is in full-time employment and engages in a spare-time activity, the presumption will be against that spare-time activity being a business. •If the taxpayer is either unemployed or retired and is only engaged in moderate (investment) activity, the presumption is against that activity being a business. Ultimately, whether a person is in the business of investing will be a question of fact. In seeking to determine whether a taxpayer is in the business of investing, the Commissioner uses the criteria identified above from the Grieve and Stockwell decisions. The following are examples to indicate whether or not an investor is a passive investor, and whether an investor is in the business of investing. Example 1 Investor A is an investment adviser employed by Bank. She spends most of her day advising investors of their investment opportunities and implementing investments for them. Investor A and her husband have a young family and have recently bought a larger house. The extent of their personal investments is minimal. Besides Investor A’s membership of a superannuation scheme operated by Bank, Investor A and her husband have a few thousand dollars invested as a lump sum in a managed fund. They approached a financial adviser for advice on which fund to invest in. The continuity and extent of Investor A’s investment activities make it unlikely that she is in the business of investing. Her employment activities of investment advice do not have any bearing on her personal activities. They must be viewed separately. Investor A is a passive investor. Example 2 Investor B is a retired bank manager. Throughout his professional career he has acquired a number of investments from which he has continued to derive both income and capital growth. Investor B uses the services of a financial adviser in managing his investments. While Investor B takes an interest in the performance of his investments, he leaves the majority of the work to his financial adviser. Investor B only undertakes a minimal amount of buying and selling. Except for some superannuation entitlements, Investor B derives all his income from these investments. If there are no other relevant facts, Investor B is not in the business of investing. Although the investments represent the majority of his income, his activities lack sufficient extent and continuity to constitute a business of investing. Cooke P in Stockwell considered there would be a presumption against a taxpayer being in the business of investing where a retired person undertook merely modest investment activity. The fact that the investments represent a taxpayer’s primary source of income does not automatically make the activity the taxpayer’s business. Investor B is a passive investor. Example 3 Taxpayer C was made redundant by his employer and received a large severance payment. He wished to buy some form of business but could not decide what type. In the intervening period, rather than invest his severance pay in fixed securities, he decided to undertake some share dealing activity with the purpose of increasing his capital. Over a period of eighteen months he spent considerable time pursuing this activity. He instructed and used a regular professional sharebroker from whom he received regular client letters. Taxpayer C received weekly share advice letters from other professional advisors that contained recommendations as to when to buy and sell shares. He studied the daily newspapers, noting share prices of listed companies in which he held shares and the share price movements of other companies. Taxpayer C read articles relating to listed companies’ shares and share movements, and watched any sharemarket programmes on television. He read annual reports of companies in which he held shares, and of some other market leaders. He regularly received share analysis publications from his sharebroker, which gave detailed analysis of the prospects of a number of leading companies in a wide range of sectors, with recommendations as to the buying and selling of shares. During this time Taxpayer C purchased and sold many shares. Any shares purchased were only held for as long as he considered he could maximise returns on Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 5 (May 2000) 34 each share parcel. He acquired the shares on all occasions for the purpose of selling them at a profit and did not purchase them for dividend income. During this time he received other income in the form of superannuation payments and some consultancy fees from his former employer. On the basis of his activities, his purpose and intention with regard to the purchase and sale of shares, Taxpayer C is considered to be in the business of investing. Deductibility provisions (a) General deductibility The general deductibility section is section BD 2(1). Section BD 2(1)(b)(i) applies if the planning expenditure is incurred in gaining or producing gross income. Section BD 2(1)(b)(ii) applies to expenditure incurred in carrying on a business. Section BD 2(1) is subject to section BD 2(2). Section BD 2(2)(e) prohibits the deduction of capital expenditure. “Capital” is not defined. (b) The capital/revenue distinction The courts have had to decide if expenditure is capital in nature in numerous cases. Often they examine various tests to decide whether expenditure has the features of capital, although they emphasise that tests are merely a guide and the particular facts of each situation will determine the matter. In deciding whether planning fees are capital or revenue expenditure, the question is whether the fees are incurred in relation to the capital assets (the profit making structure), or in relation to the income that an investor derives from those assets. The Privy Council in BP Australia Ltd v FCT (1965) 3 All ER 209, cited with approval various judgments of the New Zealand Court of Appeal (eg CIR v Mc Kenzies New Zealand Ltd (1983) 10 NZTC 5233 and CIR v LD Nathan & Co Ltd (1972) NZLR 209), and followed the approach of Dixon J in Sun Newspapers Ltd v FCT (1938) 61 CLR 337 who said that there were three matters to consider when determining whether expenditure is capital or income: •the character of the advantage sought •the manner in which it is to be used, relied upon or enjoyed (and in this and the preceding factor recurrence may be relevant); and •the means adopted to enjoy it. In BP Australia Ltd the Privy Council analysed the character of the advantage sought by the expenditure using a number of tests. The Privy Council considered: •The need or occasion that calls for the expenditure. •Whether the payments were paid out of fixed or circulating capital. •Whether the payments were of a once and for all nature, producing assets or advantages that are of an enduring benefit. •How the sum in question would be treated on ordinary accounting principles. •Whether the sums were expended on the structure within which the profits were to be earned or as part of the income-earning process. The approach adopted by the Privy Council was to consider what the expenditure was calculated to effect. BP Australia has recently been cited in a number of cases before the TRA, and one case heard on appeal to the High Court, dealing with the deductibility of financial planning fees. These cases make it clear that there is a difference in treatment between financial planning fees incurred to commence an investment strategy, and fees paid subsequently to monitor or change an existing portfolio of investments. These cases are discussed in more detail under the heading Recent case law later in this statement. The Authorities and the Court applied the criteria from BP Australia to the specific fact situation of each case. It is, therefore, considered useful to discuss the capital/ revenue distinctions from BP Australia in some detail before proceeding further. The Sun Newspapers tests The first test mentioned in Sun Newspapers, and examined in BP Australia, was the character of the advantage sought. In the context of financial planning fees, the effect the investor wishes to achieve is a plan or strategy for investing his or her financial assets to achieve investment goals. The need or occasion for the expenditure is the investor’s decision to examine his or her financial assets, and to receive initial advice on the best mix and type of assets in which to invest. The investor incurs a planning fee for such advice. The advice received relates to the investor’s capital assets. As a general proposition, the direct purpose of the initial planning advice is to establish the best mix of investments to achieve the investor’s investment goals. The result the investor wishes to achieve may be to derive more income from his or her investments, or it may be another result. Following the initial advice, the investor may subsequently wish to reduce or increase the risk of a portfolio, or may wish to change investments to produce tax-paid returns on retirement. He or she may wish to change from intangible assets to property investments. This subsequent advice may relate to the investor’s capital assets, which are the investor’s profit-earning structure, or to the profit-making process. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 5 (May 2000) 35 Analysis of whether planning advice is capital or revenue expenditure may be similar to analysing whether fees for legal and other professional advice are capital or revenue. It may not always be possible to point to an enduring asset. As with professional advice, the test is to determine whether the expenditure is incurred in relation to the profit-earning structure, or the profit-making process. In Foley Bros Pty Ltd v FC of T (1965) 13 ATD 562, the full High Court of Australia held that in examining the matter to which legal fees related, “the true contrast is between altering the framework within which income producing activities are for the future to be carried on and taking a step as part of those activities within the framework”. The question is whether the expenditure is incurred to achieve an enduring advantage. This test of capital is not whether expenditure results in a permanent, tangible asset (Kemball v C of T \[1932\] NZLR 1305, John Fairfax and Sons Pty Ltd v FC of T (1959) 101 CLR 30), but if the expenditure is incurred to obtain an advantage or something of lasting value. The financial adviser provides an initial plan that becomes the investment framework for the investor. The plan is of continuing benefit to the investor because it forms the investor’s strategy. Using the investor’s goals, the adviser provides an approach to investment that takes into account those goals, and may identify particular investments that will enable those goals to be achieved. Over time, particular investments may no longer serve the purpose of achieving the investor’s goals, and the adviser may recommend new investments. When that happens, the adviser’s new advice may relate to bringing into effect a new investment strategy. The time that a plan is of value to an investor will vary. It will be unusual for a plan to be developed each year. Although aspects of the plan may change as the performance of a particular investment changes or if the investor’s goals change, the initial plan is nonetheless something of lasting value rather than something that is a regular, recurring expense incurred in deriving investment income. Fixed or circulating capital In BP Australia the Privy Council considered that the test of whether sums were payable out of fixed or circulating capital tended in that case to favour the payments as revenue expenditure. The members of the Judicial Committee said (14 ATD 1, 8) that fixed capital is that on which a taxpayer looks to get a return by its trading operation, and circulating capital is that which comes back in the taxpayer’s trading operations. Their Lordships considered that the amounts paid by BP to a service station owner for exclusive dealership (trade ties) were sums that had to come back penny by penny with every order during the period in order to reimburse and justify the particular outlay for the trade ties. They concluded that the lump sums were part of the consistent demand that must be answered out of the returns of the trade. As such, the Privy Council found that the sums were payable out of circulating capital. The test that examines whether expenditure relates to fixed or circulating capital is not usually relevant to a passive or speculative investor. “Fixed capital” and “circulating capital” are relevant terms to a business that has fixed plant and circulating capital that are turned over while making profits and would apply to a business investor. Accounting treatment In BP Australia the Privy Council noted that the sums paid to retailers were entered into the profit and loss account by BP’s accountants. The Privy Council considered it would have been inappropriate to put the sums on the balance sheet. However, they accepted it was misleading to put the whole sum into one year’s expenses. They contemplated the idea of deducting the payments and adding back the unexpired value, but concluded that accountants did not follow this practice. Allocation to revenue was the “slightly preferable” view. In Christchurch Press Company Limited v CIR (1993) 15 NZTC 10, 206, Gallen J noted that there was no evidence on the appropriate accounting treatment of such a payment. However, his Honour referred to a comment of Lord Donovan in IRC v Land Securities Investment Trust Limited \[1969\] 2 All ER 430, 433 (PC) where his Lordship said that where a company used its own employees to build an extension to its factory, the accountant should debit the wages to the capital account relating to the extension. Although the comments of Lord Donovan were criticised by counsel for the taxpayer in Christchurch Press, the Court considered it was at least an indication of what the position was when the case was decided. For passive and speculative investors, the accounting treatment is not relevant as they are not in business. Benefit obtained and method of payment The other two considerations mentioned in Sun Newspapers are the manner in which the benefit obtained by the expense is used, relied upon, or enjoyed, and the method of payment. The initial planning advice will be used as the investor’s ongoing investment strategy. The advice forms the basis for investment of the investor’s capital assets. The method of payment is usually a one-off payment when a plan is first prepared. Further payments may also be made for planning advice if the adviser suggests modifications to the investor’s portfolio, or if the investor’s goals change. However, as discussed under Recent case law, the method of payment is not determinative in deciding whether financial planning fees are on revenue or capital account. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 5 (May 2000) 36 (c) Fees incurred in gaining or producing non- assessable or exempt income No deduction is available to the extent to which fees are incurred in the production of non-assessable or exempt income. Section BD 2 only allows a deduction for expenditure incurred in the production of gross income, or for expenditure necessarily incurred in the carrying on of a business for the purpose of gaining or producing gross income. Section BD 2(2)(b) denies a deduction for expenditure incurred in gaining exempt income. The link between gross income and planning fees will not be present when investments purchased on the advice in a plan are tax-paid investments, eg insurance bonds. Fees paid for investments that do not result in gross income are not deductible for any investor, even if the investor is in the business of investment or is a speculative investor. Therefore, where expenditure on financial planning fees produces non-assessable or exempt income, the fees cannot be deducted. Having determined the general requirements of deductibility, it is necessary to discuss how these requirements apply to the three categories of investors. A.Passive investors–deductibility of fees A passive investor is a person whose primary aim is to derive dividend and interest income from a secure investment portfolio. A secondary hope or expectation may be that the investments will provide long-term capital growth. The passive investor will not be in business as an investor, nor will the investor buy and sell investments for short-term gains. However, most investors are likely to sell and replace investments, from time to time, to ensure that the aims of their investment strategy are continually met. Section BD 2(1)(b)(i) applies to passive investors if the planning expenditure is incurred in gaining or producing gross income, ie the fees must have the requisite connection with the producing of gross income to be deductible. Section BD 2(1)(b)(ii) does not apply to passive investors or speculative investors because it only applies to expenditure incurred in carrying on a business. In addition, section BD 2(2)(e) prohibits the deduction of capital expenditure. Fees for financial plans will fail the general deductibility test under section BD 2(1)(b)(i) if the fees do not have the requisite connection with gross income. For example, when the plan is developed, the investor may not have decided whether to implement it. The investor may have received other advice, and see the plan as a possible method of capital asset reorganisation. No direct link may exist between the plan and deriving gross income from investments purchased on the advice contained in the plan. If the investor has already put a plan in place, and receives further advice from an adviser to achieve new goals, the necessary connection with gross income may be present. However, as discussed above, the fees will not be deductible if they are capital in nature. To determine whether the fees are revenue or capital in nature, it is necessary to examine each of the categories of expenditure charged by financial advisers. Initial planning fees These fees are charged for services provided by the adviser for the initial interview where the investor and the adviser discuss the investor’s investment goals, savings objectives, cash requirements, and life and general insurance requirements. The adviser then prepares a draft portfolio plan for the investor. Further interviews, discussions and adjustments to the draft plan may follow until it is acceptable to the investor. Initial planning fees are not deductible to passive investors because they relate to the creation of a capital structure (the profit or income-earning structure) and are therefore capital expenditure. In some situations, planning fees are not deductible for the further reasons that they are not deductible under the general deductibility section, or because they relate to exempt income or private expenditure. Implementation fees Often financial advisers use another organisation (a “custodian”) to place investments. Advisers pass on the custodian’s implementation charge to the investor, either within their fee, or separately as a disbursement. Implementation fees include fees payable to investment fund managers for entry into the investments. Implementation fees are directly related to establishing the investor’s income-earning structure, and are not related to the income-earning process. The effect achieved is that the investor obtains a new capital asset. The investment asset obtained as a result of the investor incurring an implementation fee will endure, because a passive investor does not buy and sell financial assets frequently and will hold the asset for a time. Implementation fees are not regular or recurring expenses and, therefore, are not deductible to passive investors for income tax purposes. In Case U53 87 ATC 351 heard before the Australian Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the taxpayer paid a fee called a service fee that was calculated as a percentage of the value of units the investor bought in a unit trust (the same unit trust was involved in Case U160 87 ATC 935). The investment document stated that the service fee was for payment in advance for services to be rendered throughout the life of the fund. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 5 (May 2000) 37 No description of the nature of the services was provided in the prospectus of the unit trust. The Tribunal in both cases held that the charges on the basis of a percentage of funds invested indicates that if any services were to be rendered, they would not be in the nature of management services, which were provided for elsewhere in the investment documents. The Tribunal in both cases held that the service fee was in reality part of the cost of the units and was a capital cost. On the basis of Case U53 and Case U160, fees that are an entry cost are not deductible implementation fees. An exception to the general position that implementation fees are not deductible to passive investors, relates to implementation fees that are part of the cost of “financial arrangements” - see under the heading Qualified accruals rules. Administration fees These fees are paid to reimburse the adviser for the costs incurred in maintaining the investor’s portfolio, such as the collection of income and depositing funds to the investor’s bank account or paying direct to the investor. These administration costs are part of the process of the investor earning gross income from the investments. They directly relate to the returns from the investments, rather than relating to the capital investments themselves. Administration fees are often regular, ongoing expenses. The investor does not receive an enduring advantage as a result of this expenditure, and the expenses cannot be linked to the capital structure of the investments. Administration fees are deductible to passive investors under section BD 2(1)(b)(i) because they have a nexus with gross income. In some cases, an administration fee could be paid for several years in advance. Such expenditure could meet the definition of “accrual expenditure” to which section EF 1 applies. The effect of this is that any portion of accrual expenditure not expended in that income year will not be an allowable deduction. That is, the unexpired portion of any such expenditure will be included in the gross income of the passive investor for the income year in which the payment is made, and as such will increase the gross income of the passive investor. See further discussion on this point under the heading Where the fee is “accrual expenditure”. Monitoring fees Monitoring involves the adviser monitoring and evaluating the performance of the investor’s portfolio. Monitoring services include collecting data on the investor’s investments and events and research material that have implications for the investor, and reporting to the investor on this data. The financial adviser may also evaluate performance of the investment portfolio (including performance of fund managers and the adviser) in terms of the investor’s goals, and relay this information to the investor. Monitoring may include arranging the collection of income from investments and exchanging currency. Monitoring fees are usually charged as a percentage of the investment funds under the adviser’s management. For passive investors, monitoring is typically on an annual or semi-annual basis. For business investors, monitoring may be more often. These fees are paid for the adviser to monitor the performance of the investor’s investments. These, like the administration fees, are for management services that are part of the process of the investor earning gross income from investments. The services relate more to the returns from the investments than the investments themselves. Monitoring fees are often regular, ongoing expenses. The investor does not receive an enduring advantage as a result of monitoring. Monitoring fees are deductible by passive investors under section BD 2(1)(b)(i). As noted under Administration fees, to the extent that monitoring fees are accrual expenditure, their deduction will be affected by section EF 1. Evaluation fees Evaluation fees relate to services for a more extensive evaluation of the investor’s investments. These services will occur where the investor, who has already established an income-earning structure (in other words an investment portfolio), desires a review to ensure that the investments are meeting the goals and aims decided at the initial planning stage. This is a more detailed examination of the performance of the investments, rather than simply monitoring performance and reporting to the investor. The service may or may not result in a recommendation from the adviser to make changes. Because these services are directly related to the income earning process, they are revenue in nature. They will qualify for a deduction, provided the advice received and implemented does not result in a significant change to the income-earning structure, eg changing from a portfolio of rental properties to one of shares and securities. In this latter situation the fees will be a prohibited deduction by the operation of section BD 2(2)(e). They are on capital account being a change in the income earning structure. Replanning fees Replanning services may be provided as part of the financial adviser’s on-going service. Using information received from monitoring or re-evaluating an investor’s portfolio, the financial adviser may Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 5 (May 2000) 38 recommend changes to the investor’s investments. The changes may be made to bring the investor’s portfolio into line with the investor’s goals and risk profile, to take advantage of better or new opportunities, or to take into account a change in the investor’s requirements. Some financial advisers may call a fee for this service a monitoring fee. In this situation the service is better described as a planning fee or a replanning fee, even though some of the original investments may be retained. As with evaluation fees discussed above, deductibility of this category of fee will depend upon whether the new plan makes some adjustments to the existing income structure or there is a complete or significant change to the income-earning structure. For passive investors this means that where the change is only to the type of investments held, the fee will be deductible. On the other hand, if the replanning fees result in a significant change in the investment structure or a change in investment type (eg share to rental properties), the fee will not be deductible. See further discussion below under Recent case law. Switching fees These fees are the costs incurred by investors for buying, selling, or changing investments. Whether these costs are deductible as a revenue expense or are prohibited for a deduction because they are of a capital nature will depend on the extent of the changes made to the investment structure. As with the discussion above under Evaluation fees and Re- planning fees, the crucial factor is the extent of the changes. Changes within an investment type will generally be revenue whereas a change to the type of investment structure, or significant changes to an existing structure, will be capital. See further discussion under Recent case law below. Recent case law Three recent Taxation Review Authority cases, and one that has been appealed to the High Court, have dealt with the deductibility of what were described by financial advisers as “portfolio establishment (or monitoring) fees”. All the cases dealt with the deductibility of fees from the same financial planning firm. In the first case, Case T42 (1998) 18 NZTC 8,285, the Authority found in favour of the husband and wife taxpayers. The objectors had claimed a deduction for what was described by the financial planner as “portfolio establishment costs”. Up until the time the objectors sought the advice of the financial planner, the husband had managed a portfolio of shares and other income-earning investments. One of these investments was a superannuation scheme. This was “cashed up” and added to the other investments that formed the total investment capital from which the financial planner created a new portfolio of investments. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue argued that the portfolio establishment costs were of a capital nature and not deductible, as there was a creation of a new or substantially changed income- producing asset. However, Judge Willy determined that the fees were incurred in the monitoring and changing of the taxpayers’ existing investment portfolio rather than the planning or implementation of a new one. The taxpayers had previously managed their own portfolio for a number of years and this was significant in Judge Willy’s reasoning. Case T42 was appealed by the Commissioner (C of IR v BO and M North, (1999) 19 NZTC 15,219). The High Court confirmed the TRA’s decision and dismissed the appeal. Finding for the taxpayers, Williams J said that the payments of the financial planning fees were revenue in nature and deductible for income tax purposes. The fees had been charged for a change in investment without a change in object (“...though the mix of their investments changed markedly, the object of their investments did not”). In applying the tests in BP Australia, the Court ruled that it was not determinative that one of those tests, that the fee was paid “once and for all”, was a point in favour of the Commissioner when seen against all the other factors required to be taken into account. In the second TRA case, Case T64 (1998) 18 NZTC 8,493, the Authority considered the deductibility of a similar portfolio monitoring fee paid by the objector to the financial adviser. In this case the objector had no previous experience in managing an investment portfolio. Judge Barber found that the costs of the fee were of a capital nature and not deductible to the taxpayer. The case concerned a taxpayer who on retirement cashed up shares and superannuation benefits from a family company. He then paid a financial consultant to invest the funds for him as a retired person to achieve a particular level of income. At paragraph 34 of the judgment Barber J said: The essential issue is whether the costs of becoming involved in such funds is part of an income earning process or is related to establishing a capital structure from which income flows. It must be correct to say that, pending the deposits of the said proceeds into the objector’s bank account, he held investments in the family auctioneering company and in the associated company and he held a stake in a superannuation fund. However, these holdings would not be regarded in normal speech as investments for the purpose of gaining investment income, because the main investment (in the auctioneering company) was to provide capital to give the objector (and other family members) a job, salary, and, presumably, some dividends. The other shares and superannuation were part of this concept. Upon retirement and sale of the auctioneering business and maturity of superannuation, the objector was simply holding all his funds in a bank account pending the design for him by experts of a financial investment structure off which he expected to achieve a certain level of income. It Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 5 (May 2000) 39 seems to me that the fee cannot be fairly regarded as incurred in the course of earning income but as incurred in the course of establishing the structure to obtain income. Accordingly, payment of the said consultancy fee repre- sents capital expenditure. In the judgment, the Authority distinguished this present case from Case T42 (discussed earlier). The critical difference is that in Case T42 the objector had an existing “extensive” share portfolio, and the Authority held that the fee was expended as part of the process by which the taxpayers earned their income from their investment portfolio. On the ordinary principles of commercial accounting, that fee would be treated as a debit to revenue and not capital. Willy J found the expenditure to be part of the income earning process because only the prudent management of investments was involved. Interestingly, Barber J in Case T64 stated at paragraph 35, that: Even if one would normally regard the holding of shares in the auctioneering company, with its associated entitlement to superannuation, as an investment structure, it seems to me that the fee in question was incurred to completely change and reconstruct that investment structure. Accord- ingly, the fee can still not be regarded as incurred in the course of an income earning process. This is consistent with the earlier view stated, that a complete change/restructure of investments is on account of capital. At paragraph 39 Barber J said the fees are capital because they relate to an investment portfolio being “created or substantially modified”. This view appears to be consistent with Willy J’s view that the planning or implementation of a new investment portfolio is on account of capital. In the third TRA case, Case U12, the Authority considered a similar case. Here, the taxpayer, before undertaking the investment plan devised by her financial advisers, held her funds in fixed interest bank securities. As these bank deposits had frequently matured she had shopped around for the best investment rates. However, this took up much of her time and she thought it attractive to let the financial planning adviser take over the investment activity. About 40 % of her investment capital stayed in similar fixed interest investments, the remainder being in equity investments. The Commissioner, basing his submissions on an analysis of Cases T42 and T64, submitted that there had been either a clear commencement of a totally new investment structure/strategy or a significant change in an investment structure/strategy. Therefore, the fee was incurred to obtain an appropriate structure or investment of capital from which to achieve income and the fee must be of a capital nature and not deductible. It was not part of an income-earning process. In finding for the taxpayer Judge Barber said that the decision was consistent with Cases T42 and T64 and with the High Court decision in CIR v North. Judge Barber held that the taxpayer was an active investor, and that her investment aims did not alter fundamentally, ie the change was to her mix of investments. Hence the fees were paid in relation to changes to the income earning process of the taxpayer and not the income-earning structure. If they had been the latter, as in Case T64, the payment would be on capital account. It is clear that two factors emerged from the case law that has determined the deductibility of planning fees. One is whether or not the taxpayer had some form of investment strategy prior to seeking and paying for financial advice. If the taxpayer had an existing portfolio of investments, and had active involvement with managing those investments prior to seeking financial advice, it seems the courts would find that the cost of the fees would be incurred in the income- earning process (Case T42, CIR v North, and Case No.U12). On the other hand, if there were no prior investment activities, as in Case T64, the fees would most probably be incurred in establishing a portfolio from which future income could be derived. The other factor that has emerged from case law is that where investment aims or objects have not fundamentally changed, even though there may be a significant change in the investments held (TRA Case U12 and C of IR v North), the fees will be on revenue account. In contrast, where an investment structure has been created or where the investment aims or objects have fundamentally changed, the costs of planning fees will be on capital account. While each case will be decided on its facts, based on the cases cited above, there would need to be either a complete change in investment direction (eg a change from a portfolio of shares and fixed interest deposits to rental property), or an almost complete change to an existing portfolio. In this regard, Williams J in C of IR v North stated: In this case \[Case T42\] Willy DCJ was considering a transposition of investments by an experienced investor without change of object. In Case T64 Barber CJ was considering a fundamental change from an investment of capital designed to provide employment, salary and associated benefits to the investment of that capital in investments of a very different nature designed to provide income. ... it would be imprudent to go further than the comments already made save to say that Cases T42 and T64 clearly indicate the difference in result which is likely to occur between fees charged for a change in investments of a broadly similar nature without change in object by contrast with those charged for fundamental changes in investments where the aim of the objector also alters. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 5 (May 2000) 40 The words “significant” and “substantially modified” are usually interpreted in the context of their use and the facts of the particular case. For example, in the English Court of Appeal in Granada Theatres v Freehold Investments (Leytonstone) \[1958\] 1 W.L.R 845, Jenkins LJ said: Next, what is meant by the words ‘of a substantial nature’? In a South Australian case, Terry’s Motors v. Rinder (\[1945\] S.A.R. 167), the word ‘substantial’ is pilloried as a word devoid of any fixed meaning and as being an unsatisfactory medium for conveying the idea of some ascertainable proportion of a whole. In Palser v. Grinling, Property Holding Co., Ltd. v. Mischeff (\[1948\] 1 All E.R. 1) a question arose as to what was a ‘substantial portion’ of a rent, and the decision is summarised (not perhaps very helpfully) in the headnote (\[1948\] A.C. 291), saying that ‘substantial’ does not mean ‘not unsubstantial’, but is equivalent to ‘considerable’, and that the judge of fact must decide the matter according to circumstances in each case; In Case TRA No.U12 it was determined that there was a significant change in the investment structure, yet the expenditure was still held to be on revenue account (there being no change to the aims or objects). Therefore, in the context of these cases it seems that the change must be more than significant before a deduction will be prohibited as being on capital account. This is consistent with the earlier view that a considerable change (being nearer to a complete change) in investment structure would need to occur before the expenditure would be denied as a deduction. For example, a change from the ownership of buildings, from which rental income is derived, to a portfolio of security and equity investments which produces interest and dividend income would be considered to be more than a significant change. In these situations there would be a discontinuation of one income-earning process for another. The cost of changing from rental income to interest and dividend income, including planning advice fees, would be on capital account as there is a complete change in the income-earning structure (C of IR v North). There will be situations where the investor undertakes a significant change in investment strategy over a period of time, such as selling shares to invest the proceeds in rental properties. The investor sells the shares within the portfolio over a number of years to achieve the best return from those sales. The question this raises is whether the fees, charged by a financial adviser on advice as to the optimum time to sell each bundle of shares, will be deductible as a revenue expense or non-deductible as being capital in nature. In the context of the discussion above it could be argued that each sale of each bundle of shares is not a significant change. However, it is the Commissioner’s view that the systematic disposal of the shares is a process of changing the income earning structure, and therefore the fees charged will be on capital account. Another example of a more than significant or a considerable change is where a taxpayer is made redundant from his work and receives a redundancy payment of $100,000. The money is immediately deposited in a three-month fixed-term account at his local bank while he decides what to do with it. He seeks the advice of a financial planner with the view of investing the redundancy proceeds in shares and securities from which he intends to derive interest and dividends to supplement some part-time employment income. On the basis of the definitions contained in this statement, the taxpayer can be described as a passive investor. The planning fees incurred in establishing the taxpayer’s portfolio will be on capital account as they are the costs of creating an investment structure (Case T64). The simple depositing of the money in the fixed-term account could not be considered to be prior investment activity as there was no “active management” of the investment (C of IR v North). The Australian Tax Office (ATO) issued a determination (DT 95/60) in December 1995 dealing with the deductibility of financial planning fees. The conclusion reached by the ATO was basically the same as public ruling BR Pub 95/10. That is, that generally the fee for drawing up a financial plan is on capital account. The determination stated: In our view, a fee paid to an investment adviser to draw up an investment plan in these circumstances would be a capital outlay even if some or all of the pre-existing investments were maintained as part of the plan. This is because the fee is for the advice that relates to drawing up an investment plan. The character of the outgoing is not altered because the existing investments fit in with the plan. It is still an outgoing of capital ... (Emphasis added.) The ATO determination is consistent with the view of the law taken in BR Pub 95/10, that fees incurred in the creation of, or changes to, an investment plan, are on capital account. Were it not for the recent TRA and High Court cases discussed above, it could be argued that the better view of the law when deciding whether financial planning fees were deductible or not, would be to treat the portfolio as being a collection of individual investments, each investment being a separate asset (unless the taxpayer is a dealer or trader). In applying the capital/revenue deductibility rules on such a basis, the result may be that advice leading to the sale of any such capital asset would be on capital account. Therefore, for passive investors, who sought financial advice that may lead to the sale of one parcel of shares to purchase another parcel, the cost of making those changes (eg switching fees) would be on capital account. However, with the decisions of the High Court (C of IR v North) and the TRA (Case U12), the Commissioner considers that the matter is now to be determined by the weight of this more recent authority. In these two cases it was held that because the taxpayers had an existing portfolio of Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 5 (May 2000) 41 investments, and there was no change to the investors’ aims or objects, the fees related to the income earning process (rather than to a collection of capital assets) and were deductible. Apportionment of global fees This interpretation statement categorises the component parts of financial planning fees, based on the process of obtaining an initial financial plan, subsequent monitoring of the plan, and any following adjustments or alterations to that plan. It is considered that if fees are charged by financial advisers on the basis of the description of these categories, then determining what amount is deductible will be on a more objective basis than the previous Public Ruling. In the event that a financial planner charges a global fee (eg performance fees) for all the services, an apportionment of that global fee, based on the categories discussed in this statement, will be required. The amount allocated to each category will be a question of fact in each case. Example 4 Investor D has a portfolio of investments consisting of shares in listed public companies and deposits in a savings account at his local bank. He seeks advice from a financial adviser as to the appropriateness of these investments, taking into account current dividend and interest income and long-term capital growth. The advice is to completely alter his portfolio by selling off all current investments and investing the proceeds into residential rental properties. The Commissioner considers that this is more than a significant change to the income earning structure. The former income earning process has ceased and a new one commenced. The fees charged to the investor will not be deductible for income tax purposes as they are of a capital nature. Example 5 Investor E has an investment portfolio consisting of shares that generate dividends, and fixed interest debentures. The income from the shares has been inconsistent over the last few years despite, from time to time, the investor selling poor performing company shares and replacing them with shares in companies that seemed to be paying better dividends. He seeks advice on what is the best option to ensure he has some certainty in future annual income. His financial adviser recommends that to ensure certainty he should cash up all current investments and place the proceeds in long term fixed interest bank deposits. He agrees to this and asks the adviser to arrange the sale of the shares and arrange to deposit the proceeds in fixed interest deposits. In this situation the Commissioner considers that there has been a significant change in the income earning process. The investor has made a fundamental change to the investment strategy, ie changing from an investment portfolio where there was some uncertainty in the income from company shares to the continuing certainty of long-term interest bearing deposits. There has been a significant change in the portfolio’s capital structure, and any financial planning fees incurred by Investor E will be of a capital nature and not deductible. Example 6 Investor F is a retired farmer who used the proceeds from the sale of her farm to buy shares in a number of publicly listed companies in the agriculture sector. After a few years of ownership of these shares, she considered that the dividend yield from some of the companies was inadequate and sought the advice of a financial adviser as to her best option to increase her dividend income. Her financial adviser suggests that she sells the majority of her existing portfolio and uses the proceeds to purchase shares in various telecommunication companies that were expected to perform better than the companies in which she held shares. She asked if the financial planning fees she incurred would be deductible against the dividend income. On the basis of the case law discussed in this statement it is the Commissioner’s view that the change is not a significant change to the income- earning structure of Investor F. The changes made to the portfolio are part of the income-earning process and the fees incurred are for the purpose of increasing the dividend income. Therefore, they are on revenue account and qualify as a deduction for income tax purposes. B.Speculative investors—deductibility of fees Speculative investors are investors who acquire an investment with the intention of selling it for the purpose of making a profit from the transaction. These acquisitions and sales are generally of a one-off nature. For a speculative investor, any difference between the cost of the investment and the amount received on disposal of the investment is gross income or a deductible loss. Their investments are called revenue account property as they have been purchased for the purpose of resale. Where a speculative investor seeks planning advice, the deductibility of the fees charged by a financial planning adviser, and the timing of such deductions, will depend on the nature of the fees charged. Preliminary expenditure Any planning advice received by a speculative investor prior to commencing the speculative activity may not have the necessary nexus between the derivation of income from speculating in investments. For example, in Case Q18 (1993) 15 NZTC 5,100 the objector intended setting up as a self-employed Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 5 (May 2000) 42 architect, but before doing so and while still an employee, he undertook a business diploma course at a university. The Commissioner disallowed the claim. In finding for the Commissioner, Barber J at page 5,103 said: In other words, the relevant expenditure was incurred by the objector in November 1988 to prepare him to set up his business as a self-employed architect. That business was not established before 18 November 1989. That type of expenditure is capital in nature and is not revenue. Accord- ingly, the expenditure cannot be deducted. The expenses were preliminary to the establishment of the self-employed architectural business rather than in the course of it. If the objector had been in business at the time he became liable for the course fees, then they would be revenue and deductible. They would not then have been preparatory in nature. (Emphasis added.) The essential feature of this case is that while the expenditure had a sufficient nexus to an income earning process it was incurred by the objector before he entered into business. Therefore, the expenditure was preliminary to the establishment of the business and of a capital nature. There was not a sufficient nexus between the expenditure and the income earning process that commenced subsequent to incurring the course fees. Fees for services, such as planning advice (such as how to go about speculating in investments) received before any activity of speculation has commenced will not, on the basis of Case Q18, be deductible. The advice will form the base knowledge to be utilised when the speculative activity commences. Cost of revenue account property As discussed earlier, investments held for the purpose of resale are revenue account property. Under the new trading stock rules revenue account property must be valued at cost. “Cost” is not defined in the Act in relation to investments that are “excepted financial arrangements” (eg shares and options), and therefore cost must take its ordinary meaning. In general terms, the cost of revenue account property will be its purchase price and the cost of acquisition. Implementation, commissions and brokerage fees paid by an investor to acquire or sell investments will be part of the cost of those investments. The effect of treating these fees as part of the cost of revenue account property is that they are not deductible when incurred, but when the investments to which they relate are eventually sold. Ongoing planning fees Once a speculative activity has been commenced, an issue arises as to whether subsequent planning advice is deductible, and if so, when. In the case of planning fees relating to specific investments, it is considered that such fees meet the definition of cost, ie they have a direct nexus to the investments and are part of the cost of acquisition. Therefore, the fees will be part of the cost of revenue account property, and deductible when the investments to which the fees relate are later sold. Where fees do not relate to specific investments, deductibility will depend upon whether they have a sufficient nexus to the gross income derived. Due to the one-off nature of speculative activities, income must be produced (at some stage) from that particular investment. Without this connection, it cannot be said that the fees are incurred in order to derive gross income. As such, the fees will not be deductible. This raises yet another concern: the extent of the speculation. If the speculation is such that there is an ongoing activity, it could be that the nature of the activities are more akin to a business, with the result that fees not relating to specific investments will have a nexus to the gross income. Whether the investor has an activity that is more than of a one-off nature will be a question of fact. If it is determined that the activity is more akin to a business, the fees will have the same tests of deductibility as that for a business investor (discussed below). Other matters Due to the one-off nature of a speculative activity, such investors will generally not incur administration, monitoring, administration, evaluation, replanning and switching fees. To the extent that a speculative investor’s fees are accrual expenditure, the deduction of those fees will be affected by section EF 1. The effect of section EF 1 is that any accrual expenditure that has not been expended in that income year will not be an allowable deduction in that year, and as such will increase the gross income of the investor. See further discussion on this point under the heading Where the fee is “accrual expenditure”. If the investment is a financial arrangement, the treatment of fees paid may be governed by the accruals rules—see details later in this statement. C.Investors in the business of investing— deductibility of fees Business investors are in the business of investing when the nature of their activity, and their intention in respect of that activity, is sufficient to amount to a business (as discussed earlier in this statement). Investors in the business of investing can deduct, with some restrictions as indicated below, all the fees described above (initial planning, implementation, administrating, monitoring, evaluation, preplanning, and switching fees) under either section BD 2(1)(b)(i) or section BD 2(1)(b)(ii). If an investor is in the business of investing, any difference between the cost of the investment and the amount received on disposal of the investment is Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 5 (May 2000) 43 assessable income or a deductible loss. The investments are trading assets and not capital assets of the investor. Therefore, fees do not fail the test of non-deductibility for the reason that they relate to the investor’s profit-making process. To the extent that a business investor’s fees are accrual expenditure (as discussed earlier), the deduction of those fees will be affected by section EF 1. The effect of section EF 1 is that any accrual expenditure not expended in that income year will not be an allowable deduction in that year, and as such will increase the gross income of the investor. See further discussion on this point under the heading Where the fee is “accrual expenditure”. Establishment fees For business investors, planning fees will be deductible under section BD 2(1)(b)(i) or section BD 2(1)(b)(ii) if they have the necessary connection with the derivation of gross income. However, as discussed above under the heading Speculative investors – deductibility of fees, consideration would need to be given as to whether the expenditure was incurred in establishing the capital base/asset from which the business is carried on. These “preliminary to business” expenses can include costs, such as fees charged by a financial adviser for reporting on an overall business strategy, evaluating business risks and options. The expenditure is generally incurred before the investor commences a business of investing. In these circumstances, the costs relate to the capital structure of the business rather than being incurred in the course of operating the business. Therefore, the costs are non-deductible. Implementation fees The timing of deductions for implementation fees for business investors is subject to either the qualified accruals rules where they are paid in relation to the acquisition of a financial arrangement (discussed below), or the trading stock provisions, ie trading stock is valued at cost. For the same reasons discussed above under the heading Speculative investors – deductibility of fees, such fees will be added to the cost of the investment. If the relevant investment is still on hand at year’s end, the deductibility of implementation fees is effectively deferred until the investment is sold. If the accruals rules apply, they take precedence over the rules applying to trading stock. On-going planning advice For the same reasons noted under Speculative investors - deductibility of fees, ongoing planning advice relating to specific investments are added to the cost of the investment, as such fees meet the definition of cost. However, unlike speculative investors, general planning advice, unrelated to specific investments, will have a nexus to a business investor’s gross income as the nature of a business investor’s activities is to earn gross income from trading in shares or other investments. Therefore, such fees will be deductible when incurred. Example 7 Investor I is an accountant, employed part-time by a major corporate. Three years ago Investor I inherited a substantial sum of money which she put into a wide range of investments. She actively participates in managing her investments. She uses her tax knowledge and accounting expertise to analyse her investments’ performances on a regular basis. She engages the services of a financial adviser so that she can obtain independent, objective, third party advice (and to implement her investment strategies). Although Investor I derives a significant income from her employment as an accountant, the extent and continuity of her investment activities (and her active participation) should be sufficient for Investor I to be considered to be in the business of investing. Investor I is a business investor and all fees, within the restriction explained above, are deductible. Where the fee is “accrual expenditure” “Accrual expenditure” is a term used to describe a payment that relates to costs that extend past the end of the current income year, ie in the context of financial planning fees, payments in advance of the services provided. For example, accrual expenditure could be an up-front payment covering the services of the financial planner for a three-year period. To the extent that a fee is accrual expenditure, for any type of investor, the deduction of those fees will be affected by section EF 1. Under section EF 1(1), accrual expenditure is allowed as a deduction in the year in which it is incurred. However, the unexpired portion of that expenditure must be returned as gross income. In effect, section EF 1(1) allows only a deduction for the expired portion of the expenditure. The amount returned as the unexpired portion in one year is allowed as a deduction in the following income year or years. However, under the exemptions provided in Determination E10, the accrual expenditure rules would only apply if the unexpired portion of the fee exceeded $12,000 and the services to which the fee relates are due to expire later than six months from the end of the investor’s income year. The accrual expenditure rules do not apply where the investment is a financial arrangement. Example 8 Investor J pays a monitoring fee of $21,000 to a financial advisor to cover all monitoring services for a period of three years—the services are to be equally spread over the three years. The effect of applying the Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 5 (May 2000) 44 accrual expenditure rules is that in the first income year only one-third ($7,000) of the fee is deductible, ie $21,000 is allowed as a deduction. However, $14,000 is added back to income as the unexpired portion of accrual expenditure. The unexpired portion is deducted in the following year and any remaining unexpired portion is added back to income. Effectively this will allow a deduction of $7,000 in each of the three years. Qualified accruals rules and implementation fees The Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1999 changed the treatment of financial arrangements entered into on or after 20 May 1999, the date the Act received the Royal Assent. The changes as they relate to the deductibility of financial planning fees are: •The removal of the references to “issuer” and “holder”. The new legislation only refers to a “party” (to a financial arrangement). •With the removal of the holder/issuer distinction, the cash basis holder exemption from the spreading methods has been extended to all parties to financial arrangements. These exemption thresholds have been amended by: (a)increasing from $600,000 to $1,000,000 the threshold in respect of the value of financial arrangements held, and (b)increasing the income and expenditure thresholds from financial arrangements from $70,000 to $100,000, and (c)increasing the threshold whereby a breach of the cash basis threshold occurs where the investor creates a deferral of income, or an acceleration of expenditure, in excess of $40,000. •Removal of the 2% threshold for non- contingent fees. Previously, non-contingent fees up to 2% of the core acquisition price did not have to be spread. This threshold has been removed so that all non-contingent fees are not now spread. The treatment of fees is reflected in the definition of “consideration” in section EH 48. •Non-contingent fee is defined in section OB 1 as a fee for services provided in relation to a person becoming a party to a financial arrangement that is payable whether or not the arrangement proceeds. The amended accrual rules apply only to financial arrangements entered into on or after the date the Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1999 received the Royal Assent—20 May 1999. Any financial arrangements entered into before this date are still dealt with under the former rules. To accomplish the distinction between the former and the new provisions the accrual rules are set out in two divisions. The rules existing prior to the introduction of the new legislation are contained in Division 1, that is, sections EH A1 to EH 19. Division 2 has been inserted after section EH 19 and contains the amended accrual rules. These rules apply to financial arrangements entered into after 20 May 1999. The rules dealing with each division are now discussed. Division 1 Division 1 applies to financial arrangements entered into prior to 20 May 1999. “Financial arrangement” is a defined term in the Act. Broadly, it includes debt instruments, and does not include shares or interests in unit trusts. Therefore, it would apply to such investments as mortgages, loans, government stock, commercial bills, and forward exchange contracts. Financial arrangement implementation fees For passive, speculative, and business investors, the deductibility of financial arrangement implementation fees is given special treatment. Such fees must be dealt with under the qualified accruals rules. For such fees the distinction between passive, speculative, and business investors is often no longer important as the deductibility of the fees is provided for by statute. There are, however, some exceptions to the statutory deductibility of the fees where the distinction between passive, speculative, and business investors is still important. Implementation fees that are part of the acquisition price of the financial arrangement will be allowed as a deduction against income earned from the financial arrangement either: •on the maturity, remission, or sale of the financial arrangement for cash basis holders; or •over the life of the financial arrangement for non-cash basis holders. Implementation fees that are part of the acquisition price of the financial arrangement include: •contingent fees, to the extent that they are provided in relation to the financial arrangement; and •non-contingent fees, to the extent that they exceed 2% of the core acquisition price, and to the extent they are provided in relation to the financial arrangement. Non-contingent fees that are no more than 2% of the core acquisition are deductible under the normal rules for deducting financial planning fees. In this case, the distinction between passive, speculative, and business investors is important. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 5 (May 2000) 45 Contingent implementation fees Where implementation fees are contingent on the financial arrangement being implemented, the fees are part of the “core acquisition price” of the financial arrangement and as such are subject to the accruals rules. The core acquisition price is defined to include “the value of all consideration provided by \[the investor\] in relation to the financial arrangement”. Implementation fees paid to financial advisers or other organisations for their services in implementing financial arrangements are provided “in relation to the financial arrangement”. See Tax Information Bulletin Vol 3, No 4 (December 1991) at pages 5 and 6. Category 1: cash basis holders A cash basis holder is a natural person for whom either the total value of all financial arrangements held by that person will not exceed $600,000, or the income derived in the year by the person from financial arrangements will not exceed $70,000. A further requirement is that the difference between the income that would be returned under the accruals rules, and the income returned as a cash basis holder, does not exceed $20,000. An investor who is a cash basis holder returns income and expenditure relating to financial arrangements as and when the income is derived and expenditure incurred. Implementation fees that are part of the acquisition price, however, cannot be taken as a deduction in the year they are incurred. Instead, when the investment matures, is remitted, or is sold, the investor will get credit for the fees when he or she performs a cash base price adjustment. The cash base price adjustment compares all amounts received by the investor in respect of the investment, with all amounts provided by the investor in relation to the investment. The amounts provided by the investor are the acquisition price. This calculation will usually mean a comparison of the amount returned at the end of the investment and interest received, with the amounts provided and any direct costs of the investment. If the cash base price adjustment results in a positive amount, the amount is income to the investor. If the cash base price adjustment results in a negative amount, the amount is an allowable deduction. Because implementation fees are part of the acquisition price, they can be offset against income received from the financial arrangement. This has the effect of allowing a deduction for the fees on the maturity, remission, or sale of a financial arrangement. Accordingly, if an investor is a cash basis holder, he or she may deduct implementation fees, irrespective of whether the investor is a passive investor, in the business of investing, or a speculative investor. Category 2: non-cash basis holders If an investor is not a cash basis holder, he or she must return income and expenditure according to the rules set out in section EH 1. Section EH 1(1) requires that for the purposes of calculating income and expenditure under sections EH 1(2) to (6), regard must be had to the amount of consideration provided by the person. The accruals rules spread the difference between amounts received by the person and amounts provided by the person over the life of the financial arrangement. Where implementation fees are part of the acquisition price of the arrangement, they will be one of the amounts provided by the person that is spread over the life of the arrangement. While the Act does not strictly allow a deduction for the implementation fees under the accrual rules, the end result is the same as the investor returns less income over the life of the financial arrangement, ie on the sale or disposition of the financial arrangement, the accruals rules arrive at a net result for tax purposes taking into account all costs and fees associated with its acquisition. Non-contingent implementation fees It is most likely that implementation fees will be contingent on the implementation of a financial plan. However, if implementation fees are not contingent on the implementation of the plan, they are covered by specific rules: •If the non-contingent fees are no more than two percent (2%) of the core acquisition price, they are excluded from the accruals rules calculations and their deductibility is tested under normal income tax rules. •If the non-contingent fees are greater than two percent (2%) of the core acquisition price, they are included within the accruals rules calculations to the extent that they exceed 2% of the core acquisition price. The remaining amount of fees (that is equal to 2% of the core acquisition price) is deductible or otherwise under normal income tax rules. Thus for non-contingent fees amounting to 2% or less of the core acquisition price of the financial arrangement, the distinction between passive, business, and speculative investors is important as the normal income tax rules of deductibility will apply. For non-contingent fees, to the extent that they exceed 2% of the core acquisition price of the financial arrangement, the discussion above relating to contingent fees is relevant. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 5 (May 2000) 46 Example 9 Investor K is a cash basis holder who has invested in a number of financial arrangements on the advice of her financial adviser. Investor K is a passive investor. She paid a fee of 2% of the cost of the financial arrangements as a commission to her adviser. The fee was contingent on the financial arrangements being purchased. Investor K may not initially deduct the fee. The fee is a contingent fee and included in the acquisition price of the financial arrangement as a direct cost of the investment. As a contingent fee, it is not deductible until a cash base price adjustment is made on the maturity, remission, or sale of the financial arrangement. At that time it will be allowed as an amount provided by the investor, to be offset against amounts received. If the fee charged was a non-contingent fee, then, to the extent that it was no more than 2% of the core acquisition price of the financial arrangement, it would be excluded from the accruals rules and tested according to normal principles. As such it would be non-deductible, as Investor K is a passive investor. Division 2 This division applies to financial planning fees incurred in respect of financial arrangements entered into on or after 20 May 1999. As discussed earlier the distinction between holder and issuer has been removed and the term “cash basis person” applies to all parties to the financial arrangement who satisfy the following criteria. Contingent fees – Cash basis person concession In Division 2, (section EH 27(1)) the concessions for determining whether a person is a cash basis person have been extended. A cash basis person is a natural person who is a party to financial arrangements where the absolute value of each of the person’s financial arrangements added together has a total face value of not more than $1,000,000 (up from $600,000). Alternatively, under the new income and expenditure threshold, a person will be a cash basis person if the absolute value of the person’s income or expenditure, calculated under the accrual rules, from the financial arrangements is less than $100,000. The absolute value of the person’s income and expenditure means that income is not offset by any expenditure. For example, a person with two financial arrangements, one deriving income of $50,000 and the other incurring expenditure of $20,000, would have an absolute value of $70,000. The income and expenditure threshold ($100,000) is not breached and the person is a cash basis person. If either one or both of the above two threshold tests are met, a further requirement to qualify as a cash basis person is that the taxpayer must also meet the deferral test. A breach of the deferral test occurs if the person creates a deferral of income or an acceleration of expenditure in excess of $40,000 in aggregate. (Section EH 27(3).) Non-contingent fees Under Division 2 all non-contingent fees are excluded from the accrual rules calculations, and their deductibility is subject to the normal income tax rules (essentially, whether there is a nexus to the income derived). This means that the deductibility of fees dealt with earlier in this statement under the separate headings of passive, speculative, and business investors will apply instead of the accrual rules. Transitional adjustments As discussed above, Division 1 applies to financial arrangements entered into before 20 May 1999. However, under section EH 17, investors may choose to apply the new rules in Division 2 to those financial arrangements. This will be useful, for example, if investors wish to account for all arrangements on a similar basis. Full details of this option and other changes to the accrual rules are included in Ta x Information Bulletin Vol 11, No 6 (July 1999). Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 5 (May 2000) 47 STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS These statements describe how the Commissioner will, in practice, exercise a statutory discretion or deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. TAPE-RECORDING INLAND REVENUE INTERVIEWS INV-330 Introduction In keeping with its efforts to streamline its activities by using technology, Inland Revenue has been conducting some of its interviews using audio recording rather than the traditional method of taking hand written notes. This Standard Practice Statement (SPS) outlines Inland Revenue’s standard practice when audio taping an interview. Interviews can range from general information exchanges where Inland Revenue will gather information to enable resolution of queries, through to formal interview situations where a line of enquiry has potential for litigation. Generally, interviewees will be advised of the intention to tape-record interviews by Inland Revenue when arranging interviews. Occasions may arise where, after having arranged an interview, Inland Revenue may seek to tape-record and interviewees will be advised prior to the commencement of the interview. Where interviews are voluntary, Inland Revenue will respect interviewees’ decisions to decline tape-recording of discussion. Statements made during recorded interviews may be admissible as evidence, and in this respect it is important that the interviews are carried out fairly to the person being interviewed. Admissibility will however, be subject to the normal rules of evidence applicable to the presiding Court. Before going into the general detail of Inland Revenue practice when taping interviews, it is opportune to reflect on why the SPS has been developed. Over recent years, Inland Revenue has used tape recorders at various interviews simply for ease of providing a complete record of discussion between parties. This has ranged from the use of Dictaphones through to the use of triple deck recorders, depending on the needs of the parties and the types of interviews. It now seems appropriate to establish a standard practice which is able to be applied across a variety of interview situations where tape recorders might reasonably be used. The simple use of technology to record (generally by consensus) interview situations does not result in any significant change to current Inland Revenue practice. Application This Standard Practice Statement applies from 1 June 2000. This SPS will not apply to an independent contractor who is conducting an interview on behalf of Inland Revenue, for example a research company contracted to carry out a customer satisfaction survey or an external solicitor under contract to carry out a Child Support review. Advantages Recording interviews in audio format is now a common practice by investigative agencies and there are advantages for both Inland Revenue staff and the person being interviewed in audio recording. •The interview will take less time than is the case when hand written notes are taken. •There is an exact record of what was said at the interview by both the interviewee and the Inland Revenue Officer conducting the interview. •Tape-recording provides far greater clarity of content of what is said and the inferences from it. •The Inland Revenue staff member and the interviewee can concentrate fully on the interview instead of there being a delay in taking full notes. •There will be a copy of the taped interview available to the interviewee. •If Inland Revenue transcribes the tape a full copy is available for the interviewee after transcription. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 5 (May 2000) 48 Standard Practice When to tape interviews Tape recording may be deemed necessary if: •The tax affairs to which the interview relates are complex. •There are numerous facts to be gathered. •There are inconsistencies in the interviewee’s explanations to date. •The relationship between the interviewee and Inland Revenue has deteriorated and objectivity needs to be restored. •Inland Revenue has reasonable grounds for considering legal proceedings may be taken involving the interviewee or some other taxpayer. •Inland Revenue has reasonable grounds for considering that the interviewee may provide important information in circumstances where the interviewee’s or another taxpayer’s purpose or intention is relevant, eg in relation to avoidance. •The interviewee requests that the interview be recorded. However, these are examples only and the decision by Inland Revenue staff to tape-record an interview is not limited to these situations. An interviewee may request that an interview be recorded using the audio monitor equipment. Such requests must be made prior to the interview and will be subject to the availability of Inland Revenue’s recording equipment. In most cases, the interviewee will be advised prior to attending the interview that the intention is to record the interview. Consent Where an interviewee is attending an interview voluntarily the interview will only be recorded with the consent and co-operation of the interviewee. Attendance at an inquiry by the Commissioner under section 19 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is compulsory. All interviews carried out under this section will be tape-recorded. The interviewee can not decline the tape-recording of interviews carried out under this section. There will not be any secret tape-recording of interviews. To minimise the possibility of accusations of secret recording the interviewee’s acknowledgement that the interview is being taped will also be recorded during the interview. Equipment When Inland Revenue intends to record interviews, Inland Revenue will provide the audio equipment; this will be general practice whether interviews are held at an Inland Revenue office or elsewhere. New tape cassettes should be used for each interview. The audio monitoring equipment used to record interviews may vary between Inland Revenue offices. Interviews may be taped on any equipment as long as the recording equipment records the interview clearly and all the participants can be heard and are distinguishable on the tape. Inland Revenue may use equipment that produces one, two or three copies of the taped interview. 1.Master Copy Where Inland Revenue uses recording equipment that produces three copies of the taped interview one copy will become the master tape. This cassette will be removed from the recorder and sealed at the conclusion of the interview while the interviewee is still present. It will be stored in a secure place in the Inland Revenue office. It will remain sealed until such time as it may be required for evidential purposes. 2.Interviewee’s Copy If a two or three tape cassette recorder is used the interviewee will be given one of the cassettes immediately after the interview to keep for his/her own purposes. If a single deck recorder is used and the interviewee requests a copy of the interview then Inland Revenue will make another copy as soon as possible after the interview and give it to the interviewee. 3.Working Copy The working copy of the tape becomes part of the investigation records and is used for any other purposes as required. Inland Revenue will usually copy the working copy and use this version to work with. If it should get lost or destroyed another copy can be made from the original working copy. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 5 (May 2000) 49 Labelling of cassettes Each cassette and its cover (where no cover is available, a sealed bag or envelope will be used) will have an adhesive label affixed on which should be written: •Interviewee’s name •Interviewer’s name •Date of interview This Standard Practice Statement was signed by me on 11 May 2000. Margaret Cotton National Manager Technical Standards Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 5 (May 2000) 50 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 5 (May 2000) 51 QUESTIONS WE’VE BEEN ASKED This section of the Tax Information Bulletin sets out the answers to some day-to-day questions that people have asked. We have published these as they may be of general interest to readers. These items are based on letters we’ve received. A general similarity to items in this package will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case will depend on its own facts. TAX RESIDENCE AND ELIGIBILITY OF MIGRANTS FOR RETURNING RESIDENTS’ VISAS Tax Information Bulletin Vol 11, No 11 (December 1999) contained a “Question We’ve Been Asked” explaining the criteria used by the New Zealand Immigration Service for determining eligibility for Returning Residents Visas (RRVs), and the relevance of tax residence to those criteria. It was noted in the article that tax residence would no longer be a relevant factor for RRV eligibility from June 2000. This was based on a decision made by the previous Government last year. It has now come to our attention that the new Government has put that decision on hold pending further review. Until a final decision is made, tax residence will continue to be used as a factor in determining RRV eligibility. SHORTFALL PENALTIES FOR FAILURE TO DEDUCT OR ACCOUNT FOR PAYE Sections 3, 4A(4) and 141A-141E of the Tax Administration Act 1994 We have been asked what shortfall penalties may be imposed if an employer fails to deduct or account for PAYE. Any or none of the five types of shortfall penalty (lack of reasonable care, gross carelessness, unacceptable interpretation, abusive tax position and evasion) may be imposed, depending on the culpability of the taxpayer. In each case the circumstances surrounding the failure to account or deduct are considered individually and a decision made about whether a shortfall penalty is to be imposed. As far as possible the examples in this item indicate Inland Revenue’s approach in similar or identical circumstances. Where a PAYE shortfall occurs, a number of factors will be considered to establish whether shortfall penalties should be imposed, including; •The employer’s knowledge of the trust money status of PAYE. •The processes the employer has in place to ensure that returns are correct, filed on time and PAYE accounted for on time. •Who is responsible for drawing up deduction details and forwarding payment by the due date. •The length of time the taxpayer has been employing staff, and their awareness of the obligation to deduct PAYE and make payments by the due date. •Whether the taxpayer was aware that PAYE had not been accounted for by the due date and that an offence was being committed. •Whether steps were taken to rectify the situation after the taxpayer became aware that payment had not been made. •Reasons why the deductions were not paid by the due date and who is responsible to ensure payment is made. •For what purpose(s) the deductions were used when not paid by the due date. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 5 (May 2000) 52 Below are some examples of cases where PAYE was not deducted or accounted for: Lack of Reasonable Care The reasonable care test requires a taxpayer to exercise the level of care that a reasonable person would be likely to exercise to fulfil their tax obligations. Example one A company employed a new accounts person who was responsible for the calculation of wages and returning PAYE. The previous accounts person left without leaving instructions or giving training and the employer was aware the new person had little experience in dealing with PAYE. Although PAYE for the month was deducted, the PAYE was not accounted for by the due date. The shortfall became apparent to Inland Revenue when the employer filed the employer monthly schedule (IR 348). In the above scenario, contact with the taxpayer established that the shortfall was due to a new, untrained staff member. This employer should have foreseen the risks when a new staff member joins the business, and ensured that the staff member had sufficient training to do the job, and that systems were in place to ensure the PAYE was paid on time. The failure to do so implies a lack of care. A shortfall penalty of 20% of the shortfall would be imposed for “not taking reasonable care”. Example two An employer deducted PAYE from all employees correctly, and placed the envelope with the PAYE return and payment in her briefcase, along with several other letters to be posted. When she got to the Post Office and took the letters out of her briefcase, the PAYE envelope had fallen inside a book in the briefcase, was overlooked and not posted. The employer posted the return and payment several days later, as soon as she discovered that the envelope had not been posted. In this case the employer had taken reasonable care to meet her obligations to deduct and account for PAYE. The failure to post the return and payment was a genuine accident. No shortfall penalty would be imposed. The taxpayer would be able to apply for remission of late payment penalties. Gross carelessness Gross carelessness is doing or not doing something in a way that suggests or implies a high level of disregard for the consequences. Example three An employee sought information from Inland Revenue after their employer refused to provide income details when requested. The employer is registered for PAYE but does not keep any proper records or deductions so that each month when he puts in his IR 345 and employer monthly schedule he makes estimates of the amounts deducted. He was audited and it was found that each month there was a substantial tax shortfall. The shortfall penalty for evasion could be considered, but in this case it could not be proved “on balance of probability” that the employer had never intended to return the PAYE. The shortfall penalty for gross carelessness is the appropriate shortfall penalty because the employer did intend to account for the deductions, but he did not keep adequate records to correctly account for PAYE. This indicates that the employer was reckless and knew that there was a high chance of a tax shortfall occurring. In this scenario prosecution action for failure to account will also be considered Example four A company employs eight people. The business is registered as an employer and has received an advisory visit from a Business Tax Information Officer during which tax and employer obligations, and the distinction between employees and contractors were discussed. As staff have joined the company after the initial setting up stage they have been treated as self-employed, despite working under essentially the same conditions as the existing employees. PAYE is deducted from five employees’ wages, the three newer staff provide an invoice and no tax is deducted from payments to them. These additional staff have to take care of their own tax and ACC obligations. As the result of an audit it was disclosed that tax should have been deducted from the earnings of the three contractors as they were engaged full time and under similar conditions to the employees. The employer was reckless regarding his tax obligations—acting as he did meant there was a high risk of a tax shortfall occurring. The employer showed a complete disregard for the consequences of his actions; therefore a shortfall penalty for gross carelessness would be imposed. Evasion or similar act All offences in this category require the person to have knowledge, that is, the taxpayer must have knowingly failed to account for or make deductions. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 5 (May 2000) 53 Example five An employer returns PAYE twice monthly, and had failed to account by the due date. An Inland Revenue officer interviewed the employer and discussed the importance of compliance. The employer stated that although he knew that he was required to pay the deductions to Inland Revenue, he had to choose between paying creditors to keep the business going or paying Inland Revenue. He had decided to pay the creditors. Numerous court decisions have held that liquidity or cash flow problems are not a cause beyond the taxpayer’s control, and therefore are not a defence. Shortfall penalties for evasion would be imposed in this instance. The taxpayer had knowingly failed to account for the deductions by the due date. Further information Further discussion of the Commissioner’s practice for imposing shortfall penalties may be found in the following Standard Practice Statements: INV-200: Not taking reasonable care (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 10, No 3 (March 1998)) INV-205: Unacceptable interpretation (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 10, No 3 (March 1998)) INV-206: Unacceptable interpretation – non application of a tax law (Tax Information Bulletin Vo l 10, No 5 (May 1998)) INV-210: Gross carelessness (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 10, No 3 (March 1998)) INV-215: Abusive tax position (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 10, No 3 (March 1998)) INV-220: Evasion or similar act (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 10, No 3 (March 1998)) Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 5 (May 2000) 54 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 5 (May 2000) 55 REGULAR FEATURES DUE DATES REMINDER These dates are taken from Inland Revenue’s Smart business tax due date calendar 2000—2001 June 2000 6Employer monthly schedule: large employers ($100,000 or more PAYE and SSCWT deductions per annum) •IR 348 Employer monthly schedule due Employer deductions: large employers ($100,000 or more PAYE and SSCWT deductions per annum) • IR 345 or IR 346 Employer deductions form and payment due 20Employer deductions: large employers ($100,000 or more PAYE and SSCWT deductions per annum) •IR 345 or IR 346 Employer deductions form and payment due Employer deductions and Employer monthly schedule: small employers (less than $100,000 PAYE and SSCWT deductions per annum) •IR 345 or IR 346 Employer deductions form and payment due •IR 348 Employer monthly schedule due 30GST return and payment due July 2000 5Employer monthly schedule: large employers ($100,000 or more PAYE and SSCWT deductions per annum) •IR 348 Employer monthly schedule due Employer deductions: large employers ($100,000 or more PAYE and SSCWT deductions per annum) •IR 345 or IR 346 Employer deductions form and payment due 7Provisional tax instalments due for people and organisations with a March balance date 20Employer deductions: large employers ($100,000 or more PAYE and SSCWT deductions per annum) •IR 345 or IR 346 Employer deductions form and payment due Employer deductions and Employer monthly schedule: small employers (less than $100,000 PAYE and SSCWT deductions per annum) •IR 345 or IR 346 Employer deductions form and payment due •IR 348 Employer monthly schedule due FBT return and payment due 31GST return and payment due Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 5 (May 2000) 56 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Volume 12, No 5 (May 2000) 57 Name Address Draft standard practice statementComment deadline ED 0014: Offsetting and transferring refunds30 June 2000 Items are not generally available once the comment deadline has passed Affix Stamp Here No envelope needed—simply fold, tape shut, stamp and post.

Please see page 25 for details on how to obtain copies: Ref.Draft typeDescription IG0010Interpretation guidelineWork of a minor nature. The item provides guidance on how the courts have determined whether specific work undertaken as part of development or division work, in the context of section CD 1(2)(f) of the Income Tax Act 1994, constitutes “work of a minor nature” and therefore excludes sale proceeds from being treated as gross income of the taxpayer.

The Commissioner can issue binding rulings in certain situations. Inland Revenue is bound to follow such a ruling if a taxpayer to whom the ruling applies calculates tax liability based on it. For full details of how binding rulings work, see our information booklet Adjudication & Rulings, a guide to Binding Rulings (IR 715) or the article on page 1 of Tax Information Bulletin Vol 6, No 12 (May 1995) or Vol 7, No 2 (August 1995).

Some formatting changes have also been made. BR Pub 95/12 applies when the time of supply occurred prior to 1 March 1999. This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections 2(1) (definition of “money”), 3(1) (definition of “financial services”), 10(2), 14(a), and 77. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the acceptance by a registered person of payment in foreign currency for a taxable supply of goods or services made in New Zealand. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: 1.The value of the taxable supply is the amount of foreign currency converted to New Zealand currency at the exchange rate applying at the time of supply. 2.The appropriate exchange rate is the rate offered by a registered bank or a bureau de change at the time of supply. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 1 March 1999 to 29 February 2004. This Ruling is signed by me on the 29th day of May 2000. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 6 (June 2000) 5 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR PUB 00/04 Section 14(a) exempts supplies of financial services from GST. Section 10 provides for the value of supply. Section 10(2) states: Subject to this section, the value of a supply of goods and services shall be such amount as, with the addition of the tax charged, is equal to the aggregate of,- (a)To the extent that the consideration for the supply is consideration in money, the amount of the money: Section 77 states: For the purposes of this Act, all amounts of money shall be expressed in terms of New Zealand currency, and in any case where and to the extent that such amount is consideration in money for a supply, that amount shall be expressed in terms of New Zealand currency as at the time of that supply. Application of the legislation Number of supplies When a registered person sells goods and services to a customer who pays in foreign currency there is only one supply. That supply is the supply of goods and services. A possible alternative view is that there are two supplies in these circumstances: the first supply being a supply of goods and services from the registered person to the customer, the second supply being an exempt supply (under section 3(1)(a) and section 14(a)) of the exchange of currency, also from the registered person to the customer. However, as already stated, that is not the position where a sale of goods and services occurs with the customer paying in foreign currency—there is only one supply in this situation. The position is different if a customer, having already completed an exchange of foreign currency for New Zealand currency with a registered person, then chooses in a separate transaction to use that New Zealand currency to purchase goods and services from the same registered person. It will be a question of fact in each case whether there are one or two supplies. In the ordinary commercial situation there can be no reconstruction of the transaction to recharacterise two supplies as one or vice versa, nor is it appropriate to apply principles of economic equivalence to achieve similar results between one supply and two supply situations. When a registered person accepts foreign currency in payment for supplies, there is no exempt supply of the exchange of currency. To be an exchange of currency under section 3(1)(a) one currency must be exchanged for another. Section 3(1)(a) does not cover the situation when currency is exchanged for goods and services. The fact that the registered person will later This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 00/04 (“the Ruling”). The subject matter covered in this Ruling was previously dealt with by BR Pub 95/12 and in Ta x Information Bulletin Vol 7, No 7 (January 1996), on page 17. This Ruling applies for the period from 1 March 1999 to 29 February 2004. Background Public ruling BR Pub 95/12 dealt with the GST consequences of receiving payment in foreign currency for taxable supplies of goods and services made in New Zealand. A number of registered persons, particularly those involved in tourism, accept foreign currency as payment for supplies of goods and services. Often a registered person will offer the customer an “in-house” exchange rate. This exchange rate is less favourable to the customer than other exchange rates. That is, the customer gets less New Zealand currency for the foreign currency than that obtainable at a bank or bureau de change. The registered supplier will exchange the foreign currency at a bank and receive New Zealand currency. Because the bank exchange rate is better than the exchange rate the registered person gave the customer, the registered person will make a profit on the conversion of the foreign currency. The Ruling considers the GST treatment of such a profit. In particular, the Ruling considers whether the profit is consideration for an exempt supply, or whether the profit is part of the consideration for a taxable supply. Legislation Section 2(1) defines “money”: “Money” includes- (a)Bank notes and other currency, being any negotiable instruments used or circulated, or intended for use or circulation, as currency; and (b)Postal notes and money orders; and (c)Promissory notes and bills of exchange,- whether of New Zealand or any other country, but does not include a collector’s piece, investment article, or item of numismatic interest. Section 3(1) defines “financial services”. Under paragraph (a): For the purposes of this Act, the term “financial services” means any one or more of the following activities: (a)The exchange of currency (whether effected by the exchange of bank notes or coin, by crediting or debiting accounts, or otherwise)... Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 6 (June 2000) 6 exchange the currency with a bank or bureau de change does not alter this. The transaction between the bank or bureau de change and the registered person involves an exempt supply of the exchange of currency by the bank or bureau de change to the registered person. There is no such exempt supply from the registered person to the customer paying with foreign currency. In situations where there is only one supply, a supply of goods and services, the value of supply is important, particularly since the registered person usually makes a profit from the low exchange rate. Value of supply When a registered person sells goods and services to a customer, the value of supply is determined using the rules in section 10. Under section 10(2)(a), when consideration for the supply is an amount of money, the value of supply is the amount of money. “Money” is defined in section 2(1) and includes foreign currency. Therefore, when a customer tenders foreign currency as consideration for a supply, the value of supply is the amount of foreign currency. However, section 77 requires all amounts of money tendered in consideration of a supply to be “expressed in terms of New Zealand currency as at the time of that supply”. “Expressed in terms of New Zealand currency” Three interpretations of the phrase “all amounts of money shall be expressed in terms of New Zealand currency” are possible. It could mean that: •the parties must state their transaction, or document it, in New Zealand currency and the supplier returns that amount for GST purposes; or •the supplier must convert foreign currency to New Zealand currency at the current market exchange rate and return that amount for GST purposes; or •the supplier may convert foreign currency to New Zealand currency at the rate agreed between the parties and returns that amount for GST purposes. The first interpretation does not require any type of conversion, whereas the second and third do. The words in section 77 are exactly equivalent to those in section 20(1) of the Australian Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. Section 20(1) had been accepted as embodying the decision of the Privy Council in Payne v Deputy FCT \[1936\] 2 All ER 793 (see, for example, Dixon J in Adelaide Electric Supply Co Ltd v FCT (1949) 78 CLR 557). In the Payne decision, Lord Russell said at page 796 of the judgment: ...the assessable income of the taxpayer must, whatever be the currency in which he derives it, all be expressed in terms of Australian currency; in other words if any portion of his assessable income is derived by him in French or Belgian currency, it must before he can be properly assessed to Australian income tax be converted into its equivalent, at the time it was derived, in Australian currency. In exactly the same way, any income derived by him in British currency must be converted into its equivalent in Australian currency. In short when an Australian statute tells the taxpayer to state his derived income in order that a fraction thereof (i.e., so many pence in the pound of derived income) may be taken as tax, this can only mean that his derived income is to be stated and dealt with in terms of Australian currency. From this it would accordingly follow that the commissioner was right in including the amount of £1,097 in the appellant’s assessment. \[Emphasis added.\] Lord Russell was using the words subsequently adopted in section 20(1) in the sense described above in the second interpretation. Accordingly, the second interpretation of the phrase in section 77 is to be preferred to the first and third interpretations. That is, the phrase “expressed in terms of New Zealand currency” in section 77 requires the amount of foreign currency tendered as consideration for a supply to be converted into an amount of New Zealand currency at the exchange rate applying at the time of supply. The above interpretation is also consistent with the use of the same phrase by the New Zealand legislature in the now repealed section KF 2(5) (definition of “effective rate of domestic income tax”). The relevant part of the former section KF 2(5) stated: “Effective rate of domestic income tax”, in relation to a company that is not resident in New Zealand and to an accounting year of that company, means the rate ascertained in accordance with the following formula: a b where- ais the total income tax (expressed in terms of New Zealand currency at the rate of exchangein force on the last day of that accounting year) payable by that company in the country orterritory in which it is resident, in respect of the total income derived by it in that accounting year, being the total income upon which the total income tax is levied; and bis that total income (expressed in terms of New Zealand currency at the rate of exchange inforce on the last day of that accounting year): \[Emphasis added.\] This definition is an equivalent use of the phrase in section 77, and supports the interpretation that the phrase requires some type of conversion. As already outlined, the decision in Payne supports the interpretation of the phrase in section 77 as requiring the conversion of the foreign currency (tendered as consideration for a supply) at the exchange rate applying at the time of supply. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 6 (June 2000) 7 Exchange rate applying at the time of supply Section 77 requires the amount of money that is consideration for a supply to be expressed in terms of New Zealand currency “as at the time of that supply”. Section 9 determines the time at which any supply takes place. Section 9(1) states the general rule, that is, a supply shall be deemed to take place at the earlier of the time an invoice is issued or the time any payment is received by the supplier. In the circumstances to which the Ruling applies, the time of supply is the time of payment. Accordingly, it is the exchange rate applying at the time of payment that is to be used to convert the foreign currency to NZ$ for GST purposes and not an exchange rate applying at the date the registered person converts the foreign currency to NZ$. Nor can the rate of exchange actually obtained on the conversion of the foreign currency be used. The Commissioner will accept the exchange rates offered by a registered bank or bureau de change. In this connection the Commissioner will accept the bank exchange rates of ASB Bank, ANZ, BNZ, National Bank of New Zealand, or WestpacTrust. The Commissioner will also accept the bureau de change exchange rates of Thomas Cook or American Express. The value of supply is not the value of foreign currency tendered as consideration exchanged at the registered person’s low exchange rate. Instead, it is the value of foreign currency tendered as consideration converted at the exchange rate determined by the registered banks and bureaux de change operating in the foreign exchange markets at the time of supply (payment). Examples Example 1 Hotel Guest wishes to exchange some foreign currency for New Zealand currency. Hotel offers him a low exchange rate, which he accepts. Hotel exchanges the foreign currency at a bank and makes a small profit. The profit is consideration for an exempt supply, being the exempt supply of an exchange of currency. Hotel has exchanged New Zealand currency for foreign currency. The consideration for the supply is the difference between the exchange rate Hotel receives from the bank and the exchange rate Hotel gave Hotel Guest. For example: Approved exchange rate:NZ$1=Foreign$3 or Foreign$1=NZ$0.33 Hotel exchange rate:NZ$1=Foreign$4 or Foreign$1=NZ$0.25 Hotel Guest exchanges Foreign$300 at Hotel exchange rate and receives NZ$75. Hotel exchanges the Foreign$300 at the bank for the approved exchange rate and receives NZ$100. The NZ$25 profit is consideration for an exempt supply and does not have to be returned for GST purposes. Example 2 Hotel Guest checks out of Hotel and settles his bill using foreign currency. Again Hotel offers him a low exchange rate which he accepts. Hotel exchanges the money at a bank and makes a small profit. The profit on the currency exchange at the bank is part of the consideration for the taxable supply of goods and services by Hotel to Hotel Guest. The value of supply is the amount of foreign currency tendered in consideration for the supply. As the amount of money is foreign currency, it needs to be expressed in amounts of New Zealand currency. That change to New Zealand currency should take place at the approved exchange rate at the time of supply. That means the profit on the currency exchange is part of the consideration for the taxable supply Hotel makes. For example: Exchange rates as above. Bill of NZ$1,000. Hotel Guest tenders Foreign$4,000 to pay the bill. Hotel accepts the Foreign$4,000 in full payment of the bill, at Hotel’s exchange rate. Hotel then exchanges the Foreign$4,000 at the bank for the approved exchange rate and receives NZ$1,333, making a profit of $333 on the currency. This profit is part of the consideration for a taxable supply and should be returned as such for GST purposes. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 6 (June 2000) 8 NEW LEGISLATION FRINGE BENEFIT TAX – PRESCRIBED RATE OF INTEREST The rate of interest used to calculate fringe benefit tax for low-interest employment-related loans is being increased to 8.1% for the quarter beginning 1 July 2000. This replaces the existing rate of 7.59%. The rate is reviewed quarterly to ensure it is in line with market interest rates. It was last changed in April 2000. The new rates are consistent with first mortgage housing rates. The new rate was enacted by Order in Council on 29 May 2000. Income Tax (Fringe Benefit Tax, Interest on Loans) Amendment Regulations (No 2) 2000 (2000/86) ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND CONSERVATION ACT 2000 The Energy Efficiency and Conservation Act 2000 was enacted on 15 May 2000. The Act establishes an Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority whose functions are to encourage, promote and support energy efficiency, energy conservation and the use of renewable sources of energy. On the basis of criteria set out in CIR v Medical Council of NZ \[1997\] 18 NZTC 13,088, the Authority is a public authority. However, for the purposes of clarifying the law, section 29 of the new Act deems the Authority to be a public authority for the purposes of the Inland Revenue Acts. This ensures that any income derived by the Authority will be exempt income in terms of section CB 3(a) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 6 (June 2000) 9 CHILD SUPPORT (RECIPROCAL AGREEMENT WITH AUSTRALIA) ORDER 2000 The Order in Council giving effect to the Child Support (Reciprocal Agreement with Australia) Order 2000 was signed by the Governor-General on 29 May 2000. The Order applies to administrative (formula) based child support, voluntary arrangements and court awarded child and spousal maintenance. The agreement will apply when a custodian and child(ren) live in one country and the liable parent in the other. The country in which the custodian and child(ren) live will be the one to establish child support and spousal maintenance liabilities. The agreement will allow Australia and New Zealand to: •enforce payment of child support and spousal maintenance owing to the other country; and •supply each other with details of liable parents’ income and their addresses. When enforcing payment, each country will use its own debt collection powers. In most cases this will consist of applying the normal process of requiring employers to make deductions from a liable parent’s salary or wages. Existing arrangements that are satisfactory to both the custodian and the liable parent will be allowed to remain outside the agreement. The Order comes into effect from 1 July 2000. Contact details Each country will manage agreement cases through a Central Authority.

Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 6 (June 2000) 14 QUESTIONS WE’VE BEEN ASKED This section of the TIB sets out the answers to some day-to-day questions that people have asked. We have published these as they may be of general interest to readers. These items are based on letters we’ve received. A general similarity to items in this package will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case will depend on its own facts. DISPUTES PROCEDURES: THE COMMENCEMENT AND EXPIRY DATES OF A “RESPONSE PERIOD” Section 3(1) Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA): Definition of “response period” We have been asked to clarify when is the last day for responding to a Notice of Proposed Adjustment (NOPA) issued by the Commissioner pursuant to the Disputes Resolution Process. This interpretation applies to all notices issued on and after 1 September 2000. “Response period” is defined in section 3(1) as meaning the two month period starting on the date of issue of: •a notice of proposed adjustment •a notice of disputable decision •a notice revoking or varying a disputable decision that is not an assessment •a disclosure notice •a notice from the Commissioner rejecting an adjustment proposed by a disputant •a notice from the disputant rejecting an adjustment proposed by the Commissioner •the date of issue of a disputant’s statement of position •the day immediately following the last day for the filing of a GST return for that period. For the purposes of this item, all of the above will be referred to as “notices”. Although the question raised in this item is specifically in relation to the issue of a NOPA, the interpretations following will apply to any of the notices that come within the definition of “response period”. Date of issue The Commissioner considers that the date of issue is the date that the notice is sent or posted. It is the date that the notice physically leaves Inland Revenue or the taxpayer for delivery to the post office or external mailbox. Generally, this will be determined by the date on the notice which, it is assumed, will be that same date that the notice is actually sent. However, this is a rebuttable presumption. If a taxpayer sends a notice by facsimile (fax), the date of issue will be the date the notice is transmitted (sent) by fax. Month Neither “two month” period nor “month” are defined in the TAA or the Income Tax Act 1994 (ITA). The word month is, however, defined in section 35(1) of the Interpretation Act 1999 as meaning a calendar month, and this meaning applies unless an enactment provides otherwise. The definition of “response period” explicitly states that the response period starts on the date of issue. This means that the date of issue is included in the response period. The last day of the two month response period is not the corresponding day (numerically) as the day the response period commenced. A last day that corresponds numerically to the date of issue (the commencement date) creates a time-span of two months and one day. The last day of the response period will be the day immediately preceding the day (numerically) corresponding with the date the response period commenced (Migotti v Colvill (1879) 4 CPD 233, 37 Halsbury’s Laws of England (3 rd Ed) 82, 83.) Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 6 (June 2000) 15 As a practical example, where a NOPA is issued on 5 October 1999, the last day for responding to that notice is 4 December 1999. Generally, the last day for responding to a NOPA will numerically be one number less than the date of issue. The exception to this is the month of February with 28 days and 29 in each leap year. Although unlikely, if a NOPA was issued on any of the days from 29 to 31 December inclusive, in each case the last day for responding to that NOPA would be 28 February, or 29 February if it is a leap year (the nearest day preceding the day numerically corresponding to the commencing day). Holidays and non-working days On occasions, the last day for responding to a notice falls on a holiday or non-working day. “Working day” is defined in the Interpretation Act 1999 as a day of the week, other than: (a)A Saturday, a Sunday, Waitangi Day, Good Friday, Easter Monday, Anzac Day, the Sovereign’s Birthday, and Labour Day; and (b)A day in the period commencing with 25 December in a year and ending with 2 January in the following year; and (c)If 1 January falls on a Friday, the following Monday; and (d)If 1 January falls on a Saturday or a Sunday, the following Monday and Tuesday: The Interpretation Act 1999 states that, where the last day in a period of time is not a working day, the last day in that period will be the next working day. For example, a NOPA is issued on 2 November 1999. The last day for responding would be 1 January 2000. As 1 and 2 January 2000 fall on a Saturday and Sunday, the holidays are observed on the following Monday and Tuesday, which are both non-working days. Therefore, the last day for responding to the NOPA is the next working day, that is 5 January 2000. This item replaces statements to the contrary published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 8, No 3 (August 1996). Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 6 (June 2000) 16 LEGAL DECISIONS – CASE NOTES This section of the TIB sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council. We’ve given full references to each case, including the citation details where it has already been reported. Details of the relevant Act and section will help you to quickly identify the legislation at issue. Short case summaries and keywords deliver the bare essentials for busy readers. The notes also outline the principal facts and grounds for the decision. Where possible, we have indicated if an appeal will be forthcoming. These case reviews do not set out Inland Revenue policy, nor do they represent our attitude to the decision. These are purely brief factual reviews of decisions for the general interest of our readers. WHETHER OBJECTORS UNINCORPORATED BODIES FOR THE PURPOSES OF GST Case:James Holdsworth & Others v CIR Colin Francis Hair & Others v CIR William Newman & Others v CIR Decision date:2 June 2000 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Keywords:Definition of unincorporated body, taxable activity, value of supply Summary Justice Smellie found for the Commissioner on all three cases. Facts William Newman & Ors v CIR Farm land was owned by a “daughter’s trust”, a “son’s trust”, and William Newman as tenants in common as to a 1/3 share each. The 1/3 share owned by the daughter’s trust was leased to William Newman. The land was farmed by a partnership between William Newman and the son’s trust. The partnership was registered for GST. The profits of the partnership were split evenly between William Newman and the son’s trust. In July 1991 all three owners sold the land to a company, Newman & Newman Limited. Pursuant to section 51(4) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (“the Act”) the Commissioner deemed the landowning objectors to be registered for GST. The objectors were assessed for output tax on 2/3 of the purchase price of the land as they owned a 2/3 share. James Holdsworth & Ors v CIR The farm land was owned as to ½ by James Holdsworth, 1/6 by Peter Holdsworth, 1/6 by Margaret Holdsworth and 1/6 by Rachel Chadwick. The land was farmed by a partnership comprising them all and was registered for GST. In August 1991 the owners sold the land to Peter Holdsworth as trustee for a company to be formed. Pursuant to section 51(4) the Commissioner deemed the objectors to be registered for GST as an unincorporated body and assessed them for output tax on the purchase price of the land. Colin Francis Hair & Ors v CIR The farm land was owned as to 3/20 by Colin Hair, 5/20 by Lorna Hair and 12/20 by Colin Hair and Robert Briant as trustees of four different trusts. The land was farmed by the objectors in partnership with Taumutu Farm Limited and was known as the Taumutu Farm New Partnership. The partnership was registered for GST. In April 1994 the land was sold to a third party. Pursuant to section 51(4) the Commissioner deemed the objectors to be registered for GST as an unincorporated body and assessed them for output tax on the purchase price of the land. Decision Justice Smellie stated that the Act casts a very wide net and that it is entirely within the purpose of the Act that “associated persons” who act together to supply goods valued above the threshold of $30,000 per annum should be taxed as a group. The taxing mechanism is that provided in the Act as the “unincorporated body”. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 6 (June 2000) 17 He held that in each case, when looking at the contractual arrangements made by the objectors, there must have been agreement between the tenants in common to commit their respective interests in the land to the respective partnerships for the term of those partnerships and, as a necessary corollary, to restrict their individual rights of occupation and disposal. He went on to hold that the objectors were joint ventures and therefore unincorporated bodies pursuant to section 57 of the Act. On the issue of “taxable activity” Justice Smellie held that the Court of Appeal decision in CIR v Bayly (1998) 18 NZTC 14,073 applies directly and that a taxable activity was being carried on. Justice Smellie held that the value of supply in all cases was over the threshold. Decision Majority reasons: Richardson P considered that the relevant section 204 of the ITA 1976 created a code and that there were two principle income flows to CML under that section. “(T)he interest is an adjustment in relation to the premium payable contractually charged because of the delay in payment and made on a daily basis”. He considered it took on the same character as the premium and noted that both interest and premium were calculations of time value of money. Henry J also considered section 204 to be a code and thought that interest on premiums did not come within the concept of an “investment” by CML. Nor was it “gross revenue” as the Act did not contemplate a method by which expenditure to gain the revenue could be deducted and therefore was premium income. He rejected an argument by the Commissioner that the interest was not calculated by reference to risk assessment (mortality) and therefore not premium, saying the extra charge was part of meeting the “overall risk obligations” and “in substance it is part of the premium”. Blanchard J also considered section 204 to be a code with two business activities within its ambit: insurance and investment. While accepting there may be sources of “gross revenue” for CML outside these two activities, His Honour did not consider that there was an investment (although he did accept there was a WHETHER LATE PAYMENT CHARGE ON INSURANCE PREMIUMS WAS INTEREST AND TAXABLE, OR ADDITIONAL PREMIUMS AND TAX EXEMPT (Note: This decision relates to pre-1990 tax years as the section in question was amended for later years) Case:Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society Ltd v CIR Decision date:18 May 2000 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 Keywords:Income tax, insurance, interest on overdue premium Summary In a split decision, the Court of Appeal considered that the additional charge was not taxable. Facts This was an appeal from Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society Ltd v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,375. When policyholders in Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society Ltd (“CML”) did not pay their premiums on time, CML charged an additional sum. This amount was described by CML in its policy documents as “interest”. The Commissioner took the view that the additional charge was interest and taxable. CML took the view it was additional premium and tax exempt. The High Court took the Commissioner’s view and upheld the assessment. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 6 (June 2000) 18 debt) by CML. He said, “payments to purchase or keep up a life policy are tax exempt payments which are intended to be invested by the insurer”. The interest is paid as part of maintaining the policy and thus is akin to a premium. Minority decisions: Gault J considered the interest was taxable and relied, in part, on a previous decision of the Court of Appeal (Cmr of Taxes v AMP (1902) 22 NZLR 445). He also considered that interest could create a debt. His Honour found influential the contract between CML and the policy holder that treated the sum paid as interest, and accepted that interest recognises the time value of money unpaid without making that interest the same character as the principle sum (in this case the overdue premium) on which the interest is paid. Finally, he accepted that such interest was within the definition of “gross revenue” for section 204 and highlighted that there was provision to allow deductions for expenses incurred in creating such “gross revenue”. Thomas J agreed with Gault J that the AMP case was directly on point and should not be overturned. After discussing that case he went on to accept the interest was payable on a debt (the unpaid premium). His Honour considered the interest to represent income to CML and then went on to consider what its nature was. Rejecting taxation by economic equivalence, Thomas J considered the words of the section and accepted the presence of an inclusive definition of “gross revenue” which could include income from other than premiums and investments. However, he was concerned that there was no provision for deductibility of direct expenses in earning that third source of income (although he conceded it would be deductible as indirect expenses). He went on to consider Parliament’s intent as reflected in the section, giving eight reasons to conclude that the interest was investment income and therefore taxable. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 6 (June 2000) 19 GST ON FEES FOR ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES; COMMISSIONER NOT ENTITLED ON APPEAL TO CHANGE BASIS ON WHICH ASSESSMENTS WERE MADE; APPELLATE COURT JURISDICTION CONFINED TO CASE STATED Case:F B Duvall Limited v CIR Decision date:17 May 2000 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Keywords:GST, output tax, scope of appeal, change of grounds on appeal, jurisdiction of appellate court. Facts The objector was a loss company controlled by J G Russell and was part of his tax avoidance scheme. This case related to seven six month GST periods (the first ending 31 August 1987, the last 31 August 1990, both dates inclusive). During the relevant periods the objector received administration fees from various subsidiary companies. The Commissioner calculated GST payable on those fees. Notices of assessment expressed themselves as being in respect of total supplies made by the objector for the particular periods. In a judgment reported at (1993) 15 NZTC 5,159 the TRA found for the Commissioner. There were no discussions of the supplies received by the objector and of its input tax credits. The objector appealed to the High Court and the case was heard four years after the TRA decision. However, by then the Commissioner had concluded that the appeal had to be allowed. Baragwanath J noted that the appeal was to be allowed by consent and considered that the main issue for him to determine was upon what ground. The Commissioner contended that no services were supplied by the objector and so no GST arose. The reason for this was to provide a stepping stone to a contention that the objector was not entitled to input tax credits. The objector submitted that it was not open for the Commissioner to raise this argument and further that the services it supplied were financial and therefore exempt from GST. Baragwanath J concluded that the Commissioner’s contention was open to consideration and that there was no reason why the parties should not reverse their position on appeal. His Honour further held that no services were supplied by the objector in return for the administration charge. Following the High Court judgment the Commissioner made zero assessments, which, while allowing for the wrongly allowed output tax, also rejected input tax credits. This was challenged by the objector but was upheld by two further judgments of Baragwanath J: ((1999) 19 NZTC 15,039 and (1999) 19 NZTC 15,515). Decision Richardson P, delivering the Court of Appeal’s judgment, concluded that the Commissioner was not entitled to change the stance he had taken in making the assessments and had pursued before the TRA, namely, that the administration charges were in respect of taxable supplies assessable for output tax. His Honour further held that the High Court lacked jurisdiction to hear and determine the Commissioner’s new argument that the objector had not supplied any services and then in subsequent judgments to determine that the objector was not entitled to input tax credits. Richardson P firstly considered that it was difficult to see any justification for the High Court to go beyond the consent and beyond formally allowing the appeal. Secondly, it was not open for the Commissioner to assert the contrary of the basis on which the assessments had been made and objected to. All of the notices of assessment asserted that that objector had supplied services. The TRA had upheld the view that the administration charges were taxable supplies. On appeal the Commissioner was confined to the stance he had taken and which had been upheld by the TRA and the attempt to assert the opposite, that no supply of services had been made, was outside the Commissioner’s actual assessments of output tax. Further, the High Court was hearing an appeal on questions of law or fact in terms of the case stated by the TRA. The case stated confined the High Court, and the Commissioner was not entitled to change his stance. The High Court exceeded its jurisdiction in allowing the Commissioner to do so and in hearing and determining the appeal as it did. Finally, input tax credits were not at issue in the assessments or in the hearing before the TRA. The whole focus was on output tax. The appeal was therefore allowed and the orders made by the High Court, beyond the original allowing of the appeal by consent, were quashed. However, the Court of Appeal indicated that the Commissioner may be able to make further assessments in respect of the input tax credits, notwithstanding the prima facie time bar. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 6 (June 2000) 20 WHETHER TAXPAYER’S PAYMENT OF ACCRUED STAFF LIABILITIES WAS A CAPITAL OR REVENUE EXPENSE During the succeeding year NZFRI paid $836,978 on account of leave that was due to employees it engaged from 1 July 1992, in terms of their employment contracts. The Commissioner disallowed the deduction of that amount on the basis that it was an item of capital and not deductible to NZFRI. In the High Court Justice Salmon found in favour of the Commissioner. The taxpayer appealed to the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal found in favour of the taxpayer and reversed the finding of the High Court. The Court found that, firstly, the payments were made as remuneration paid by the taxpayer to its employees in respect of leave taken during the first income year of the company ending 30 June 1993. Secondly, remuneration for leave has all the attributes of revenue character payments. Thirdly, the payments in question were not made in the discharge of a liability to pay a quantified sum as at the commencement of the year 1 July 1992. The employees’ rights and the taxpayer’s obligations to them were as provided for in the collective employment contract and section 41 of the CRI Act. Fourthly, in terms of section 41, the employment contract of every transferring employee is “deemed to have been unbroken” and the employee’s period of service with the Crown is “deemed to have been a period of service with the Crown Research Institute”. Therefore, any payment in respect of leave paid by the taxpayer is not in respect of service to another employer, that is the Crown. Fifthly, the $836,978 payment was not paid by the taxpayer in discharge of the Crown’s accrued liability to the employees. The payment was made pursuant to the contract of employment as affected by section 41 and not pursuant to the transfer agreement. In this regard, the case is clearly distinguishable from Royal Insurance Company, Tata Hydro-Electric Agencies Limited (Bombay), Bombay Presidency and Eden and Nicholls and Others. Sixthly, by statute the pre-1 July 1992 service of the transferring employees is deemed to have been unbroken service with the company. The contract of employment must be accorded that status and given that effect for all purposes including tax purposes. Case:CIR v New Zealand Forest Research Institute Ltd Decision date:12 June 2000 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 Keywords:Capital expenditure or revenue expenditure Summary The Commissioner was successful in his appeal from the Court of Appeal. Facts With effect from 1 July 1992 New Zealand Forest Research Institute (“NZFRI”) acquired from the Crown certain assets and the Crown’s business related to forest research. Under the transfer agreement NZFRI was obliged to pay a price for those assets that was determined having regard to the relative values of assets and liabilities associated with the Crown’s forest research establishment. Under the transfer agreement NZFRI assumed certain liabilities from the Crown with effect from the transfer date. Those included liabilities that related to the business or activity carried on by the Ministry of Forestry before the transfer date or to the transfer or employment of any employee of the Ministry on the terms on which any employee was previously employed. The Crown was obliged to adjust the purchase price for the assets transferred to NZFRI by an amount determined having regard to “accrued staff liabilities” —essentially for different types of leave pay that employees of the Crown had become entitled to before the business and asset transfer to NZFRI. A sum of $1.97 million was determined to be the value of accrued staff liabilities and the price to be paid by NZFRI for the Crown’s business and assets was calculated having regard to that sum. Under the Crown Research Institutes Act 1992 (“CRI Act”) certain provisions were enacted to the effect that employees of the Crown would become employees of CRIs. In accordance with the CRI Act and its employment contracts, NZFRI recognised transferring employees as being entitled to certain paid leave with effect from 1 July 1992. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 6 (June 2000) 21 On this point, the Court stated that given the purpose, scheme and scope of the income tax legislation and the significance to the revenue and to the economy, and the tax treatment of employment as a source of income, deductions in arriving at business profits, collection responsibilities (for example PAYE) and special arrangements (for example fringe benefit tax), there is much force in the argument that the Income Tax Act is “an enactment ... relating to the employment of each such employee”. Finally, the Court found that the expenditure was incurred and paid in carrying on a business for the purposes of gaining and producing assessable income for the taxpayer. It was paid pursuant to the employment contract because the employees are deemed to have worked for the taxpayer for the pre-1 July 1992 periods involved. Decision The Privy Council found in the Commissioner’s favour reversing the Court of Appeal’s decision. Simply, the Board held that the payments were capital expenditure being part of what was paid for the acquisition of the assets for the business. The Board stated that there can be no doubt that the discharge of the vendor’s liability to a third party, whether vested or contingent, can be part of the purchase price. It does not matter that the payment is not made at once but pursuant to an arrangement whereby the purchaser agrees to be substituted as debtor to the third party. It also does not matter that the payments would be income in the hands of the third party recipient. The case of Royal Insurance v Watson was directly on point with the Commissioner’s case being stronger in this instance because the payments in issue were clearly attributable to services rendered to the Crown and, but for the sale of the business, would have been obligations of the Crown. The Board did point out that there could be a case where there is no obligation on the part of a purchaser of a business to make such payments and payments are made by the purchaser. In such a case the payments would be additional remuneration for services performed for the new employer and will be a revenue expense. In this case, however, the finding of fact by the High Court Judge was that NZFRI was obliged to make the payments both as a result of statute and as a result of the bargain contained in the transfer agreement. In regards to the application of section 41 of the CRI Act, the Board found that the Court of Appeal’s construction gave section 41 too wide a meaning. The Board favoured a narrower construction of section 41 in that the rights (particularly as affected by their length of continuous service) of the employees as against NZFRI are to be determined as if they had always been employed by NZFRI. This does not mean that this assumption is to be applied to the Crown/NZFRI relationship. Nor can the assumption be applied to the effect of the transfer agreement upon NZFRI’s liability for tax. Finally the Board stated that there can be no doubt that if the Crown had been a taxable entity and had itself paid the accrued staff liabilities then they would have been deductible revenue expenses. The ascertainment of the income year in which the Crown would have been entitled to deduct the payments is irrelevant. The conclusion is that NZFRI’s acceptance of liability to pay the accrued staff liabilities was a capital expense.

Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 7 (July 2000) 3 THIS MONTH’S OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO COMMENT Inland Revenue produces a number of statements and rulings aimed at explaining how taxation law affects taxpayers and their agents. Because we are keen to produce items that accurately and fairly reflect taxation legislation, and are useful in practical situations, your input into the process—as perhaps a user of that legislation—is highly valued. The following draft item is available for review/comment this month, having a deadline of 31 August 2000. Please see page 27 for details on how to obtain copies: Ref.Draft typeDescription PU0085Public rulingLease surrender payments received by a landlord – income tax treatment. The subject matter of the item was previously covered by public rulings BR Pub 97/1 and 97/1A. The arrangement considered in the draft ruling is the receipt of a lease surrender payment by a landlord from a tenant when the landlord, who is in the business of leasing property, agrees to accept the early termination of the lease. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 7 (July 2000) 4 BINDING RULINGS This section of the TIB contains binding rulings that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has issued recently. The Commissioner can issue binding rulings in certain situations. Inland Revenue is bound to follow such a ruling if a taxpayer to whom the ruling applies calculates tax liability based on it. For full details of how binding rulings work, see our information booklet Adjudication & Rulings, a guide to Binding Rulings (IR 715) or the article on page 1 of Tax Information Bulletin Vol 6, No 12 (May 1995) or Vol 7, No 2 (August 1995).

This Ruling is signed by me on the 14th day of June 2000. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of section CD 1(2). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the sale or other disposition of land by a taxpayer who is associated with another person. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •For the purposes of determining whether any amount derived from the sale or other disposition of land is included in the gross income of any taxpayer by virtue of paragraphs (b) to (d) of section CD 1(2), the test of whether a taxpayer and another person are associated persons is applied only at the time of the acquisition of the land. The test of association is not applied at the time of the sale or other disposition of the land. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 7 (July 2000) 5 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR PUB 00/05 stems from the wording and tenses used. The Commissioner’s view is, and always has been, that the test of association is applied at the time the land was acquired. Legislation Section CD 1(1) states: Any amount derived from the sale or other disposition of any land, being an amount to which this section applies, is gross income. Section CD 1(2) sets out the amounts that are included in the gross income of any person under section CD 1(1): For the purposes of subsection (1), the gross income of any taxpayer includes the following amounts – ... (b)Any amount derived from the sale or other disposition of any land where the taxpayer, or any other person where the taxpayer and that other person are associated persons, carried on, at the time the land was acquired, the business of dealing in land, and – (i)That land, which was sold or disposed of by the taxpayer, was acquired by that taxpayer for the purpose of that business of dealing in land; or (ii)That land was sold or disposed of by the taxpayer within 10 years after the date on which it was acquired by the taxpayer: (c)Any amount derived from the sale or other disposition of any land where the taxpayer, or any other person where the taxpayer and that other person are associated persons, carried on, at the time the land was acquired, the business of developing or dividing land into lots, being development or division of the kind (not being work of a minor nature) referred to in paragraph (f), and – (i)That land, which was sold or disposed of by the taxpayer, was acquired by that taxpayer for the purpose of that business of developing or dividing land into lots; or (ii)That land was sold or disposed of by the taxpayer within 10 years after the date on which it was acquired by the taxpayer: (d)Any amount derived from the sale or other disposition of any land, where the taxpayer, or any other person where the taxpayer and that other person are associated persons, carried on, at the time the land was acquired, the business of erecting buildings, and the taxpayer or that other person carried out, whether before or after the acquisition of that land by the taxpayer, any improvements, not being improvements of a minor nature, to that land (whether by way of erecting a building or otherwise); and (i)That land, which was sold or disposed of by the taxpayer, was acquired for the purpose of that business of erecting buildings; or This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusion reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 00/05 (“the Ruling”). Background Paragraphs (b) to (d) of section CD 1(2) include within the gross income of a taxpayer any amounts derived from the sale or other disposition of land if the taxpayer, or any other person associated with the taxpayer, carried on certain businesses at the time the land was acquired. For the purposes of section CD 1, associated persons or persons associated with each other are defined in section OD 8(4). Section OD 8(4) was amended by the Income Tax Act 1994 Amendment Act (No 4) 1995 (“the amendments”). The definition was extended to ensure that discretionary beneficiaries fall within the trustee-beneficiary relationships included in the definition. During the course of the related Bill, a submission was made raising the issue of whether the changes to the definition of associated persons would have any effect in relation to land acquired before the changes were made. While the amendments came into force on 17 August 1995 (the date of the Bill’s introduction), the submission queried whether the changes would have any effect in the case of an amount derived from the sale of land acquired before that date. The amendments to the definition would only apply to land acquired before 17 August 1995 if the test of association in paragraphs (b) to (d) of section CD 1(2) applies at the time the land is disposed of. If the test of association under paragraphs (b) to (d) applies at the time the land is acquired, the amended definition of associated persons would only apply in relation to land acquired after 17 August 1995. The Ruling confirms that the test of association under paragraphs (b) to (d) of section CD 1(2) applies at the time the land is acquired. The changes to the definition of associated persons will therefore only apply to land acquired on or after 17 August 1995. This question is important in general terms (i.e. not just because of the changes made to the definition of associated persons) because in many cases a taxpayer may be associated with a person at the time of acquisition of land, but may not be associated with the person at the time of the sale or disposition of the land (and vice versa). A number of commentators have expressed their view as to the timing of the test of association in section CD 1(2)(b) to (d), but there seems to be uncertainty as to the correct view. This uncertainty Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 7 (July 2000) 6 (ii)That improved land was sold or disposed of by the taxpayer within 10 years after the date on which those improvements were completed. ... \[Emphasis added\] Section OD 8(4) defines “associated persons or persons who are associated” for the purposes of section CD 1. Application of Legislation Paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of section CD 1(2) all use the same phrase in bringing to tax, “Any amount derived from the sale or other disposition of any land where the taxpayer, or any other person where the taxpayer and that other person are associated persons, carried on, at the time the land was acquired, the business of ...”. The question is raised as to whether the use of the words “are associated persons” means that in order for the provisions to be satisfied the test of association is applied: •at the time of acquisition of the land by the taxpayer: this requires a person who carried on the business of dealing in land at the time the taxpayer acquired the land to have been associated with the taxpayer at the time the land was acquired (but that person would not necessarily be associated with the taxpayer at the time of disposition); or •at the time of disposition: this requires a person who carried on the business of dealing in land at the time the taxpayer acquired the land to be associated with the taxpayer at the time the land was disposed of (but that person would not necessarily have been associated with the taxpayer at the time of acquisition); or •at the time of acquisition and at the time of sale or other disposal: this requires a person who carried on the business of dealing in land at the time the taxpayer acquired the land to have been associated with the taxpayer both at the time the land was acquired and also at the time the land is disposed of. Plain words On an ordinary reading of the words of the legislation it seems clear that the phrase “at the time the land was acquired” relates to the carrying on of the relevant business, rather than to the timing of the associated persons test. However, it is not clear as to the point in time that the words “are associated persons” are referring to. The word “are” generally indicates a present tense and, therefore, arguably indicates that the test should be applied at the most recent point in time (i.e. the time of the disposal of the land). However, another reading of the words indicates that the test should be applied at the time of acquisition. The meaning of the words without the presence of an associated person is clear: •An amount will be gross income if: – a taxpayer derives that amount from the sale or other disposition of land, – the taxpayer was carrying on the relevant business when the land was acquired, and – the land was acquired for that business or sold within 10 years of acquisition. There are three elements to the section. First, an amount must be derived from the sale or disposition of land. Second, the taxpayer must have been carrying on the relevant business at the time the land was acquired. Third, the land must have been acquired for that business or sold within 10 years. Arguably, the second element is the most important. The fact that the taxpayer was carrying on the relevant business at the time the land was acquired is central to the issue of the taxability of any amount derived on the sale of the land. For example, if the taxpayer were not carrying on a business of dealing in land, any amount derived would not be taxable under section CD 1(2)(b). However, if the taxpayer were carrying on such a business, any amount derived would be taxable if the land was either acquired for the business or sold within 10 years. If the land was acquired for the purpose of a relevant business, it is logical that any amount derived from the sale of the land would be taxable. This is entirely consistent with the fact that any amount derived from a business is gross income under section CD 3. However, where the land was not acquired for the purpose of such a business, any amount derived would still be taxable if the land was sold within 10 years. In this situation, it is simply the fact that the taxpayer carried on the relevant business that leads to the inclusion of the amount derived within gross income. All acquisitions of land by the taxpayer are tainted by the existence of the business, regardless of whether the land is acquired as part of that business. Now consider the effect of the section where an associated person is involved: •An amount will be gross income of a taxpayer if: – the taxpayer derives that amount from the sale or other disposition of land, – an associated person of the taxpayer was carrying on the business of dealing in land when the taxpayer acquired the land, and – the land was sold by the taxpayer within 10 years of acquisition. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 7 (July 2000) 7 Again, there are three elements to the section. First, an amount must be derived from the sale or other disposition of the land. Second, an associated person of the taxpayer must have been carrying on the business of dealing in land when the taxpayer acquired the land. Third, the land must have been sold within 10 years of acquisition. In a situation where an associated person is involved, the central focus of the section is even more clearly the fact that a relevant business, such as dealing in land, must have been carried on at the time the land was acquired. As it is the associated person who was carrying on the required business at the time of acquisition, the taxpayer could not have acquired the land for the purposes of the business. In these circumstances the amount derived will only be taxable if the land is sold within 10 years. It is only the existence of the business at the time of acquisition that allows the section to include the amount derived on sale in the taxpayer’s gross income. The taxpayer is effectively tainted by the activities of the associated person at the time the land was acquired. The section, therefore, is concerned with what was happening at the time the land was acquired – was an associated person of the taxpayer carrying on a business of dealing in land? It would seem that in these circumstances it is logical to argue that the associated person must have been associated with the taxpayer when the land was acquired. To separate the associated persons test from the test of the relevant business is an artificial interpretation of the section. Although the section is including in gross income amounts derived on sale, the focus of the section is on the activities of either the taxpayer or the associated person at the time the land was acquired. The time of sale or other disposition of the land is certainly important in the context of section CD 1. The time of the sale of the land is the time at which the application of the section is triggered. However, once the application of the section is triggered by the sale of the land, the focus of the section is clearly on the activities which took place at an earlier time. The mere fact of the sale of the land is insufficient to include any amount derived from that sale in a taxpayer’s gross income. The scheme and purpose of the provisions is not simply to bring to tax amounts derived on the sale of property. There must be some other relevant purpose or intention, some other relevant action on the part of the taxpayer or associated person, or some link with business activities, before any amount will be included in gross income. However, as it is not completely clear on the plain reading of the words that the test is applied at acquisition, relevant case law should be considered. The question as to the relevant time for testing association does not appear to have been directly considered by any New Zealand court. However, there is implicit support for the view that the test of association is applied at the time the land was acquired in some TRA cases. For example, in Case H92 (1986) 8 NZTC 630, the TRA considered whether the objectors were assessable on the profit made on the sale of land, A, under any of sections 65(2)(a) and 67(4)(a), (b) and (e) of the Income Tax Act 1976. On concluding that the objectors were not dealers in land at the time the land was acquired, the issue was then whether an associated company, P, was dealing in land when the relevant land was purchased by the taxpayer. The TRA found that the company’s activities did not constitute the business of dealing in land at the time of purchase. Although the TRA did not specifically consider the time at which the parties needed to be associated, the judgment appeared to assume that this was at the time of acquisition. Bathgate DJ said (at page 642): The thrust of cross-examination of the objectors concerning P was to show that it was involved in erecting buildings when A was purchased by the objectors. At that time P and the objectors were associated persons for the purposes of sec 67(4)(b) and (c). \[Emphasis added\] More recently, Case T25 (1997) 18 NZTC 8,160 concerned whether a taxpayer was assessable on the proceeds of the sale of a commercial property. The question to be answered by the TRA was whether, on the date of acquisition by the objector of his interest in the commercial property, the objector carried on any business of developing or dividing land into lots or whether on that date any associated person of the objector (the CC Partnership or the R Syndicate) carried on such a business. Although the timing of the test of association is not specifically referred to by Barber DJ, his Honour makes it clear that he considers the time of acquisition to be the appropriate time and he proceeds on that basis. When discussing whether the objector was a developer or subdivider as at the date of acquisition of the property, his Honour stated (at pages 8,174–8,175): However, as at 17 October 1978 only two relevant projects had been undertaken. One subdivisional project (of residen- tial land) had been completed and the other was a building project so that, at that date, the objector could not be described as carrying on the business of developing or dividing into lots ‘any land’ and nor was any associated person of the objector at that time. I appreciate that the CC Partnership and the R Syndicate each commenced in 1974 and ended in late 1979; but on the crucial date, 17 October 1978, the nature of their activity did not offend s 67(4)(ba). \[Emphasis added\] Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 7 (July 2000) 8 Barber DJ’s statement that the CC Partnership and R Syndicate ended in 1979 impliedly gives strong support for the proposition that the time for the test of association is at acquisition. In this case the property in question was disposed of in 1988. In these circumstances, if the test of association were to be applied at the time of disposal the above comments by Barber DJ would have been irrelevant. Notwithstanding the above statements, it is clear that the issue of the timing of the test of association was not argued in Case H92 or Case T25. Case law, therefore, provides limited guidance on the interpretation of the words “are associated persons” in the context of land sales. However, case law does indicate that one should be careful in the interpretation of tenses. The use of a tense may be decisive only if it is clear what the tense used relates to. For example, in Maradana Mosque Board of Trustees v Mahmud \[1967\] 1 AC 13, the Privy Council considered a provision that empowered the Minister to make a certain order if satisfied that a school “is being administered” in contravention of the Act. Counsel for the Minister argued that it was permissible to take account of the past running of the school. The Privy Council held that only the current method of administration at the time of the order could be considered. By way of contrast, in Norman v Simpson \[1946\] 1 All ER 74 the United Kingdom Court of Appeal needed to interpret the words “have been” and concluded that the expression could be equated to “are” or “is” in the context before the Court. In that case the use of the words “have been” did not limit the Court to considering only the point in the past at which the sub-letting commenced. In relation to section CD 1(2), it can be argued that the use of the word “are” does not necessarily limit the inquiry to the present time and that it could be interpreted as operating in the past tense. The approach of the courts has been that if the use of a tense is not clear or is ambiguous, other sources such as the statutory context and the scheme and purpose of the legislation will be used as aids in determining the correct interpretation. This approach is also consistent with the Court of Appeal’s approach to statutory interpretation set out in CIR v Alcan New Zealand Ltd (1994) 16 NZTC 11,175. Section GD 9(1) The associated persons test is used in many provisions of the Revenue Acts. Generally, these provisions are unhelpful for present purposes as it is obvious in most cases that the associated persons test relates to only one point in time. However, section GD 9(1) is relevant here because it is closely related to the provisions currently being considered. Section GD 9(1) deals with the situation where a person transfers land to an associated person some time after acquisition. Section GD 9(1) is in the nature of an anti-avoidance provision, and applies where land is transferred from a “transferor” to a “transferee” and the transferor and the transferee “are associated persons”. If the transferee later sells or otherwise disposes of the land, any amount derived from the transaction is gross income of the transferee if that amount would have been gross income of the transferor under section CD 1(2). Section GD 9(1) states: Where – (a)Any land has been transferred from any person (the “transferor”) to any person (the “transferee”); and (b)The transferor and the transferee are associated persons; and (c)The transferee subsequently sells or otherwise disposes of that land and the consideration from that sale or disposition exceeds the cost of the land to the transferee; and (d)If, had the transferor not transferred the land to the transferee but instead had sold or otherwise disposed of the land for the consideration referred to in paragraph (c), that consideration would have been gross income of the transferor under section CD 1 – that consideration shall be deemed to be gross income of the transferee under section CD 1. Thus, section GD 9(1), like section CD 1(2), also uses the phrase “are associated persons” in a context where its meaning could be ambiguous. The section is concerned with the situation of a property being disposed of at a profit or gain, i.e. something that happens in the present and triggers the application of the section. However, the section also refers to the earlier transfer from the transferor to the transferee who “are associated persons”. In section GD 9(1), the words “are associated persons” clearly relate back to the earlier time of the transfer from the transferor to the transferee, rather than the present time of the disposal of the land. The words “are associated persons” are followed by “and the transferee subsequently sells or otherwise disposes of that land”. The use of the word “subsequently” denies the words “are associated persons” any connection to the event of disposal. The section, therefore, is an example of words in a present tense being used to relate to a past event. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 7 (July 2000) 9 Section GD 9(1) clearly supports the conclusion that “are associated persons” does not necessarily mean associated at the most recent point in time, i.e. the time of disposal, but can be interpreted as “were associated persons”. In the case of section GD 9(1), this means looking back to the time of acquisition by the relevant taxpayer, i.e. the transferee. Legislative purpose The use of the associated persons test in section CD 1(2) is essentially for anti-avoidance reasons and aims to stop the use of associated persons who are not carrying on any relevant business. This was referred to in the Parliamentary Debates in 1973 on the Land and Income Tax (Annual) Bill (which contained the predecessor provisions to section CD 1). Mr Munroe (MP, Invercargill) explained the difficulties in applying the then current law on the taxation of profits relating to land and the need for amendment, and stated (NZPD Vol 386, 1973: 3653): There is a provision in the \[Land and Income Tax\] Act which makes dealing in real or personal property for profit or gain assessable for tax. The Inland Revenue Department has had difficulty with this provision because of interpretations of it by the courts. The courts have tended to take the view before they will uphold an assessment, that as there is no capital gains tax in New Zealand there must be a clear pattern of previous dealings, or the circumstances must be such as to leave an inference that a profit motive was present at the time of purchase. In cases where the taxpayers have been land dealers or builders they have been able to avoid assess- ment of profits on property deals by claiming quite success- fully that the property was held as an investment even if the sale was made shortly after acquisition. In other cases the land dealers or builders have held properties in the names of members of their families or in associate companies for the purpose of avoiding tax on the sale of the properties. \[Emphasis added\] If the intention were to prevent dealers in land using associates (who are not dealers) to acquire the land, one would expect that the relevant association would need to be examined at the time of acquisition. The intention behind the provisions of section CD 1(2) would seem to be to make it more difficult for a person who is carrying on one of the specified businesses to hide behind associated persons. If the test of association applies only at the time of disposal, this would mean that associated person purchasers of land who are “substituted” for land dealers could avoid being taxed where the association was technically terminated immediately before the disposal of the land. Furthermore, if the association test applies only at the time of disposal, it would apply to persons who happen (by way of “accident” or otherwise) to become associated with, e.g. a land dealer just prior to their disposing of property where no taxable purpose or connection previously existed. In addition, the anti-avoidance policy would tend to suggest that the possible interpretation of applying the association test at both acquisition and disposal is also incorrect. As such an interpretation would also require the test to be applied at disposal, the concerns expressed above would be equally applicable to that interpretation. Conclusion In paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of section CD 1(2), on an ordinary reading of the words “are associated persons”, the time at which the test of association must be applied is ambiguous. However, the scheme and purpose of the provisions indicate that the correct interpretation is that the test of association is applied at the time the land is acquired by a taxpayer. The Commissioner considers this to be the better view of the law. The test is not applied at the time of sale or other disposition of the land, nor must it be applied at both the time of acquisition and at the time of sale or other disposition. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 7 (July 2000) 10 PRODUCT RULING - BR PRD 00/05 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by the Hawke’s Bay Regional Council (“HBRC”). Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of: sections CD 3, CD 5, CE 1(1)(b), CE 1(1)(e), CF 2(1) of the Income Tax Act 1994; and section 8(1) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the distribution of surplus funds, sourced by the HBRC from a special dividend received from the Port of Napier Limited (“PONL”), to ratepayers of the Hawke’s Bay region. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1.The Arrangement involves the payment of an amount to be applied for the benefit of ratepayers in the Hawke’s Bay region in the form of a one-off cash distribution (“the ratepayers’ distribution”). The source of the ratepayers’ distribution will be surplus cash of approximately $10 million arising from receipt by the HBRC of a fully imputed special dividend from PONL (of which HBRC owns 91.67%) which the HBRC intends to distribute to ratepayers and local authorities within the region. The amount of the ratepayers’ distribution will be the difference between the total surplus cash to be distributed (approximately $10 million) and the distributions (if any) to be made to various territorial local authorities (being the Napier City Council, the Hastings District Council and the Wairoa District Council). 2.The HBRC proposes to divide up the ratepayers’ distribution on the basis of rateable land value and distribute it to ratepayers in the Hawke’s Bay region (being ratepayers in the Central Hawke’s Bay District, Part Rangitikei and Part Taupo District, Wairoa District, Hastings District and Napier City). This will be effected by sending out individual cheques to the ratepayers. 3.Ratepayers are: •persons whose names appear in the “occupiers” column of the rate records of the HBRC; or •where a territorial local authority has agreed to collect rates for the HBRC under section 127 of the Rating Powers Act 1988, persons whose names appear in the “occupiers” column of the rate records of the territorial local authority. 4.The ratepayer’s distribution payment will be paid entirely independently of the rating process and will not be recorded on general rates notices sent to ratepayers. 5.The HBRC chose to distribute the surplus funds according to rateable property values because: (i)it is administratively easier and more efficient to do so; (ii)it is considered to be more equitable than distributing the funds on a per capita basis. 6.Where ratepayers are in arrears with their rates, the distribution payment will be used to satisfy their arrears and the balance (if any) will be paid out to the ratepayer. 7.Ratepayers are not obliged to do anything in return for the payment. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a)That the ratepayers’ distribution is sourced entirely from the fully imputed special dividend received from PONL in 1997. b)That this is a one-off payment in terms of distributing funds received from PONL. c)At the time of making the ratepayers’ distribution, HBRC is not contemplating or anticipating making any further distributions of a similar nature to ratepayers. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 7 (July 2000) 11 How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to the conditions stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •The ratepayers’ distribution will not be gross income in the hands of ratepayers under sections CD 3, CD 5, CE 1(1)(b), CE 1(1)(e) and CF 2(1). •There will be no liability on ratepayers under section 8(1) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 to pay GST on the ratepayers’ distribution payment. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 17 May 2000 to 31 December 2002. This Ruling is signed by me on the 17th day of May 2000. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 7 (July 2000) 12 NEW LEGISLATION 1999–2000 DEEMED RATE OF RETURN ANNOUNCED FOR FOREIGN INVESTMENT FUND RULES The deemed rate of return used for the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules of the Income Tax Act 1994 has been set at 10.74% for the 1999–2000 income year. The rate will apply to all types of investments, including interests in superannuation schemes and life insurance policies. The FIF rules tax the income earned by foreign entities on behalf of New Zealand residents and apply to investments that are not subject to the controlled foreign company rules. The deemed rate of return method is one of four methods for calculating FIF income or loss. The rate for future income years will continue to be set annually. The regulations setting the rate, the Income Tax (Deemed Rate of Return, 1999–2000 Income Year) Regulations 2000, were made by Order in Council on 19 June 2000. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 7 (July 2000) 13 QUESTIONS WE’VE BEEN ASKED This section of the TIB sets out the answers to some day-to-day questions that people have asked. We have published these as they may be of general interest to readers. These items are based on letters we’ve received. A general similarity to items in this package will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case will depend on its own facts. COMMISSIONS PAID TO INDEPENDENT FINANCIAL ADVISORS Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979, Section NC 7 Income Tax Act 1994 We have been asked if commissions paid to independent financial advisors in relation to the sale of products provided by a funds management company are subject to withholding payments deductions. Background Independent financial advisors provide their clients with financial planning advice and other services. As part of this, and because the financial advisor operates on an independent basis, clients are provided with opportunities to purchase financial products from a number of financial organisations, for example, funds management companies. If a client purchases such a financial product, the independent financial advisor receives a commission (for example, upfront and trail commissions) from the provider of that financial product. The advisor is commonly referred to as a commissioned agent or a commissioned salesman. Liability to deduct withholding tax from withholding payments Regulations Regulation 4 of the Withholding Payments Regulations 1979 states that payments of the classes specified in the Schedule to those Regulations are withholding payments for the purposes of the PAYE rules. One such class is: 1. Commissions or other remuneration to insurance agents or sub-agents, or to salesmen. The Schedule to the Regulations states that, in relation to this class of payment, withholding tax must be deducted at a rate of 20 cents per dollar. Under regulation 4(2), withholding tax does not have to be deducted if the individual financial advisor derives the commission or other remuneration through a company (not being a non-resident entertainer or non-resident contractor), or holds a certificate of exemption. In summary, liability to deduct withholding payments is determined by whether payments made to financial advisors are “commissions or remuneration” and whether these payments are made to “insurance agents or sub-agents, or to salesmen”. Commissions or remuneration The independent financial advisor provides services that facilitate the sale of a funds management company’s products. In return, the independent financial advisor receives a monetary payment calculated as a percentage of the resultant sales. These payments (commission, or other forms of remuneration such as brokerage) received by independent financial advisors satisfy the first requirement of being “commissions or other remuneration” (Drielsma v Manifold, \[1894\] 3 Ch.100,C.A.). Insurance agents or sub-agents, or salesmen An independent financial advisor facilitating product sales for a funds management company, is not acting as an insurance agent or sub-agent. It is the Commissioner’s view that an independent financial advisor who provides services of this nature is acting in the capacity of a salesman (Wendell and Associates Limited v CIR (1986) 8 NZTC 5,155; and Challenge Realty Ltd v CIR (1990) 12 NZTC 7,022). Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 7 (July 2000) 14 Withholding declaration – Section NC 7 of Income Tax Act 1994 Section NC 7 states that the person who is to receive the withholding payment must deliver a withholding declaration to the person who is to make the withholding payment. This declaration must be authorised by the Commissioner and contain such particulars as the Commissioner requires (refer specifically to Tax code declaration (IR 330) form). Exemption certificate Under regulation 4(2)(c) of the Withholding Payments Regulations, payments will not be withholding payments if they are exempted by an exemption certificate under regulation 5. A self-employed taxpayer, whose earnings are subject to withholding payments, may apply for a certificate of exemption under regulation 5(1). When considering an application for a certificate of exemption, the Commissioner will take into account the taxpayer’s compliance history. (Application for an exemption certificate can be made on the Request for a certificate of exemption from withholding tax (IR 332) form. To obtain this form, please telephone 0800 377 774.) Timing of withholding tax payments to Inland Revenue Under regulation 4, the withholding payments are payments for the purposes of the PAYE rules, and a funds management company is required to account for the withholding payments on the same basis as PAYE. GST If the independent financial advisor has issued a tax invoice to a funds management company under section 24 of the Goods and Services Act 1985, withholding tax is to be calculated on the GST exclusive amount. Where no tax invoice has been issued, the calculation will be on the gross amount of any payment.

WHETHER WORK CARRIED OUT ON TAXPAYER’S GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM WAS REPLACEMENT (CAPITAL EXPENDITURE), OR REPAIR (REVENUE EXPENDITURE) Case:Auckland Gas Limited v CIR Decision date:14 June 2000 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 Keywords:Capital expenditure or revenue expenditure. Repairs, alterations Summary The Privy Council found the work carried out was correctly characterised by the Commissioner as capital expenditure. Facts The appeal concerned the deductibility of expenditure incurred by the taxpayer on its low-pressure gas distribution system for the years ended 30 June 1988 to 1992. The taxpayer claimed it was entitled to deduct this expenditure in the year incurred when calculating its assessable income. The Commissioner disallowed the claim, contending the expenditure was capital in nature and should be depreciated over time. The taxpayer’s underground distribution system was principally made of cast iron mains and smaller steel pipes known as services, which ran from the mains to individual premises. Cast iron mains have a life of a century or more, but are by no means trouble free. Two major problems were leakage of gas and the entry of water. This occurred at joints and fractures in the mains and at corroded parts of the services. The result was interruptions to the supply. As cast iron mains were manufactured in short lengths, there were many thousands of joints in the network. In addition, fractured mains were a weekly occurrence for the taxpayer. This occurred from subsidence of surrounding ground and by vibration caused by overhead traffic, nowadays of a weight and frequency not contemplated when the mains were laid. For these reasons the percentage of gas entering the system and becoming lost (known as unaccounted for gas, or UFG), became a major problem. It peaked in 1971, when no less than 38.5% of the gas entering the system was lost. The UFG problem became worse in the 1970s when natural gas was introduced. The lengths of cast iron pipe were joined by bell and spigot joints, filled with hemp and kept in place by molten lead. Until 1970 the gas supplied was coal gas, a wet gas which had the effect of swelling the hemp joints and making them gas tight. Natural gas is dry, and has the effect of drying the joints and creating more leaks. In the 1980s the practice of laying new mains in cast iron was abandoned in favour of coated steel. That product was then replaced with polyethylene pipes. Polyethylene pipes are tough, but flexible, and are resistant to abrasion, pressure, stress and corrosion. They are supplied in long lengths of 150 metres and can be easily joined by heat, and the resulting joints are as strong as the pipe itself. They are also largely unaffected by vibration caused by traffic and subsidence. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 7 (July 2000) 16 The taxpayer made many attempts to develop a technique to solve the problems affecting the old cast iron pipes. It finally adopted the technique of inserting polyethylene pipe into the existing cast iron mains and services. The old mains and services were broken open to enable the insertion process to be carried out. This procedure solved the problem of leakage in the old pipes. The technique also solved the UFG problem more cheaply than the “find and fix “ method, which required digging up the problem pipe. Decision The decision deals with the question of “repair” versus “replacement”, and observes that in this context these words are not technical expressions with a special meaning, but bear an ordinary everyday meaning. In order to decide whether work constitutes repair or replacement, the first step is to identify the object to which the test of repair or replacement is being applied. The decision observes that authority on the question of repair or replacement is of limited assistance, as the physical objects to which the test of repair has to be applied vary widely and so does the nature of the work done. Judicial dicta applicable to one set of circumstances may be unhelpful or misleading when applied in different circumstances. The Board noted that the effect of the work on the character of the object is also an important consideration. In the last resort, as with the general question of distinguishing income expenditure from capital expenditure, the solution is not to be found by any rigid test or description. The answer depends upon a consideration of all the circumstances. The Board made it clear that although it is tempting to say the answer is a question of fact and impression, that would be a mistaken approach. It noted that in drawing a distinction between repair and replacement, the dominant features leading to a reasoned conclusion must be capable of being identified. The courts below treated the entirety of the system as the relevant asset, and the Board was content to proceed on that footing. It said that one must be clear about what is meant by the taxpayer’s distribution system. It defined the asset as “an assemblage of linked pipes whose function was to carry gas from one place to another” and observed that if a significant portion of this series of linked pipes is effectively abandoned and replaced wholesale with new pipes, the work may readily go beyond repair. On the facts, polyethylene pipes were inserted over the five years at issue in 380 km of the cast iron mains, which represented about 23% of the total mains network. In addition, polyethylene pipes were inserted in 150 km or 32% of the steel services. Thus the work covered a substantial part of the entire mains network. The Board noted the new pipes differed from the old in several respects; they were virtually leak free and they were much better suited to the passage of dry and clean natural gas and they carried gas at a higher (medium) pressure. Although the latter difference was not a goal in itself, it was an improvement over the old system. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 7 (July 2000) 17 WHETHER SALE OF DISPUTANT’S LAND INVOLVED THE SALE OF A GOING CONCERN Case:TRA Number 040/99. Decision Number 15/2000 Decision date:21 June 2000 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Keywords:Going concern Summary The disputant was successful and the Commissioner is to amend the assessment by deleting the debit sum of $105,555.55 Facts On 1 July 1996 one of the corporate components of the disputant sold some land which it owned at Wiri to a plant nursery company. The purchase price was $950,000. Possession was to be given on 20 September 1996. The transaction was evidenced by a written agreement for sale and purchase using an Auckland District Law Society form. The property was sold subject to a licence to a third party evidenced by an agreement dated 30 April 1991, permitting it to operate a quarry on the land and a lease to another company in the disputant group. Both vendor and purchaser were registered for GST. The agreement provided that the purchase price was “inclusive of GST (if any)”. The words “plus GST (if any)” were deleted and the agreement provided that only if both possibilities were deleted then “the purchase price includes GST (if any)”. This is a going concern case. The defendant has paid out to a taxpayer a GST credit of $108,242.38 and, of that sum, seeks to recover $105,555.55 from the disputant. Decision The disputant contended that the reservation of the licensee’s quarrying rights referred to in clause 16.1 of the agreement did form the basis of a concern which was “going” as at the date of settlement of the transaction. The Commissioner contended that this was not factually so. He submitted that because the purchaser and the licencee renegotiated the terms of the quarrying licence effective from the date of settlement, there was no “going concern” at the date of hand-over of the property. The TRA considered that this argument was unsustainable and that all the disputant needed to prove was at that time of settlement there was some “concern”, in this case quarrying, which was ongoing and was to pass to the purchaser. What the purchaser subsequently did with that activity was irrelevant and in any event the evidence established that the licencee continued to extract gravel and shingle from the property. The TRA considered that there was a written agreement for the sale of a going concern and accepted the evidence of the then commercial manager of the vendor group and its solicitor and the contemporary record of the solicitor’s legal executive. The TRA went on to consider counsel’s argument on the lease/licence point. The Commissioner contended that there was never a written agreement that the transaction was for the sale of a going concern and therefore zero-rated, because the quarrying business supported by the licence rights and obligations did not pass on the sale of property. This was based on a proposition that the “licence agreement” of 30 April 1991 is not capable of coming within the words “details of tenancies” where they appear on page 1 of the agreement for sale and purchase. This is because a licence is not a tenancy. The TRA considered that it had already decided as a question of fact that in this agreement the parties intended the word “tenancies” to have the context and meaning given to it by clause 16. It clearly included the licence. Even if it were wrong, the TRA further considered that it was satisfied that in this case, the nomenclature chosen by the parties was inapt to describe the nature of the tenure being granted. The licence could just as accurately have been described as a lease.

The Commissioner can issue binding rulings in certain situations. Inland Revenue is bound to follow such a ruling if a taxpayer to whom the ruling applies calculates tax liability based on it. For full details of how binding rulings work, see our information booklet Adjudication & Rulings, a guide to Binding Rulings (IR 715) or the article on page 1 of Tax Information Bulletin Vol 6, No 12 (May 1995) or Vol 7, No 2 (August 1995). You can download these publications free of charge from our website at www.ird.govt.nz ADVERTISING SPACE AND ADVERTISING TIME SUPPLIED TO NON-RESIDENTS – GST TREATMENT PUBLIC RULING – BR Pub 00/06 How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •The contractually supplied service of providing advertising space in a publication or advertising time on radio or television (or other broadcasting service), for and to a non-resident who is outside New Zealand at the time the service is performed, is not supplied “directly in connection with” any land (or improvement thereto) or moveable personal property situated in New Zealand. Section 11(2)(e) will apply to zero-rate the supply of services, provided that all the other requirements of section 11(2)(e) are satisfied. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 1 December 1999 to 30 November 2004. This Ruling is signed by me on the 17th day of July 2000. John Mora Assistant General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Note (not part of ruling): This ruling is essentially the same as public ruling BR Pub 96/10, published in Ta x Information Bulletin Vol 8, No 8 (November 1996), but its period of application is from 1 December 1999 to 30 November 2004. Some formatting changes have also been made. BR Pub 96/10 applied up until 30 November 1999. This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section 11(2)(e). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the contractual supply of advertising space in a publication, or the supply of advertising time on radio or television (or other broadcasting service), by a GST registered person for and to a non-resident person who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed. For the purposes of this Ruling the supply of advertising space or advertising time means the service of communicating an advertising message, and includes all steps involved in providing this service by the supplier of the advertising space or time. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 8 (August 2000) 4 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR PUB 00/06 (2A) Subsection (2)(e) does not apply to a supply of services under an agreement that is entered into, whether directly or indirectly, with a person (person A) who is not resident in New Zealand if- (a)The performance of the services is, or it is reasonably foreseeable at the time the agreement is entered into that the performance of the services will be, received in New Zealand by another person (person B), including- (i) An employee of person A; or (ii) If person A is a company, a director of the company; and (b)It is reasonably foreseeable, at the time the agreement is entered into, that person B will not receive the performance of the services in the course of making taxable or exempt supplies. (2B) For the purpose of subsection (2)(e) and (2fa), ‘outside New Zealand’, for a company or an unincorporated body that is not resident, includes a minor presence in New Zealand, or a presence that is not effectively connected with the supply. Section 60 sets out the GST agency provisions. Section 60(2) states: Subject to this section, for the purposes of this Act, where any registered person makes a taxable supply of goods and services to an agent who is acting on behalf of another person who is the principal for the purposes of that supply, that supply shall be deemed to be made to that principal and not to that agent:... Court of Appeal decision The Court of Appeal held that the supply of the publication of advertisements by Wilson & Horton to non-resident clients qualified for zero-rating under section 11(2)(e), irrespective of whether a New Zealand resident obtains a benefit from the supply. “For and to” The Court of Appeal rejected the High Court’s interpretation of “for” in section 11(2)(e), as meaning “beneficially for”. The Court of Appeal questioned whether this “benefit” test was workable. The Court noted that many parties may potentially benefit from an advertisement placed by a non-resident, and that it was unlikely that the legislature would have intended a wide group of possible beneficiaries of a service to determine the GST treatment of the service. In discussing the “for and to” wording in section 11(2)(e), the Court of Appeal examined the possible meanings of “for” that may have been intended by the legislature and rejected the Commissioner’s interpretation of “for” as meaning “beneficially for”. This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 00/06 (“this Ruling”). The subject matter covered in this Ruling was previously dealt with by BR Pub 96/10 that appeared in TIB Vol 8, No 8 (November 1996), at page 13. This Ruling applies for the period from 1 December 1999 to 30 November 2004. Background In July 1994, the High Court delivered its judgment in Wilson & Horton v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,221. The case dealt with the circumstances in which a newspaper publisher should account for GST on the services of placing advertisements for non-resident clients. The High Court held that: •to qualify for zero-rating under section 11(2)(e), services must be provided “contractually to” and “beneficially for” a non-resident person. If a New Zealand resident receives the benefit of the advertising services, the services are not zero-rated; and •the provision of advertising space and related services is not supplied directly in connection with the subject matter of the advertisements. Wilson & Horton appealed this decision to the Court of Appeal (Wilson & Horton v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,325). The Court of Appeal held in favour of the taxpayer, and concluded that the supply of advertising space in New Zealand by Wilson & Horton to non- resident clients is zero-rated under section 11(2)(e), irrespective of whether a New Zealand resident also benefits from the supply. The Commissioner did not appeal this decision. Legislation Section 11(2)(e) zero-rates a supply of services when: The services are supplied for and to a person who is not resident in New Zealand and who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed, not being services which are supplied directly in connection with - (i)Land or any improvement thereto situated inside New Zealand; or (ii)Moveable personal property (other than choses in action, and other than goods to which paragraph (ca) of this subsection applies) situated inside New Zealand at the time the services are performed; - Sections 11(2A) and 11(2B) deal with services that are supplied to non-residents but are received by persons in New Zealand. The sections state: Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 8 (August 2000) 5 The Court concluded that “for” in section 11(2)(e) was used for emphasis only. Justice Richardson noted that legislative drafters often convey emphasis through the use of a combination of words and said that (at 12,330): I am inclined to think that the framers of s11(2)(e) em- ployed both expressions to convey emphasis and perhaps to bring out the intent that the contract must be genuine and so the services must be supplied under that contract to and for the other contracting party. As a matter of statutory interpretation, the Court said that section 11(2)(e) would have been worded quite differently if the intent had been to preclude zero- rating, unless a non-resident recipient of a supply was the only person who could benefit from the services supplied. Justice Penlington considered that this result was consistent with one of the underlying themes of zero- rating—the preservation of New Zealand’s competitiveness in world trade. It was also recognised that if advertised merchandise is sold in New Zealand, GST will be imposed on the sale at that time. “Directly in connection with” The Court of Appeal did not discuss whether the supply was made directly in connection with land or moveable personal property in New Zealand for the purposes of section 11(2)(e). The High Court had accepted that the supply of advertising space in a newspaper was not “directly in connection with” the subject matter of the advertising. During the Court of Appeal hearing, the potential argument that the services are supplied directly in connection with the newspapers themselves was also raised. However, the Court of Appeal did not allow the Commissioner to introduce this new line of reasoning, as it would have changed the basis upon which the assessment was made and objected to. The publishing industry has asked the Commissioner to clarify the application of the “directly in connection with” exclusion in section 11(2)(e) in this context. Application of the Legislation The key features of section 11(2)(e) are the phrases “for and to” and “directly in connection with”. “For and to” The Commissioner accepts the Court of Appeal’s interpretation of “for and to” in Wilson & Horton for the purposes of section 11(2)(e). In this context, “for and to” is a composite phrase. “For” simply emphasises “to” and does not connote any requirement that services must be provided for the exclusive benefit of the recipient of the supply. If services are supplied pursuant to a contract with a non-resident and are for that non-resident, section 11(2)(e) will apply to zero-rate the supply regardless of any other benefits also arising to a New Zealand resident (provided that the other requirements of the section are satisfied). The Court of Appeal’s interpretation of “for and to” is not restricted to the supply of advertising space in a newspaper. It also applies to the supply of advertising space in all forms of publication and to the supply of advertising time on radio or television (or other broadcasting service). This Ruling discusses the application of section 11(2)(e) to the supply of advertising space in publications, such as newspapers and magazines. The Ruling also covers the supply of advertising time on radio and television, or by way of any other broadcasting service, eg the internet. For the purposes of the Ruling, the supply of advertising space or advertising time means the service of communicating an advertising message, and includes all steps involved in providing this service by the supplier of the advertising space or time. “Directly in connection with” A supply of services to a non-resident will not be zero- rated under section 11(2)(e) if the services are supplied “directly in connection with” any land (or improvement to the land) or moveable personal property (other than choses in action and goods which are referred to in section 11(2)(ca)) situated in New Zealand at the time the services are performed. The Court of Appeal in Wilson & Horton did not discuss the meaning of “directly in connection with” in section 11(2)(e), nor resolve whether advertising space is supplied directly in connection with the newspapers in which advertisements are placed. Case law The determination of whether or not services are supplied “directly in connection with” land or moveable personal property depends on the circumstances in which the services are supplied. In Case E84 (1982) 5 NZTC 59,441, Bathgate DJ considered the meaning of the phrase “in connection with” (note that the word “directly” was not used) in the context of section 165 of the Income Tax Act 1976 (section DJ 5 of the Income Tax Act 1994) and noted (at 59,444 and 59,446): It may be that only an empirical and common sense ap- proach to the interpretation of the words can be applied in each particular case to determine where, if at all, the line should be drawn to allow or not allow expenditure ‘in connection with’ an assessment. However I believe that a narrow interpretation of the words ‘... any expenditure ... in connection with ... the assessment ...’ is the correct interpre- tation ... ... Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 8 (August 2000) 6 It is a matter of degree whether, on the interpretation of a particular statute, there is a sufficient relationship between subject and object to come within the words “in connection with” or not. It is clear that no hard and fast rule can be or should be applied to the interpretation of the words “in connection with”. Each case depends on its own facts and the particular statute under consideration. In the context of GST, the meaning of “directly in connection with” for the purposes of section 11(2)(a), prior to its amendment in 1988, has been judicially considered by the High Court in Auckland Regional Authority v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,080 and the Taxation Review Authority (TRA) in Case P78 (1992) 14 NZTC 4,532. Before amendment, section 11(2)(a) provided for zero-rating of services supplied “directly in connection with” transportation. The High Court and TRA cases concerned the application of section 11(2)(a) to various charges (landing dues, international terminal charges, and rubbish disposal charges) levied on overseas airlines. The High Court and the TRA adopted similar interpretations of the words “directly in connection with” under section 11(2)(a). The Auckland Regional Authority case summarises the reasoning of the TRA in Case P78 (at 11,084): There, the Taxation Review Authority, Judge Barber, held that “airport dues” were zero-rated for GST because passen- gers cannot realistically be transported to New Zealand by air unless a plane lands and parks on the tarmac; that charges for those services can be regarded as provided for international passengers who are in a sense “outside New Zealand” until they pass through customs. The services are fundamental to and directly connected with the transportation of passengers; The High Court and the TRA focus on whether a supply of services is fundamental or integral to transportation to determine whether the “directly in connection with” test in section 11(2)(a) is satisfied. This reasoning is not strictly relevant for the purposes of interpreting “directly in connection with” in section 11(2)(e). This is because the focus of section 11(2)(a) was on services directly connected with transportation services, and the identification of a direct connection between a service and another service, and a service and an item of property, involves different considerations. However, the TRA has recently applied the proviso to section 11(2)(e) and considered the words “directly in connection with” in Case S88 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,551. The objector in Case S88 purchased motor vehicles from its non-resident parent company and then sold the vehicles to independent dealers, who onsold them to the public. The parent company provided a contractual warranty to the objector. The objector agreed with the dealers that if a vehicle was repaired under warranty the objector would reimburse the dealer. The objector would then register a claim with the parent company under the warranty and receive payment pursuant to that claim. The TRA was required to consider whether the repair services provided by the objector pursuant to its contract with the non-resident parent were zero-rated under section 11(2)(e). The TRA concluded that section 11(2)(e) could not apply to zero-rate this supply as the services were supplied “directly in connection with” moveable personal property (the vehicles) situated in New Zealand at the time the services were provided. Although the TRA did not examine the meaning of “directly in connection with” in great detail, it did state (at 7,558): The moveable personal property in question is the repaired vehicle. There is a direct relationship or connection between the service of the repairs and the vehicle. Accordingly, the said “proviso” to s 11(2)(e) must apply to the facts of this case and prevent the objectors from relying on the zero-rating provisions of s 11(2)(e). The repair service could not be performed but for the existence of the vehicle. \[Please note that Case S88 is currently under appeal by the taxpayer.\] The High Court in Malololailai Interval Holidays New Zealand Ltd v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,137 also considered the words “directly in connection with” in the context of section 11(2)(b). In Case T54 (1998) 18 NZTC 8,410, the TRA considered whether the supply of video services for Japanese honeymoon couples to a Japanese company was zero- rated under section 11(2)(e). The decisions in both of these cases are consistent with the cases mentioned above. Therefore, the case law discussing “in connection with” and “directly in connection with” indicates that the interpretation of the test will be dictated by the particular context involved. The Commissioner considers that the “directly in connection with” proviso in section 11(2)(e) should be interpreted narrowly (Judge Bathgate’s words from Case E84 quoted above support this), and that there must be a clear and direct relationship with moveable personal property or land in New Zealand before a supply will be standard-rated. This is consistent with the approach of the TRA in Case S88 in identifying on the facts of that particular case, a “direct relationship or connection” between the repair services and the vehicles under repair. Advertising space and advertising time The supply of advertising space in a publication is the supply of the service of communicating an advertising message, involving all the steps required to achieve communication of the advertisement. This service is not supplied directly in connection with the subject matter of the advertisement. In the words of the High Court in Wilson & Horton v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,221 (at 11,224): The supply of space and services rendered by Wilson & Horton are directly connected with the advertising but not with the goods advertised. The goods are, as it were, at least one step removed from the services supplied by the newspa- per proprietor. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 8 (August 2000) 7 The Commissioner agrees with this view. There is no direct relationship or connection between the provision of advertising space and the subject matter of the advertisement. The same reasoning also applies to the supply of advertising space in all types of publication as well as advertising time on radio or television (or other broadcasting service). The supply of advertising space or time in these media cannot be described as “directly in connection with” the advertised commodity. Similarly, when advertising space is supplied in a publication, the services are not supplied directly in connection with the publication in which the advertisements are published. The High Court judgment in Wilson & Horton concluded that the provision of advertising space was supplied directly in connection with (if anything) the advertising itself. The advertised goods were considered to be at least one step removed from the services. The Commissioner considers the same logic applies in respect of a newspaper or other publication. The service of communicating an advertising message is directly connected with that message and not the publication. The publication is at least one step removed from the service and is merely the medium in which the advertising message is publicised. Accordingly, the service is not supplied directly in connection with the publication produced by the publishers. Consequently, the supply of advertising space in either a publication or by way of broadcast will be treated in the same way for GST purposes. The supply will qualify for zero-rating, provided that the services are supplied for and to a non-resident who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed. Supplies through agents The application of section 60(2) may also need to be considered to determine whether a supply is zero-rated under section 11(2)(e). Section 60(2) deems a taxable supply of goods and services made by a registered person to an agent who is acting on behalf of a principal, to be a supply made to the principal. Therefore, if a supply of advertising space or time is made to a New Zealand resident person who is acting as an agent for a non-resident principal, section 60(2) deems the supply to be made to the non-resident principal and not the resident agent. Section 11(2)(e) will apply to zero-rate the supply of services, provided that all the other requirements of section 11(2)(e) are satisfied. A common example of this is where a resident advertising agency acts as an agent for a non- resident person in purchasing advertising space or time in New Zealand. Conversely, if a supply is made to a non-resident person who is acting as an agent for a New Zealand resident in relation to the supply, section 11(2)(e) will not apply to zero-rate the supply even if the criteria in section 11(2)(e) are otherwise satisfied. The supply will be deemed to be made to the resident principal and it will not be for and to a non-resident person. Section 11(2A) Section 11(2A) was introduced to deal with situations where services are provided to non-residents and persons in New Zealand receive the performance of these services. An example is where New Zealand educational institutions contract with non-residents to provide education for the non-resident’s children in New Zealand. The section operates to ensure supplies of this type are standard rated for GST purposes. Section 11(2A) will not affect the provision of advertising services to non-residents in the circumstances covered by the arrangement described in this Ruling. The performance of these services is not received in New Zealand by other persons. Examples For the purposes of these examples, it is assumed that: –a person referred to as a resident is a “resident” as defined in section 2 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. The converse applies to non-residents, and –if the services are supplied to a non-resident, the non-resident is outside New Zealand at the time of performance of the services. Example 1 A UK resident manufacturing company contacts a New Zealand magazine publisher and books advertising space for a newly developed product. The UK company has a GST-registered subsidiary in New Zealand that sells the advertised product. The supply of advertising space by the magazine publisher to the UK manufacturer is zero-rated under section 11(2)(e). This is because: •The publisher supplies the services contractually for and to a non-resident. The fact that the New Zealand resident subsidiary potentially may benefit from the supply through increased sales does not preclude zero-rating. •The services are not supplied directly in connection with either the products for sale in New Zealand, or the magazines in which the advertisements are shown. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 8 (August 2000) 8 Example 2 A US resident distributor of soft drinks contracts for the supply of radio time on a national radio station in New Zealand. The soft drinks are available from all chains of supermarkets throughout New Zealand. The supply of radio time by the New Zealand radio station to the US distributor is zero-rated under section 11(2)(e). This is because: •The radio station supplies its services contractually for and to a non-resident. The fact that New Zealand resident retailers throughout New Zealand may potentially benefit from the supply through increased sales does not preclude zero-rating. •The services are not supplied directly in connection with the products for sale in New Zealand. Example 3 An Australian computer distributor plans to advertise its product range in New Zealand. The computers will be available through all major computer distributors in New Zealand. The Australian company contacts a New Zealand resident advertising agency to arrange an advertising campaign. The agency, acting in the capacity as agent for the Australian company, purchases air time on a New Zealand resident television channel. The supply of air time by the television station to the Australian company is zero-rated under section 11(2)(e). This is because: •The television channel supplies the air time services contractually for and to a non-resident. Section 60(2) deems the supply to be made to the Australian company, as principal. The New Zealand resident advertising agency receives the supply as agent only. •The fact that New Zealand resident distributors may potentially benefit from the supply through increased sales does not preclude zero-rating. The services are not supplied directly in connection with the products for sale in New Zealand. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 8 (August 2000) 9 DEBT FACTORING ARRANGEMENTS AND GST PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 00/07 The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply to taxable periods commencing on or after 1 August 2000 to 31 July 2005. This Ruling is signed by me on the 19th day of July 2000. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) This is a Public Ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections 8(1), 20(3), and 26(1). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the sale, by a GST registered person (the “Assignor”) on an invoice basis, to a third party (“the Factor”), on a recourse or non-recourse basis, of an outstanding debt at a price less than the debt’s face value. Debt factoring on a non-recourse basis means that the Factor has no claim back to the Assignor if the debts sold to him or her become doubtful or uncollectable (that is, the Factor assumes all of the risk). In contrast, debt factoring on a recourse basis means that the Factor has some form of claim back to the Assignor if the debts sold to him or her prove to be doubtful or uncollectable, for example under a put option at the transfer price. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •The difference between the face value of the debt and the price received from the Factor is not a bad debt for the purposes of section 26. Accordingly, section 26 has no application and the registered person cannot claim an output tax deduction under section 20(3)(a)(iii); and •If a portion of a debt is written-off before it is sold to the Factor, then whether this write-off meets the requirements of section 26(1) depends on whether the amount written off was “bad” according to the conventional tests (outlined in public ruling BR Pub 00/03, entitled “Bad debts – writing off debts as bad for GST and income tax purposes”). Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 8 (August 2000) 10 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR PUB 00/07 This issue only arises in respect of taxpayers registered for GST on an invoice basis, because taxpayers registered for GST on a payments basis are only required to return, as output tax, any payment received. However, it is noted that the Taxation (Annual Rates, GST and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill includes an amendment to section 26 which, if enacted, will establish parity between the two GST accounting bases. Under the amendment, a registered person who sells a debt to a third party must pay tax on the remaining book value of the debt on the date that the debt is sold if the registered person accounts for tax payable on a payments basis. Legislation Section 8(1) states: Subject to this Act, a tax, to be known as goods and services tax, shall be charged in accordance with the provisions of this Act at the rate of 12.5 percent on the supply (but not including an exempt supply) in New Zealand of goods and services, on or after the 1st day of October 1986, by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by that person, by reference to the value of that supply. Section 9(1) states: Subject to this Act, for the purposes of this Act a supply of goods and services shall be deemed to take place at the earlier of the time an invoice is issued by the supplier or the recipient or the time any payment is received by the supplier, in respect of that supply. Section 20 states: (1) In respect of each taxable period every registered person shall calculate the amount of tax payable by that registered person in accordance with the provisions of this section. ... (3) Subject to this section, in calculating the amount of tax payable in respect of each taxable period, there shall be deducted from the amount of output tax of a registered person attributable to the taxable period- (a)In the case of a registered person who is required to account for tax payable on an invoice basis pursuant to section 19 of this Act, the amount of input tax- (i) In relation to the supply of goods and services (not being a supply of secondhand goods to which paragraph (c) of the definition of the term “input tax” in section 2(1) of this Act applies), made to that registered person during that taxable period: (ia) In relation to the supply of secondhand goods to which paragraph (c) of the definition of the term “input tax” in section 2(1) of this Act applies, to the extent that a payment in respect of that supply has been made during that taxable period: (ii)Invoiced or paid, whichever is the earlier, pursuant to section 12 of this Act during that taxable period: This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 00/07 (“the Ruling”). Background Sections 20(3)(a)(iii) and 26 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (“the Act”) allow a registered person to make a deduction from output tax if the registered person has made a taxable supply, returned output tax in respect of that taxable supply, and subsequently written off as a bad debt all or part of the debt. If a registered person factors (sells) a debt owing for less than its face value to a third party (“the Factor”), the issue arises whether the difference between the face value of the debt and the amount received from the Factor can be an amount written off as a bad debt. This issue was previously dealt with in PIB No 164 (August 1987) at page 27 under the heading “GST and debt collection agencies – debt factoring” and in Technical Rulings paragraph 104.9.4 under an identical heading. Those statements concluded that if a registered person accounting for GST on an invoice basis subsequently sold a debt for less than its face value, the Commissioner would allow the registered person a bad debt deduction under section 26 for the difference between the debt’s face value and the sale proceeds. The inference being that the difference between the two amounts was a bad debt. Barber DJ in Case T27 (1997) 18 NZTC 8,188 reached a different conclusion from that set out in PIB No 164 and Technical Rulings paragraph 104.9.4. In particular, the Taxation Review Authority (“TRA”) concluded that if a registered person factors a debt owing for less than its face value, the difference between the face value of the debt and the amount received from the Factor is not a bad debt. The Ruling confirms that the Commissioner accepts the view of Barber DJ in Case T27. In particular, it is now the Commissioner’s view that if a registered person factors a debt owing for less than its face value, the difference between the face value of the debt and the amount received from the Factor is not a bad debt. Accordingly, section 26 has no application, and a registered person cannot claim a deduction from output tax under section 20(3)(a)(iii). The Ruling changes and supersedes the earlier policy set out in PIB No 164 and Technical Rulings paragraph 104.9.4. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 8 (August 2000) 11 (iii) Calculated in accordance with section 25(2)(b) or section 25(5) or section 26 of this Act; and (b)In the case of a registered person who is required to account for tax payable on a paymentsbasis or a hybrid basis pursuant to section 19 of this Act, the amount of input tax- (i) In relation to the supply of goods and services made to that registered person, being a supply of goods and services which is deemed to take place pursuant to section 9(1) or section 9(3)(a) or section 9(3)(aa) or section 9(6) of this Act, to the extent that a payment in respect of that supply has been made during the taxable period: (ii)Paid pursuant to section 12 of this Act during that taxable period: (iii) In relation to the supply of goods and services made during that taxable period to that registered person, not being a supply of goods and services to which subparagraph (i) of this paragraph applies: (iv) Calculated in accordance with section 25(2)(b) or section 25(5) of this Act, to the extent that a payment has been made in respect of that amount, or section 26 of this Act; ... The provision relating to bad debts is in section 26, which states: (1)Where a registered person- (a)Has made a taxable supply for consideration in money; and (b)Has furnished a return in relation to the taxable period during which the output tax on the supply was attributable and has properly accounted for the output tax on that supply as required under this Act; and (c)Has written off as a bad debt the whole or part of the consideration not paid to that person,- that registered person shall make a deduction under section 20(3) of this Act of that portion of the amount of tax charged in relation to that supply as the amount written off as a bad debt bears to the total consideration for the supply: ... Section 3(1) defines “financial services” as follows: For the purposes of this Act, the term “financial services” means any one or more of the following activities: (a)The exchange of currency (whether effected by the exchange of bank notes or coin, by crediting or debiting accounts, or otherwise): (b)The issue, payment, collection, or transfer of ownership of a cheque or letter of credit: (c)The issue, allotment, drawing, acceptance, endorse- ment, or transfer of ownership of a debt security: (d)The issue, allotment, or transfer of ownership of an equity security or a participatory security: (e)Underwriting or sub-underwriting the issue of an equity security, debt security, or participatory security: (f)The provision of credit under a credit contract: (g)The renewal or variation of a debt security, equity security, participatory security, or credit contract: (h)The provision, taking, variation, or release of a guarantee, indemnity, security, or bond in respect of the performance of obligations under a cheque, credit contract, equity security, debt security, or participatory security, or in respect of the activities specified in paragraphs (b) to (g) of this subsection: (i)The provision, or transfer of ownership, of a life insurance contract or the provision of re-insurance in respect of any such contract: (j)The provision, or transfer of ownership, of an interest in a superannuation scheme, or the management of a superannuation scheme: (k)The provision or assignment of a futures contract through a futures exchange: (ka)The payment or collection of any amount of interest, principal, dividend, or other amount whatever in respect of any debt security, equity security, participa- tory security, credit contract, contract of life insur- ance, superannuation scheme, or futures contract: (l)Agreeing to do, or arranging, any of the activities specified in paragraphs (a) to (ka) of this subsection, other than advising thereon. Application of the Legislation Under section 26, a registered person can make a deduction under section 20(3)(a)(iii) if that person has: •made a taxable supply for consideration, and •furnished a return in relation to the taxable period during which the output tax on the supply was attributable and has properly accounted for the output tax on that supply as required under the Act, and •written off as a bad debt the whole or part of the consideration not paid to that person. The amount that may be deducted is that portion of the amount of GST charged as the amount written off bears to the total consideration for the supply. If the supply is the supply of goods under a hire purchase agreement, the first proviso to section 26 limits the deduction to the portion of the amount written off as the cash price bears to the total amount payable under the hire purchase agreement. Further, section 26 does not apply to a registered person accounting on a payments basis under section 19 or 19A, unless either section 9(2)(b) (door to door sales) or section 9(3)(b) (hire purchase agreements) applies to the supply. Section 26 only applies when the registered person has already accounted for GST on a supply and subsequently “Has written off as a bad debt the whole or part of the consideration not paid to that person”. If a registered person factors a debt owing for less than its face value, the issue arises whether the difference between the face value of the debt and the amount received from the Factor can be an amount “written off as a bad debt”. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 8 (August 2000) 12 The Commissioner believes that the difference between the face value of the debt and the amount received from the Factor cannot be an amount written off as a bad debt under section 26. Rather than being a bad debt, the discount from face value is simply a result of the process of agreeing the consideration for the debts that is acceptable to both the Assignor and the Factor. The reasons for this view are: 1.Cases considering the meaning of bad debt focus on whether the creditor can recover the outstanding amounts owing. That is, a bad debt arises when the creditor is unable or unlikely to recover the debt owing. If the creditor could recover the full amount owing but chooses not to (as in a debt factoring situation), any “loss” suffered by the creditor is not due to a bad debt. 2.Cases also indicate that for an amount to be written off as a bad debt, a debt must exist at the time the debt is written off. If a registered person factors a debt, no further debt exists between the registered person and debtor, and no amount can be written off as a bad debt. In considering the second of these factors, with regard to recourse debt factoring arrangements (where the Factor has some form of claim back to the Assignor if he or she is unable to collect some of the debts purchased), it is the Commissioner’s view that when a debt is sold by the Assignor on a recourse basis, the title to the debt passes to the Factor unless the Factor exercises a recourse option or right. Therefore, until the recourse is exercised and the debt is transferred back, a bad debt deduction is not available under section 26(1), as after the sale there is no debt owed to the Assignor. However, if the Factor exercises an option or right to transfer some portion of the debt back to the Assignor after the sale then, once this has occurred, a debt exists that is owed to the Assignor that may be able to be written off by the Assignor. Whether it can be written off depends on the application of the ordinary tests for determining whether a debt is bad as noted below, under the heading “Whether the creditor can recover the amount owing”. Whether the creditor can recover the amount owing The term “bad debt” is not defined in the Act. However, in Budget Rent A Car Ltd v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,263 Tompkins J discussed the meaning of bad debt in the context of the Income Tax Act. He stated at page 12,269: When did the debt become bad? The term “bad debt” is not defined in the Act. It, therefore, should be given its normal commercial meaning. It is a question of fact to be deter- mined objectively. A debt becomes a bad debt when a reasonably prudent commercial person would conclude that there is no reasonable likelihood that the debt will be paid in whole or in part by the debtor or by someone else either on behalf of the debtor or otherwise. Case N69 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,541 also discusses the meaning of bad debt. In that case the taxpayer was a private limited liability company carrying on the business as a timber merchant. Following the receipt of a letter from one of the company’s debtors, the managing director realised that there was no likelihood of recovery of a debt owing and that the debt should be written off. The taxpayer physically wrote the appropriate entries into the journal and books of the company in May 1988 to write off the debt as at 31 March 1988. The taxpayer claimed a bad debt deduction for the income year ending 31 March 1988, but this was disallowed by the TRA on the basis that the relevant journal entries had not been made by 31 March 1988. The TRA (Barber DJ) discussed the meaning of bad debt and at page 3,548 stated: Naturally, the debts in question must be “bad” to be written off as bad in terms of sec 106(1)(b). This is a question of fact. Generally, an application of that criterion will not be difficult as the debtor will be insolvent. However, the debtor does not need to be insolvent for the debt to be bad. It is only necessary that there be a bona fide assessment that the debtor is unlikely to make payment of the debt. If there is a clear understanding or arrangement that there be long term credit, and if the taxpayer believes that the terms of the credit will be met, then the debt cannot be treated as bad because it is merely a situation of deferred payment. In my view, as well as the need for the writing off to be made bona fide, the circumstances must indicate to a reasonable and prudent business person, that, on the balance of probability, the debt is unlikely to be recovered. This is an objective test. As is evident from the quotations above, different wording is used by the High Court in Budget Rent A Car and the TRA in Case N69 to describe the test of when a debt can be written off as bad. To summarise these differences, in Budget Rent A Car the words used were “no reasonable likelihood” that the debt (or part of the debt) would be recovered, whereas in Case N69 the words used were that “on the balance of probability, the debt is unlikely to be repaid”. The wording used in Case N69 may appear to include two standards into the test. That is, that the debt will not be repaid “on the balance of probabilities” and that the debt is “unlikely” to be repaid. These standards are potentially conflicting as the first of them provides a lower standard than the second. However, the Commissioner considers that the test provided by Barber DJ in Case N69 requires that for a debt to be written off as bad it must be unlikely to be repaid. This is clear from his Honour’s statement at page 3,548 of the judgment: Even if the executives had come to a formal business decision or assessment by 31 March 1988 that the debts were unlikely to be recovered and therefore should be written off as bad debts... \[Emphasis added\] Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 8 (August 2000) 13 Furthermore, the Commissioner considers that the words “no reasonable likelihood” and “unlikely” have the same meaning. Therefore, on this basis the Commissioner regards the decisions in Budget Rent A Car and Case N69 as applying the same test, and both cases as authority for the conclusion that a reasonably prudent commercial person must determine that there is no reasonable likelihood of recovering a debt before it can be written off as bad. The Commissioner prefers the wording used in Budget Rent A Car as this is the higher authority and this wording is supported by the way in which the High Court applied the test in Graham v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1995) 17 NZTC 12,107. Also adopting this wording removes the risk of misinterpreting the wording of the test in Case N69 as meaning that a debt can be written off as bad if, on the balance of probabilities, it will not be repaid. The emphasis of the discussion above is on the inability of the debtor to pay due to the debtor’s financial position. To reiterate, in order for a debt to be bad, the creditor must have sufficient information to enable a reasonably prudent business person to form the view that there is no reasonable likelihood that the debt will be paid. Case T27 specifically considered the issue in respect of section 26 and debt factoring arrangements. In Case T27 the taxpayer sought a bad debt deduction for the difference between the amount invoiced and amount received from a debt factor, on the basis that the difference was a bad debt. The TRA determined that the debt was not a bad debt, but in actual fact a “good debt”. At page 8,192 the TRA stated: A pivotal submission for the objector is that the discounts it allows the franchiser are bad debts which it may write off as such and, hence, claim an input tax refund for GST purposes under s 26(1) and s 20(3) of the Act. It is also pivotal to the objector’s case that it has been factoring the hireage debts to its franchiser and that such process has constituted the writing off of bad debts regarding the discount. It seems to me that the provision of such a discount could not possibly constitute the incurring of a bad debt by the objector. The essence of the arrangement between the objector and the franchiser is that the hireage debt from the customer is a good debt, but that the objector prefers early payment of that debt and to avoid the administration process and normal risks of its recovery. Moreover, at page 8,194 the TRA reaffirmed its view that such a debt could not be bad. The TRA stated: There were submissions by counsel as to whether a bad debt exists for the purposes of s 26(1) including references to case law. Counsel particularly referred to my decision in Case N69 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,541 where I considered the wording of s 106(1)(b)(iii) of the Income Tax Act 1976 relating to the deductibility of bad debts for income tax purposes. There, I emphasised that a bad debt deduction was only available if the debt was in fact “bad” and had been actually written off. The present case is not a situation where there could be any sensible assessment that the debts (assigned by the objector to the franchiser) were, in any particular sense, bad or uncollect- able or unlikely to be paid. Accordingly, the provisions of s 26(1)(c) of the Act are irrelevant to the issues before me. I appreciate that, in terms of my views in Case N69, the objector in the present case had made appropriate journal entries to write off the discounts as bad debts and had, no doubt, done so in good faith, but that was a quite erroneous procedure because, on any objective test, the debts were not bad. Consistent with Budget Rent A Car and Case N69, the TRA appears to take the view that, where a creditor chooses to sell a perfectly collectable debt for below its face value, no bad debt can arise. In no way can such a debt be regarded as bad or uncollectable or unlikely to be paid. Accordingly, any difference between the face value of the debt and amount actually received is due to factors other than the debt being a bad debt. In summary, when assessing whether a bad debt exists, the cases indicate that a debt is bad when a reasonably prudent business person would have concluded, based on the information available about the debtor’s ability to repay the debt, that there is no reasonable likelihood that the debt will be paid. In the absence of such a circumstance, if a registered person chooses to sell a debt for below its face value, no bad debt exists and no deduction is available under section 20(3)(a)(iii). Finally in this regard, in response to submissions received on the first draft of the Ruling, it is useful to clarify that, in the Commissioner’s view, when a portion of debt is written-off on the basis of experience of the collectability of similar types of debts, without investigating the likelihood of each debtor repaying the debt, the requirements of section 26(1) have not been met. This is because case law establishes that, to write-off a debt as bad under section 26(1), reasonable steps must be taken to determine whether that particular debt owed by that particular debtor is likely to be paid (Case P53 (1992) 14 NZTC 4370 and Budget Rent A Car v C of IR (1995) 17 NZTC 12263). Writing-off a portion of debt on this basis involves seeking a deduction for the provision for doubtful debts. As noted in BR Pub 00/03, the GST Act does not allow a deduction for the provision for doubtful debts. Must a debt be in existence at the time it is written off? Case law also indicates that before an amount can be written off as a bad debt, a bad debt must be in existence at the time the amount is written off. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 8 (August 2000) 14 In Budget Rent A Car the taxpayer company carried on business in New Zealand as a motor vehicle rental company. A sum of money ($2,767,695.48) was owed to it by an Australian company (BRACS). In May 1989, BRACS developed financial problems and was purchased by a consortium. In July 1990, Budget Rent A Car (“Budget”) entered a deed of covenant with BRACS and covenanted that it would not bring any proceedings against or prove in the liquidation of BRACS for any claim Budget might have. The debt, however, remained outstanding. In November 1990, Budget’s directors wrote off the debt owing by BRACS and claimed a bad debt deduction for the amount. The Commissioner argued that there was no bad debt and no bad debt deduction was allowed. In particular, the Commissioner argued that for there to be a bad debt, there must at the time of the write-off be a debt in existence. As any debt due by BRACS to Budget had been remitted or extinguished by the deed of covenant, no debt thereafter existed and none could be written off. Accepting the Commissioner’s argument in this respect Tompkins J stated at page 12,267: I accept Mr Wood’s submission that for a taxpayer to be entitled to deduct from its assessable income the amount of a bad debt written off, there must at the time of the write off be a debt in existence. If a debt has been effectively released, the effect is to extinguish it or put an end to its existence. Thereafter there cannot be a write off of that debt for tax purposes. This accords with the view expressed by Owen J in Point v FC of T 70 ACT 4021; (1970) 1 ATR 577 at ATC p 4023; ATR p 580. ... The issue therefore becomes whether the parties, when they entered into the deed of covenant and in particular cl 2.1, intended to extinguish the debt. In accordance with the normal canons of contractual interpretation, this is to be determined having regard to the words the parties used, viewed in the light of the surrounding circumstances. However, on the facts Tompkins J found that a debt did exist, and allowed Budget a bad debt deduction. The following Australian case illustrates a similar point. In GE Crane Sales Pty Ltd v FC of T 71 ATC 4268 the High Court of Australia considered a claim by the taxpayer to write off certain bad debts. The Court held that it could not do so because the taxpayer was not a creditor in respect of these debts. Whereas some payment had been accepted in full satisfaction of a debt owing, the taxpayer’s rights to recover the balance had been extinguished and it could not claim to write off as a bad debt the balance of the amount. Menzies J at page 4,272 expressed the opinion that a taxpayer cannot write off as a bad debt an amount that is no longer a debt. Moreover, at page 4,272 he stated: I have therefore come to the conclusion, both as to the factored debts which were extinguished and those in which the appellant gave up any beneficial interest which it had to the receiver and manager under the scheme of arrangement, that sec. 63 does not apply because at the time the writing off occurred there did not exist, in any sense, debts owing to the appellant. To write off as bad debts amounts which are owing but which cannot be recovered is a sensible commercial exercise and one to which taxation significance is naturally enough given, but to write off a non-existent debt as a bad debt is hardly sensible commercially and, in my opinion, to do so has no significance for the purposes of sec. 63 ... Section 26 requires that the registered person “Has written off as a bad debt the whole or part of the consideration not paid to that person”. Both Budget Rent A Car and G E Crane Sales Pty Ltd indicate that before a debt can be written off a debt must be in existence at the time the debt is written off. Although these cases were determined in an income tax context, the wording of section 26 makes them no less applicable for GST purposes. Accordingly, for section 26 to apply, the registered person must be able to show that at the time of writing off the debt, a debt was then in existence. In terms of non-recourse debt factoring, at the time the debt is sold, the debt between the registered person and debtor is extinguished and replaced with a separate and distinct debt between the Factor and debtor. In such situations no debt exists at the time the amount is written off, which will be after sale of the debt. Therefore, after the sale of the debt to the Factor, no further debt exists and according to both Budget Rent A Car Ltd and G E Crane Sales Pty Ltd no amount can be written off as a bad debt. In terms of recourse debt factoring arrangements (where the Factor has some form of claim back to the Assignor if he or she is unable to collect some of the debts purchased) when a debt is sold by the Assignor on a recourse basis, the title to the debt passes to the Factor unless the Factor exercises a recourse option or right by which the debt can be transferred back to the Assignor. Therefore, after the sale of the debt to the Factor (until the recourse is exercised and the debt is transferred back) no further debt exists, and according to both Budget Rent A Car Ltd and G E Crane Sales Pty Ltd no amount can be written off as a bad debt. However, if the Factor exercises an option or right to transfer some portion of the debt back to the Assignor after the sale then, once this has occurred, a debt exists that is owed to the Assignor that may be able to be written off by the Assignor. Whether it can be written off depends on the application of the ordinary tests for determining whether a debt is bad as noted above, under the heading “Whether the creditor can recover the amount owing”. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 8 (August 2000) 15 Writing off the debt before sale to the Factor Several submissions received on the first draft of the Ruling noted that the issue of whether the discount to the Factor might be written off as a bad debt under section 26(1) would not arise if this amount were written off prior to the sale of the debt to the Factor. The Commissioner agrees that this is the case. If a portion of a debt is written off before it is sold to the Factor, then whether the debt is written off as bad according to the requirements in section 26(1) depends on the application of the tests outlined in Public Ruling BR Pub 00/03 entitled “Bad debts – writing off debts as bad for GST and income tax purposes”, see Tax Information Bulletin Vol 12, No 5 (May 2000) at page 5. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 8 (August 2000) 16 PRODUCT RULING - BR PRD 00/06 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by The Royal New Zealand College of General Practitioners (“the College”). Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CD 5 and CB 9(d) of the Act. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the monthly payments made by the College to individual doctors (“Registrars”), for the Registrars’ participation in an annual 40 week Intensive Clinical Training Course (“the Course”), on terms and conditions that are materially the same as those contained in the following three documents: •Terms and Conditions of Registrars 1998: the terms and conditions to be agreed between the College and all Registrars enrolled in the Intensive Clinical Training Course of the General Practice Vocational Training Programme. •Letter of Appointment of Registrar: The letter supplied to the Registrar, by the College, as an agreement of the respective obligations of each party. •Intensive Clinical Training Year Handbook 1998: The detailed handbook of terms, conditions, obligations and syllabus of the Intensive Clinical Training Course. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1.The College was formed in 1974, and obtained a Royal Charter in 1979. The mission of the College is to improve the health of all New Zealanders through the provision of high- quality general practice care. 2.The Constitutional Objectives of the College are: (a)To promote in all ways the highest standards in general practice in New Zealand; (b)To take a caring interest in the welfare of its members and their families; (c)To sustain and improve the professional competence of members of the medical profession who are engaged in general practice in New Zealand; (d)To inform the general public in New Zealand in relation to general practice; (e)To encourage and assist in the provision of a high standard of teaching and training for all undergraduate medical students in the field of general practice in New Zealand.

Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 8 (August 2000) 17 4.The Course is a 40 week practice-based training course established by the College as one part of its GPVTP. This Course is placed at ‘year nine’ of a doctor’s standard educational path to gaining the MRNZCGP qualification. The GPVTP is regarded as encompassing years’ seven to eleven of this ‘path’. 5.It is stated by the College (page 8 of the Intensive Clinical Training Year Handbook 1998) the general aims of the Course are to: •Improve the health of New Zealanders through the provision of a GPVTP which achieves a level of competence sufficient to maintain independent general practice; •Promote high standards of general practice in New Zealand by ensuring those entering general practice are vocationally trained; •Ensure registrars understand the principles of general practice; •Develop and foster a group of general practice teachers and teaching practices; and •Foster an understanding of general practice within the medical profession and primary care purchasers. 6.The Course involves various aspects of training that a Registrar is to complete. Essentially, a Registrar is assigned to a ‘teaching practice’. Each teaching practice is a general practice medical centre for which the College has contracted with a general practitioner to be the Registrar’s teacher. The general practitioner teacher holds vocational registration and is paid by the College under the separate contract. 7.The standard Course week for a Registrar under the Course is broken up as follows: •8 half days per week attendance at the teaching practice to which they are assigned, consisting of: •Patient contact. The conditions in respect of this are that a Registrar is to participate in between 5 and 13 patient consultations per half day. In the early weeks of the attachment, to relieve possible pressure on a Registrar, each consultation is to be for a generous period of 20-30 minutes. •The Registrar having at least three hours of direct contact time with the teacher per week, to include discussion, observation, review and feedback. It is essential that there be a minimum of a one hour and 30 minute uninterrupted block between the teacher and the Registrar per week. •2 half days attending seminars and workshops that are provided and organised by the College. •Registrars are required to ‘satisfactorily’ attend and participate in these seminars and workshops. •Registrars are responsible for organising/presenting part of the programme within these seminars and workshops. 8.A Registrar does not receive any payment from the teacher, but receives monthly payments from the College allocated from the funding the College receives from the Clinical Training Agency (“CTA”). The 1998 level of the payments is as follows, being paid monthly during the period of the Course: For the Forty WeekAnnualised (before tax) Course 1.$27,551.53$35,817 2.$29,027.69$37,736 9.The level of payment is dependent on the level of prior medical experience of a Registrar. However these amounts are set at a level to provide for the Registrar’s maintenance of their standard of living and not at the level for a doctor with similar experience in appropriate employment. 10.A doctor who wishes to attend the Course as a Registrar applies to the College at the appropriate time. From the total number of applicants, the College undertakes a selection process to accept only the number of Registrars for which it has funding for. 11.The criteria by which Registrars are selected are merit-based; the College taking the perspective of selecting Registrars who will benefit the community in the long term. These criteria include: Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 8 (August 2000) 18 •The intention to enter general practice; •Experience in various areas of medicine; •A demonstrated commitment to general practice addressing priority health areas; •A demonstrated commitment to general practice addressing rural health issues; •A demonstrated commitment to general practice addressing Maori health issues; and •A demonstrated commitment to teaching medical students and colleagues. 12.The College initiates an agreement with each individual doctor that is to be agreed before the doctor becomes a Registrar in the Course. 13.The letter of appointment that the College offers to the Registrar refers to the “Terms and Conditions of Employment” and also the obligations contained in the “Registrar Handbook”, which are to form part of their agreement and be met by the Registrar. 14.The obligations contained in this Handbook include (among others): •That the Registrar satisfactorily attend, and participate in, 80% of the seminars and workshops, •That the Registrar complete the ‘attachment’ to teaching practices, and the assessments thereon; •That the Registrar be involved in patient contact, by having 5 to 13 consultations with patients per half day. •That the Registrar has review sessions with the attachment teacher each day. 15.In exchange for agreeing to undertake the above and undertaking it, the Registrars receive from the College the monthly payments which are intended to maintain the Registrars whilst attending the Course. 16.The College Council is responsible for setting the educational philosophy and mission statement for its general practice education programme. 17.With regards to the Course content, the College has developed a curriculum for general practice training in consultation with College Members and Fellows and with the CTA to ensure that Government health priority areas are reflected in the educational programmes. 18.The College determines, in consultation with its Registrars, the methods of delivery for its programme for Stage I. The content of seminars and workshops is based on the syllabus for the Course and the specific learning needs of Registrars. The College determines the structure of the programme also. Materials for the programme are provided by the College and are purchased from the funding provided by the CTA. Seminars and workshops are held on premises hired by the College for that purpose. 19.The College is responsible for setting the Primex examination (sat at the end of the Course) and, in doing so, sets the standards for entry into Stage II and ultimately for vocational registration. The College also determines the structure and timing of the teaching programme. Furthermore the College determines the outputs of Registrars in terms of assignments, research projects, presentations and other learning activities. 20.The College selects teachers to the programme who meet a number of specific criteria. These include holding general registration with the Medical Council, being a Fellow of the College, and being assessed by the Regional Director as being competent and able to provide excellent education to a trainee. These teachers are employed by the College to provide teaching within the calendar year of the programme. All teachers must undertake ongoing professional development activities whilst they remain a teacher. 21.Regional directors (employed by the College) are responsible for maintaining contact with teachers during the programme and resolving any difficulties that may arise. They do so primarily through teacher meetings and practice visits. The regional directors are kept informed by teachers on the progress of Registrars. 22.The College devotes the majority of its resources (staff, funding and other assets) to the administration and running of the GPVTP and the continuing education of doctors in general practice. Over 50% of the College’s total income and expenditure for the year ended March 1998 were directly attributable to the GPVTP alone. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 8 (August 2000) 19 Condition stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following condition: •The monthly payments made to the Registrars under the Arrangement are not grants made under regulations made under section 193 of the Education Act 1964, section 303 of the Education Act 1989, or any enactment in substitution for those sections. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to the condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •The monthly payments made to the Registrars under the Arrangement are exempt income under section CB 9(d). The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 1 January 1998 to 31 December 2003. This Ruling is signed by me on the 29th day of May 2000.

We have published these as they may be of general interest to readers. These items are based on letters we’ve received. A general similarity to items in this package will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case will depend on its own facts. WEBSITE EXPENDITURE - DEDUCTIBILITY Section BD 2, Income Tax Act 1994 – Allowable deductions A taxpayer has asked how he should treat expenditure incurred in creating a website to be used by him in deriving gross income. (The same considerations could also apply if the taxpayer had contracted another person to create the website for him.) A website is a collection of web pages or web files. “Web” is an abbreviation for the “World Wide Web”, the graphical part of the Internet. A web page is created using different programming languages (such as hypertext markup programming language (“HTML”)). The use of programming code such as HTML enables web pages to have a number of features, such as video files, sound files, and links to other sites. A web browser interprets the code for graphical interface with a user’s computer. A web page is transferred to a user’s computer via the hypertext transfer protocol (“HTTP”). A website resides on an HTTP server. A website’s development has a number of steps (that can be undertaken in any order), including acquiring a domain name—the site’s Internet address. The site needs to be designed and programmed. A website owner may wish to register the site with different Internet search engines, and to embed search strings in the site. The owner will also need to rent space on a web server. The domain name of the website is generally acquired for a modest sum (less than $200). However, in some cases acquiring the domain name may require substantial expenditure. Expenditure incurred in acquiring a domain name is capital expenditure and non-deductible. In terms of the applicable capital/ revenue tests established by the courts, such expenditure is of a one-off nature, gives rise to an enduring benefit, gives rise to an identifiable asset, and is part of the business structure of a taxpayer. A domain name is not “depreciable intangible property” as defined in section OB 1, and listed in Schedule 17, of the Act. As such, the expenditure incurred in acquiring the domain name is also not depreciable. The HTML or other programming that makes up the website is an asset, being a computer software program. The costs incurred in creating the website are appropriately categorised as capital expenditure. In terms of the applicable capital/revenue tests established by the courts, such expenditure: •is of a one-off nature •gives rise to an enduring benefit •is part of the business structure of a taxpayer. As a capital asset, the costs of creating the website must be capitalised and may be depreciated. To be depreciable, the software must be used in deriving gross income. Consistent with other computer software, it may be depreciated at a rate of 40% diminishing value or 30% straight line. This approach (of capitalising expenditure and depreciating it) is consistent with the views expressed by a number of commentators. In an accounting context the view that capitalisation and amortisation is appropriate has been expressed by Dr Rachel Baskerville in “Web Sites – Lame Ducks or Golden Geese” Chartered Accountants Journal (March 2000, page 62) and by Craig Fisher in “Accounting for Web- sites” Accounting, Corporate and Tax Alert (Issue 93, 5 June 2000, paragraph 200). The approach of capitalising and depreciating is also consistent with the draft Australian Tax Office ruling TR2000/D6. Ongoing costs of updating or adding to the information on a website are of a revenue nature, and are deductible when incurred if they meet the general test of deductibility in section BD 2(1). It is a matter of degree as to whether expenditure is updating and maintaining a website, and hence revenue, or a reconstruction or functional improvement to a website, which would be capital. It is difficult to give general guidance on the distinction, as was noted (in a different context) by the Privy Council in Auckland Gas Co Ltd v CIR (unreported, PC Appeal 32 of 1999, judgment 14 June 2000). Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 8 (August 2000) 22 However, some examples can be given as to the distinction between the two categories in the context of websites. Maintenance of a website would include the following: •updating the content of a web page •adding content to a web page •correcting minor errors or bugs in a website, and •minor style or format changes relating to matters such as font types, font sizes, colours and so on. An upgrade of a website would include the following: •adding new features to a website, such as adding a sales capability with credit card processing features •adding extra pages to the website •upgrading the version of the software used in the website, and •completely changing the layout and functions of the website sufficient to be a reconstruction. These examples are consistent with the distinction between maintenance and upgrade in the Commissioner’s existing computer software policy statement (“Income Tax Treatment of Computer Software” in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 4, No 10 (May 1993)). The examples also reflect the fact that a website may start out as a very simple website with few features, and yet may be upgraded over time to be a complex e-commerce site with advanced features such as the ability to purchase goods and services online, with online credit card processing capability. Just as the general capital/revenue principles apply to the original website (and the capital classification of that), any upgrade which adds new functions is also subject to those general principles and will also be on capital account. The cost of renting space on an HTTP server is deductible, assuming the general test of deductibility is met. The annual renewal fee for registration of a domain name is also deductible. Such costs are of a revenue nature, because they are ongoing in the nature of a servicing charge, and are analogous to expenditure incurred in renting space in a building or in hiring goods. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 8 (August 2000) 23 REAL ESTATE SALE AND PURCHASE – GST APPORTIONMENTS OF INCOME AND EXPENDITURE Section 2(1), Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 – definition of “consideration” We have been asked if the Goods and Services Tax (GST) treatment of local authority rates apportionments on the sale and purchase of real estate, outlined in Public Ruling BR Pub 99/8, also applies to other income or expenditure that is similarly apportioned. Public Ruling BR Pub 99/8 published in TIB Vol 11, No 11 (December 1999), with a minor correction in TIB Vol 12, No 2 (February 2000), sets out the GST treatment of local authority rates apportioned at the time of settlement on the sale and purchase of real estate. The Commissioner’s view is that rates apportionments form part of the consideration for the supply of real estate and, where the transaction is subject to GST, should be taken into account in calculating the applicable GST. If other expenditure (such as insurance) or income (such as commercial rental) is apportioned at settlement, these apportionments should be treated in a manner consistent with Public Ruling BR Pub 99/8. Provided the apportionment is determined on a contractual basis between the vendor and purchaser at the time of settlement, the apportionment will form part of the “consideration” of the supply of the real estate. For the reasons set out in Public Ruling BR Pub 99/8, the GST consequences will depend on whether the vendor and/or purchaser are GST-registered persons and whether the transaction forms part of a taxable activity.

These are purely brief factual reviews of decisions for the general interest of our readers. GST TREATMENT OF SUMS RECEIVED BY TAXPAYER FROM PARENT COMPANY UNDER WARRANTY AGREEMENT Case:CIR v Suzuki New Zealand Limited Decision date:18 July 2000 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Summary McGechan J held both TRA findings were correct. In the result, the assessments stand. Facts Suzuki New Zealand (“SNZ”) purchases Suzuki motor vehicles from Suzuki Motor Corporation (“SMC”) which is the Japanese parent company. The terms of the sale and purchase agreement include a provision under which SMC warrants the goods to SNZ. The warranty is in respect of parts and labour for up to one year from the date the vehicle is sold to any particular customer. The beneficiary of the warranty is SNZ. Once the Suzuki products arrive in NZ, they are sold to independent dealers. The dealers then sell to the public. Each vehicle is sold with a warranty provided by SNZ. This warranty is separate from the warranty agreement between SMC and SNZ. SNZ has an agreement with each dealer that if the dealer repairs a vehicle covered by the warranty provided by SNZ the dealer will be paid by SNZ at standard rates for the work. The warranty provided by SNZ covers any repairs specified in the agreement which are necessary within a period of three years after the purchase of the Suzuki product. The work is generally done by the same dealer who sold the vehicle to the customer. SNZ contracts with the eventual purchaser of vehicles to provide the retail warranty. The dealers are authorised to offer the warranty to the purchasers. When a customer has a problem with a vehicle, the customer normally returns it to a dealer, who assesses the vehicle to determine whether it is covered by the warranty. If they consider the repairs will cost more than $250, authority from SNZ to begin work is needed. The dealer repairs the vehicle free of charge to the customer. The dealer seeks payment from SNZ, who pays according to their agreement. The dealer accounts for output tax on the payment from SNZ and SNZ claims an input tax credit. SNZ may only then, after the repairs have been completed, approach SMC under the warranty between SMC and SNZ. If SMC is satisfied it is liable, it pays SNZ under the terms of the agreement between them. The dispute is focused on the GST treatment of sums received by SNZ from SMC Japan. No issues arise in respect of the warranty payments from SNZ to dealers. Decision Whether SNZ supplied repair services to SMC Japan On the first issue, concerning whether SNZ made a supply of repair services to SMC, the taxpayer argued the payments were not for repair services and the particular documentation should be interpreted as a mere obligation by SMC to pay compensation for defects. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 8 (August 2000) 25 McGechan J held that on the facts, including the documentation and the established practice, the true position was that payments were not necessarily either payments under the warranty, as the taxpayer contended, nor payments for repair services as the CIR contended, but were a mixture of both. The Court said the supply of repair services was an integral component of the situation which brought about the SMC payments, bringing the supply within the definition of consideration. There was a clear nexus. The payment if not “in respect of” was certainly in “response to” those repair services. Whether repair services zero-rated under s 11(2(c) The second leg of the first issue concerned whether the repair services were zero-rated or standard-rated. Quite simply the Court had no doubt repair services were carried out on cars in New Zealand, so the supply could not be zero-rated. Whether payments by SMC Japan to SNZ were consideration for repairs by SNZ to customers The second issue concerned whether payments by SMC Japan were “consideration” for repairs by SNZ to the customers. The CIR relied on this as an alternative argument, which had already failed before the TRA. McGechan J accepted SNZ did carry out repairs via dealer agents for customers, but noted that was not all SNZ did. It also carried out repairs for SMC under the SMC warranty arrangements. Although SMC would want to see customers satisfied, the Court was unable to accept SMC was paying SNZ to supply repairs. It paid SNZ because that was required under its warranty agreement, not for the repair work itself. It was not “in respect of” or “in response to” or as “an inducement for” the repair work carried out for the customer. Thus the payments by SMC were not in consideration of repair services by SNZ to customers. They were repairs carried out by SNZ for SMC itself.
