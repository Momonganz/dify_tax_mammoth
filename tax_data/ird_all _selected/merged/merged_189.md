To request the redemption of Fly Buys points a person does not have to be a customer of the Bank.

KiwiSaver Act 2006 1. The KiwiSaver regime, which started on 1 July 2007, is a voluntary work-based saving scheme established to facilitate individuals' savings habits, principally through the workplace. Savings are primarily for retirement and are "locked in" until the age of eligibility for New Zealand superannuation (which is currently 65 years old), although exceptions can be made in certain cases, such as financial hardship. 2. As stated in s 3 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006, the purpose of KiwiSaver is to: • encourage long-term savings habits and asset accumulation by individuals who may not otherwise enjoy standards of living in retirement similar to those enjoyed before retirement; and • increase individuals' well-being and financial independence, particularly in retirement, and provide retirement benefits. 3. Inland Revenue administers Parts 1 to 3 and Schedule 3 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue oversees the provisions of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 that Inland Revenue administers. Among other administrative functions, Inland Revenue collects contributions from employers, as part of the PAYE rules, and pays contributions to providers of KiwiSaver schemes. The Bank's KiwiSaver Scheme 4. The Bank operates its own KiwiSaver scheme. 5. The BNZ KiwiSaver Scheme was established by trust deed dated 8 January 2013 (the Trust Deed), and set up as a portfolio investment entity (PIE). The manager/issuer of the BNZ KiwiSaver Scheme is BNZ Investment Services Limited (which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank), with the Bank and its directors being promoters of the BNZ KiwiSaver Scheme. As at the date of this Ruling, the registrar, trustee, investment adviser and accountant of the BNZ KiwiSaver Scheme are Trustees Executors Limited, The New Zealand Guardian Trust Company Limited, Russell Investment Group Limited and MMC Limited respectively. The BNZ KiwiSaver Scheme is registered with the Financial Markets Authority, and is open to customers who are natural persons that join the Scheme by completing the relevant application form. Customers can elect to make their employee and employer contributions to any one of the six funds within the BNZ KiwiSaver Scheme, being: • the Cash Fund (comprising 100% growth assets); • the First Home Buyer Fund (comprising 85% income assets and 15% growth assets); • the Conservative Fund (comprising 80% income assets and 20% growth assets); • the Balanced Fund (comprising 50% income assets and 50% growth assets); • the Moderate Fund (comprising 65% income assets and 35% growth assets); and 3 • the Growth Fund (comprising 30% income assets and 70% growth assets). 6. It is possible that additional funds could be established within the BNZ KiwiSaver Scheme from time to time, pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed. 7. It is anticipated that changes will shortly be made to the Trust Deed in order to ensure compliance with the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013. Among the changes will be the removal of the role of “Promoter” and changes in terminology so that the Trustee is referred to as the “Supervisor” and the Trust Deed becomes known as the “Governing Document”. None of these changes will affect the BNZ KiwiSaver Scheme or the Arrangement. Fly Buys 8. The Fly Buys points programme is New Zealand's largest loyalty programme. Fly Buys is administered by Loyalty NZ, which is owned in equal shares by the Bank, Foodstuffs Ventures (NZ) Limited, IAG New Zealand Limited, and Z Energy Limited. 9. Any person can become a Fly Buys member by completing an appropriate application form. Membership is free. Under the terms and conditions established by Loyalty NZ, Fly Buys points are agreed to have no value and cannot be sold, transferred, or assigned for cash or other consideration. Additionally, Fly Buys points cannot be redeemed for or refunded in cash. Any Fly Buys points that are awarded but unused expire after 36 months. The terms and conditions of the Fly Buys loyalty programme do not prohibit the points being redeemed for any particular reward or class of rewards. Once redeemed, a reward could (as a subsequent and separate transaction) be sold, transferred or assigned for cash or other consideration. 10. Once a person is a Fly Buys member, they collect Fly Buys points (by way of a credit to an account maintained by Loyalty NZ) as a consequence of purchasing goods or services from participating reward partners (Partners). There are currently over 40 Partners. Loyalty NZ and Partners agree on the level of Fly Buys points that may be awarded to Fly Buys members by Loyalty NZ. For example, 1 point may be awarded to a Fly Buys member for every $25 (or some other amount) spent with the Partner. From time to time Loyalty NZ provides Fly Buys members with a points summary statement, which details the opening points balance, credits and debits of points, and the closing points balance. 11. Once sufficient Fly Buys points have been collected the Fly Buys member may redeem the Fly Buys points for specified rewards, being goods and services provided by Partners or other third parties that have entered into an agreement with Loyalty NZ to provide such rewards. The Fly Buys member contacts Loyalty NZ to request a redemption of their Fly Buys points, and Loyalty NZ contacts the relevant Partner or other reward provider to arrange for the reward to be provided to the Fly Buys member. At Loyalty NZ's option, rewards are posted or delivered to the address of the Fly Buys member, or made available for collection at a location notified to the Fly Buys member. 4 Fly Buys and contributions to the BNZ KiwiSaver Scheme 12. The Bank has integrated a Fly Buys feature into the BNZ KiwiSaver Scheme. 13. Under an agreement between the Bank and Loyalty NZ, members in the Fly Buys programme (Fly Buys member) will be able to redeem their Fly Buys points for a contribution to their own, or another person's, member's account in the BNZ KiwiSaver Scheme (BNZ KiwiSaver member). In the case where Fly Buys members redeem their Fly Buys points for a contribution to another person's BNZ KiwiSaver account, the contribution will be a gift from the Fly Buys members to the other persons. 14. In the case of a redemption request for a contribution to a member’s account in the BNZ KiwiSaver Scheme, the Fly Buys member contacts Loyalty NZ and requests the redemption of a specified number of Fly Buys points for a contribution of a specified amount to a nominated BNZ KiwiSaver account. 15. Loyalty NZ then provides details of the BNZ KiwiSaver member that is receiving the contribution reward and the dollar amount of the reward to the Bank. Loyalty NZ pays the money into the BNZ KiwiSaver Scheme subscriptions account (held in the name of the Trustee). In turn, the Trustee applies the contribution to the member's BNZ KiwiSaver account and to the fund they have selected. 16. As a separate and independent obligation, the Bank will make a payment to Loyalty NZ for each contribution made by Loyalty NZ to a member's account with the BNZ KiwiSaver Scheme. The contributions to the BNZ KiwiSaver member’s account arising from the redemption of Fly Buys points are treated no differently to any other employee or employer KiwiSaver contributions. 17. A Bank customer's membership in the Fly Buys programme is contractually separate to their agreement (if any) relating to their investment in the relevant KiwiSaver fund, and each arrangement exists independently of the other. Bank's objectives 18. The Bank's goals and objectives in integrating the Fly Buys feature into the BNZ KiwiSaver Scheme are to: • increase customer benefits, satisfaction and customer retention; • encourage retirement savings by providing an innovative savings solution to its customers; and • improve the Bank's brand awareness among the public, so the Bank is seen as a market leader. 5 How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: a) No income arises under s CA 1(2) for a BNZ KiwiSaver member in relation to the Arrangement. b) No income arises under s CB 4 for a Fly Buys member or for a BNZ KiwiSaver member in relation to the Arrangement. c) No income arises under s CC 3 for a BNZ KiwiSaver member in relation to the Arrangement. d) No income arises under s CE 1 for a BNZ employee in relation to the Arrangement. e) No income arises under s CP 1 for a BNZ KiwiSaver member in relation to the Arrangement. f) Section BG 1 does not apply to the Arrangement. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 1 April 2016 and ending on 31 March 2021. This Ruling is signed by me on the 17th day of May 2016. Howard Davis Director (Taxpayer Rulings)

The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the offering of retail discounts and a points based reward scheme to the three categories of members of a scheme offered by Sovereign Services Limited (Sovereign).

Cash back rewards are between $50 - $100 and gym cash back vouchers are between $25 - $50. The retail discounts are offered to all members irrespective of the number of reward points earned by the member. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. Summary of the Reward Scheme 1. The points based reward scheme is called “Healthy by Sovereign”. It encourages members to become healthier by awarding points for exercising, receiving regular medical check-ups and consuming nutritious food. A member will be ranked as bronze, silver, gold or platinum depending on the number of points that they have accumulated. 2. If the member earns a certain number of points within a twelve month period, they will be rewarded with a cash back reward payment.

Membership 4. Entry into the Healthy by Sovereign scheme is voluntary and is free of charge. 5. There are three categories of membership: • Customer Membership: An individual who is at least 16 years of age and is life assured under a retail health insurance policy or eligible group scheme with Sovereign (includes employees and advisers who have an eligible insurance policy with Sovereign). • Adviser Membership: Third party advisers who have a current agency agreement with Sovereign and are accredited to sell Sovereign health products. For the purposes of this ruling the phrase “Adviser” refers to those Adviser Members who are treated by Sovereign as employees for tax purposes. • Sovereign Employee Membership: A permanent employee of Sovereign. 6. If a person is eligible for more than one membership, they will automatically be added to only one membership category based on the following order of priority: (1) Customer, (2) Adviser, and (3) Sovereign Employee. 7. Membership is only available to individuals. Membership cannot be shared. There is no family, company, trust or joint membership. Partnership Agreements 8. Sovereign has entered into a number of Partnering Agreements with Gym Partners who will provide all Healthy by Sovereign members with an upfront fee discount. Sovereign will not subsidise this discount and it will be fully funded by the Gym Partner. If, however, a member reaches silver, gold or platinum status, Sovereign will issue the member with a gym cash back voucher to redeem at a Gym Partner. In this instance the Gym Partner will invoice Sovereign for reimbursement of the discount provided to the member. 9. Sovereign has entered into agreements with Retail Partners who will provide all members of Healthy by Sovereign with discounted goods and / or services regardless of their level of membership. 10. Sovereign will not reimburse Retail Partners and Gym Partners for the cost of discounts provided to the three categories of members. 3 Reward points and cash back rewards 11. Only Customer Members and Adviser Members are eligible for the cash back reward. Sovereign Employee Members are only eligible for gym cash back vouchers, Gym Partner discounts and Retail Partner discounts. 12. Whenever a member completes a specified healthy activity they will earn reward points. Activities that earn reward points include purchasing fresh meat, fruit and vegetables, completing a gym workout, reaching a certain number of daily steps, and going for annual doctor and dentist check-ups. 13. The number of points earned by a member will determine which of the four membership levels they will be accredited with. The cash back rewards are calculated on the basis of the level that has been achieved as at their membership anniversary date. The cash back reward payment will only be paid to members who reach Silver ($50), Gold ($75) or Platinum ($100) status. The maximum annual cash back reward is capped at $100. 14. The terms and conditions provide that reward points are not transferrable and cannot be redeemed for cash. Gym cash back vouchers and other rewards are non-transferable, not exchangeable for cash, cannot be replaced if expired, can only be redeemed once, and can only be used if the person is a member of Healthy by Sovereign. 15. At each member’s anniversary date, the member’s points will be reset to zero, and the member will be automatically reclassified into the Bronze category. A member’s points cannot be carried over to a subsequent year. 16. The anniversary dates for each membership category are outlined below: • Customer Membership – six weeks before their Sovereign health insurance policy renews. • Adviser Membership – the date that the adviser registered for Healthy by Sovereign. • Employee Membership – the date the employee registered for Healthy by Sovereign. 17. A member can lose the points they have been allocated if they are involved in any dishonest or fraudulent activity with regard to the programme. Termination of Membership or the Scheme 18. A member may terminate their membership at any time. All accumulated points will automatically expire. 19.

PRODUCT RULING – BR Prd 16/06 This is a product ruling made under s 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Smartshares Limited in its capacity as Manager of the NZX Mid Cap Index Fund. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of ss BG 1, CB 4, CD 8, CX 56C, DB 23, and FC 2.

The New Fund was established under and by virtue of a trust deed dated 24 June 2014 and amended and restated on 9 September 2016 (the Master Trust Deed), and an Establishment Deed dated 9 September 2016 executed by the Manager and Public Trust. 8. The manager of the New Fund is Smartshares Limited (the Manager) and the supervisor and trustee of the New Fund is Public Trust. 3 9. The New Fund will elect into the PIE regime and will become a “listed PIE” (as defined in s YA 1). 10. The investment policy of the New Fund is and will be similar in all material respects to that of the Existing Fund. Steps to be undertaken to resettle the Existing Fund 11. The resettlement of the Existing Fund onto the New Fund will be achieved by utilising the resettlement mechanism contained in the Trust Deed. 12. The material provisions in the Trust Deed are as follows: ARTICLE 18 – TERMINATION OF THE FUND 18.1 Termination 18.1.1 The Fund shall terminate if it has not previously terminated on the day that is the first of the following days to occur: (a) the day that is one day less than 80 years from the date of this Deed; (b) the day nominated by Unitholders pursuant to clause 18.2.1; (c) the day appointed by the Manager pursuant to clause 18.2.2; or (d) the day on which the Trustee retires under clause 13.11 if on the date of retirement no successor Trustee has been appointed; (e) within 60 days of Unitholders by Extraordinary Resolution terminating the Manager's authority under clause 15.9. 18.2 Termination by Unitholder or Manager 18.2.1 Unitholders may terminate Fund: Unitholders may resolve by Extraordinary Resolution to terminate the Fund on a date not earlier than two months after the passage of the resolution, but no such resolution to terminate may be made if during a period of 3 months or more prior to the date of the deposit of the requisition: (i) holders of Basket Numbers of Units would have been able, if they so wished, to redeem a Basket or more on at least 20 Business Days during that period, at their Current Unit Value; and (ii) the reported weighted average price for sales of units in parcels of less than a Basket on at least 20 Business Days during that period has been higher than 1% below Current Unit Value at the time of sale. 18.2.2 Manager may terminate Fund: The Manager may terminate the Fund for any reason whatsoever, including (but without limitation) if in the opinion of the Manager the Fund is not sufficiently profitable for the Manager. The date of termination shall be a day appointed by the Manager by giving not less than two months' written notice to the Unitholders and to the Trustee. 18.2.3 No redemption once a termination date is determined: Upon Unitholders pursuant to clause 18.2.1, or the Manager pursuant to clause 18.2.2, determining a date of termination of the Fund the rights of Unitholders with respect to the redemption of Units shall cease. 18.3 Termination Procedure 18.3.1 Distribution of Assets: Upon the Fund being terminated subject to clause 13.13 (successor trustee), the Trustee shall discharge the liabilities and Expenses of the Fund and distribute to each Unitholder that Unitholder's share of the net Assets of the Fund proportionately to the Unitholders in such manner 4 and within such period after the termination of the Fund as the Trustee considers advisable. 18.3.2 Form of distribution: Such distribution may be made in cash or in kind or partly in both, all as the Trustee in its sole discretion may determine. 18.3.3 Certificates and release: Any Certificates shall in the case of the final distribution be surrendered to the Trustee and such final distribution shall only be made against delivery to the Trustee of such form of release as the Trustee shall in its sole discretion require. 18.3.4 Resettlement: If Unitholders resolve by Extraordinary Resolution to resettle all or part of the income or capital of the Fund and the Trustee is satisfied that it is not, nor is it likely to become, materially prejudicial to the interests of Unitholders generally, the Trustee shall, : (a) Compulsory redemption: Require Unitholders to accept repayment in respect of all or any of the Unitholders’ Units for the purposes of the application of the proceeds referred to in clause 18.3.1; or (b) Apply Proceeds toward a New Fund: Apply the proceeds of repayment towards the issue price for Units in an alternative Fund, being a new Fund ("the New Fund") with an investment policy similar in all material respects to those of the Fund (“the Existing Fund"), as if the Unitholder had redeemed units in the Existing Fund and reinvested the proceeds from those units in the New Fund. (c) Transfer of GIF Assets: Sell or otherwise transfer all or any GIF Assets of the Existing Fund to the New Fund. (d) Resettle New Fund: Resettle by irrevocable deed (without infringing the rule against perpetuities) all or part of the income or capital of the Fund on the trusts and with the powers of any New Fund, or other trust approved by the Trustee. (e) Lend to New Fund: Lend any sum to the trustee or trustees of that New Fund, with or without security, at an interest rate (if any) and on such other terms as in each respect the Trustee thinks fit. (f) Assume Liabilities: Assume liabilities of the Existing Fund on behalf of the New Fund. (g) New Manager or Trustee: Arrange any of the foregoing with another manager and/or trustee for the New Fund; (h) Terminate Fund: Terminate the Existing Fund. 13. Other relevant provisions of the Trust Deed are as follows: ARTICLE 1 - INTERPRETATION 1.1 Definitions In this Deed, unless the subject matter or context otherwise requires: ... "Fund" means the NZ Mid Cap Index Fund, a group investment fund constituted under this Deed and as the context requires refers also the Trustee in its capacity as trustee of that group investment fund; ARTICLE 4 – REGISTERS, TRANSFERS, CERTIFICATES ... 4.11 Consolidation and Split of Units 5 4.11.1 Notice: The Manager may at any time, by notice in writing to the Trustee, cause Units in existence on a date specified in that notice to be consolidated or subdivided. Each such notice shall (a) specify the date on which such consolidation or subdivision is to take place (the "Operative Date"); and (b) specify the ratio ("the Ratio") which the number of Units in existence after the consolidation or subdivision will bear to the number of Units in existence before the consolidation or subdivision. 4.11.2 New number of Units: As from the Operative Date, each Unitholder of the Fund shall be deemed to hold a number of Units of the Fund equivalent to the number held by him before the Operative Date multiplied or divided (as the case may be) by the Ratio. For this purpose, at the option of the Manager in each case, fractions may be disregarded or may be rounded upwards or downwards. 4.11.3 Arrangement at Manager's discretion: The Manager shall make such arrangements (if any) as it deems appropriate, following a consolidation or subdivision, for the cancellation of existing Certificates and the issue of new Certificates. ARTICLE 16 - AMENDMENTS 16.1 Amendments to Deed or Issue Terms The Trustee may at any time make any alteration, modification, variation or addition to the Trust Deed or any Issue Term, with the concurrence of the Manager, in any of the following cases: ... 16.1.6 If it is authorised by an Extraordinary Resolution of the Unitholders under Clause 17.10. 14. Prior to the resettlement of the Existing Fund, the Trust Deed will be amended as follows by the Amendment Deed: a) A new definition will be added to clause 1.1 that reads as follows: “Resettlement Fund” means a fund (other than the Fund) established as part of a managed investment scheme (as defined in the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013) in relation to which units are issued that are managed investment products (as defined in the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013) and that, at the date of any resettlement pursuant to Clause 18.3.4, has or will have Smartshares Limited as its manager. b) The second sentence of clause 18.2.2 will be amended to read as follows: The date of termination shall be a day appointed by the Manager by giving not less than: (i) one week’s written notice if all of the income and capital of the Fund is to be resettled in accordance with clause 18.3.4 and an Extraordinary Resolution approving that resettlement has been passed; or (ii) two months’ written notice in all other cases, to the Unitholders and the Trustee. c) Clause 18.3.4(b) will be deleted and the following inserted in its place: (b) Apply Proceeds towards a Resettlement Fund: Apply the proceeds of repayment towards the issue price for units in a Resettlement Fund (“the New Fund”) with an investment policy similar in all material respects to 6 those of the Fund (“The Existing Fund”), as if the Unitholder had redeemed units in the Existing Fund and reinvested the proceeds from those units in the New Fund. 15. Prior to the resettlement, the Manager will provide written notice to the Trustee (in accordance with clause 4.11 of the Trust Deed) requiring that each unit in the Existing Fund is subdivided so as to become two units (the Subdivision). Unitholders will not be given an option whether to receive a bonus issue (being the Subdivision of units) or money or money’s worth (other than money’s worth that is a bonus issue). The Subdivision will occur immediately prior to the Existing Fund being resettled. When it makes the bonus issue (being the subdivision of units), the Manager will resolve: a) that it is a "dividend" for the purposes of the Act; b) the amount to be treated as a dividend (which must be more than zero); and c) that imputation credits are attached at the maximum permitted ratio. 16. The Manager of the Existing Fund will give notice to the Commissioner under s 63 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 of the election to treat the Subdivision as a dividend under s CD 8, and the amount to be treated as a dividend. 17. The effect of the Subdivision and related resolutions summarised above is that the Existing Fund is unlikely to have any imputation credits at the time the resettlement occurs. 18. The following steps will be undertaken to achieve the resettlement of the Existing Fund on the New Fund: a) A notice of meeting will be issued to Unitholders of the Existing Fund in accordance with the requirements of Article 17 of the Trust Deed. The notice of meeting will advise Unitholders of: i) the following proposed amendments to the Trust Deed:  the amendment contained in the Amendment Deed (such amendment allowing the power of resettlement in clause 18.3.4 to be used to resettle the assets of the Existing Fund onto the New Fund notwithstanding that the New Fund is not a group investment fund); and  the amendment of the notice period required for the termination of the Existing Fund by the Manager under clause 18.2.2 from two months to one week; ii) the intention to seek authorisation of the resettlement of the Existing Fund on the New Fund (as required by clause 18.3.4 of the Trust Deed). b) At the meeting, the Manager will give notice of the intended termination of the Existing Fund pursuant to clause 18.2.2 of the Trust Deed. Such notice will be conditional on the Unitholders passing extraordinary resolutions approving: 7 i) the amendments to the Trust Deed referred to in \[18(a)(i)\] above; and ii) the resettlement described in \[18(a)(ii)\] above. c) Formal written notice will be provided in compliance with the provisions of clause 18.2.2 of the Trust Deed (as amended) immediately following the passage of the extraordinary resolutions referred to in \[18(b)\]. d) If the Unitholders approve the amendments to the Trust Deed referred to in \[18(a)(i)\] above, and approve the resettlement described in \[18(a)(ii)\] above, the Trustee will: i) discharge the liabilities and expenses of the Existing Fund (clause 18.3.1); ii) redeem the Unitholders’ units in the Existing Fund (clause 18.3.4(a)); iii) apply the proceeds of redemption to acquire units in the New Fund on behalf of Unitholders (clause 18.3.4(b)); iv) transfer the assets of the Existing Fund to the New Fund (to be held and invested subject to a statement of investment policy and objectives identical in all material respects to the investment policy to which the Existing Fund is subject) (clause 18.3.4(c)); and v) wind up the Existing Fund (clause 18.3.4(h)). 19. Accordingly, the Arrangement will comprise a redemption of Unitholders’ units in the Existing Fund and a resettlement on the New Fund. At conclusion of the resettlement process: a) Unitholders will hold interests in the New Fund of the same value and on substantially similar terms as the interests they held in the Existing Fund; b) the New Fund will hold the same assets as the Existing Fund and will continue to invest on the same basis and in the same manner in which the Existing Fund invested prior to resettlement. 20. To ensure that the resettlement process does not result in the New Fund inadvertently breaching foreign securities laws, the New Fund will not issue units to any Unitholders in the Existing Fund whose address on the register of Unitholders (established and maintained under clause 4.1 of the Trust Deed) is outside New Zealand (Offshore Unitholders). Accordingly the redemption proceeds that Offshore Unitholders receive from the Existing Fund will be cash only and the resettlement process will not result in them becoming unitholders in the New Fund. 21. The trustees of the Existing Fund and the New Fund will enter into a Deed of Resettlement and Related Matters pursuant to which the trustee of the New Fund will undertake to issue units to Unitholders (excluding Offshore Unitholders) in proportion to the units that they each held on resettlement in the Existing Fund and to receive funds which are unallocated at the time of resettlement (if any) 8 and to pay such amounts to the persons lawfully entitled to those funds. This ruling is based on a draft of the Deed of Resettlement and Related Matters provided to the Commissioner on 21 October 2016. 22. The Existing Fund will not at the time of its resettlement onto the New Fund be a party to a “returning share transfer” as that term is defined in the Act. 23. Immediately prior to its resettlement, the assets of the Existing Fund will include cash held in short term interest bearing bank accounts (the Bank Accounts) by the Existing Fund. Such amounts of the Bank Accounts that form part of the net assets of the Existing Fund at the time of redemption will be distributed to Unitholders on redemption of their units under the Arrangement. 24. An amount equal to the interest derived on such accounts is paid by the Existing Fund to the Manager as a management fee. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a) The Existing Fund: • is not a “designated group investment fund” (as defined in s HR 3(6)); • results from investments made into it that are not from a “designated source” (as defined in s HR 3(5)); • does not derive any “category B income” (as defined in s YA 1); and • is a “listed PIE” (as defined in s YA 1). How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any conditions stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: a) Any units received by the Unitholders under the Subdivision will be a “taxable bonus issue” that is a dividend under s CD 8. b) The amount derived by Unitholders of the Existing Fund on redemption of their units in the Existing Fund, and any units received by Unitholders under the Subdivision, are excluded income under s CX 56C(1) if they: i) are resident; and ii) are a natural person or a trustee; and iii) do not include the amount as income in a return of income for the income year. c) If any one or more of the criteria listed in subparagraphs (i) to (iii) above does not apply to the Unitholder, the amount derived by the Unitholder on redemption of their units in the Existing Fund, and any units received by Unitholders under the Subdivision, are excluded income to the extent to which the redemption proceeds is more than the amount that is fully credited as described in s CD 43(26). 9 d) Unitholders (other than Offshore Unitholders or PIEs) will: i) derive income under s CB 4 from the disposal of the redemption proceeds to the New Fund; ii) be entitled to a deduction under s DB 23 (calculated with reference to s FC 2) for an amount at least the same as the amount of any income under s CB 4; and iii) have no overall income tax liability as a result of their disposal of the redemption proceeds to the New Fund. e) Unitholders which are PIEs will derive excluded income under s CX 55 from the disposal of the redemption proceeds to the New Fund to the extent that: i) the redemption proceeds consist of shares issued by a company referred to in s CX 55(3)(a); ii) the Unitholders are not assured under an arrangement with another person of having a gain on the disposal; and iii) the shares are not fixed-rate shares within the meaning of paragraphs (a) to (d) of the definition of “fixed-rate share”. f) To the extent that Unitholders which are PIEs dispose of redemption proceeds that do not satisfy one or more of the criteria listed in subparagraphs (i) to (iii) of paragraph (e), those Unitholders will: i) derive income under section CB 4 from the disposal of the redemption proceeds to the New Fund; ii) be entitled to a deduction under s DB 23 (calculated with reference to s FC 2) for an amount at least the same as the amount of any income under s CB 4; and iii) have no overall income tax liability as a result of their disposal of the redemption proceeds to the New Fund. g) Section BG 1 does not apply to the Arrangement. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 1 April 2016 and ending on 30 September 2017. This Ruling is signed by me on the 25th day of October 2016. Howard Davis Director (Taxpayer Rulings)
PRODUCT RULING – BR Prd 16/07 This is a product ruling made under s 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Smartshares Limited in its capacity as Manager of the NZX 10 Fund. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of ss BG 1, CB 4, CD 8, CX 56C, DB 23, and FC 2. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the resettlement of the NZX 10 Fund (the Existing Fund) onto the NZ Top 10 Fund (the New Fund) by redeeming units held by unitholders (Unitholders) in the Existing Fund, applying the redemption proceeds to acquire units in the New Fund on behalf of Unitholders, and transferring the assets of the Existing Fund to the New Fund. However, the New Fund will not issue units to Unitholders whose address on the register of Unitholders is outside New Zealand (Offshore Unitholders). The redemption proceeds that Offshore Unitholders will receive from the Existing Fund will be cash only and the resettlement process will not result in them becoming unitholders in the New Fund. Prior to the resettlement Unitholder’s units in the Existing Fund will be subdivided and the Manager of the Existing Fund will resolve that the subdivision of units is a dividend that will be fully imputed. The New Fund was established as part of a managed investment scheme as defined in the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 (FMCA) in relation to which units will be issued that are managed investment products (as defined in the FMCA). Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below.

The Existing Fund elected into the portfolio investment entity (PIE) regime and is a “listed PIE” as defined in s YA 1. 4. The Manager of the Existing Fund is Smartshares Limited (the Manager), and the trustee of the Existing Fund is The New Zealand Guardian Trust Company Limited. 5. The Existing Fund invests in financial products listed on the NZX Main Board and is designed to track the S & P / NZX 10 Index. The S & P / NZX 10 Index is made up of ten of the largest financial products listed on the NZX Main Board, but excludes products issued by non-New Zealand issuers. The Existing Fund’s investment objective is to provide a return that closely matches the return on the S & P / NZX 10 Index. The New Fund 6. The New Fund is a fund established as part of a managed investment scheme (as defined in the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013) in relation to which units will be issued that are managed investment products (as defined in the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013). 7. The New Fund was established under and by virtue of a trust deed dated 24 June 2014 and amended and restated on 9 September 2016 (the Master Trust Deed), and an Establishment Deed dated 9 September 2016 executed by the Manager and Public Trust. 8. The manager of the New Fund is Smartshares Limited (the Manager) and the supervisor and trustee of the New Fund is Public Trust. 3 9. The New Fund will elect into the PIE regime and will become a “listed PIE” (as defined in s YA 1). 10. The investment policy of the New Fund is and will be similar in all material respects to that of the Existing Fund. Steps to be undertaken to resettle the Existing Fund 11. The resettlement of the Existing Fund onto the New Fund will be achieved by utilising the resettlement mechanism which will, at the time of resettlement, be contained in the Trust Deed. 12. The material provisions in the Trust Deed are as follows: ARTICLE 20 – TERMINATION OF A FUND 20.1 Termination 20.1.1 Each Fund shall terminate if it has not previously terminated on the day that is the first of the following days to occur: (a) the day that is one day less than 80 years from the date of this Deed; (b) the day appointed by the Manager for that Fund by giving not less than two months' written notice to the Unitholders and to the Trustee; or (c) the day nominated by Unitholders pursuant to clause 20.2.1; (d) the day on which the Fund is terminated pursuant to the terms of this Deed or law; or (e) the day on which the Trustee retires under clause 15.11 if on the date of retirement no successor Trustee has been appointed. 20.2 Termination by Unitholder 20.2.1 Unitholders may resolve by Extraordinary Resolution to terminate the Fund on a date not earlier than two months after the passage of the resolution, but no such resolution to terminate may be made if during a period of 3 months or more prior to the date of the deposit of the requisition: (i) holders of Basket Numbers of Units would have been able, if they so wished, to redeem a Basket or more on at least 20 Business Days during that period, at their Current Unit Value; and (ii) the reported weighted average price for sales of units in parcels of less than a Basket on at least 20 Business Days during that period has been higher than 1% below Current Unit Value at the time of sale. 20.2.2 As and from the date of termination of a Fund so fixed by the Manager the rights of Unitholders with respect to the redemption of Units shall cease. 20.3 Termination Procedure 20.3.1 Upon a Fund being terminated subject to clause 15.14 (successor trustee), the Trustee shall discharge the liabilities and Expenses of that Fund and distribute to each Unitholder that Unitholder's share of the net Assets of the Fund 4 proportionately to the Unitholders in such manner and within such period after the termination of the Fund as the Trustee considers advisable. 20.3.2 Such distribution may be made in cash or in kind or partly in both, all as the Trustee in its sole discretion may determine. 20.3.3 Any Certificates shall in the case of the final distribution be surrendered to the Trustee and such final distribution shall only be made against delivery to the Trustee of such form of release as the Trustee shall in its sole discretion require. 13. Other relevant provisions of the Trust Deed are as follows: ARTICLE 1 - INTERPRETATION 1.1 Definitions In this Deed, unless the subject matter or context otherwise requires, in respect of each Fund: ... "Fund" means a group investment fund governed by this Deed; ARTICLE 4 – REGISTERS, TRANSFERS, CERTIFICATES 4.10 Consolidation and Split of Units 4.10.1 The Manager may at any time, by notice in writing to the Trustee, cause Units in existence at a Record Date specified in that notice to be consolidated or subdivided. Each such noticed shall: (a) specify the date on which such consolidation or subdivision is to take place (the "Operative Date"); and (b) specify the ratio ("the Ratio") which the number of Units in existence after the consolidation or subdivision will bear to the number of Units in existence before the consolidation or subdivision. 4.10.2 As from the Operative Date, each Unitholder of the Fund shall be deemed to hold a number of Units of the Fund equivalent to the number held by him before the Operative Date multiplied or divided (as the case may be) by the Ratio. For this purpose, at the option of the Manager in each case, fractions may be disregarded or may be rounded upwards or downwards. 4.10.3 The Manager shall make such arrangements (if any) as it deems appropriate, following a consolidation or subdivision, for the cancellation of existing Certificates and the issue of new Certificates. ARTICLE 18 - AMENDMENTS 18.1 Amendments to Deed The Trustee may at any time make any alteration, modification, variation or addition to the Trust Deed or any Issue Term, with the concurrence of the Manager, in any of the following cases: ... 18.1.5 If it is authorised by an Extraordinary Resolution of the Unitholders under Clause 19.10 (Effect of a resolution). 14. Prior to the resettlement of the Existing Fund, the Trust Deed will be amended as follows by the Amendment Deed: 5 a) Clause 20.1.1(b) will be amended to read as follows: (b) the day appointed by the Manager for that Fund by giving not less than: (i) one week's written notice if all of the income and capital of the Fund is to be resettled in accordance with clause 20.3.4 and an Extraordinary Resolution approving that resettlement has been passed; or (ii) two months’ written notice in all other cases, to the Unitholders and the Trustee. b) Clause 20.3 will be amended by the insertion of the following: 20.3.4 Resettlement: If Unitholders resolve by Extraordinary Resolution to resettle all or part of the income or capital of the Fund and the Trustee is satisfied that it is not, nor is it likely to become, materially prejudicial to the interests of Unitholders generally, the Trustee shall: (a) Require Unitholders to accept repayment of all or any of the Unitholders' Units for the purposes of the application of the proceeds referred to in clause 20.3.1. (b) Apply the proceeds of repayment towards the issue price for units in a Resettlement Fund (“the New Fund”) with an investment policy similar in all material respects to those of the Fund (“the Existing Fund”), as if the Unitholder had redeemed units in the Existing Fund and reinvested the proceeds from those units in the New Fund. (c) Sell or otherwise transfer all or any GIF Assets of the Existing Fund to the New Fund. (d) Resettle by irrevocable deed (without infringing the rule against perpetuities) all or part of the income or capital of the Fund on the trusts and with the powers of any New Fund, or other trust approved by the Trustee. (e) Lend any sum to the trustee or trustees of that New Fund, with or without security, at an interest rate (if any) and on such other terms as in each respect the Trustee thinks fit. (f) Assume liabilities of the Existing Fund on behalf of the New Fund. (g) Arrange any of the foregoing with another manager and/or trustee for the New Fund. (h) Terminate the Existing Fund. c) A new definition will be added to clause 1.1 that reads as follows: “Resettlement Fund” means a fund (other than the Fund) established as part of a managed investment scheme (as defined in the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013) in relation to which units are issued that are managed investment products (as defined in the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013) and that, at the date of any resettlement pursuant to Clause 20.3.4, has or will have Smartshares Limited as its manager. 15. Prior to the date of resettlement, the Manager will provide written notice to the Trustee (in accordance with clause 4.10 of the Trust Deed) requiring that each unit in the Existing Fund is subdivided so as to become two units (the 6 Subdivision). Unitholders will not be given an option whether to receive a bonus issue (being the Subdivision) or money or money’s worth (other than money’s worth that is a bonus issue). 16. The Subdivision will occur immediately prior to the Existing Fund being resettled. When it makes the Subdivision, the Manager will resolve: a) that it is a "dividend" for purposes of the Act; b) the amount to be treated as a dividend (which must be more than zero); and c) that imputation credits are attached at the maximum permitted ratio. 17. The Manager of the Existing Fund will give notice to the Commissioner under s 63 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 of the election to treat the Subdivision as a dividend under s CD 8, and the amount to be treated as a dividend. 18. The effect of the Subdivision and related resolutions summarised above is that the Existing Fund is unlikely to have any imputation credits at the time the resettlement occurs. 19. The following steps will be undertaken to achieve the resettlement of the Existing Fund on the New Fund: a) A notice of meeting will be issued to Unitholders in the Existing Fund in accordance with the requirements of Article 19 of the Trust Deed. The notice of meeting will advise Unitholders of: i) the following proposed amendments to the Trust Deed:  the amendment contained in the Amendment Deed (such amendment introducing the ability to resettle the assets of the Existing Fund on a New Fund with an investment policy similar in all material respects to that of the Existing Fund); and  the amendment of the notice period required for the termination of the Existing Fund by the Manager under clause 20.1.1(b) from two months to one week; ii) the intention to seek authorisation of the resettlement of the Existing Fund on the New Fund (as required by (new) clause 20.3.4 of the Trust Deed). b) At the meeting, the Manager will give notice of the intended termination of the Existing Fund pursuant to clause 20.2.2 of the Trust Deed. Such notice will be conditional on the Unitholders passing extraordinary resolutions approving: i) the amendments to the Trust Deed referred to in \[19(a)(i)\] above; and ii) the resettlement described in \[19(a)(ii)\] above. 7 c) Formal written notice will be provided in compliance with the provisions of clause 20.2.2 of the Trust Deed (as amended) immediately following the passage of the extraordinary resolutions referred to in \[19(b)\]. d) If the Unitholders approve the amendments to the Trust Deed referred to in \[19(a)(i)\] above, and approve the resettlement described in \[19(a)(ii)\] above, the Trustee will: i) discharge the liabilities and expenses of the Existing Fund (clause 20.3.1); ii) redeem the Unitholders' units in the Existing Fund (clause 20.3.4(a)); iii) apply the proceeds of redemption to acquire units in the New Fund on behalf of the Unitholders (clause 20.3.4(b)); iv) transfer the assets of the Existing Fund to the New Fund (to be held and invested subject to a statement of investment policy and objectives identical in all material respects to the investment policy to which the Existing Fund is subject (clause 20.3.4(c)); and v) wind up the Existing Fund (clause 20.3.4(h)). 20. Accordingly, the Arrangement will comprise a redemption of Unitholders’ units in the Existing Fund and a resettlement on the New Fund. At conclusion of the resettlement process: a) Unitholders will hold interests in the New Fund of the same value and on substantially similar terms as the interests they held in the Existing Fund; b) the New Fund will hold the same assets as the Existing Fund and will continue to invest on the same basis and in the same manner in which the Existing Fund invested prior to resettlement. 21. To ensure that the resettlement process does not result in the New Fund inadvertently breaching foreign securities laws, the New Fund will not issue units to any Unitholders in the Existing Fund whose address on the register of Unitholders (established and maintained under clause 4.1 of the Trust Deed) is outside New Zealand (Offshore Unitholders). Accordingly the redemption proceeds that Offshore Unitholders receive from the Existing Fund will be cash only and the resettlement process will not result in them becoming Unitholders in the New Fund. 22. The trustees of the Existing Fund and the New Fund will enter into a Deed of Resettlement and Related Matters pursuant to which the trustee of the New Fund will undertake to issue units to Unitholders (excluding Offshore Unitholders) in proportion to the units that they each held on resettlement in the Existing Fund and to receive funds which are unallocated at the time of resettlement (if any) and to pay such amounts to the persons lawfully entitled to those funds. This ruling is based on a draft of the Deed of Resettlement and Related Matters provided to the Commissioner on 21 October 2016. 8 23. The Existing Fund will not at the time of its resettlement onto the New Fund be a party to a returning share transfer as defined in s YA 1. 24. Immediately prior to its resettlement, the assets of the Existing Fund will include cash held in short term interest bearing bank accounts (the Bank Accounts) by the Existing Fund. Such amounts of the Bank Accounts that form part of the net assets of the Existing Fund at the time of redemption will be distributed to Unitholders on redemption of their units under the Arrangement. 25. An amount equal to the interest derived on the Bank Accounts is paid by the Existing Fund to the Manager as a management fee. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a) The Existing Fund: • is not a “designated group investment fund” (as defined in s HR 3(6)); • results from investments made into it that are not from a “designated source” (as defined in s HR 3(5)); • does not derive any “category B income” (as defined in s YA 1); and • is a “listed PIE” (as defined in s YA 1). How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any conditions stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: a) Any units received by the Unitholders under the Subdivision will be a “taxable bonus issue” that is a dividend under s CD 8. b) The amount derived by Unitholders of the Existing Fund on redemption of their units in the Existing Fund, and any units received by Unitholders under the Subdivision, are excluded income under s CX 56C(1) if they: i) are resident; and ii) are a natural person or a trustee; and iii) do not include the amount as income in a return of income for the income year. c) If any one or more of the criteria listed in subparagraphs (i) to (iii) above does not apply to the Unitholder, the amount derived by the Unitholder on redemption of their units in the Existing Fund, and any units received by Unitholders under the Subdivision, are excluded income to the extent to which the redemption proceeds is more than the amount that is fully credited as described in s CD 43(26). d) Unitholders (other than Offshore Unitholders or PIEs) will: 9 i) derive income under s CB 4 from the disposal of the redemption proceeds to the New Fund; ii) be entitled to a deduction under s DB 23 (calculated with reference to s FC 2) for an amount at least the same as the amount of any income under s CB 4; and iii) have no overall income tax liability as a result of their disposal of the redemption proceeds to the New Fund. e) Unitholders which are PIEs will derive excluded income under s CX 55 from the disposal of the redemption proceeds to the New Fund to the extent that: i) the redemption proceeds consist of shares issued by a company referred to in s CX 55(3)(a); ii) the Unitholders are not assured under an arrangement with another person of having a gain on the disposal; and iii) the shares are not fixed-rate shares within the meaning of paragraphs (a) to (d) of the definition of “fixed-rate share”. f) To the extent that Unitholders which are PIEs dispose of redemption proceeds that do not satisfy one or more of the criteria listed in subparagraphs (i) to (iii) of paragraph (e), those Unitholders will: i) derive income under section CB 4 from the disposal of the redemption proceeds to the New Fund; ii) be entitled to a deduction under s DB 23 (calculated with reference to s FC 2) for an amount at least the same as the amount of any income under s CB 4; and iii) have no overall income tax liability as a result of their disposal of the redemption proceeds to the New Fund. g) Section BG 1 does not apply to the Arrangement. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 1 April 2016 and ending on 30 September 2017.

PRODUCT RULING – BR Prd 16/08 This is a product ruling made under s 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Smartshares Limited in its capacity as Manager of the NZX Australian 20 Leaders Index Fund. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of ss BG 1, CB 4, CD 8, CX 56C, DB 23, and FC 2. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the resettlement of the NZX Australian 20 Leaders Index Fund (the Existing Fund) onto the Australian Top 20 Fund (the New Fund) by redeeming units held by unitholders (Unitholders) in the Existing Fund, applying the redemption proceeds to acquire units in the New Fund on behalf of Unitholders, and transferring the assets of the Existing Fund to the New Fund. However, the New Fund will not issue units to Unitholders whose address on the register of Unitholders is outside New Zealand (Offshore Unitholders). The redemption proceeds that Offshore Unitholders will receive from the Existing Fund will be cash only and the resettlement process will not result in them becoming unitholders in the New Fund. Prior to the resettlement Unitholder’s units in the Existing Fund will be subdivided and the Manager of the Existing Fund will resolve that the subdivision of units is a dividend that will be fully imputed. The New Fund was established as part of a managed investment scheme as defined in the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 (FMCA) in relation to which units will be issued that are managed investment products (as defined in the FMCA).

The material provisions in the Trust Deed are as follows: ARTICLE 18 – TERMINATION OF A FUND 18.1 Termination 18.1.1 The Fund shall terminate if it has not previously terminated on the day that is the first of the following days to occur: (a) the day that is one day less than 80 years from the date of this Deed; (b) the day appointed by the Manager by giving not less than two months' written notice to the Unitholders and to the Trustee; or (c) the day nominated by Unitholders pursuant to clause 18.2.1; (d) the day on which the Trustee retires under clause 13.11 if on the date of retirement no successor Trustee has been appointed; (e) within 60 days of the Trustee terminating the Manager's authority under clause 15.8. 18.2 Termination by Unitholder 18.2.1 Unitholders may terminate Fund: Unitholders may resolve by Extraordinary Resolution to terminate the Fund on a date not earlier than two months after the passage of the resolution, but no such resolution to terminate may be made if during a period of 3 months or more prior to the date of the deposit of the requisition: (i) holders of Basket Numbers of Units would have been able, if they so wished, to redeem a Basket or more on at least 20 Business Days during that period, at their Current Unit Value; and (ii) the reported weighted average price for sales of units in parcels of less than a Basket on at least 20 Business Days during that period has been higher than 1% below Current Unit Value at the time of sale. 18.2.2 No redemption once a termination date is determined: Upon the Manager determining a date of termination of the Fund the rights of Unitholders with respect to the redemption of Units shall cease. 18.3 Termination Procedure 18.3.1 Distribution of Assets: Upon the Fund being terminated subject to clause 13.13 (successor trustee), the Trustee shall discharge the liabilities and Expenses of the Fund and distribute to each Unitholder that Unitholder's share of the net Assets of the Fund proportionately to the Unitholders in such manner and within such period after the termination of the Fund as the Trustee considers advisable. 18.3.2 Form of distribution: Such distribution may be made in cash or in kind or partly in both, all as the Trustee in its sole discretion may determine. 18.3.3 Certificates and release: Any Certificates shall in the case of the final distribution be surrendered to the Trustee and such final distribution shall only be made against delivery to the Trustee of such form of release as the Trustee shall in its sole discretion require. 18.3.4 Resettlement: If Unitholders resolve by Extraordinary Resolution to resettle all or part of the income or capital of the Fund and the Trustee is satisfied that it is 4 not, nor is it likely to become, materially prejudicial to the interests of Unitholders generally, the Trustee shall, : (a) Compulsory redemption: Require Unitholders to accept repayment in respect of all or any of the Unitholders' Units for the purposes of the application of the proceeds referred to in clause 18.3.1; or (b) Apply Proceeds toward a New Fund: Apply the proceeds of repayment towards the issue price for Units in an alternative Fund, being a new Fund ("the New Fund") with an investment policy similar in all material respects to those of the Fund (“the Existing Fund"), as if the Unitholder had redeemed units in the Existing Fund and reinvested the proceeds from those units in the New Fund. (c) Transfer of GIF Assets: Sell or otherwise transfer all or any GIF Assets of the Existing Fund to the New Fund. (d) Resettle New Fund: Resettle by irrevocable deed (without infringing the rule against perpetuities) all or part of the income or capital of the Fund on the trusts and with the powers of any New Fund, or other trust approved by the Trustee.

"Fund" means the group investment fund constituted under this Deed; ARTICLE 4 – REGISTERS, TRANSFERS, CERTIFICATES 4.11 Consolidation and Split of Units 4.11.1 Notice: The Manager may at any time, by notice in writing to the Trustee, cause Units in existence on a date specified in that notice to be consolidated or subdivided. Each such notice shall: (a) specify the date on which such consolidation or subdivision is to take place (the "Operative Date"); and (b) specify the ratio ("the Ratio") which the number of Units in existence after the consolidation or subdivision will bear to the number of Units in existence before the consolidation or subdivision. 4.11.2 New number of Units: As from the Operative Date, each Unitholder of the Fund shall be deemed to hold a number of Units of the Fund equivalent to the number held by him before the Operative Date multiplied or divided (as the case may be) by the Ratio. For this purpose, at the option of the Manager in each case, fractions may be disregarded or may be rounded upwards or downwards. 5 4.11.3 Arrangement at Manager's discretion: The Manager shall make such arrangements (if any) as it deems appropriate, following a consolidation or subdivision, for the cancellation of existing Certificates and the issue of new Certificates. ARTICLE 17 – MEETINGS 17.10 Resolution binding on all: Except as provided for in clauses 17.10.2, 17.10.3, 18.2.1 (Unitholder's may terminate Fund) and 18.3.4 (Resettlement) a resolution passed at a meeting of Unitholders duly convened and held in accordance with this Article 17 shall be binding upon all Unitholders whether present or not present at the meeting, and the Manager and the Trustee shall be bound to give effect thereto accordingly and the passing of any such resolution shall as between the Trustee, the Manager and the Unitholders be conclusive evidence that the circumstances justify the passing thereof the intention being that it shall rest with the meeting to determine without appeal whether or not the circumstances justify the passing of such resolution. 17.10.2 Resolution amending this Deed: Other than as provided for in Article 16 (Amendments) only an Extraordinary Resolution can amend, alter, modify, vary or add to this Deed. 14. Prior to the resettlement of the Existing Fund, the Trust Deed will be amended by the Amendment Deed as follows: a) A new definition will be added to clause 1.1 that reads as follows: “Resettlement Fund” means a fund (other than the Fund) established as part of a managed investment scheme (as defined in the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013) in relation to which units are issued that are managed investment products (as defined in the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013) and that, at the date of any resettlement pursuant to clause 18.3.4, has or will have Smartshares Limited as its manager. b) Clause 18.1.1(b) will be amended to read as follows: the day appointed by the Manager by giving not less than: i) one week’s written notice if all of the income and capital of the Fund is to be resettled in accordance with clause 18.3.4 and an Extraordinary Resolution approving that resettlement has been passed; or ii) two months’ written notice in all other cases, to the Unitholders and the Trustee. c) Clause 18.3.4(b) will be deleted and the following inserted in its place: (b) Apply Proceeds towards a Resettlement Fund: Apply the proceeds of repayment towards the issue price for units in a Resettlement Fund (“the New Fund”) with an investment policy similar in all material respects to those of the Fund (“the Existing Fund”), as if the Unitholder had redeemed units in the Existing Fund and reinvested the proceeds from those units in the New Fund. 15. Prior to the date of resettlement, the Manager will provide written notice to the Trustee (in accordance with clause 4.11 of the Trust Deed) requiring that each unit in the Existing Fund is subdivided so as to become two units (the Subdivision). Unitholders will not be given an option whether to receive a bonus 6 issue (being the Subdivision) or money or money’s worth (other than money’s worth that is a bonus issue). 16. The Subdivision will occur immediately prior to the Existing Fund being resettled. When it makes the Subdivision, the Manager will resolve: a) that it is a "dividend" for purposes of the Act; b) the amount to be treated as a dividend (which must be more than zero); and c) that imputation credits are attached at the maximum permitted ratio. 17. The Manager of the Existing Fund will give notice to the Commissioner under s 63 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 of the election to treat the Subdivision as a dividend under s CD 8, and the amount to be treated as a dividend. 18. The effect of the Subdivision and related resolutions summarised above is that the Existing Fund is unlikely to have any imputation credits at the time the resettlement occurs. 19. The following steps will be undertaken to achieve the resettlement of the Existing Fund on the New Fund: a) A notice of meeting will be issued to Unitholders in the Existing Fund in accordance with the requirements of Article 19 of the Trust Deed. The notice of meeting will advise Unitholders of: i) the following proposed amendments to the Trust Deed:  the amendment contained in the Amendment Deed (such amendment allowing the power of resettlement in clause 18.3.4 to be used to resettle the assets of the Existing Fund onto the New Fund notwithstanding that the New Fund is not a group investment fund); and  the amendment of the notice period required for the termination of the Existing Fund by the Manager under clause 18.1.1(b) from two months to one week; ii) the intention to seek authorisation of the resettlement of the Existing Fund on the New Fund (as required by clause 18.3.4 of the Trust Deed). b) At the meeting, the Manager will give notice of the intended termination of the Existing Fund pursuant to clause 18.1.1(b) of the Trust Deed. Such notice will be conditional on the Unitholders passing extraordinary resolutions approving: i) the amendments to the Trust Deed referred to in \[19(a)(i)\] above; and ii) the resettlement described in \[19(a)(ii)\] above. 7 c) Formal written notice will be provided in compliance with the provisions of clause 18.1.1(b) of the Trust Deed (as amended) immediately following the passage of the extraordinary resolutions referred to in \[19(b)\] above. d) If the Unitholders approve the amendments to the Trust Deed referred to in \[19(a)(i)\] above, and approve the resettlement described in \[19(a)(ii)\] above, the Trustee will: i) discharge the liabilities and expenses of the Existing Fund (clause 18.3.1); ii) redeem the Unitholders' units in the Existing Fund (clause 18.3.4(a)); iii) apply the proceeds of redemption towards the issue price of units in the New Fund on behalf of the Unitholders (clause 18.3.4(b)); iv) transfer the assets of the Existing Fund to the New Fund (to be held and invested subject to a statement of investment policy and objectives identical in all material respects to the investment policy to which the Existing Fund is subject) (clause 18.3.4(c)); and v) wind up the Existing Fund (clause 18.3.4(h)). 20. Accordingly, the Arrangement will comprise a redemption of Unitholders’ interests in the Existing Fund and a resettlement on the New Fund. At conclusion of the resettlement process: a) Unitholders will hold interests in the New Fund of the same value and on substantially similar terms as the interests they held in the Existing Fund; b) the New Fund will hold the same assets as the Existing Fund and will continue to invest on the same basis and in the same manner in which the Existing Fund invested prior to resettlement. 21. To ensure that the resettlement process does not result in the New Fund inadvertently breaching foreign securities laws, the New Fund will not issue units to any Unitholders in the Existing Fund whose address on the register of Unitholders (established and maintained under clause 4.1 of the Trust Deed) is outside New Zealand (Offshore Unitholders). Accordingly the redemption proceeds that Offshore Unitholders receive from the Existing Fund will be cash only and the resettlement process will not result in them becoming Unitholders in the New Fund. 22. The trustees of the Existing Fund and the New Fund will enter into a Deed of Resettlement and Related Matters pursuant to which the trustee of the New Fund will undertake to issue units to Unitholders (excluding Offshore Unitholders) in proportion to the units that they each held on resettlement in the Existing Fund and to receive funds which are unallocated at the time of resettlement (if any) and to pay such amounts to the persons lawfully entitled to those funds. This ruling is based on a draft of the Deed of Resettlement and Related Matters provided to the Commissioner on 21 October 2016. 8 23. The Existing Fund will not at the time of its resettlement onto the New Fund be a party to a "returning share transfer" as defined in s YA 1. 24. Immediately prior to its resettlement, the assets of the Existing Fund will include cash held in short term interest bearing bank accounts (the Bank Accounts) by the Existing Fund. Such amounts of the Bank Accounts that form part of the net assets of the Existing Fund at the time of redemption will be distributed to Unitholders on redemption of their units under the Arrangement. 25. An amount equal to the interest derived on the Bank Accounts is paid by the Existing Fund to the Manager as a management fee. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a) The Existing Fund: • is not a “designated group investment fund” (as defined in s HR 3(6)); • results from investments made into it that are not from a “designated source” (as defined in s HR 3(5)); • does not derive any “category B income” (as defined in s YA 1); and • is a “listed PIE” (as defined in s YA 1). How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: a) Any units received by the Unitholders under the Subdivision will be a “taxable bonus issue” that is a dividend under s CD 8. b) The amount derived by Unitholders of the Existing Fund on redemption of their units in the Existing Fund, and any units received by Unitholders under the Subdivision, are excluded income under s CX 56C(1) if they: i) are resident; and ii) are a natural person or a trustee; and iii) do not include the amount as income in a return of income for the income year. c) If any one or more of the criteria listed in subparagraphs (i) to (iii) above does not apply to the Unitholder, the amount derived by the Unitholder on redemption of their units in the Existing Fund, and any units received by Unitholders under the Subdivision, are excluded income to the extent to which the redemption proceeds is more than the amount that is fully credited as described in s CD 43(26). d) Unitholders (other than Offshore Unitholders or PIEs) will: 9 i) derive income under s CB 4 from the disposal of the redemption proceeds to the New Fund; ii) be entitled to a deduction under s DB 23 (calculated with reference to s FC 2) for an amount at least the same as the amount of any income under s CB 4; and iii) have no overall income tax liability as a result of their disposal of the redemption proceeds to the New Fund. e) Unitholders which are PIEs will derive excluded income under s CX 55 from the disposal of the redemption proceeds to the New Fund to the extent that: i) the redemption proceeds consist of shares issued by a company referred to in s CX 55(3)(b); ii) the Unitholders are not assured under an arrangement with another person of having a gain on the disposal; and iii) the shares are not fixed-rate shares within the meaning of paragraphs (a) to (d) of the definition of “fixed-rate share”. f) To the extent that Unitholders which are PIEs dispose of redemption proceeds that do not satisfy one or more of the criteria listed in subparagraphs (i) to (iii) of paragraph (e), those Unitholders will: i) derive income under section CB 4 from the disposal of the redemption proceeds to the New Fund; ii) be entitled to a deduction under s DB 23 (calculated with reference to s FC 2) for an amount at least the same as the amount of any income under s CB 4; and iii) have no overall income tax liability as a result of their disposal of the redemption proceeds to the New Fund. g) Section BG 1 does not apply to the Arrangement. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 1 April 2016 and ending on 30 September 2017. This Ruling is signed by me on the 25 th day of October 2016. Howard Davis Director (Taxpayer Rulings)

The material provisions in the Trust Deed are as follows: ARTICLE 19 – TERMINATION OF THE FUND 19.1 Termination (a) The Fund shall terminate if it has not previously terminated on the day that is the first of the following days to occur: (i) the day that is one day less than 80 years from the date of this Deed; (ii) the day nominated by Unitholders pursuant to clause 19.2(a) (Unitholders may terminate Fund); (iii) the day appointed by the Manager pursuant to clause 19.2(b) (Manager may terminate Fund); or (iv) the day on which the Trustee retires under clause 14.9 (Retirement of Trustee) or clause 14.10 (Trustee's retirement of Manager's request) if on the date of retirement no successor Trustee has been appointed; and (v) if NZX Funds Management Limited (or any related company of that company as defined in section 2(3) of the Companies Act 1993) is the manager of the Fund, within 60 days of Unitholders by Extraordinary Resolution terminating the Manager's authority under clause 16.9 (Removal of Manager by Extraordinary Resolution of Unitholders). 19.2 Termination by Unitholder or Manager (a) Unitholders may terminate Fund: Unitholders may resolve by Extraordinary Resolution to terminate the Fund on a date not earlier than two months after the passage of the resolution, but no such resolution to terminate may be made if during a period of 3 months or more prior to the date of the deposit of the requisition of the meeting setting out the terms of such Extraordinary Resolution: (i) holders of Basket Numbers of Units would have been able, if they so wished, to redeem a Basket or more on at least 20 Business Days during that period, at their Current Unit Value; and (ii) the reported weighted average price for sales of Units in parcels of less than a Basket on at least 20 Business Days during that period has been higher than 1% below Current Unit Value at the time of sale. (b) Manager may terminate Fund: The Manager may terminate the Fund for any reason whatsoever, including (but without limitation) if in the opinion of the Manager the Fund is not sufficiently profitable for the Manager. The date of termination shall be a day appointed by the Manager by giving not less than two months' written notice to the Unitholders and to the Trustee. (c) No redemption once a termination date is determined: Upon Unitholders pursuant to clause 19.2(a) (Unitholders may terminate Fund), or the Manager pursuant to clause 19.2(b) (Manager may terminate Fund) determining a date of termination of the Fund the rights of Unitholders with respect to the redemption of Units shall cease. 4 19.3 Termination Procedure (a) Distribution of Assets: Upon the Fund being terminated subject to clause 14.12 (Successor Trustee), the Trustee shall discharge the liabilities and Expenses of the Fund (and the provisions of Article 12 (Custodial arrangement for Securities), to the extent, if any, they prohibit the payment of Expenses out of the Fund, shall cease to apply) and distribute to each Unitholder that Unitholder's Share of the net Assets of the Fund proportionately to the Unitholders in such manner and within such period after the termination of the Fund as the Trustee considers advisable. (b) Form of distribution: Such distribution may be made in cash or in kind or partly in both, all as the Trustee in its sole discretion may determine. (c) Certificates and release: Any Certificates shall in the case of the final distribution be surrendered to the Trustee and such final distribution shall only be made against delivery to the Trustee of such form of release as the Trustee shall in its sole discretion require. (d) Resettlement: If Unitholders resolve by Extraordinary Resolution to resettle all or part of the income or capital of the Fund and the Trustee is satisfied that it is not, nor is it likely to become, materially prejudicial to the interests of Unitholders generally, the Trustee shall: (i) Compulsory redemption: Require Unitholders to accept repayment in respect of all or any of the Unitholder's Units for the purposes of the application of the proceeds referred to in clause 19.3(a) (Distribution of Assets); or (ii) Apply Proceeds toward a New Fund: Apply the proceeds of repayment towards the issue price for Units in an alternative Fund, being a new fund (the New Fund) with an investment policy similar in all material respects to those of the Fund (the Existing Fund), as if the Unitholder had redeemed units in the Existing Fund and reinvested the proceeds from those units in the New Fund; (iii) Transfer of GIF Assets: Sell or otherwise transfer all or any GIF Assets of the Existing Fund to the New Fund; (iv) Resettle New Fund: Resettle by irrevocable deed (without infringing the rule against perpetuities) all or part of the income or capital of the Fund on the trusts and with the powers of any New Fund, or other trust approved by the Trustee; (v) Lend to New Fund: Lend any sum to the trustee or trustees of that New Fund, with or without security, at an interest rate (if any) and on such other terms as in each respect the Trustee thinks fit; (vi) Assume Liabilities: Assume liabilities of the Existing Fund on behalf of the New Fund; (vii) New Manager or Trustee: Arrange any of the foregoing with another manager and/or trustee for the New Fund; (viii) Terminate Fund: Terminate the Existing Fund. 13. Other relevant provisions of the Trust Deed are as follows: ARTICLE 1 - INTERPRETATION 1.1 Definitions 5 In this Deed, unless the subject matter or context otherwise requires: ... Fund means The NZX 50 Portfolio Index Fund, which is a group investment fund (GIF) governed by this Deed and as the context requires refers also to the Trustee in its capacity as trustee of that group investment fund; ARTICLE 4 – REGISTERS, TRANSFERS, CERTIFICATES 4.11 Consolidation and split of Units (a) Notice: The manager may at any time, by notice in writing to the Trustee, cause Units in existence on a date specified in that notice to be consolidated or subdivided. Each such notice shall: (i) specify the date on which such consolidation or subdivision is to take place (the "Operative Date"); and (ii) specify the ratio (the "Ratio") which the number of Units in existence after the consolidation or subdivision will bear to the number of Units in existence before the consolidation or subdivision. (b) New number of Units: As from the Operative Date, each Unitholder of the Fund shall be deemed to hold a number of Units of the Fund equivalent to the number held by him before the Operative Date multiplied or divided (as the case may be) by the Ratio. For this purpose, at the option of the Manager in each case, fractions may be disregarded or may be rounded upwards or downwards. (c) Arrangement at Manager's discretion: The Manager shall make such arrangements (if any) as it deems appropriate, following a consolidation or subdivision, for the cancellation of existing Certificates and the Issue of new Certificates, if Certificates are required by law. ARTICLE 17 - AMENDMENTS 17.1 Amendments to Deed or Issue Terms The Trustee may at any time make any alteration, modification, variation or addition to the Trust Deed or any Issue Term (excluding any applicable Rule), with the concurrence of the Manager, in any of the following cases: ... (f) If it is authorised by an Extraordinary Resolution of the Unitholders under Clause 18.10 (Effect of a resolution). 14. Prior to the resettlement of the Existing Fund, the Trust Deed will be amended by the Amendment Deed as follows: a) A new definition will be added to clause 1.1 that reads as follows: “Resettlement Fund” means a fund (other than the Fund) established as part of a managed investment scheme (as defined in the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013) in relation to which units are issued that are managed investment products (as defined in the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013) and that, at the date of any resettlement pursuant to Clause 19.3(d), has or will have Smartshares Limited as its manager. 6 b) The second sentence of clause 19.2(b) will be amended to read as follows: The date of termination shall be a day appointed by the Manager by giving not less than: (i) one week’s written notice if all of the income and capital of the Fund is to be resettled in accordance with clause 19.3(d) and an Extraordinary Resolution approving that resettlement has been passed; or (ii) two months’ written notice in all other cases, to the Unitholders and the Trustee. c) Clause 19.3(d)(ii) will be deleted and the following inserted in its place: (ii) Apply Proceeds towards a Resettlement Fund: Apply the proceeds of repayment towards the issue price for units in a Resettlement Fund (the New Fund) with an investment policy similar in all material respects to those of the Fund (the Existing Fund), as if the Unitholder had redeemed units in the Existing Fund and reinvested the proceeds from those units in the New Fund. 15. Prior to the date of resettlement, the Manager will provide written notice to the Trustee (in accordance with clause 4.11 of the Trust Deed) requiring that each unit in the Existing Fund is subdivided so as to become two units (the Subdivision). Unitholders will not be given an option whether to receive a bonus issue (being the Subdivision) or money or money’s worth (other than money’s worth that is a bonus issue). 16. The Subdivision will occur immediately prior to the Existing Fund being resettled. When it makes the Subdivision, the Manager will resolve: a) that it is a "dividend" for purposes of the Act; b) the amount to be treated as a dividend (which must be more than zero); and c) that imputation credits are attached at the maximum permitted ratio. 17. The Manager of the Existing Fund will give notice to the Commissioner under s 63 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 of the election to treat the Subdivision as a dividend under s CD 8, and the amount to be treated as a dividend. 18. The effect of the Subdivision and related resolutions summarised above is that the Existing Fund is unlikely to have any imputation credits at the time the resettlement occurs. 19. The following steps will be undertaken to achieve the resettlement of the Existing Fund on the New Fund: a) A notice of meeting will be issued to Unitholders in the Existing Fund in accordance with the requirements of Article 18 of the Trust Deed. The notice of meeting will advise Unitholders of: i) the following proposed amendments to the Trust Deed:  the amendment contained in the Amendment Deed (such amendment allowing the power of resettlement in clause 7 19.3(d) to be used to resettle the assets of the Existing Fund onto the New Fund notwithstanding that the New Fund is not a group investment fund); and  the amendment of the notice period required for the termination of the Existing Fund by the Manager under clause 19.2(b) from two months to one week; ii) the intention to seek authorisation of the resettlement of the Existing Fund on the New Fund (as required by clause 19.3(d) of the Trust Deed). b) At the meeting, the Manager will give notice of the intended termination of the Existing Fund pursuant to clause 19.2(b) of the Trust Deed. Such notice will be conditional on the Unitholders passing extraordinary resolutions approving: i) the amendments to the Trust Deed referred to in \[19(a)(i)\] above; and ii) the resettlement described in \[19(a)(ii)\] above. c) Formal written notice will be provided in compliance with the provisions of clause 19.2(b) of the Trust Deed (as amended) immediately following the passage of the extraordinary resolutions referred to in \[19(b)\] above. d) If the Unitholders approve the amendments to the Trust Deed referred to in \[19(a)(i) above, and approve the resettlement described in \[19(a)(ii)\] above, the Trustee will: i) discharge the liabilities and expenses of the Existing Fund (clause 19.3(a)) ii) redeem the Unitholders' units in the Existing Fund (clause 19.3(d)(i)); iii) apply the proceeds of redemption towards the issue price of units in the New Fund on behalf of the Unitholders (clause 19.3(d)(ii)); iv) transfer the assets of the Existing Fund to the New Fund (to be held and invested subject to a statement of investment policy and objectives identical in all material respects to the investment policy to which the Existing Fund is subject) (clause 19.3(d)(iii)); and v) wind up the Existing Fund (clause 19.3(d)(viii)). 20. Accordingly, the Arrangement will comprise a redemption of Unitholders’ interests in the Existing Fund and a resettlement on the New Fund. At conclusion of the resettlement process: a) Unitholders will hold interests in the New Fund of the same value and on substantially similar terms as the interests they held in the Existing Fund; 8 b) the New Fund will hold the same assets as the Existing Fund and will continue to invest on the same basis and in the same manner in which the Existing Fund invested prior to resettlement. 21. To ensure that the resettlement process does not result in the New Fund inadvertently breaching foreign securities laws, the New Fund will not issue units to any Unitholders in the Existing Fund whose address on the register of Unitholders (established and maintained under clause 4.1 of the Trust Deed) is outside New Zealand (Offshore Unitholders). Accordingly the redemption proceeds that Offshore Unitholders receive from the Existing Fund will be cash only and the resettlement process will not result in them becoming Unitholders in the New Fund. 22. The trustees of the Existing Fund and the New Fund will enter into a Deed of Resettlement and Related Matters pursuant to which the trustee of the New Fund will undertake to issue units to Unitholders (excluding Offshore Unitholders) in proportion to the units that they each held on resettlement in the Existing Fund and to receive funds which are unallocated at the time of resettlement (if any) and to pay such amounts to the persons lawfully entitled to those funds. This ruling is based on a draft of the Deed of Resettlement and Related Matters provided to the Commissioner on 21 October 2016. 23. The Existing Fund will not at the time of its resettlement onto the New Fund be a party to a "returning share transfer" as defined in s YA 1. 24. Immediately prior to its resettlement, the assets of the Existing Fund will include cash held in short term interest bearing bank accounts (the Bank Accounts) by the Existing Fund. Such amounts of the Bank Accounts that form part of the net assets of the Existing Fund at the time of redemption will be distributed to Unitholders on redemption of their units under the Arrangement. 25. An amount equal to the interest derived on the Bank Accounts is paid by the Existing Fund to the Manager as a management fee. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a) The Existing Fund: • is not a “designated group investment fund” (as defined in s HR 3(6)); • results from investments made into it that are not from a “designated source” (as defined in s HR 3(5)); • does not derive any “category B income” (as defined in s YA 1); and • is a “listed PIE” (as defined in s YA 1). 9 How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any conditions stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: a) Any units received by the Unitholders under the Subdivision will be a “taxable bonus issue” that is a dividend under s CD 8. b) The amount derived by Unitholders of the Existing Fund on redemption of their units in the Existing Fund, and any units received by Unitholders under the Subdivision, are excluded income under s CX 56C(1) if they: i) are resident; and ii) are a natural person or a trustee; and iii) do not include the amount as income in a return of income for the income year. c) If any one or more of the criteria listed in subparagraphs (i) to (iii) above does not apply to the Unitholder, the amount derived by the Unitholder on redemption of their units in the Existing Fund, and any units received by Unitholders under the Subdivision, are excluded income to the extent to which the redemption proceeds is more than the amount that is fully credited as described in s CD 43(26). d) Unitholders (other than Offshore Unitholders or PIEs) will: i) derive income under s CB 4 from the disposal of the redemption proceeds to the New Fund; ii) be entitled to a deduction under s DB 23 (calculated with reference to s FC 2) for an amount at least the same as the amount of any income under s CB 4; and iii) have no overall income tax liability as a result of their disposal of the redemption proceeds to the New Fund. e) Unitholders which are PIEs will derive excluded income under s CX 55 from the disposal of the redemption proceeds to the New Fund to the extent that: i) the redemption proceeds consist of shares issued by a company referred to in s CX 55(3)(a); ii) the Unitholders are not assured under an arrangement with another person of having a gain on the disposal; and iii) the shares are not fixed-rate shares within the meaning of paragraphs (a) to (d) of the definition of “fixed-rate share”. f) To the extent that Unitholders which are PIEs dispose of redemption proceeds that do not satisfy one or more of the criteria listed in subparagraphs (i) to (iii) of paragraph (e), those Unitholders will: i) derive income under section CB 4 from the disposal of the redemption proceeds to the New Fund; ii) be entitled to a deduction under s DB 23 (calculated with reference to s FC 2) for an amount at least the same as the amount of any income under s CB 4; and 10 iii) have no overall income tax liability as a result of their disposal of the redemption proceeds to the New Fund. g) Section BG 1 does not apply to the Arrangement. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 1 April 2016 and ending on 30 September 2017. This Ruling is signed by me on the 25 th day of October 2016. Howard Davis Director (Taxpayer Rulings)
PRODUCT RULING – BR Prd 16/10 This is a product ruling made under s 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Smartshares Limited in its capacity as Manager of NZX Australian Mid Cap Index Fund. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of ss BG 1, CB 4, CD 8, CX 56C, DB 23, and FC 2. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the resettlement of the NZX Australian Mid Cap Index Fund (the Existing Fund) onto the Australian Mid Cap Fund (the New Fund) by redeeming units held by unitholders (Unitholders) in the Existing Fund, applying the redemption proceeds to acquire units in the New Fund on behalf of Unitholders, and transferring the assets of the Existing Fund to the New Fund. However, the New Fund will not issue units to Unitholders whose address on the register of Unitholders is outside New Zealand (Offshore Unitholders). The redemption proceeds that Offshore Unitholders will receive from the Existing Fund will be cash only and the resettlement process will not result in them becoming unitholders in the New Fund. Prior to the resettlement Unitholder’s units in the Existing Fund will be subdivided and the Manager of the Existing Fund will resolve that the subdivision of units is a dividend that will be fully imputed. The New Fund will be established as part of a managed investment scheme as defined in the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 (FMCA) in relation to which units are issued that are managed investment products (as defined in the FMCA). Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below.

Prior to the resettlement of the Existing Fund, the Trust Deed will be amended by the Amendment Deed as follows: a) A new definition will be added to clause 1.1 that reads as follows: “Resettlement Fund” means a fund (other than the Fund) established as part of a managed investment scheme (as defined in the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013) in relation to which units are issued that are managed investment products (as defined in the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013) and that, at the date of any resettlement pursuant to clause 18.3(d), has or will have Smartshares Limited as its manager. b) The second sentence of clause 18.2(b) will be amended to read as follows: The date of termination shall be a day appointed by the Manager by giving not less than: 6 (i) one week’s written notice if all of the income and capital of the Fund is to be resettled in accordance with clause 18.3(d) and an Extraordinary Resolution approving that resettlement has been passed; or (ii) two months’ written notice in all other cases, to the Unitholders and the Trustee. c) Clause 18.3(d)(ii) will be deleted and the following inserted in its place: (ii) Apply Proceeds towards a Resettlement Fund: Apply the proceeds of repayment towards the issue price for units in a Resettlement Fund (the New Fund) with an investment policy similar in all material respects to those of the Fund (the Existing Fund), as if the Unitholder had redeemed units in the Existing Fund and reinvested the proceeds from those units in the New Fund. 15.

Such notice will be conditional on the Unitholders passing extraordinary resolutions approving: i) the amendments to the Trust Deed referred to in \[19(a)(i)\] above; and ii) the resettlement described in \[19(a)(ii)\] above. c) Formal written notice will be provided in compliance with the provisions of clause 18.2(b) of the Trust Deed (as amended) immediately following the passage of the extraordinary resolutions referred to in \[19(b)\] above. d) If the Unitholders approve the amendments to the Trust Deed referred to in \[19(a)(i)\] above, and approve the resettlement described in \[19(a)(ii)\] above, the Trustee will: i) discharge the liabilities and expenses of the Existing Fund (clause 18.3(a)); ii) redeem the Unitholders' units in the Existing Fund (clause 18.3(d)(i)); iii) apply the proceeds of redemption towards the issue price of units in the New Fund on behalf of the Unitholders (clause 18.3(d)(ii); iv) transfer the assets of the Existing Fund to the New Fund (to be held and invested subject to a statement of investment policy and objectives identical in all material respects to the investment policy to which the Existing Fund is subject) (clause 18.3(d)(iii)); and v) wind up the Existing Fund (clause 18.3(d)(viii)). 20. Accordingly, the Arrangement will comprise a redemption of Unitholders’ interests in the Existing Fund and a resettlement on the New Fund. At conclusion of the resettlement process: a) Unitholders will hold interests in the New Fund of the same value and on substantially similar terms as the interests they held in the Existing Fund; b) the New Fund will hold the same assets as the Existing Fund and will continue to invest on the same basis and in the same manner in which the Existing Fund invested prior to resettlement. 8 21. To ensure that the resettlement process does not result in the New Fund inadvertently breaching foreign securities laws, the New Fund will not issue units to any Unitholders in the Existing Fund whose address on the register of Unitholders (established and maintained under clause 4.1 of the Trust Deed) is outside New Zealand (Offshore Unitholders). Accordingly the redemption proceeds that Offshore Unitholders receive from the Existing Fund will be cash only and the resettlement process will not result in them becoming Unitholders in the New Fund. 22. The trustees of the Existing Fund and the New Fund will enter into a Deed of Resettlement and Related Matters pursuant to which the trustee of the New Fund will undertake to issue units to Unitholders (excluding Offshore Unitholders) in proportion to the units that they each held on resettlement in the Existing Fund and to receive funds which are unallocated at the time of resettlement (if any) and to pay such amounts to the persons lawfully entitled to those funds. This ruling is based on a draft of the Deed of Resettlement and Related Matters provided to the Commissioner on 21 October 2016. 23. The Existing Fund will not at the time of its resettlement onto the New Fund be a party to a "returning share transfer" as defined in s YA 1. 24. Immediately prior to its resettlement, the assets of the Existing Fund will include cash held in short term interest bearing bank accounts (the Bank Accounts) by the Existing Fund. Such amounts of the Bank Accounts that form part of the net assets of the Existing Fund at the time of redemption will be distributed to Unitholders on redemption of their units under the Arrangement. 25. An amount equal to the interest derived on the Bank Accounts is paid by the Existing Fund to the Manager as a management fee. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a) The Existing Fund: • is not a “designated group investment fund” (as defined in s HR 3(6)); • results from investments made into it that are not from a “designated source” (as defined in s HR 3(5)); • does not derive any “category B income” (as defined in s YA 1); and • is a “listed PIE” (as defined in s YA 1). How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any conditions stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: a) Any units received by the Unitholders under the Subdivision will be a “taxable bonus issue” that is a dividend under s CD 8. 9 b) The amount derived by Unitholders of the Existing Fund on redemption of their units in the Existing Fund, and any units received by Unitholders under the Subdivision, are excluded income under s CX 56C(1) if they: i) are resident; and ii) are a natural person or a trustee; and iii) do not include the amount as income in a return of income for the income year. c) If any one or more of the criteria listed in subparagraphs (i) to (iii) above does not apply to the Unitholder, the amount derived by the Unitholder on redemption of their units in the Existing Fund, and any units received by Unitholders under the Subdivision, are excluded income to the extent to which the redemption proceeds is more than the amount that is fully credited as described in s CD 43(26). d) Unitholders (other than Offshore Unitholders or PIEs) will: i) derive income under s CB 4 from the disposal of the redemption proceeds to the New Fund; ii) be entitled to a deduction under s DB 23 (calculated with reference to s FC 2) for an amount at least the same as the amount of any income under s CB 4; and iii) have no overall income tax liability as a result of their disposal of the redemption proceeds to the New Fund. e) Unitholders which are PIEs will derive excluded income under s CX 55 from the disposal of the redemption proceeds to the New Fund to the extent that: i) the redemption proceeds consist of shares issued by a company referred to in s CX 55(3)(b); ii) the Unitholders are not assured under an arrangement with another person of having a gain on the disposal; and iii) the shares are not fixed-rate shares within the meaning of paragraphs (a) to (d) of the definition of “fixed-rate share”. f) To the extent that Unitholders which are PIEs dispose of redemption proceeds that do not satisfy one or more of the criteria listed in subparagraphs (i) to (iii) of paragraph (e), those Unitholders will: i) derive income under section CB 4 from the disposal of the redemption proceeds to the New Fund; ii) be entitled to a deduction under s DB 23 (calculated with reference to s FC 2) for an amount at least the same as the amount of any income under s CB 4; and iii) have no overall income tax liability as a result of their disposal of the redemption proceeds to the New Fund. g) Section BG 1 does not apply to the Arrangement. 10 The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 1 April 2016 and ending on 30 September 2017. This Ruling is signed by me on the 25 th day of October 2016. Howard Davis Director (Taxpayer Rulings)
IN CONFIDENCE PRODUCT RULING – BR PRD 17/06 This is a product ruling made under s 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by New Zealand Bloodstock Finance and Leasing Limited. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of ss BG 1, DA 1, EA 3, EC 39 to 48, EJ 10, FA 6 to FA 11B, FA 12 and subpart EW. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the leasing of a thoroughbred breed of horse (bloodstock) on the terms provided in the Bloodstock Lease (Lease) to Purchase Agreement (Bloodstock Agreement) entered into by New Zealand Bloodstock Financing and Leasing Limited (NZBFLL) and its customers, for use in the customers’ “business” (as defined in s YA 1) of breeding and selling the leased bloodstock’s progeny. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. Background 1. NZBFLL is a wholly owned subsidiary of New Zealand Bloodstock Holdings Limited (NZB Holdings). 2. NZBFLL was, prior to 2 July 2014, known as New Zealand Bloodstock Leasing Limited (NZBLL). NZBLL had on 1 July 2014 amalgamated with New Zealand Bloodstock Finance Limited (NZBLL becoming the amalgamated company). New Zealand Bloodstock Leasing Ltd then changed its name to NZBFLL on 2 July 2014. Purpose of the Arrangement 3. NZB Holdings established NZBFLL to expand its business and increase sales of Office of the Chief Tax Counsel Te Tari o te Rōia Tāke Matua Asteron Centre 55 Featherston Street PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 New Zealand Telephone: 04 890-1500 Facsimile Numbers: Chief Tax Counsel: 04 978-1630 Taxpayer Rulings: 04 978-1628 Escalations & Advising: 04 978-1630 Disputes Review: 04 978-1630 Public Rulings: 04 978-1633 2 IN CONFIDENCE bloodstock in New Zealand by making investment in the bloodstock industry more attractive to existing and new entrants. The availability of leasing reduces the initial level of cash required by existing and new entrants to the bloodstock business to acquire bloodstock. The leasing arrangement gives the customers the opportunity to participate in the business of breeding bloodstock by leasing the bloodstock. New Zealand Bloodstock Limited (“NZB”) is contractually entitled to provide auctioning services for any progeny of the bloodstock. The benefit for the NZB Group from the leasing arrangement is that NZB gets the commissions from selling the bloodstock and the commissions from any sale of progeny from the bloodstock, in addition to NZBFLL’s right to receive the lease payments. 4. The customer is in the business of leasing bloodstock to breed and sell its progeny. This business does not involve the sale and disposal of leases. Sourcing of the Bloodstock 5. NZBFLL acquires bloodstock from third party owners, and then leases this bloodstock to the customer. Alternatively, the customer purchases the bloodstock from the third party owner, sells it to NZBFLL, and then leases the bloodstock from NZBFLL. This helps protect NZBFLL from involvement in any subsequent contractual claims regarding the purchase of the bloodstock from the third party owner. In both cases the transaction as a whole (e.g., sale and lease-back) is contemplated by the parties at the outset. In either case, the customer sources the bloodstock, drawing on bloodstock consulting, freight, and insurance services provided by NZB. 6. NZBFLL may also acquire bloodstock that is already owned by the customer, either through an earlier purchase or because it is homebred (the “already owned bloodstock”). The proceeds or sale of the already owned bloodstock are used for further investment in the customer’s bloodstock breeding business. 7. It is agreed in the Bloodstock Agreement that the customer may purchase the bloodstock at the end of the lease. The Bloodstock Agreement describes the Arrangement: “BACKGROUND A. At the request of the Lessee and the Guarantor (if any), the Owner has purchased the Bloodstock in order to lease the Bloodstock to the Lessee and the lessee has agreed to take on lease the Bloodstock with the right to purchase the Bloodstock at the expiration of the lease and otherwise upon the terms and conditions in this Lease. B. The Lessee has entered into this Lease for the purpose of obtaining breeding stock to use in the Lessee’s business of breeding bloodstock for sale...” Lease Particulars 8. The terms and duration of leases are based on individual requirements, credit risk, and potential breeding expectations. Lease periods may vary but a typical lease term is three years for fillies or mares and two years for colts or stallions. 9. The customer will make payments (Lease Payments) for the lease of the bloodstock, in the amount(s) set out in the Lease. 3 IN CONFIDENCE Residual Value 10. The bloodstock has a defined Residual Value under the Bloodstock Agreement. The Residual Value is an estimate (at the time of signing the lease) of the value the bloodstock will have at the end of the lease. “Residual Value” is defined in the Bloodstock Agreement as: “Residual Value” means the amount specified in the Schedule being a pre-estimate of the value of the Bloodstock upon the expiry of this Lease. 11. Under clause 8(b) of the Lease, the Residual Value is exclusive of GST: (b) Liability for residual Value: You are liable to pay the Residual Value exclusive of GST and to pay all other monies owing to Us notwithstanding any changes in circumstances or changes to the Bloodstock or its condition during the term of this Lease. Lease Termination Date 12. The lease termination date (“Expiry Date”) is the date on which the lease ends. The customer may purchase the bloodstock on the Expiry Date for the Residual Value. If the customer does exercise their option to purchase the bloodstock NZBFLL will transfer title to the customer in return for payment of the Residual Value. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a) The leased bloodstock is mature for use in breeding and is capable of being used for breeding at all times during the period to which each Lease Payment relates. b) Any racing undertaken by the leased bloodstock is only incidental to the actual use of the bloodstock for breeding during the lease term. c) The Lease Payments are genuine, arm’s-length amounts for the possession and use of the bloodstock. d) The Residual Value of the bloodstock is a reasonable, and the parties’ best, estimate of the likely market value of the bloodstock at the Lease Termination Date. e) The bloodstock becomes the property of the customer only when the customer makes payment of the Residual Value after the Lease Termination Date. f) No consideration is paid for the option to purchase the bloodstock at the Lease Termination Date. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: a) The bloodstock lease payments are deductible under s DA 1(1) and none of the general limitations in s DA 2 apply, provided that: 4 IN CONFIDENCE  No provision in subparts DB to DZ applies to prevent a deduction in s DA 1(1); and  The customer is a “New Zealand resident” (as defined in s YA 1). b) At the end of an income year, unless excused from this requirement pursuant to a determination issued by the Commissioner, s EA 3 applies to require the unexpired portion of any lease payments paid in advance to be included in the customer’s income in the current income year and to be an amount for which the customer is allowed a deduction in the following income year. c) The valuation and specified write-down provisions in s EC 39 to EC 48 apply to the customer when the bloodstock is purchased by payment of the Residual Value after the Lease Termination Date. d) The “cost price” of the bloodstock for the purposes of s EC 39 to EC 48 is the Residual Value stated in the Bloodstock Lease to Purchase Agreement. e) The financial arrangements rules in subpart EW do not apply to the Arrangement. f) Section EJ 10 does not apply to the Arrangement. g) Sections FA 6 to FA 11B do not apply to the Arrangement. h) Section FA 12 does not apply to the Arrangement. i) Section BG 1 does not apply to the Arrangement. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 7 December 2017 and ending on 7 December 2022. This Ruling is signed by me on the 23 rd day of November 2017. Howard Davis Director (Taxpayer Rulings)
PRODUCT RULING – BR PRD 17/02 This is a product ruling made under s 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Logbook Me Pty Ltd and Fleet NZ Ltd. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of: • ss CX 6, CX 38, DE 7 and RD 29; and • s 75(3BA) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GSTA). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the use of the LogbookMe product (LogbookMe) by taxpayers to record details of their vehicular trips. LogbookMe is a cloud-based online platform which uses an on-board electronic recording device to log data about a vehicles’ trip. Logbook Me Pty Ltd (LMP) an Australian registered and resident company owns and maintains the LogbookMe product, which is licensed on a wholesale basis to Fleet NZ Ltd (FleetPartners). Hardware and sim card connectivity is supplied by LMP to FleetPartners for sale directly to customers in New Zealand. LMP provides provisioning support and manages the service. FleetPartners is the exclusive distributor of LogbookMe in New Zealand. LogbookMe can be used by New Zealand individuals and businesses to record all vehicle journeys. It allows the driver to classify and generate reports on the business use of the vehicle. This subsequently enables the calculation of a business use percentage. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. Office of the Chief Tax Counsel Te Tari o te Rōia Tāke Matua Asteron Centre 55 Featherston Street PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 New Zealand Telephone: 04 890-1500 Facsimile Numbers: Chief Tax Counsel: 04 978-1630 Taxpayer Rulings: 04 978-1628 Escalations & Advising: 04 978-1630 Disputes Review: 04 978-1630 Public Rulings: 04 978-1633 2 LogbookMe components 1. LogbookMe consists of the components set out in the following paragraphs. 2. An in-car device (Device) that is installed in the car to capture journey information. The Device: • contains an accurate GPS module, movement sensors, solid state memory, mobile communication modules, sim card, battery and power socket; • monitors car usage, including the position of the vehicle, start and end locations of journeys, start and stop times, start and stop date and total distance travelled; • is powered by connecting directly to the car’s On Board Diagnostics (OBD) port; • commences recording the following data when it senses movement and/or ignition in the car:  car registration;  a record of all trips made by the relevant car;  date of trip;  start time of each trip;  end time of each trip;  start odometer;  end odometer;  total kilometres travelled during the trip; and  trip details (including start and end address); • records that data onto the Device memory with identifiers, including the time and date of each capture; and • automatically and continuously transmits the recorded data to the data management platform using a wireless mobile connection (should coverage on the mobile network not be available, it will automatically store the recorded data (up to approximately 30,000 trips) and periodically resend it until successful). 3. Car and employee registration with secure login and password features (SSL encrypted using a case sensitive password). This registration occurs at the time when the Device is ordered and the account is set up by the LogbookMe support team. 4. A cloud-based online remote data management platform (Platform) which is hosted in Australia. The Platform that securely receives, processes, reports and stores the journey information. In particular, it: • receives all transmissions continuously whilst the Device is operating and verifies data integrity upon receipt. The Platform then processes the 3 transmissions and generates a log for the specific Device that represents an individual driver. Part of the processing includes collation of various transmissions to create individual trips (Trip Log). • collates Trip Logs that then appear in the smartphone application and web browser dashboard for the driver to classify each trip. 5. A smartphone based mobile application (App) and the web browser-based secure dashboard portal (Portal), both of which allow the driver to easily classify journey information and record the purpose or purposes of each journey as follows: • After the creation of each Trip Log, the driver will receive an in-device notification (if using the App) prompting for journey classification and to record the purpose, or purposes, of the journey. Alternatively, the driver may also use the Portal, which is enabled with the same functionality to classify the journey and record the purpose, or purposes, of the journey. • The driver will need to confirm and classify each trip as follows:  the date and time when each journey began and ended;  the respective odometer readings at beginning and end of each journey;  the number of kilometres travelled by the car in the course of the journey;  the purpose of the trip; and  whether the trip was business or personal. • To assist the driver, the App and Portal can be set to automatically overlay the driver’s calendar entries and auto-fill the field for recording the purpose, or purposes, of the journey. Where this function is utilised, the driver is required to review and validate the auto-fill calendar information and may also make necessary edits. The purpose, or purposes, of the journey is not recorded until the user has validated and saved the record by press of a button. Prior to this step, the record will remain unclassified. • Where the driver has not classified a trip within 48 hours (or timeframe as agreed by the employer or individual), the driver will receive an email notification requesting that they log in to the App or Portal to classify any outstanding Trip Logs. • Data entered on a smartphone application or web interface will transmit to the server immediately once saved by the user. The user then receives feedback on the success of the transmission. If the transmission is not successful, the user is advised to resubmit. • A timestamp is recorded to the database when a trip is classified by a certain user, whether performed on a smartphone application or web interface. • At any given time, the driver will be able to view all unclassified trips on the App and Portal. The driver is then able to classify each trip individually and record the purpose, or purposes, of the journey. 6. The Portal allows the employer and driver to: 4 • view, review and generate reports on all data (including device, driver, car details) that are exportable in English to a variety of file formats (including .xls, .csv and .pdf); • obtain the business use percentage, which has been determined by the business distance travelled divided by total distance travelled (which includes both personal and business distance travelled); • obtain information on all relevant items and recorded fields, which include:  car registration;  start date of logbook period, including opening kilometres;  end date of logbook period, including ending kilometres;  a record of all trips made by the relevant car;  date of trip;  start time of each trip;  end time of each trip;  start odometer;  end odometer;  total kilometres travelled during the trip;  trip details (including start and end address);  classification of trip (business or personal);  detail of the purpose, or purposes, of the journey;  any unclassified trips; and  any days remaining in the logbook term; • capture data for different periods of time, including the ‘test period’ (a period of 12 weeks), the full duration the car was held or any other period of time that the user wishes to determine a log for. 7. The employer also has a summary of all drivers, including: • user attributes (including name and car registration details); • start odometer reading; • end odometer reading; • business usage percentage; • number of unclassified trips; • last trip; • start date of logbook; • end date of logbook; and • days remaining in logbook period. 5 Set-up 8. At the time the Device is ordered, either the employer or the individual provides set-up information that is input upon set-up of the user account. This information includes the following: • name of driver; • car registration; • car make and model; • engine size; • carrying capacity; • email address for user notifications and App configuration; • login and password details; and • the name of the employer. 9. This set-up process allows the user to utilise the Device and the Platform. The above information can be reviewed and revised by the car driver at any time through the Portal. This information can also be reviewed by the employer. If any anomalies are identified by the employer, the employer can communicate these anomalies to the employee so that appropriate changes can be made. 10. The Platform is activated for use when the Device is dispatched to the user and, from that point, is available to receive journey information at any time while the Device is operating. Upon receipt of the Device and it being placed in the relevant car, the user will be prompted to enter the below information prior to commencing their first trip: • login and password details; • opening odometer reading from the vehicle’s built-in odometer; and • time zone. 11. LogbookMe’s optional recording periods are currently either a 12-week period or a 52-week period. Users may easily extend the usage period beyond the set periods and, if so, the Trip Log will continue to be populated by data received on the Platform. 12. LogbookMe can also allow multiple drivers to classify trips using a Shared Car Module in the LogbookMe Platform. Similar to the process described above, this would allow for multiple drivers to login to cars that they have used and classify the relevant trips. Security 13. LogbookMe’s In-Car Logbook Solution data is securely stored on the Platform and is: • automatically backed up on a daily basis at 4pm, and retains 7-day running snapshots, as well as weekly and monthly snapshots, to protect the integrity of information; 6 • IP locked for database and remote access and staff are provided limited access on an as needed timed basis locked to a static IP address at a specific location; • very transparent and has a full audit trail capturing the metadata in the event any trip information or account information is changed. 14. LMP regularly updates its data management platform for the latest security patches and IP locked firewalls are in place for database and remote access. All staff and contractors are instructed to safeguard sensitive records and are provided limited access on an as needed timed basis locked to a static IP address at a specific location. This ensures that the risk of unauthorised alteration, addition or deletion is minimised as much as possible. 15. In addition, LMP’s data storage provider, Amazon Web Services Asia Pacific (AWS), stores LogbookMe’s objects on multiple devices across multiple facilities across Australia and regularly verifies the integrity of LogbookMe’s data using checksums. This is designed to sustain concurrent device failures by quickly detecting and repairing any lost data. 16. Further, a versioning backup system (databases exist in several versions at the same time) allows LMP to preserve, retrieve and restore every version of every object stored in AWS. This provides LMP with an additional level of protection by providing a means of recovery if objects are inadvertently overridden or deleted. 17. As a final step to ensuring the integrity of data, LMP permits only its technical director to have permanent access to its data management platform. All other LogbookMe user accounts are protected by a SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption using a case sensitive password. This ensures that only authorised personnel have access to electronic records. 18. FleetPartners has a direct feed which provides a live carbon copy of all client data from LMP via an Application Program Interface (API) that is provided in real time by LMP. This data is stored in New Zealand by FleetPartners for fleet management and reporting. This is hosted on a local server located at the FleetPartners office in Mount Wellington, Auckland. 19. LMP’s data retention policy for current, future and former clients is to maintain records indefinitely. Data integrity checks 20. Upon completion of the logbook, the driver will be prompted to enter the odometer reading as displayed on the car odometer at the end of the logbook period. The Portal will then determine whether there is any variance between the closing odometer reading determined by the GPS compared to the car odometer reading. 21. If the variance between the total distance measured by the GPS compared to the car odometer reading is greater than an acceptable variance (as pre-determined by the employer and the driver), the employer and driver will be notified. 7 22. Where it is deemed that the variance is not acceptable, the driver will have the option to continue the logbook period or to restart the logbook period. This prevents the driver from overstating business kilometres travelled by having a referenced GPS calculation, and ensures accuracy and integrity of the calculation. Customer Agreement 23. The Customer Agreement: Online Telematics Service (Customer Agreement) a copy of which was provided to Inland Revenue on 9 March 2017, sets out the terms and conditions under which FleetPartners supplies LogbookMe to its customers. 24. Clause 20 of the Customer Agreement sets out the record keeping obligations of FleetPartners as follows: 20 Record Keeping FleetPartners must maintain, for a period of 7 years after the end of the income year or taxable period to which they relate, separate and accurate records of all Customer Data related to this agreement. These records will remain readily accessible to the Customer and the End User for the 7 years after the end of the income year or taxable period to which they relate. 25. Clause 19.5 of the Customer Agreement provides that cl 20 of the Customer Agreement will survive termination of the Customer Agreement. 26. The following diagram summarises how the Arrangement operates: 8 Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a) The taxpayer accurately fills out the required fields in LogbookMe. b) The taxpayer does not remove the Device from the vehicle during the log book period. c) LogbookMe operates appropriately and accurately to record all relevant vehicle trip data. d) LogbookMe satisfies the requirements of s 26 of the Electronic Transactions Act 2002. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: a) Taxpayers who use LogbookMe will satisfy the record-keeping requirements of s 75(3BA) of the GSTA for those records that are generated by LogbookMe. b) A taxpayer’s use of LogbookMe will satisfy the logbook record keeping requirements set out within s DE 7 provided: • the logbook is kept for a minimum of 90 consecutive days; • the logbook is kept at a time that represents, or is likely to represent, the average proportion of travel by the vehicle for business purposes during the “logbook term” (as defined in s DE 8); and • the Commissioner has not required the taxpayer to record additional information in its logbook under s DE 7(2)(f). c) A taxpayer who uses LogbookMe will meet the requirements for recording the trip- related data (but not the non-trip-related data) for a “test period” under s RD 29(6) to establish the taxable value of the fringe benefit arising from making a vehicle available to an employee. This is provided that: • LogbookMe is set to record the trip details during the test period for three consecutive months of an income year (where the taxpayer pays fringe benefit tax (FBT) on an income year basis) or a quarter (where FBT is paid quarterly or annually); • the taxpayer chooses a test period that shows, or is likely to show, a pattern of use of the motor vehicle by the employee that fairly represents the use of the vehicle by the employee over the whole of the applicable “term” (as determined pursuant to s RD 31(6)–(8)); and • the taxpayer independently records the number of days a motor vehicle was available, but not actually used, for private use over the period referred to above. However, if the vehicle is a work-related vehicle (as defined in s CX 38(1) and (2)), then the taxpayer does not need to record any days on which the vehicle was available for the following private use: 9  travel to and from their home that is necessary in, and a condition of, their employment; or  other travel in the course of their employment during which the travel arises incidentally to the business use. d) A taxpayer who uses LogbookMe will record the trip-related data (but not the non- trip-related data) required to satisfy the work-related vehicle exclusion for FBT purposes under s CX 6(2) and to ascertain any private use days that may arise under s CX 38(3). This is provided that: • the taxpayer independently records the number of days a motor vehicle was available, but not actually used, for private use over the period referred to above, other than private use that is:  travel to and from their home that is necessary in, and a condition of, their employment; or  other travel in the course of their employment during which the travel arises incidentally to the business use. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 1 April 2017 and ending on 1 April 2020. This Ruling is signed by me on the 3rd day of April 2017. Howard Davis Director (Taxpayer Rulings)

The Choices Offset Arrangement allows a customer to link several deposit accounts (known as Linked Deposit Accounts) to one of a variety of home loan accounts (known as a Choices Offset Loan), notionally offsetting the balances of the deposit accounts against the loan account balance. Interest is calculated on the loan account balance after the notional offset. Interest is not paid or payable on any Linked Deposit Accounts for as long as the account is linked to a Choices Offset Loan. This Ruling does not consider the tax consequences of any arrangement under which a Linked Deposit Account holder agrees to offset their deposit account credit balance against another person's Choices Offset Loan account debit balance in return for valuable consideration (whether in monetary or non-monetary form). Further details of the Arrangement are set out below. Background 1. The Choices Offset Arrangement is a "mortgage offset" arrangement. The customers who may participate are classified as either Restricted Entities or Non- Investigations and Advice Whakatewhatewha me te Tohu 1 Bryce Street P O Box 432 HAMILTON 3204 T. 07-959 1404 F. 07-959 7604 E. graham.poppelwell@ird.govt.nz restricted Entities. Special rules apply to each of the two participant entities as discussed below. 2. The Choices Offset Arrangement allows Westpac customers to "link" up to 10 Linked Deposit Accounts to a single loan account such that the balances of the home loan and deposit account(s) will be notionally aggregated (thereby notionally reducing the debit balance of the loan) for the purposes of calculating the amount of interest that accrues on the loan. Westpac will pay no credit interest on the Linked Deposit Accounts during the period they are so linked, even where the deposit balances exceed the loan balance. 3. The Choices Offset Arrangement is not a separate loan product; it is an arrangement that can be used with an existing home loan product and deposit accounts. Further details of the Choices Offset Arrangement, particularly in relation to the eligible home loans and deposit accounts, interest calculations, interest rates, eligibility requirements of participants and relevant documentation are set out in the following paragraphs. Eligible home loans that can be offset 4. Westpac offers its retail and business customers several loan products, including Choices Home Loans, which may have a fixed, floating or capped interest rate. 5. Westpac will determine from time to time which loan products may be included in a Choices Offset Arrangement (Qualifying Loans). Currently, only floating-rate Choices Home Loans may be included in the Choices Offset Arrangement. Other Choices Home Loan types (excluding the Choices Everyday Loan) may be added in due course. 6. Qualifying Loans will have a variety of repayment options, including table, non- table and interest only. A Qualifying Loan included in a Choices Offset Arrangement is referred to as a Choices Offset Loan. 7. The effect of offsetting is that interest will be payable on the lower notional principal balance of the Choice Offset Loan. In the case of: a. a table loan, the term of the loan will be reduced; b. a non-table loan, the interest payments will be reduced. Any interest savings will result in either a reduction of interest payments or (if any minimum periodical payments are maintained) a reduction in the term of the loan; c. an interest-only loan, interest payments will be reduced. Eligible deposit accounts that can be offset 8. Westpac also offers its customers a variety of deposit accounts, including transaction accounts and savings accounts. Westpac determines, from time to time, which of these accounts may be included in a Choices Offset Arrangement. 9. Deposit accounts are not required to be new deposit accounts opened for the purpose of the Arrangement. Further, no new deposit account types have been (or will be) created as part of the Choices Offset Arrangement. 10. To participate in the Choices Offset Arrangement, the deposit account (or accounts) must be linked to a Choices Offset Loan. As noted above, a deposit account that has been linked to a Choices Offset Loan pursuant to the Choices Offset Arrangement is referred to as a Linked Deposit Account. 11. Only one Qualifying Loan and up to 10 Linked Deposit Accounts may be included in a Choices Offset Arrangement. Offsetting features 12. The key feature of the Choices Offset Arrangement is the "offsetting" of the aggregate credit balance of the Linked Deposit Account(s) against the debit balance of a Choices Offset Loan. This offsetting occurs before interest is calculated. 13. A net notional balance will be calculated for the Choices Offset Loan. Interest then accrues on that net notional balance only. This is the case as a matter of both contract (as set out in the terms and conditions applying to the Choices Offset Arrangement, which are discussed in more detail below) and as a matter of practice (in terms of Westpac's internal systems and accounting). 14. There are no actual transfers of funds, no set-offs or netting of funds, and no transfer of any interest in, or entitlement to, funds between the Choices Offset Loan account and Linked Deposit Account (or Accounts). 15. The effect of offsetting is that interest will be payable on the lower notional principal balance of the Choices Offset Loan. 16. Financially, the consequences for a customer of linking one or more deposit accounts and a Choices Offset Loan in a Choices Offset Arrangement are similar in terms of reduced interest costs that may arise from the use of Westpac's revolving home loan product (Choices Everyday Loan). Under the revolving home loan product, the balance on which interest is calculated is reduced, resulting in a reduced term of the loan for table mortgages and reduced periodic payments for non-table mortgages. Interest calculations under a Choices Offset Loan 17. The balance on which interest accrues on any day under a Choices Offset Loan will be calculated by notionally reducing the debit balance of the Choices Offset Loan at the end of that day by an amount equal to the aggregate of the credit balances of each Linked Deposit Account at the end of that day. 18. If the aggregate of the credit balances of all Linked Deposit Accounts equals or exceeds the debit balance of the relevant Choices Offset Loan, no interest will accrue on the Choices Offset Loan. 19. No interest will accrue or be paid on the credit balance of a Linked Deposit Account for so long as it is linked to a Choices Offset Loan. This is the case irrespective of whether, on any given day, the aggregate of the credit balances of all Linked Deposit Accounts at the end of that day exceeds the debit balance of the Choices Offset Loan to which they are linked. 20. Interest will accrue on any Linked Deposit Account for any period that it is not linked to a Qualifying Loan. Clause 3 of the Offset Arrangement Agreement and Clause 2 of the Offset Arrangement Contributor Agreement make it clear that interest is suspended on Linked Deposit Accounts only for so long as they are linked to a Choices Offset Loan under those agreements. 21. Default interest will not be subject to the offsetting arrangement. It will continue to accrue in accordance with the standard terms and conditions that apply to any Choices Offset Loan. Interest rate 22. The rate of interest applicable to a Choices Offset Loan will be a market rate that Westpac determines. Eligible persons and entities 23. Under a Choices Offset Arrangement, deposit accounts held by the following persons may be linked to a Choices Offset Loan: a. the Borrower, that is, the person (or persons acting jointly) who has (have) taken out the Qualifying Loan to be included in the Choices Offset Arrangement; b. in limited circumstances (as discussed below), persons other than the Borrower (known as a Contributor). 24. The Offset Arrangement Agreement draws a distinction between “Restricted Entities” and “Non-Restricted Entities” for the purposes of determining what deposit accounts can be linked to a Choices Offset Loan. These terms, and the consequences arising, are discussed below. Restricted Entities 25. Where the Borrower is a Restricted Entity only the following deposit accounts may be linked to a Choices Offset Loan: a. A deposit account in respect of which the Borrower is the Account Holder; and b. if the Borrower is party to this Agreement in its capacity as the trustee(s) of a trust or executor(s) of an estate, deposit accounts that are held by the Account Holder in its capacity as the trustee(s) of the same trust or executor(s) of the same estate. 26. A Restricted Entity is a. any body corporate or other person, including a body of persons acting jointly, other than a natural person or two natural person(s) jointly who are Partners; and b. any person(s), including any natural person(s), who is/are acting in its/their capacity as the trustee(s) of a trust or executor(s) of an estate. 27. The effect of being a Restricted Entity is that only deposit accounts in respect of which the Borrower is the sole account holder can be linked to the Borrower's Choices Offset Loan. 28. In the case of a Borrower acting in its/their capacity as the trustee(s) of a trust or the executor(s) of an estate, deposit accounts held only by the Borrower in its/their capacity(ies) as the trustee(s) of the same trust or executor(s) of the same estate can be linked to its Choices Offset Loan. 29. By way of example, if ABC Limited has established a Choices Offset Arrangement in connection with its Qualifying Loan, deposit accounts held only by ABC Limited may be linked to that loan. Further, if ABC Limited is a party to the Choices Offset Loan as trustee of a trust, deposit accounts held only by ABC Limited in its capacity as trustee of the same trust may be linked to that loan. Non-Restricted Entities 30. Where the Borrower is not a Restricted Entity, deposit accounts held either individually or jointly by the Borrower, their partner (spouse, civil union or de facto partner), any of their children (or a child together with his or her partner), or any of their parents (or a parent together with his or her partner) can be linked to the Borrower's Choices Offset Loan (on the condition that such persons are not themselves Restricted Entities). This can be done by: a. the Borrower where he or she (or they) can do so within the parameters of any linking rules determined by Westpac from time to time (which will require, among other things, that the Borrower has sufficient authority to operate the relevant deposit account); b. the Borrower acting with the consent of the relevant Contributor, in circumstances where the linking rules determined by Westpac from time to time require the relevant Contributor's consent (which will be the case where the Borrower does not have sufficient authority to operate the relevant deposit account); c. a Contributor, where the relevant deposit account is held by a Contributor and that Contributor has already provided consent in relation to another deposit account (and, therefore, has already signed up to the relevant terms and conditions under which the Borrower and the relevant Contributor agree that the Contributor may do so). 31. By way of example only, if Mr and Mrs Brown jointly establish a Choices Offset Loan: a. deposit accounts held by Mr and Mrs Brown jointly may be linked to that Choices Offset Loan; b. subject to any further criteria set by Westpac from time to time, deposit accounts held by Mr Brown in his individual capacity may be linked to that Choices Offset Loan (most likely by Mr Brown himself); c. subject to any further criteria set by Westpac from time to time, deposit accounts held by Mrs Brown's father may be linked to that Choices Offset Loan by: i. Mr and Mrs Brown, as the Borrower, with the consent of Mrs Brown's father; or ii. Mrs Brown's father, if Mrs Brown's father has already consented to another deposit account being linked to Mr and Mrs Brown's Choices Offset Loan; d. deposit accounts held by Mr Brown's father or by Mr Brown's father and his de facto partner jointly may be linked to that Choices Offset Loan (in accordance with relevant linking criteria above); and e. deposit accounts held by ABC Limited, or by Mr Brown in his capacity as a trustee, or any other Restricted Entity, cannot be linked to that Choices Offset Loan. Offset Arrangement documentation 32. The terms and conditions of the Choices Offset Arrangement are set out in the following documents provided to Inland Revenue on 29 March 2017: a. Choices Home Loan Summary (which forms part of the agreement pursuant to which Westpac advances home lending to a particular customer). b. Choices Home Loan Terms & Conditions (which is a standard form master document that contains generic provisions applying to all Westpac loans of a particular type). c. Offset Arrangement Agreement (being the principal agreement between the Choices Offset Loan customer and Westpac in relation to the Offset Arrangement). d. Offset Arrangement Contributor Agreement (being the document that a Contributor signs in addition to Westpac and the Borrower to join an Offset Arrangement). 33. The Choices Offset Arrangement documentation will override certain of the terms and conditions that would otherwise apply to the relevant Qualifying Loan and Linked Deposit Accounts that are included in an Offset Arrangement. 34. In particular, the Choices Offset Arrangement Agreement sets out the interest calculation method to be used for the Choices Offset Loan, provides for no interest to accrue on Linked Deposit Accounts for as long as the account(s) are linked to a Choices Offset Loan, and sets out the eligibility criteria (in relation to loans, accounts and account holders). 35. Therefore, Westpac customers who wish to include a Qualifying Loan in a Choices Offset Arrangement would enter into the standard loan documentation applicable to the Qualifying Loan as well as the Choices Offset Arrangement documentation. A customer may not have a Choices Offset Arrangement without a Qualifying Loan. Condition\[s\] stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following condition: a. All interest rates offered by Westpac in relation to an Offset Arrangement are at arm's length market rates. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any conditions stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Offset Arrangement as follows. Financial arrangements rules When, under the Choices Offset Arrangement, a credit balance of a Linked Deposit Account and a debit balance of a Choices Offset Loan account are offset, no amount of consideration is paid or payable by virtue of that offset for the purposes of calculating income or expenditure under ss EW 15 and EW 31 of the financial arrangements rules (as defined in s EW 1(2)). Therefore, offsetting does not, of itself, give rise to any income or expenditure under the financial arrangements rules. For the avoidance of doubt, fees payable by a Borrower to Westpac for the Choices Offset Arrangement constitute consideration for the purposes of the financial arrangements rules. Withholding tax  There is no payment of, or entitlement to, interest (as defined in s YA 1) in relation to the credit balance(s) of Linked Deposit Account(s) in the Choices Offset Arrangement. Therefore, no holder of a Linked Deposit Account derives any interest income on such accounts for the purposes of s CC 4, and Westpac does not pay any interest and has no obligation to deduct resident withholding tax or non-resident withholding tax under the Act or pay approved issuer levy under part VIB of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971.  The Choices Offset Arrangement is not an indirect associated funding arrangement as that term is defined in section RF 12I. Section CC7  No income arises under s CC 7 for Westpac or its customers in relation to the Choices Offset Arrangement. Tax avoidance  Sections BG 1 and GB 21 do not apply to the Choices Offset Arrangement. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 1 April 2017 and ending on 31 March 2022. This Ruling is signed by me on the 9 th day of June 2017. Graham Poppelwell Investigations Manager, Investigation and Advice
PRODUCT RULING – BR PRD 18/01 This is a product ruling made under s 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Livestock Improvement Corporation Limited, IRD No: 49-836-279. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of ss BG 1, CB 1, CB 3, CB 4, CB 5, subpart CD and the definition of “non-taxable bonus issue” in s YA 1. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is a series of steps detailed below resulting in the reclassification of two classes of shares (Co-operative Control Shares and Investment Shares) currently on issue by Livestock Improvement Corporation Limited (LIC), a co-operative company registered under the Co-operative Companies Act 1996 (CCA 1996). The shares will be reclassified into a single, continuing class of shares (Ordinary Shares) listed on the New Zealand Alternative Market Exchange (NZAX). Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. Background 1. LIC was incorporated in 1988 under the Companies Act 1955, and was subsequently reregistered under the Companies Act 1993 (CA 1993) and the CCA 1996. LIC has been a user-owned co-operative since 1 March 2002, and is owned by approximately 10,500 farmers. 2. LIC provides a range of services and solutions to improve the prosperity and productivity of its farmers. This includes dairy genetics, artificial breeding 2 services, information technology systems, herd testing and DNA parentage verification. 3. Currently, LIC customers must purchase at least $500 of LIC’s products and services per season to hold a certain number of LIC’s shares, based on their expenditure with LIC (the Share Standard). Under the Arrangement, the minimum spend before the Share Standard applies will be increased to $1,000 (although existing Shareholders whose spend is between $500 and $999 will be unaffected until they exceed $1,000, at which point they will become bound by a Minimum Purchases Amount of $1,000). LIC’s existing capital structure 4. In April 2004, LIC implemented a capital structure involving two classes of shares: Co-operative Control Shares and Investment Shares. At that time, LIC had 2,952,859 Co-operative Control Shares on issue and 29,528,590 Investment Shares on issue. The Investment Shares have not increased since then, but (as at 31 May 2017) there are more than 6 million Co-operative Control Shares. Co-operative Control Shares 5. Each Co-operative Control Share has a nominal value of $1. 6. A farmer purchasing goods and services from LIC must hold a number of Co- operative Control Shares with a nominal value equal to 4% of the aggregate amounts paid (or deemed to be paid) for goods and services purchased from LIC in the preceding season. 7. Co-operative Control Shares carry voting interests. Clause 2.1 of LIC’s constitution defines a “Voting Security” as excluding Investment Shares. This ensures that voting interests are only held by transacting shareholders, in accordance with s 33 of the CCA 1996. 8. Co-operative Control Shares carry the right to a Priority Dividend, being a specified percentage of the nominal amount of the share. The specified percentage ¡s set by the Board in each season, and cannot exceed the first mortgage lending rates of LIC’s principal bankers in respect of secured loans made to farmers. No other dividend is payable in respect of the Co-operative Control Shares. 9. Since the nominal value of the Co-operative Control Shares is $1, the Priority Dividend (when paid) is always a modest amount. The concept was intended to recompense the farmers for the interest cost they would face ¡n borrowing to purchase the Co-operative Control Shares. Investment Shares 10. Investment Shares can only be held by persons also holding Co-operative Control Shares (due to LIC being a co-operative company) although a small allocation of Investment Shares is available to LIC employees under an employee incentive scheme. 3 11. Investment Shares do not carry voting interests (other than certain protective rights and the right to vote on any resolution for the purpose of liquidating LIC). 12. Investment Shares carry dividend rights. Payment of a dividend is subordinate to any Priority Dividend on the Co-operative Control Shares, but that subordination is immaterial given the modest nature of any Priority Dividend. 13. LIC listed on the NZAX in April 2004, to facilitate trading of the Investment Shares (between holders of Co-operative Control Shares). LIC was granted listing with a 'Non-Standard' (NS) designation primarily because of the restrictions on who can hold Investment Shares. LIC’s Available Subscribed Capital (ASC) 14. As at 31 May 2017 the ASC in respect of each class of share was approximately as follows: • Co-operative Control Shares; $6.24m. • Investment Shares; $58.46m. 15. This Ruling does not consider or rule upon whether the advised amount of ASC has been correctly calculated. The proposed capital restructure 16. The Applicant advises that the overall objective of the Arrangement is to create a sustainable capital structure that aligns economic and voting rights. This will be achieved by providing holders of Co-operative Control Shares with a greater economic interest in LIC, while providing holders of Investment Shares with voting rights and requiring Co-operative Control Shareholders to introduce more capital for their greater economic interest. 17. LIC’s Board will reclassify the Investment Shares and Co-operative Control Shares into Ordinary Shares on a one-for-one basis. Immediately prior to the Arrangement, each shareholder’s holding of Co-operative Control Shares will be adjusted by reference to their expenditure with LIC in the 2017/2018 season in accordance with the Share Standard. 18. The Arrangement involving the equalisation and reclassification of shares will be consistent with relevant provisions in the CCA 1996 and in LIC’s constitution concerning co-operative companies. Equalisation 19. The Co-operative Control Shares have a fixed nominal value of $1, and the Investment Shares have a fluctuating, market-based value (referred to below as $X as at implementation of the Arrangement (Implementation Value)). 20. Accordingly, the value of the Co-operative Control Shares and the Investment Shares will need to be equalised. 4 Issue of further Co-Operative Control Shares 21. LIC will issue additional $1 nominal value Co-operative Control Shares to existing shareholders. 22. The additional shares are not issued out of existing reserves. The additional Co- operative Control Shares will be nil paid and will become payable when LIC calls for payment. A call for payment will generally coincide with a decision to pay dividends, and each shareholder’s outstanding amounts will be offset against any dividend payable. 23. The shareholders do not have an option to elect to take money or money’s worth instead of the additional shares, or to require LIC to repurchase those shares. Implementation Ratio 24. The number of additional nil paid Co-operative Control Shares issued is determined by the ratio of Y:1 (the Implementation Ratio), where: Y is equal to "$X - $1": $X is the Implementation Value of an Investment Share (as at implementation). $1 is the nominal value of a Co-operative Control Share. 1 is each Co-operative Control Share held prior to implementation. 25. The above steps assume that the valuation of the Investment Shares is a simple (non-fractional) multiple of the nominal $1 value of the Co-operative Control Shares. If this is not the case, then the Implementation Ratio will be applied so as to ensure that a whole number of additional Co-operative Control Shares will be issued. 26. The Implementation Value ($X) will be determined by LIC’s Board, with the benefit of an independent adviser's report (which will be made available to shareholders), external financial advice provided to the Board, and taking into account the market price of the Investment Shares as traded on NZAX. Given low trading volumes, the NZAX market price for Investment Shares is not necessarily a reliable indicator of the true market value of Investment Shares. Subdivision of Investment Shares 27. LIC will then subdivide each Investment Share to ensure that the value of an Investment Share on implementation, having regard to the Implementation Value, equals $1. If, for a particular shareholder, the subdivision calculation does not produce a whole number, the number of Investment Shares will be rounded up to the nearest whole number. The value of each Investment Share will then be equal to the nominal value of each Co-operative Control Share. 28. This will increase the number of Investment Shares by the Implementation Ratio (the same ratio as the increase in Co-operative Control Shares). 5 29. Upon completion of the above steps, the value of the Investment Shares and the nominal value of the Co-operative Control Shares will have been equalised (albeit with the new Co-operative Control Shares being paid up as to nil). The overall ratio of Investment Shares to Co-operative Control Shares will remain the same as it was immediately prior to implementation. 30. LIC will not elect to treat the share subdivision as a dividend under s CD 8 of the ITA 2007. Share reclassification 31. After equalisation, all Co-operative Control Shares and Investment Shares will be reclassified as Ordinary Shares. This will occur by way of a constitutional alteration of the rights attaching to the shares. 32. Nil paid Co-operative Control Shares will become nil paid Ordinary Shares. 33. A number of the above steps, including the subdivision of Investment Shares and the reclassification of Co-operative Control Shares and Investment Shares into Ordinary Shares, will need to be approved at a meeting of LIC shareholders. The reclassification will require two resolutions to be passed, one by Co-operative Control Shareholders only, and one by interest classes of each of the Co-operative Control Shareholders and Investment Shareholders. Issue of and calls on nil paid shares 34. A co-operative company is not required to obtain the consent of a shareholder for the issue of shares imposing or increasing a liability of that person to the company. Accordingly, LIC is able to issue nil paid shares to all holders of Co- operative Control Shares, without the consent of every shareholder. 35. Following reclassification of nil paid Co-operative Control Shares as nil paid Ordinary Shares, the Board will, from time to time, make a call for full payment of the outstanding issue price of one or more nil paid Ordinary Shares held by a shareholder. LIC's constitution allows the Board to "make Calls for the payment of any amounts unpaid on Securities which are not payable at a fixed time or times by the terms of issue of those Securities." The amount of the call is payable at the time specified on the giving of at least ten working days' notice. 36. A call will coincide with the declaration of a dividend. The number of a shareholder’s nil paid Ordinary Shares in relation to which a call is made for full payment of the outstanding issue price will be determined by dividing the net cash dividend by the outstanding issue price of the nil paid shares. Any dividends paid on nil paid Ordinary Shares and on any other shares required to be held to satisfy the Share Standard will be applied to repay the outstanding issue price. Restriction on trading nil paid shares and shareholder-requested calls 37. The Investment Shares are currently traded on the NZAX. After reclassification of all Co-operative Control Shares and Investment Shares into Ordinary Shares, the Ordinary Shares will be traded on the NZAX. There is no practical way to have less than fully paid shares traded on the NZAX, since such shares will have a 6 lesser tradable value than fully paid shares due to the potential for calls on such shares. Consequently, nil paid Ordinary Shares issued by LIC will not be able to be traded on the NZAX until paid in full. 38. The Board reserves the right to approve the transfer of nil paid Ordinary Shares before they have been paid up in full, which it expects to exercise in exceptional circumstances only. In the event that nil paid Ordinary Shares are transferred, the transferee will remain subject to calls for payment in the same way and in the same circumstances as the transferor of those shares. While it will not be a matter within the Company’s control, any consideration paid for the transfer of the shares would be expected to take this liability into account. 39. To facilitate trading, shareholders will be able to apply dividends on any additional Ordinary Shares they own to pay up the nil paid Ordinary Shares. They can also make additional payments if they wish to pay up the nil paid Ordinary Shares sooner. Shareholders will need to give notice to LIC in writing if they wish to exercise these rights. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: a) The issue of additional nil paid Co-operative Control Shares will not give rise to a taxable dividend to Co-operative Control Shareholders under subpart CD. b) The subdivision of the Investment Shares will be a “non-taxable bonus issue" as defined in s YA 1. Accordingly, under s CD 29, the subdivision will not give rise to a dividend to holders of Investment Shares. c) The reclassification of Co-operative Control Shares and Investment Shares as Ordinary Shares of the same class will not give rise to a taxable dividend under subpart CD. d) The Arrangement does not involve a disposal of shares by the shareholders. For the purposes of ss CB 1, CB 3, CB 4 and CB 5, no amount is derived by the shareholders as a result of the Arrangement. e) Section BG 1 does not apply to the Arrangement. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 9 February 2018 and ending on 31 March 2019. This Ruling is signed by me on the 9th day of February 2018. Howard Davis Director (Taxpayer Rulings)
High Wealth Individuals Research Project: Review of draft report Peer Ebbesen Skov pskov@aut.ac.nz March 2023 Draft report received on February Friday 3rd 2023 Contents 1 Summary2 2 Other comments3 3 Re. Executive Summary3 4 Re. Chapters 11 - 154 1 1 Summary The High Wealth Individuals Research Project provides the first effective tax rates (ETR) measures for individuals from theverytop of the New Zealand wealth dis- tribution. The report first shows ETR calculated based on information available in administrative taxable income registers. The median ETR calculated using a net income concept is 30%, with almost no variation over time and limited cross sectional variation. The report proceeds by using a combination of administrative and public register data as well as detailed survey information to extend the income concept in the ETR calculations. The broader income concept is labelled economic income and includes a range of additional income sources e.g., accrued capital gains from trusts, listed companies and property etc. The results show that the ETR measures are sensitive to some of these inclusions, with an ETR estimate for theAll-income concept equal to≈8.2%. Overall, I found the results interesting, informative but also expected, and in line with international results. In the process of calculating economic income many researcher decisions are required. The analysis follows the academic literature by being very transparent: the report highlights decisions and often presents the primary results alongside several robustness checks to show the consequences of the chosen approach. The second draft of the report has a consistent structure across chapters which makes it easy to follow. Results are presented in a consist way which makes it easy for the reader to absorb the results and methodolog- ical approaches. Below follows a list of smaller suggestions and comments/thoughts which each refer to specific report sub-chapters of the draft report. 2 2 Other comments It would be informative if all graphs included anoteto show the number of individ- uals used in the calculation e.g., percent of project population. ETR equations are presented as just numerator and denominator I would add the LHS of the equation and write it all out: ETR = numerator / denominator. E.g., Box 2. 3 Re. Executive Summary Re. 13. Raw numbers can be a difficult to appreciate. It would be useful with a baseline for comparison e.g., if in addition to the number itself the$926,353,562 was averaged by individuals and year then it would be possible to compare to$266,000 in taxable income in (6) but other baselines could also work. Re. 26. Add a note as to why the change in confidence – perhaps, more assumptions being needed for the calculation in e) compared to a) Re. Idea for a visual representation of the findings in the executive summary: Add in a bar plot showing the development of the ETR across A-E. Y-axis is percent. X-axis is five categories: 1. A, 2, A+B, 3 A+B+C, 4 A+B+C, 5, A+B+C+D. 3 4 Re. Chapters 11 - 15 Chapter 11 11.2. I think it is very informative and it would be useful to have in every chapter introduction. 11.8. I was a bit confused as to exactly what administrative data source was referred to here? 11.19. How many industries does not have a comparable multiple? If this is a large share (I suspect not) then perhaps a weighted mean would be a useful approach to recognize that some industries are closer in nature to each other. 11.34. This is small point but I suggest changing the axis to million NZD so less of graph area is taken up by zeros. Carries over to 12.1 (and probably more places). Chapter 12 Figure 12.3. Includes six lines but it is incredibly hard to distinguish these plots from each other. Perhaps Figure 12.3 Panel A (Individual) and Panel B (Family)? Figure 12.4. Shows some variation in the ETR for all threeAll-incomemeasures. Is this mainly driven by variation over time or by individual (within year variation)? 4 Table 12.2. Difference to base is in %-points which should be noted but perhaps these two columns could be deleted. Chapter 13 13.1 Makes references to a ‘subset of the Project population’: I think it would be useful, if it possible to write out the percentage of the population under is study in this (and all other) chapter(s). 13.11. “Capital gains are calculated by taking the individual’s holdings on the last day of the quarter multiplied by the change in share price over the next quarter.” How much does the ‘last day’ approach matter for the calculation compared to using averages over the quarter? 13.13. I think the business cycle test is nice – a different view on business cycle defini- tions (compared to reference in footnote 108): https://www.nber.org/research/business- cycle-dating perhaps mostly for noting. Figure 13.1. See 11.34. Also, all three included graphs are interesting but unfortu- nately they all require different axis in the current version the “Tax on base plus SLC income” line is almost redundant – a reader can note that line is above zero and seems to include only very limited variation. Perhaps an alternative option is to calculate Tax as share of Base plus SLC income and use the RHS y-axis. 5 Figure 13.16. I agree that correlation point is likely true (I would add in the estimate, rho = 0.??) but I note that the graph might visually suppress a higher correlation just because it looks as if there is no change in the Tax line and there might not be but the y-axis range is so wide that a reader cannot know for sure. Chapter 14 14.2. Re. Incidence assumption. You can state that you follow the Mirrlees Review (see Mirrlees (2010)) and rely on the key assumption that VAT incidence falls fully on consumers. Note that since the publication of the Mirrlees Review, researchers have studied the incidence of VATs, e.g. Gaarder (2023) Figure 14.1. Note I found no reference to this figure in the text. I think it is sufficient to have source listed below the Figure and on include “Thomas” in the Figure title. Figure 14.2. See Figure 14.1 Chapter 15 Re. 15.2. Reference should be Delestre et al. (2022). 6 References Gaarder, I. (2023). Incidence and distributional effects of value added taxes.The Economic Journal. Mirrlees, J. (2010).

People-led networks
===================

Our people-led networks enable individuals to come together, share ideas and provide support for one another. Some of the reasons they come together include their culture, ethnicity, ability, gender or sexuality.

They are led and organised by people who are passionate about creating an inclusive culture for all at Inland Revenue.

Working in partnership
----------------------

Our networks operate in a way that acknowledges the unique position of Māori as tangata whenua (people of the land) and Te Tiriti o Waitangi (The Treaty of Waitangi) partners. Doing this mahi (work) in partnership, is about creating a mana (standing, respect, status) enhancing experience that will build mutual trust and respect.

Opportunities within people-led networks
----------------------------------------

Joining our networks gives people the opportunity to:

*   champion and advocate for others
*   learn and share knowledge
*   grow your capabilities
*   share stories
*   create events, activities and opportunities to get involved
*   contribute to change at IR.

\[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Version: Draft v0.01 Date:29 October 2020 Stage 4 START Delivery Release 1 People Readiness Approach Prepared by Organisation Change Management and Training \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] People Readiness Approach Purpose of this document •This document outlines the Stage 4 Start Delivery Release 1 (S4.1.R1) approach on how to me asure our people readiness. People readiness informs both business readiness and programme readiness, which, along with customer readiness, is assessed at pre-determined checkpoints. •The approach summarises how we will engage with our people to understand if they feel ready for S 4.1.R1 and how we can help support and better prepare them for change. Using lessons learned from previous releases, we found that we received the most valuable input from our people through our in-person discussions and team surveys, where themes emerge quickly. In addition to the report that goes to PGC, the results of these types of surveying will assist the wider business with implementation planning through briefings with relevant leads and management advisors. •START Release 3 impacted most people in IR in some capacity and many were very highly impacted. •Release 4 had a more direct impact on specialised teams, including 1,500 people in KiwiSaver and S tudent Loans who are highly or moderately impacted. Other areas of moderate to low change in Release 4 included tax on income, tax at source, Working for Families Tax Credits and Research & Development Tax Incentive. In Stage 4 Release 1 due to the specialised products in scope, we will use a combination of Close Up Teams for our most highly impacted groups, Team Surveys for our moderately to highly impacted groups and we have included a Pulse Check survey which will span multiple change groups. The Stage 4 Release 2 People Readiness approach will be documented later next year. - 2 - \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Checkpoints for People Readiness 4a: Mon 22 Feb (tbc) Go-Live Committee Can we COMMENCE (Deployment Central) Checkpoint 5: Are we ON TRACK 18 March Checkpoint 1: AWARE 22 October Checkpoint 6: Can we EXIT Hyper Care 22 April 1 4a 5 FEB‘21 6 4b: Sun 28 Feb(tbc) Go-Live Committee Can we PROCEED (Deployment Central) Jan’ 21 Feb’ 21 Dec 20 Mar‘ 21 Apr‘ 21 Nov’ 20 Sept’ 20 Checkpoint 0: ALIGNED Stage 0 (Baseline Scope) 13 August S0 Heightened CHANGE CONTROL Stage 2 -7 December CHANGE FREEZE Stage 3 -1 February 4b Classroom Training & SBS Commences 11 January S3 Aug’ 20 CHANGE RESTRICTION Stage -23 October S1 S2 Oct’ 20 CHANGE FREEZE Stage 4 (Black-Out) - 15 February 0 S4 - 3 - Indicates a People Readiness Checkpoint Checkpoint 2: Are we ON TRACK 10 December Surveys include: •Close Up Teams •Team Surveys Checkpoints 3a: Are we READY 18 February Surveys include: •Pulse Check •Team Survey 2 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] People Readiness Approach WhatWhyHowSampleResearch type Close Up TeamsTo gain insight into readinessexperiences over time.

Team Surveys were sent to team leads to be completed after a discussion at a team meeting on how ready their team was. 80 teams were selected, in which 40 teams alternated checkpoints. Team Surveys will be sent to up to 70 teams, to be completed after a discussion during a team meeting. Team Surveys will be sent to 6-8 teams, to be completed after a discussion during a team meeting. Te Rapa Sessions – These were 24 people participating in a face- to-face interview on readiness. Close Up teams were selected across the most highly impacted change groups for Release 3 to have face- to-face conversations about readiness. These started with 6 teams and increased to 13 as we got closer to go-live. 8 Close Up teams will be selected to have face-to-face conversations in regard to how ready our most highly impacted groups are. 4 Close Up teams will be selected to have face-to-face conversations in regard to how ready our most highly impacted groups are. Hearts and Minds – a range of frontline staff of varying roles were selected at random to discuss via a phone call how they were feeling about Release 2.

Percentage of tax refunds which are accurate
--------------------------------------------

### Income tax refund accuracy

One of our case studies looks at how automatic income tax assessments for individuals are making tax simpler for New Zealanders, by optimising the use of data that we hold. With more detailed and timely reporting of employment and investment income, we expect to see the value of end-of-year income tax refunds reduce over time.

[Year 3 of automatically issued income tax assessments](/about-us/publications/annual-corporate-reports/annual-report/annual-report-2021/our-performance/case-studies/year-3-of-automatically-issued-income-tax-assessments)

### GST refund accuracy

*   98.7% of GST refunds had no amendment after the initial refund. 

| Year | Percentage of GST refunds that had no amendment after the initial refund |
| --- | --- |
| 2018 | 98.1% |
| 2019 | 98.8% |
| 2020 | 98.3% |
| 2021 | 98.7% |

The accuracy of GST refunds increased marginally in 2021 and has remained at a high level over the last 4 years.

Percentage of social policy payments which are accurate
-------------------------------------------------------

### Working for Families payment accuracy

This indicator looks at whether Working for Families Tax Credit (WfFTC) customers received the amounts they‘re entitled to, to support their families. Our aim is to improve the accuracy of WfFTC payments over time, using information from employers to pick up changes in customers’ income and make timely adjustments. The accuracy of payments also relies on customers providing timely updates on any changes to their circumstances.

| Customers with a Working for Families debit or payment | 2020 | 2021 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Debit greater than $5,000 | 1,700 | 2,000 |
| Debit between $1,000 and $5,000 | 11,500 | 12,700 |
| Debit between $400 and $1,000 | 7,900 | 8,600 |
| Debit between $200 and $400 | 4,700 | 5,200 |
| Debit between $50 and $200 | 6,400 | 6,200 |
| Debit between 0 and $50 | 6,100 | 5,100 |
| Credit between 0 and $50 | 15,800 | 25,300 |
| Credit between $50 and $200 | 12,100 | 8,900 |
| Credit between $200 and $400 | 8,700 | 8,600 |
| Credit between $400 and $1,000 | 17,600 | 16,000 |
| Credit between $1,000 and $5,000 | 27,800 | 26,600 |
| Credit greater than $5,000 | 7,500 | 6,800 |

Results for the 2021 tax year are mixed. On a positive note, 60% more WfFTC customers had a nil or small credit assessment compared to 2020, indicating that more customers are getting close to their entitlement during the year. The high number of customers with larger credit assessments reflects customers who have opted to receive their entitlement as a lump sum.

There was a small (4.3%) increase in the number of customers who had a debit assessment in 2021. Several factors contributed to this result, such as the impact of COVID-19 on employment and income stability for some customers and changes in family circumstances. Also, a number of entitlements were estimated incorrectly for some customers with multiple employers, and where the employer had not provided key information to us. We’re working to prevent this situation from happening again.

Note, results are as at 30 June 2021 and include customers who received an end-of-year square-up for their Working for Families entitlement through the automatic assessment process. Results do not include square-up results for customers who are required to file an IR3 return.

API mō te wā Period API
=======================

The period API provides information about 1 or more periods for an identified customer account. It is 1 of 8 APIs that, together, make up the customer services suite.

[How customer services work](/digital-service-providers/services-catalogue/customer-and-account/customer-services-suite/how-customer-services-work)
 

How the period API works
------------------------

When integrated through our gateway services, the period API provides information about a customer’s account periods. The period service accepts an account ID and account type, and an optional date range. It returns information about each period of the specified account or, if a date range is specified, it returns information about periods within that date range only. This information includes:

The period API can only be used by:

*   the customer the account is associated to
*   a user with delegated access to the customer’s account
*   an intermediary who’s linked to the customer’s account
*   government agencies with a memorandum of understanding that allows them access to customer account level data.

Some customers may split their individual account access across delegated users. This means a user may not be able to see all accounts for a specific customer.

The period API enables the above users to query Inland Revenue’s period data from their native systems, and to avoid the use of manually facilitated channels.

Te ture ārai i te kore hanga whakanōhanga pūmau Permanent establishment anti-avoidance rule
===========================================================================================

An anti-avoidance rule has been introduced for large multinationals (that is, over EUR 750 million of consolidated global turnover per annum) with a structure intended to avoid having a permanent establishment (PE) in New Zealand.

The rule deems a non-resident to have a PE in New Zealand if a related entity carries out sales-related activities for it here under an arrangement with a more than merely incidental purpose of tax avoidance (and the other requirements of the rule are met).

The rule applies for income years starting on or after 1 July 2018.

Detailed guidance on the rule is provided in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 3 April 2019.

[Tax Information Bulletin - Vol 31 No 3 - April 2019](https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/tib/volume-31---2019/tib-vol31-no3)

The following guidance outlines the risk indicators that Inland Revenue will use in deciding whether to investigate the possible application of section GB 54 of the Income Tax Act 2007 to an arrangement. It also explains how Inland Revenue will determine the profit attributable to a PE deemed to exist under section GB 54.

Key features
------------

The new PE anti-avoidance rule is contained in section GB 54. A PE is deemed to exist in New Zealand for a non-resident if all the following criteria are met.

| Question | Criteria |
| --- | --- |
| 1   | The non-resident is part of a large multinational group (that is, over EUR 750 million of consolidated global turnover per annum). |
| 2   | The non-resident makes a supply of goods or services to a person in New Zealand. |
| 3   | A person (the 'facilitator') carries out an activity in New Zealand for the purpose of bringing about that particular supply. |
| 4   | The facilitator is associated with the non-resident, is an employee of the non-resident, or is commercially dependent on the non-resident. |
| 5   | The facilitator's activities are more than preparatory or auxiliary to the non-resident's supply. |
| 6   | The non-resident's income from the supply is subject to a double tax agreement (DTA) that does not include the OECD's latest PE article. |
| 7   | A more than merely incidental purpose or effect of the arrangement is to avoid New Zealand tax, or a combination of New Zealand tax and foreign tax. |

Where a supply is subject to the rule, the non-resident is deemed to make that supply through the deemed PE. The activities of the facilitator in relation to the supply are also attributed to the PE.

The application of the rule is illustrated in the flowchart on page 24 of Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 3 April 2019.

[Tax Information Bulletin - Vol 31 No 3 - April 2019](https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/tib/volume-31---2019/tib-vol31-no3)

Risk indicators
---------------

The PE anti-avoidance rule is based on what actually occurs in New Zealand, as opposed to the terms of the contract. The following factors may be practical indicators of risk.

*   Significant functions are in practice carried out in New Zealand in relation to the sale, including those activities designed to convince a particular customer to acquire supplies from the non-resident.
*   The non-resident has little or no contact with the New Zealand customer (other than executing the sales contract).
*   The more complicated the supply, the more likely significant functions will be carried out in New Zealand to achieve sales.
*   The employees of the New Zealand facilitator are highly remunerated, possibly indicating the provision of high value activities for non-residents.
*   No or low foreign tax ultimately being payable on the income from New Zealand. However, the payment of tax on the income in another jurisdiction is not sufficient to circumvent the application of the rule.

These factors will be used by Inland Revenue to determine whether it needs to investigate an arrangement further in relation to section GB 54. The presence of one or more of these factors does not necessarily mean that section GB 54 will apply to an arrangement.

The actual application of section GB 54 will depend on whether the legislative requirements of the section are met, and in particular whether the arrangement has a more than merely incidental purpose or effect of tax avoidance.

New Zealand profit attribution rules
------------------------------------

The normal profit attribution rules apply to determine the amount of profit attributable to the deemed PE under section GB 54. In this regard, New Zealand follows an earlier version of the OECD's latest PE profit attribution rules (and not the latest version, which is known as the 'authorised OECD approach', or AOA). This is for the following two reasons.

1.  The AOA only applies to DTAs which incorporate the latest version of Article 7 (business profits) of the OECD Model Tax Convention (MTC). None of New Zealand's DTAs incorporate this version of Article 7, so the AOA is not relevant to New Zealand's DTAs.
2.  New Zealand does not agree with some aspects of the AOA and has made an explicit reservation against it.

Further guidance on profit attribution is contained in the Commentary to Article 7 of the MTC. Given New Zealand's specific reservation against Part 1 of the AOA, the relevant commentary in interpreting New Zealand's DTAs is the commentary as it read immediately before 22 July 2010, taking into account our reservations and observations. This version is found in the annex to the MTC Commentary on Article 7.

A New Zealand observation made in this version of the commentary notes that New Zealand does not agree with the approach reflected in Part I of the 2008 Report Attribution of Profits to Permanent Establishments, an earlier version of the AOA. New Zealand does not agree with the amendments made to the commentary that adopt the conclusions of that report such as, for example, the concept of allocating free capital.

Also see our general information on branches 'General principles of attribution' section.

[Branches](/international-tax/business/transfer-pricing/practice-issues/branches)

Profit available for attribution
--------------------------------

Where a PE is deemed under the rules, profit is attributable to it in accordance with normal profit attribution rules. Depending on the facts and circumstances, profit could be positive, nil or negative.

It is not correct to state that no additional profit arises in the PE merely because the facilitator has returned an arm’s length profit. This is due to a range of factors, including the following.

*   The activity taxed in the PE is different to the activity of the facilitator.
*   An arm’s length transfer pricing outcome for the facilitator, in accordance with Article 9 of the MTC, will not always result in New Zealand based activities being fully taxed in New Zealand.
*   Mechanical differences exist in the application of transfer pricing rules and the application of profit allocation rules.

New Zealand sourced income is taxed either in the hands of the non-resident or the facilitator, the same income is not taxed twice.

The factors above are explored further in the following examples.

Show all

Different business activity

A facilitator performs customer credit risk assessment functions on behalf of a non-resident. The facilitator does not undertake sales so it is never exposed to the customer credit risk for which it is responsible for assessing. The non-resident however undertakes the sale and is exposed to this risk. The business activities of the facilitator and non-resident are different.

In accordance with the transfer pricing rules, the facilitator would be entitled to an arm’s length return for the activities it performs and the non-resident would be entitled to the profit arising from its exposure to the credit risk. Where the non-resident is deemed to have a PE, its profit arising from this risk exposure would be available for attribution to the PE.

Interaction with transfer pricing rules - shared control over risk

Where a non-resident contractually assumes risk and the non-resident and a related party New Zealand facilitator both control the risk and have the financial capacity to bear the risk, within the meaning of the transfer pricing rules, the non-resident would be entitled to the income arising from the assumption of the risk in accordance with the transfer pricing rules.

The transfer pricing rules would require the New Zealand facilitator to be remunerated for its control functions. However, if this remuneration did not reflect a full sharing of the upside or downside risk exposure, where the non-resident is deemed to have a PE, the difference between this amount and the amount actually remunerated would be available for attribution to the PE.

Interaction with transfer pricing rules - consequential funding return

In accordance with the transfer pricing rules, where it is determined that a non-resident has the requisite control over a decision to invest in an asset acquired by a related party New Zealand facilitator, the facilitator would be required to compensate the non-resident for the funding provided. Where the non-resident is deemed to have a PE, that compensation would be available for attribution to the PE.

Mechanical differences

The specific rules governing transfer pricing and permanent establishment profit attribution differ and can therefore result in different outcomes.

For example, our profit attribution rules do not allow for notional royalty charges. Where a PE utilises intangible property income and expenses related to that property are attributed to the PE, as opposed to a notional royalty charge. This amount may differ from an arm's length amount charged to a related party New Zealand facilitator for its use of the intangible property, or it may involve intangible property exploited by the non-resident which has not been exploited by the New Zealand facilitator.

This same principle applies in respect of notional financing charges and notional mark-ups on administration costs.

Other differences can also arise simply due to mechanical differences in attributing income and expenditure in accordance with profit attribution rules as opposed to the application of specific methods for transfer pricing purposes. In practice, differences also arise due to the inexact nature of transfer pricing and available comparable data.

Returning income
----------------

Where a supply is subject to the PE anti-avoidance rule, the non-resident is deemed to make that supply through a deemed PE. The activities of the facilitator in relation to the supply are also attributed to the PE. A separate income tax return must be filed for the PE.

We understand that some multinationals want to comply with section GB 54, but do not want to restructure their New Zealand operations to a distributor model (for example, because it would be inconsistent with their regional strategy) or file a separate PE return. We have been asked whether we would accept the facilitator returning additional income under the transfer pricing rules equal to the amount payable under a distributor model, but without requiring them to actually restructure their legal arrangements or file separate PE returns.

Inland Revenue does not accept this approach. If section GB 54 applies, then we expect taxpayers to either return the corresponding income by filing a PE return, or to legally restructure their arrangements (for example, to a distributor model).

This approach is taken with regard to the following considerations.

*   We see the introduction of section GB 54 as a significant change to our international tax settings.
*   Compliance savings from single filing would be minimal because the relevant PE profit attribution calculation would still be required.
*   The presence of a PE can have other tax consequences, for example, it can make royalties and interest payable by the non-resident subject to NRWT to the extent they are attributable to the PE.
*   Returning income in the wrong taxpayer could result in adverse consequences in the event of a dispute with a tax treaty partner. For example, if we accepted a return to the facilitator that was above the arm's length amount for the actual legal arrangements, then the other country could challenge this return under their own transfer pricing rules. This would require us to refund the additional tax paid in New Zealand on the above arm's-length return.

Permanent place of abode and time bar
=====================================

2017 case note – High Court found the appellant had a permanent place of abode, that time bar could be opened and a shortfall penalty imposed - Residency, Diamond.

Case

Van Uden v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2017\] NZHC 2554

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 1994 ss CG15; OE 1 and Tax Administration Act 1994 ss 108; 141 B

### Summary

The High Court found that the appellant did have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand in the relevant years, applying the _Diamond_ test (_Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Diamond_ \[2015\] NZCA 613). The Court also concluded that time bar could be opened under s 108(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (“TAA”) and that a shortfall penalty for taking an unacceptable tax position was appropriately imposed.

### Impact

The decision confirms the application of the Diamond test for determining permanent place of abode. The decision also confirms that the wording of any time bar opinion is not important, but rather that an opinion has been formed. The Court also confirmed, consistent with the decision in _Great North Motor Co Ltd (in rec) v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2017\] NZCA 328, that the Taxation Review Authority (“the Authority”) is required to consider the time bar decision _de novo_ and not merely whether it was honestly held and reasonably available.

### Facts

The appellant, Mr van Uden, is a master mariner who on average, is at sea for approximately eight months of each year. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“the Commissioner”) assessed the appellant for income tax in the 2005 to 2009 income years on the basis he had a permanent place of abode.

The appellant was born in New Zealand in 1957 after his parents emigrated from the Netherlands. During the 1980's, the appellant married his first wife and adopted her two daughters. In 1987, the appellant purchased a home in Mangere Bridge, Auckland for his family. In 1993, the appellant purchased a rental property in Auckland, which was the first of four rental properties that the appellant acquired.

By 1994, he and his wife had separated. In 1996, the appellant bought an apartment which he stayed in while in New Zealand. The appellant returned to New Zealand regularly to visit his son.

In 1998, the appellant met his current wife, Judith van Uden. Mrs van Uden had received a property at 27 Evelyn Road as part of an earlier divorce settlement from her previous marriage which she transferred to the Pink Dog Family Trust (“the Trust”). From 21 November 1998, the appellant stayed at 27 Evelyn Road with Mrs van Uden. The appellant and Mrs van Uden were married on 14 December 1998. In 1999 the appellant was also appointed a trustee of the Trust and included as a discretionary beneficiary. Between 1998 and early 2000, when the appellant was not at sea, he would return to New Zealand and stay at 27 Evelyn Road with Mrs van Uden. From early 2000, Mrs van Uden began sailing fulltime with the appellant. In March 2004 the property at 27 Evelyn Road was tenanted for $70 per month.

During early 2005 the appellant carried out deferred maintenance at 27 Evelyn Road. In August 2006, the appellant, Mrs van Uden, and her solicitor, as the trustees of the Trust, purchased 29 Evelyn Road. In June 2009, the appellant and Mrs van Uden commenced a new build project at 29 Evelyn Road, which was completed by early 2011. The property at 27 Evelyn Road was let in 2010. The appellant and Mrs van Uden moved into the property at 29 Evelyn Road and eventually sold the property at 27 Evelyn Road in October 2014.

The Commissioner assessed the appellant for income tax on his overseas income for the years ended 31 March 2005 to 31 March 2009 (inclusive) on the basis he was a resident in New Zealand. The appellant unsuccessfully challenged the assessment before the Authority and appealed that decision to the High Court.

### Decision

#### Residency

The Court agreed with the Authority that the appellant had a permanent place of abode at 27 Evelyn Road. The Court applied the decision in Diamond and took into consideration the following factors:

1.  _The continuity or otherwise of the taxpayer’s presence in New Zealand and in the dwelling_ – While the appellant spent an average of at least eight months a year at sea, when he was not on the ship, holidaying or travelling, he returned to New Zealand and spent time here. When he did return, the appellant lived and based himself at 27 Evelyn Road. Apart from relatively short periods in the Netherlands as a child and during a period in the 1980’s, the appellant had a continuous presence in New Zealand.
2.  _The duration of that presence_ – the property at 27 Evelyn Road had been used as the appellant’s home for almost 10 years until June 2010.
3.  _The durability of the taxpayer’s association with the particular place_ – The appellant has maintained significant ties with 27 Evelyn Road, exhibited in both practical and financial ways. Firstly, the appellant returned to 27 Evelyn Road when not at sea. Secondly, the appellant and Mrs van Uden further committed to that address when they purchased the neighbouring property and undertook significant renovations. Thirdly, credit card statements in the relevant periods showed regular household expenditure at that location and a Sky television account maintained for several years suggested to the Court that 27 Evelyn Road was used for their residential purposes. Additionally, 27 Evelyn Road was the registered address for three motor vehicles that Mrs van Uden and the Trust owned from time to time, the appellant’s pay slips, and their electoral address. Lastly, the appellant regularly gave the 27 Evelyn Road address for bills, bank statements, insurance policies and investments.
4.  _The closeness or otherwise of the taxpayer’s connection with the dwelling_ – 27 Evelyn Road remained the property that the appellant and Mrs van Uden left from and returned to. It was their base in New Zealand. It was Mrs van Uden’s home, who the appellant was in a committed relationship with. While the appellant argued that he did not own 27 Evelyn Road, the Court noted that the parties committed to each other at an early stage in their relationship and that the appellant transferred his rental properties first to them both as a partnership and then from the partnership to the Trust.
5.  _The requirement for permanency to distinguish merely transient or temporary places of abode_ – 27 Evelyn Road was indefinitely available to the appellant when he and Mrs van Uden returned to New Zealand. Even when it was tenanted in 2004 that was at a concessionary rate and only for 10 months. Any use by the house sitter, friends or family was also dependent on the appellant and Mrs van Uden needing to live there.

#### FIF income

The Court held that the _de minimis_ exception in s CG 15(2)(d) did not apply namely because the employer’s contributions were incurred “by or on behalf of” the appellant. Accordingly, the Court found that the appellant was liable to pay tax on his interest in his employer’s superannuation fund. The appellant’s unit trust investments were also aggregated to the income from the superannuation fund.

#### Time bar

The Court found that the Commissioner validly formed an opinion when an adjudication report issued by a Manager of the Dispute Review Unit, confirmed that the exception to open the time bar in s 108(2)(b) of the TAA applied. The opinion was the most recent opinion on the issue, was reasonably held and the assessments that followed were consistent with that opinion.

The Court confirmed that there is no significance in the form of wording used, just that an opinion needs to be formed. In any event, the Court confirmed that the hearing before the Authority was a de novo hearing so that the Authority was obliged to review the Commissioner’s time bar decision.

#### Shortfall penalties

The Court held that the appellant’s claim that he did not have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand during the tax years in dispute did not have the prospect of being close to a 50 per cent chance of success. He therefore failed to meet the standard of being about as likely as not to be correct.

Persistent litigant discouraged
===============================

2011 case note - Interlocutory applications which attempted to re-open finalised decisions dismissed - judicial review, strikeout, re-litigation, indemnity costs.

Case

Clarence John Faloon v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

High Court Rules, Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

A number of interlocutory applications which attempted to re-open finalised decisions were dismissed by the Court.

### Impact of decision

The decision is further confirmation of the approach the Court will take to persistent re-litigation of previously decided and/or unmeritorious matters.

### Facts

Mr Faloon's father was the director of two companies, Trade Lines Limited and Central Equipment Company Limited, which are in liquidation.

Mr Faloon claims that there is compensation owing on assets which were once owned by the companies. The compensation relates to a pipe diversion of a stream by the Palmerston North City Council and the taking of land by the Crown for airport extensions. He also claims that he should be compensated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue for the loss of patent rights which were owned by one of the companies.

Compensation of $80,000 was paid to Trade Lines Limited for the land in December 1993. The compensation was paid in accordance with the requirements of the Public Works Act 1993.

Mr Faloon remains aggrieved over the loss of company assets and claims that the compensation was inadequate. He has been involved in litigation against the Crown and the Commissioner for a number of years and despite those claims being rejected by the courts, he continues to re-litigate the issues. There have been over 20 proceedings touching on these matters to date.

On 15 October 2010, Mr Faloon made a Statement of Claim naming the Commissioner as defendant in the High Court in Tauranga. The claim related to correspondence between Mr Faloon and the Commissioner. The claim is similar to the other claims made by Mr Faloon who believes that the correspondence from the Commissioner amounts to a "disputable decision" as defined in the Tax Administration Act 1994.

The Commissioner applied to "strike out" the proceedings and on 8 December 2010, Associate Judge Doogue agreed to hear the Commissioner's application.

*   On 13 December 2010, Mr Faloon made an interlocutory application for a judicial review of the decision of Associate Judge Doogue to hear the strikeout.
*   On 16 February 2011, Mr Faloon made a second interlocutory application asking the Court to order that a letter sent to him by the Commissioner on 4 February 2011 be declared "void". In the letter, the Commissioner had declined to give Mr Faloon the information requested until Mr Faloon had clarified the "scope" of his request.
*   On 24 February 2011, Mr Faloon applied for orders setting aside the Commissioner's memorandum in response to his application dated 16 February 2011.

### Decision

Justice Brewer held that rule 15.1 of the High Court Rules gives the Court the power to strike out all or part of a proceeding. He noted that the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA") does not, in any way, "trammel" the defendant's right to do so; Mr Faloon had argued that an extant challenge under Part VIIIA of the TAA could not be struck out. The Commissioner as defendant had every right to apply for a strikeout. Judicial review proceedings were therefore dismissed.

There was held to be no underlying infringement of rights or oppressive conduct which might call for court intervention. The plaintiff's first interlocutory application was therefore dismissed.

His Honour, in dismissing the second interlocutory application, simply set Mr Faloon's memorandum out in full and said: "This is another example of Mr Faloon's passionate but obsessive pursuit of his case. As will be evident from the foregoing, there is no basis in law for the application and accordingly it is dismissed."

Indemnity costs, which are often left as an issue until after the conclusion of a case, were awarded against Mr Faloon. The Court said: "… I believe that something must be done to bring home to Mr Faloon that a litigant who files multiple applications that have no chance of succeeding because they have no basis in law will be held accountable for wasting the Court's time ..."

Personal tax cuts
=================

Taxation (Budget Measures) Act 2010: Personal income tax rates are being reduced from 1 October 2010.

**_Sections CS 1, HM 58, LC 3, LC 4, ML 2(1), RC 5(4), RC 8(9), RC 10(3)(a), RC 11(4), RD 50 to 53, RD 58 to 61, RZ 3 to RZ 5C, YA 1, schedule 1, part A, table 1, schedule 1, part C, table 1, schedule 1, part D, tables 1 to 5, schedule 2, part A, schedule 2, part B, table 1, schedule 4, part I, schedule 6, tables 1 and 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007; sections 28C and 33C(c) of the Tax Administration Act 1994_**

Under changes enacted in the Taxation (Budget Measures) Act 2010, personal income tax rates are being reduced from 1 October 2010.

To ensure that the effects of the tax cuts flow through the tax system appropriately, other consequential amendments to the tax Acts have been made. The Taxation (Budget Measures) Act 2010 therefore amends fringe benefit tax rates, secondary employment codes, withholding tax rates for casual agricultural employees and election day workers, extra pay rates, employer superannuation contribution tax rates, portfolio investment entity rates, resident withholding tax rates, retirement superannuation tax rates, withholding rates for some Māori authority distributions, ACC attendant care withholding rates, child taxpayer tax credits and transitional circumstances tax credits. Transitional provisional tax rules for individual taxpayers are also provided.

Redundancy payment tax credits are being removed from 1 October 2010 and officials have recommended that fund withdrawal tax be repealed from 1 April 2011.

### Key features

The Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 have been amended to provide for tax cuts for individuals from 1 October 2010. The main features of the changes are:

*   The new tax rates apply to income earned by individuals from 1 October 2010.
*   The bottom tax rate will be lowered from 12.5% to 10.5%, the 21% rate to 17.5%, the 33% rate to 30%, and the highest rate lowered from 38% to 33%.
*   Consequential changes to other aspects of the tax legislation - such as PAYE and provisional tax, resident withholding tax rates for interest income, portfolio investment entity tax rates, and fringe benefit tax - will be made to coincide with these changes.
*   Some withholding tax rates remain unchanged (for example, the 19.5% tax rate for Māori authorities, the tax rate for non-resident seasonal workers and certain withholding tax rates such as payments to horticultural contractors). These rates will be reviewed at a later date as it is not yet clear what rates would be appropriate for these payments.

### Application dates

The changes generally apply from 1 October 2010.

The new composite income tax rates apply for the 2010-11 income year.

Officials have recommended that fund withdrawal tax be repealed from 1 April 2011.

### Detailed analysis

#### _Composite income tax rates for the 2010-11 income year (schedule 1, part A, table 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007)_

Income tax is calculated based on a person's annual income. Because the tax rates are changing part-way through the 2010-11 income year, the new tax rates that apply for the whole of the 2010-11 income year are "composite tax rates" that reflect an average of the two income tax rates that are used during the year. The table below shows the income tax rates to be used during the 2010-11 income year as well as the composite tax rates for the year. The new composite rates are contained in schedule 1, part A, table 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

##### Income tax rates and composite tax rates for 2010-11 income year

| **Income range** | Old tax rates applying to PAYE for the period 1 April 2010 - 30 Sept 2010 | New tax rates applying to PAYE for the period 1 Oct 2010 - 31 March 2011 | Composite tax rates for the 2010-11 income year |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $0-$14,000 | 12.5% | 10.5% | 11.5% |
| $14,001-$48,000 | 21% | 17.5% | 19.25% |
| $48,001-$70,000 | 33% | 30% | 31.5% |
| $70,001 and over | 38% | 33% | 35.5% |

#### _Income tax rates for the 2011-12 and future income years (schedule 1, part A, table 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007)_

Schedule 1, part A, table 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides for new income tax rates for the 2011-12 and future income years.

##### Income tax rates for the 2011-12 and future income years

| Income range | Tax rate |
| --- | --- |
| $0-$14,000 | 10.5% |
| $14,001-$48,000 | 17.5% |
| $48,001-$70,000 | 30% |
| $70,001 and over | 33% |

#### _PAYE rates: M and ML tax codes_

The new income tax rates apply to PAYE for the first pay period that ends on or after 1 October 2010. For pay periods that span the 1 October date and are for one month or less, PAYE should be deducted at the new rates. If the pay period spanning 1 October is longer than a month, PAYE should be deducted at the old rate for the portion of the pay period before 1 October and at the new rate for the portion of the pay period after 1 October.

##### PAYE rates from 1 October 2010

| Income range | Tax rate |
| --- | --- |
| $0-$14,000 | 10.5% |
| $14,001-$48,000 | 17.5% |
| $48,001-$70,000 | 30% |
| $70,001 and over | 33% |

Inland Revenue's PAYE deduction tables will be updated so the M and ML tax codes reflect the new rates.

#### _PAYE rates: Secondary employment income (schedule 2, part A of the Income Tax Act 2007)_

Schedule 2, part A of the Income Tax Act 2007 reduces withholding tax rates on secondary employment income to reflect the new tax rates. This applies from the first pay period that ends on or after 1 October 2010.

##### PAYE rates from 1 October 2010: Secondary employment income

| Income range | Tax code | Tax rate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $0-$14,000 | SB  | 10.5% |
| $14,001-$48,000 | S   | 17.5% |
| $48,001-$70,000 | SH  | 30% |
| $70,001 and over | ST  | 33% |

#### _Extra pays (schedule 2, part B, table 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007)_

Lump sums earned in the course of employment ("extra pays") are generally taxed at the employee's marginal rate. Schedule 2, part B, table 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 will reduce withholding tax rates on extra pays to reflect the new marginal tax rates. These will apply from the first pay period that ends on or after 1 October 2010.

##### Tax rates for extra pays

| Income range | Tax rate |
| --- | --- |
| $0-$14,000 | 10.5% |
| $14,001-$48,0 | 17.5% |
| $48,001-$70,000 | 30% |
| $70,001 and over | 33% |

#### _PAYE rates: Casual agricultural employees and election day workers (schedule 2, part A of the Income Tax Act 2007)_

Schedule 2, part A of the Income Tax Act 2007 reduces withholding tax rates for casual agricultural employees and election day workers. The rate is dropping from 21% to 17.5%, to reflect the second-to-lowest marginal tax rate and applies from the first pay period that ends on or after 1 October 2010.

#### _Resident withholding tax rates on interest income for individuals (schedule 1, part D, table 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007)_

Schedule 1, part D, table 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides for new resident withholding tax (RWT) rates for individuals who receive interest income. These reflect the new personal tax rates of 33%, 30%, 17.5% and 10.5%.

Row 1 of schedule 1, part D, table 2 replaces the previous 38% RWT rate that applied if a person had not supplied their interest payer with their tax file number with a 33% rate, to align with the new highest marginal tax rate.

Row 2 of schedule 1, part D, table 2 introduces a new 33% default rate from 1 October 2010 for people who have opened a new account with an interest payer after 31 March 2010 but do not elect a tax rate.

Row 5 of schedule 1, part D, table 2 provides for a 17.5% default rate from 1 October 2010 for people who have not opened a new account after 31 March 2010 and have not made a tax rate election.

Additionally, table 2 sets out transitional rules so that people who elected rates before 1 October 2010 shift automatically on that date to the relevant new RWT rates.

The new rates apply from 1 October 2010.

#### _Consequential change to resident withholding tax rates on interest income for companies (schedule 1, part D, table 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007)_

Schedule 1, part D, table 3, rows 3 and 4 have been amended to reflect changes to personal income tax rates. This reduces the rate of resident withholding tax from 38% to 33% for interest paid to a company when the recipient of the interest has either elected for the top personal rate to apply or has not supplied their tax file number to the payer.

The change applies from 1 October 2010.

#### _Portfolio investment entity (PIE) rates (sections HM 58, YA 1 and schedule 6, table 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007)_

Schedule 6, table 1 has been amended to lower the tax rates that apply to investors in portfolio investment entities (PIEs).

##### PIE tax rates

| Taxable income | Taxable + PIE income | PIE tax rate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $0-$14,000 | $0-$48,000 | 10.5% |
| $0-$14,000 | $48,001-$70,000 | 17.5% |
| $14,001-$48,000 | $0-$70,000 | 17.5% |
| $48,001 and over | Any | 28% |
| Any | $70,001 and over | 28% |

Section HM 58 ensures that people who invest in PIEs before 1 October 2010 will automatically shift to the new equivalent rate on 1 October 2010, so that they do not need to re-elect their rate with the PIE.

The changes apply from 1 October 2010.

#### _Provisional tax (sections RZ 3 to RZ 5C and YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007)_

Changes to sections RZ 3 to RZ 5 amend the formulas used to calculate provisional tax and allow individuals who pay provisional tax based on the earlier year method to reduce their provisional tax payments from 1 October 2010.

To calculate provisional tax from 1 October 2010 that is paid on the basis of an earlier year's residual income tax (RIT), transitional factors apply.

The following table provides adjustments to the transitional factors for individuals on the standard and the GST ratio methods for calculating provisional tax for the 2010-11 or later income years.

#### Adjustments to transitional factors for calculating provisional tax for the 2010-11 or later income years

| Method | Years |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2010-11 | 2011-12 | 2012-13 | 2013-14 |
| _Standard method adjustment_ |     |     |     |     |
| 110% payment decreases to: | 95% | 95% | 100% |     |
| 105% payment decreases to: | 95% | 95% |     |     |
| _GST ratio method adjustment_ |     |     |     |     |
| Two years before preceding year RIT decreases to: | 80% | 80% | 85% | 90% |
| Year before preceding year RIT decreases to: | 85% | 85% | 90% |     |
| Preceding year's RIT decreases to: | 90% | 90% |     |     |

For the 2010-11 income year the adjustments apply to provisional tax payments made on or after 1 October 2010.

Consequently, the formulas referred to in sections RZ 5B and RZ 5C from the 2008 Budget measures have been repealed.

#### _New FBT rates (sections RD 50 to 53, RD 58 to 61, and schedule 1, part C, table 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007)_

Changes to sections RD 50 to 53 and schedule 1, part C, table 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 provide for new fringe benefit tax (FBT) rates and thresholds for fringe benefits. These reflect the new personal tax rates. The changes apply to the 2010-11 income year and subsequent income years. For the 2010-11 income year, composite rates apply for attribution purposes to reflect the two sets of rates being used for that year.

##### FBT rates and thresholds for attribution purposes

| Income range | Tax rate |
| --- | --- |
| _FBT rates for the 2010-11 income year_ |     |
| $0-$12,390 | 0.1299 |
| $12,391-$39,845 | 0.2384 |
| $39,846-$54,915 | 0.4599 |
| $54,916 and over | 0.5504 |
| _FBT rates for the 2011-12 and subsequent income years_ |     |
| $0-$12,530 | 0.1173 |
| $12,531-$40,580 | 0.2121 |
| $40,581-$55,980 | 0.4286 |
| $55,981 and over | 0.4925 |

Employers still have the option of paying FBT at a single rate if they prefer. Changes to sections RD 58 to 61 reduce the single rate from 61% to 49.25%. For close companies and small businesses that are able to file FBT returns annually, the applicable rate is also reduced to 49.25% from the 2011-12 income year. For the 2010-11 income year, however, a composite rate of 55.04% will apply.

#### _New employer superannuation contribution tax rates (schedule 1, part D, table 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007)_

Contributions that an employer makes to an employee's superannuation scheme are generally taxed at the employee's marginal tax rate under the employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) rules. Schedule 1, part D, table 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides for new ESCT rates. The 12.5% rate drops to 10.5% and the 21% rate drops to 17.5%. The rate reduces from 33% to 30% for people who earn between $57,601 and $84,000.

The changes apply from the first pay period that ends on or after 1 October 2010.

##### ESCT rates

| Income range | Tax rate |
| --- | --- |
| $0-$16,800 | 0.105 |
| $16,801-$57,600 | 0.175 |
| $57,601-$84,000 | 0.300 |
| $84,001 and over | 0.330 |

It should be noted that the income ranges at which the ESCT rates apply are higher than the income ranges that apply for personal tax rates. This is to reduce the risk that employer contributions made to employees whose income is close to a threshold are not overtaxed.

#### _New retirement superannuation contribution tax rates (schedule 1, part D, table 5 and schedule 6, table 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007; section 28C of the Tax Administration Act 1994)_

Certain entities make contributions to a superannuation scheme for the benefit of their individual members under the retirement superannuation contribution tax (RSCT) rules. These contributions are generally taxed at the member's marginal rate. Schedule 1, part D, table 5 and schedule 6, table 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007 provide for new RSCT rates that reflect the new personal tax rates.

A consequential change has also been made to section 28C of the Tax Administration Act 1994, which deals with notification of a person's retirement scheme prescribed rate, to reflect the new top tax rate.

The changes apply from 1 October 2010.

#### _ACC attendant carers (schedule 4, part I of the Income Tax Act 2007; section 33C(c) of the Tax Administration Act 1994)_

Payments to ACC attendant carers are currently subject to a withholding tax rate of 12.5%, which reflects the lowest tax rate. Schedule 4, part I, clause 1 reduces the withholding tax rate to 10.5% from 1 October 2010. A consequential change has also been made to section 33C(c) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This ensures that these taxpayers do not need to file a tax return if they used either the 10.5% or the 12.5% rate in the 2010-11 income year.

#### _Payments from Māori authorities to members who have not provided a tax file number (schedule 1, part D, table 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007)_

The current rate of tax for Māori authority distributions to members who have not provided a tax file number is 38% in schedule 1, part D, table 4, row 2. This rate has been reduced to 33% to reflect the reduction in the top personal tax rate.

The changes apply for payments made on or after 1 October 2010.

#### _Fund withdrawal tax (section CS 1)_

Fund withdrawal tax (FWT) is a 4.2% tax payable on some superannuation fund withdrawals for members whose income is above $70,000. FWT was introduced to ensure that taxpayers who are on the highest tax rate (which is generally 38% until 1 October 2010) were not undertaxed under the employer contribution superannuation tax (ESCT) rules, as the top rate for ESCT was 33%.

As a consequence of the new legislation's alignment of the top ESCT rate and the top personal tax rate, fund withdrawal tax was to be phased out so that it would not apply to contributions made after 1 October 2010.

However, officials have instead recommended that fund withdrawal tax be repealed on all withdrawals from 1 April 2011, which is the date from which there is no discrepancy between the top ESCT rate and the top actual tax rate. This will be included in a future bill.

#### _Child taxpayer credit (section LC 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007)_

The child taxpayer credit provides children with a tax rebate on income that is not from interest or dividends. This allows an eligible child to earn income (less interest and dividends) up to $2,340 a year tax-free.

As a result of the reduction in the lowest tax rate from 12.5% to 10.5%, section LC 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007 has been consequentially amended so that the current tax-free threshold stays at the same level.

The changes apply to the 2010-11 and later income years.

#### _Transitional circumstances credit (section LC 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007)_

The transitional circumstances credit effectively provides a tax-free threshold of $5,824. It is available for some people who earn under $9,880. As a result of the reduction in the lowest tax rate from 12.5% to 10.5%, section LC 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007 has been consequentially amended so that the current tax-free threshold stays at the same level.

The changes apply to the 2010-11 and later income years.

#### _Redundancy tax credit (section ML 2(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007)_

Section ML 2(1) has been amended to remove the redundancy tax credit from 1 October 2010. The redundancy tax credit was originally introduced to ensure that the receipt of a redundancy payment did not cause a person to move up a tax threshold and be taxed at a significantly higher tax rate than they would ordinarily. (The top personal tax rate at the time was 39%, which was 6% higher than the next highest personal tax rate at the time. The 39% rate has since been reduced to 38%.) Because the 38% rate is reduced to 33% from 1 October, and because there is a smaller gap between the new 33% top personal tax rate and the next lowest rate of 30%, this credit is repealed from 1 October 2009.

Section 36AB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (the “Taxation Act”) requires the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to prescribe one or more electronic formats in which a return required under section 57B of the Taxation Act must be furnished. 1.2 Document Scope This document outlines the file upload process and defines the functional requirements for the file upload service. The file upload service is separate from the Gateway Services ("GWS") channel and provides an alternative means for Portfolio Investment Entities (“PIE’s”) to file PIE Periodic Returns, Annual Reconciliation Return and Investor Certificates. Details of the GWS channel are defined in the GWS software developer kit which may be obtained from this IR webpage. A PIE's access to and use of the file upload service is governed by Inland Revenue's standard terms and conditions that apply to the use of Inland Revenue's Website and Online Services as follows: 1.2.1 Inland Revenue Website – Conditions of use for Inland Revenue websites and social media pages. These can be accessed via the following link: http://www.ird.govt.nz/about- this-site/conditions/ ("Standard Terms and Conditions") The PIE filer will be deemed to have agreed to the Standard Terms and Conditions (as modified by Inland Revenue and made available on its website from time to time) by accessing the file upload service. 1.3 PIE Reporting Legislation Legislation passed in March 2018 includes several provisions regarding the reporting of investment income information. The reporting changes are intended to give IR a better understanding of investment income and will enable tax and social policy to be administered more effectively. The Taxation (Annual Rates 2017-18 Employment and Investment Income and Remedial Matters) Act 2018 requires that payers of investment income must provide certain information to Inland Revenue (IR) on a regular basis and in an electronic format. Financial institutions, Māori Authorities, companies and individuals are required to provide investment income information under section 25E(1) of the Tax Administration Act (TAA) to IR if they: • pay interest from which tax is withheld • pay interest subject to an approved issuer levy (limited to domestically issued debt) • pay taxable dividends (including unit trusts) • make taxable Māori authority distributions to members • pay royalties to someone who isn’t a New Zealand resident • attribute income to investors in a multi-rate PIE • pay interest, which can be claimed as a tax deduction, but from which tax may not be required to be withheld • stop being a New Zealand resident for tax purposes and continue to exist (applies only to companies). The legislation also sets out additional information requirements applicable to the IR854 – Investor Certificates. These requirements are detailed in Section 4.8.4 and include: • an amended file layout, PIE File Upload Specification V1.3 4 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] • some changes to the information required such as the provision of information on any joint investors in a PIE, • a multi-rate PIE is required to report investment income information to Inland Revenue yearly by 15 May after the end of the tax year rather than 31 May. These reporting changes are mandatory as at 1 April 2020. Further Information: For further information on PIE reporting requirements and due dates for PIEs that attribute income, refer to this IR webpage: PIE Reporting Requirements 1.4 PIE reporting date change for locked-in funds The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020–21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill requires that as at 1 April 2020 the due date for the Annual Reconciliation Return and all associated Investor Certificates for locked-in funds with a balance date between October and February is the 15 th of May each year rather than 30 June. PIE File Upload Specification V1.3 5 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 2 Electronic Filing Requirements 2.1 Network connectivity Banks, investment providers and others, can connect to the internet through an ISP as per the current process. 2.2 Operating systems The myIR system is operating system independent. However, a supported browser is required. 2.3 Supported web browsers At the date of publication of this document, the following web browsers are supported for use with myIR: • Apple Safari • Google Chrome • Microsoft Edge • Microsoft Internet Explorer 11 or Newer • Mozilla Firefox 2.4 Messages and validations in myIR Transferred files are validated by myIR and the customer informed of any errors. This validation is designed to provide instant turnaround, ensuring customers are provided with an immediate response of any errors. File validation rules include • file format • mandatory (required) data fields • data fields formats e.g. numeric, alpha numeric • data fields maximum lengths Note this is not the definitive list of all validations – these are noted in each file specification and in the Appendix. Error messages and warning messages will be displayed onscreen. More details are provided in the following section 2.4.1. 2.4.1 Error and Warning messages There are a number of error messages that can be received when transferring files to us. The messages will display clear details of the error or issue that has been found. There are two levels of messages in myIR: 1. Error messages that will stop the file upload – e.g. invalid payee IRD number 2. Warning messages that will not stop the file upload – e.g. totals do not match the individual return lines 2.5 Security The Inland Revenue myIR facility is a secure service involving authentication of users via a user-id and password. Knowledge of the password is assumed to guarantee that the user is authentic. Each user registers initially (or is registered by someone else), using an assigned or self-declared password. On each subsequent use, the user must know and use the previously declared password. PIE File Upload Specification V1.3 6 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] The PIE or any person or persons registered to file PIE Periodic Returns, Annual Reconciliation Returns and Investor Certificates, are responsible for ensuring that their user- id, password and other registration details are kept secure. These details should not be disclosed, even to Inland Revenue staff. Further details can be found via the website link in Appendix 5.3: IR Website Terms and Conditions. PIE File Upload Specification V1.3 7 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 3 File Upload Service 3.1 Overview The file upload service in myIR enables the PIE filer to upload PIE Periodic Returns, Annual Reconciliation Returns and Investor Certificates to Inland Revenue over the internet. To access this service, the payer must: • have a myIR account, • be registered for the tax type they wish to upload a file for (i.e. PIE), and • have access rights to file for the tax type. If the above pre-conditions are met, the payer may complete a file upload by utilising one of the following options: 3.1.1 File Upload – file a return option Under this option, the IR853 is auto generated when IR854 certificates are uploaded. 1. access the myIR Home for the PIE fund, 2. go to - Portfolio investment entity panel, 3. select the Returns and transaction hyperlink, 4. click on the grey return link, 5. select File now for the PIE annual reconciliation return, 6. at data entry method select Upload file, 7. Upload the file: 8. If file passes validation, click on Next, 9. The IR853 auto populates (Note: ensure the Total number of certificates is correct – change if not), click on Next, 10. Review the IR853 – if correct, click the Declaration box and select Submit. PIE File Upload Specification V1.3 8 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 3.1.2 PIE file transfer service option Under this option, the IR853 must be filed separately. 1. go to Portfolio investment entity panel, 2. select More, 3. select the option to ‘Use PIE file transfer service’ in the Payments, refund and return section, 4. choose a file to upload as per the below screenshot: Note: Under both the ‘file a return’ and ‘PIE file transfer’ options, the PIE IRD number in the uploaded file must match the IRD number of the account being filed for. 3.1.3 Upload bulk PIE file option Alternatively, an entity that has registered for the bulk PIE file option (available on request to Inland Revenue), may choose to navigate to the ‘Upload bulk PIE file’ option by selecting the ‘I want to’ grey hyperlink on the landing page at the customer level: PIE File Upload Specification V1.3 9 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] This button takes the payer to a larger menu of actions, one of which is the bulk PIE file upload option: Under this option, the payer may select to upload PIE return files at a customer level (rather than at an account level), and in this case the file may contain different PIE IRD numbers. Regardless of which PIE file upload option is used, the file selected must be a csv file and must pass the validation rules as detailed in sections 4.7 and 4.8. If no data validation or formatting errors are detected, the following message will display: The payer will then be able to submit the file(s) for uploading by selecting the ‘Submit’ button. PIE File Upload Specification V1.3 10 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Otherwise, if there are errors present, these will be detailed in error messages, and the payer will need to correct the errors before re-selecting the file for uploading. Below is an example of some error messages that would need to be fixed before the file can be uploaded: The payer may also choose to export the errors into an Excel file to assist with the error resolution process. This may be done by selecting the ‘Export’ button. PIE File Upload Specification V1.3 11 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 4 CSV File Requirements 4.1 Introduction This section sets out the data and format requirements of the files that the PIE filer will send to Inland Revenue using the file upload service. There are three files: • PIE Periodic Return (IR852) • Annual Reconciliation Return (IR853) • Investor Certificates (IR854) The PIE Periodic Return file is required to be filed either monthly, quarterly or annually. Further details are set out in section 4.7. The Annual Reconciliation Return and Investor Certificates can be filed in accordance with section 57B of the Taxation Act. Further details are set out in section 4.8. 4.2 File Format The file format for all myIR file transfer services is ASCII comma delimited format (csv file format). 4.3 File naming suggestions There is no standard file naming required. However, for easier identification we suggest the following: • A unique, period-based name. • Inclusion of the type of return to differentiate it from other returns, which may be required to be filed electronically in the future. • A CSV extension to indicate the file type. 4.4 File Extensions The file extension shall be three letters preceded by a full point or period. Valid extensions .txt or .csv are acceptable for a single file. Refer to the next section for acceptable file extensions where multiple files are compressed or grouped. 4.5 Compression / Grouped files File compression using the zip compression algorithm is acceptable, provided that the following rules are adhered to: • The content of any zip file must consist only of uncompressed files, i.e. a compressed file should not be included within any other zip file. The ‘nested’ zip file will be rejected as a file in error. • A zip file must be a single file only. In other words, a multi-part zip file (usually created to span removable media) will be rejected, as the decompression application will fail when trying to process a part file as a whole file. The following common file extensions shall be acceptable for compressed or grouped files: • .ZIP • .TAR • .GZIP PIE File Upload Specification V1.3 12 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Zip files or uncompressed smaller files may contain a mixture of IR852, IR853 and IR854 records, all of which may not necessarily belong to the same period. Example 1 Single file PIEReturns-20200405-002.csv is a file which contains IR852 return where 20200405 is the date when the file would have been sent with a sequence number of 002. Example 2 Grouped files Example: PIEReturns-20200403-01.zip is a zipped file which contains the following files: PIEReturns-20200403-001.csv PIEReturns-20200403-002.csv PIEReturns-20200403-003.csv PIEReturns-20200403-004.csv The date the file was sent to IR Systems would have been 20200403 with a batch number of 01. 4.6 Data Errors Correction Correction of data errors reported by the file upload service is the responsibility of the PIE filers. However, the file upload service will include specific and directive error messages to enable the PIE filers to quickly identify and correct erroneous data. Only files with no reported errors are transferred. Errors uncovered during the upload process will be displayed on the file upload screen with sufficient details to help the PIE filer identify the error and correct the data. The number of errors which will be displayed is limited to 250, hence when the limit is reached, succeeding errors will not be shown. All data errors must be corrected before making further attempts to upload the file. The file upload service can only accept a single file per transmission. This limitation, however, may be circumvented by using file compression or “zipping” a number of files into a single file. Please refer to the previous section 4.5 for the rules regarding compressed or zip files. In the case of grouped files, each file (.csv or .txt) will be validated and errors encountered will be listed under each file name. It must be emphasized at this point that although it is possible to zip or compress files with same file name, this should be avoided as it may cause problems in identifying the file/s in error.

This means that each Primary record line (identified by the code ‘PIEC’) holds the Parent (or primary) individual customer details such as name, address and the financial details of the PIE. If the PIE is a joint account, Child record lines (identified by the code ‘PIEJ’) will contain the Joint account owner details (if held by the payer). Each child record must directly follow their Parent record. Every customer record will include a Parent (or primary) record but may or may not include one or more Child records. E.g. For a jointly held investment in the names of A&B, the file will include 2 lines of information for that investment – one parent record and one child record. If the investment is in 3 names, then the file will include 3 lines, one parent record and 2 child records.

Alternatively, send in a written letter to the following address: Manager, Significant Enterprises Inland Revenue Department Private Bag 39984 Wellington • Under section 113 – The Commissioner may at any time amend the assessment as Inland Revenue thinks necessary in order to ensure its correctness, notwithstanding that tax already assessed may have been paid. • Under section 89DA –a Notice of Proposed Adjustment may be completed and sent to Inland Revenue (IR770 or IR777 for Tax Agents). PIE File Upload Specification V1.3 37 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 5 Appendix 5.1 Inland Revenue (IRD) Number validation The IRD number format used by Inland Revenue is an eight or nine digit number consisting of the following parts – • A seven or eight digit base number • A trailing check digit Check digit Validation The following steps are to be performed - 1. Check the valid range • If the IRD number is < 10-000-000 or > 150-000-000 then the number is invalid. This step ensures that the IRD number is in the already issued range, or is in the range expected to be issued in the next 10 years. 2. Form the eight digit base number: • Remove the trailing check digit. • If the resulting number is seven digits long, pad to eight digits by adding a leading zero. 3. Calculate the check digit: • To each of the base number’s eight digits a weight factor is assigned. From left to right these are: 3, 2, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2. • Sum together the products of the weight factors and their associated digits. • Divide the sum by 11. If the remainder is 0, the calculated check digit is 0. • If the remainder is not 0, subtract the remainder from 11, giving the calculated check digit. • If the calculated check digit is in the range 0 to 9, go to step 5. • If the calculated check digit is 10, continue with step 4. PIE File Upload Specification V1.3 38 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 4. Re-calculate the check digit : • To each of the base number’s eight digits a secondary weight factor is assigned. From left to right these are: 7, 4, 3, 2, 5, 2, 7, 6. • Sum together the products of the weight factors and their associated digits. • Divide the sum by 11. If the remainder is 0, the calculated check digit is 0. • If the remainder is not 0 then subtract the remainder from 11, giving the calculated check digit. • If the calculated check digit is 10, the IRD number is invalid. 5. Compare the check digit : • Compare the calculated check digit to the last digit of the original IRD number. If they match, the IRD number is valid. Example 1 IR number 49091850. The base number is 4909185 and the supplied check digit is 0. The number is greater than 10,000,000. Using the weightings above: (0\*3) + (4\*2) + (9\*7) + (0\*6) + (9\*5) + (1\*4) + (8\*3) + (5\*2) = 154. 154 / 11 = 14 remainder 0 (i.e. mod (154,11) = 0) The remainder (0) = check digit (0), so no further calculation is necessary. Example 2 IR number 35901981. The base number is 3590198 and the supplied check digit is 1. The number is greater than 10,000,000. Using the weightings above: (0\*3) + (3\*2) + (5\*7) + (9\*6) + (0\*5) + (1\*4) + (9\*3) + (8\*2) = 142. 142 / 11 = 12 remainder 10 (i.e. mod (142,11) = 10) 11 – 10 = 1 which matches the check digit. The number is valid. Example 3 IR number 49098576. The base number is 4909857 and the supplied check digit is 6. The number is greater than 10,000,000. Using the weightings above: (0\*3) + (4\*2) + (9\*7) + (0\*6) + (9\*5) + (8\*4) + (5\*3) + (7\*2) = 177 . 177 / 11 = 16 remainder 1 (i.e. mod(177,11) = 1) 11 – 1 = 10 so perform the secondary calculation. (0\*7) + (4\*4) + (9\*3) + (0\*2) + (9\*5) + (8\*2) + (5\*7) + (7\*6) = 181 181 / 11 = 16 remainder 5 (i.e. mod(181,11) = 5) 11 – 5 = 6, this matches the check digit. The number is valid. PIE File Upload Specification V1.3 39 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Example 4 (9 digit IRD number) IR number 136410132. The base number is 13641013 and the supplied check digit is 2. The number is greater than 10,000,000. Using the weightings above: (1\*3) + (3\*2) + (6\*7) + (4\*6) + (1\*5) + (0\*4) + (1\*3) + (3\*2) = 89 . 89 / 11 = 8 remainder 1 (i.e. mod (89,11) = 1) 11 – 1 = 10 so perform the secondary calculation. (1\*7) + (3\*4) + (6\*3) + (4\*2) + (1\*5) + (0\*2) + (1\*7) + (3\*6) = 75 75 / 11 = 6 remainder 9 (i.e. mod (75,11) = 9) 11 – 9 = 2 which matches the check digit. The number is valid. Example 5 (9 digit IRD number) IR number 136410133. The base number is 13641013 and the supplied check digit is 3. The number is greater than 10,000,000. Using the weightings above: (1\*3) + (3\*2) + (6\*7) + (4\*6) + (1\*5) + (0\*4) + (1\*3) + (3\*2) = 89 . 89 / 11 = 8 remainder 1 (i.e. mod (89,11) = 1) 11 – 1 = 10 so perform the secondary calculation. (1\*7) + (3\*4) + (6\*3) + (4\*2) + (1\*5) + (0\*2) + (1\*7) + (3\*6) = 75 75 / 11 = 6 remainder 9 (i.e. mod (75,11) = 9) 11 – 9 = 2, this does not match the check digit (3). The number is invalid. Example 6 IR number 9125568. The number is less than 10,000,000 so fails the first validation. The number is invalid.

These can be accessed via the following link: https://www.ird.govt.nz/about-this- site/conditions/conditions-of-use.html PIE File Upload Specification V1.3 42 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 5.4 Portfolio Investment Entity Monthly Return Filing Requirements Exemption Inland Revenue acknowledges the difficulties faced by Portfolio Investment Entities (PIEs) in providing all the information required in monthly returns to be furnished when investors exit from an Annual Exit (exit calculation option) PIE. It is understood that this may arise where the PIE operates separate unit pricing and investor registry systems whereby the net income figure calculated from the former is transferred to the latter as the starting point for calculating the tax liability for each investor. It is acknowledged that the tax liability information that is causing the concern is not information required in the daily unit pricing. However the tax liability information cannot be provided for a tax return unless identified and tracked with the other information required for daily unit pricing. Providing all the information required in the PIE return can result in increased processing time that may compromise the PIE’s ability to provide daily unit pricing to the market on a timely basis. In recognition of these difficulties, the Commissioner is prepared, under certain conditions, to alleviate the requirement for PIEs to provide income and deduction return information when determining the exiting investor’s tax liabilities in the monthly returns. The Commissioner still requires this fund information for the full year to be provided in the March year end return. Commissioner’s position The Commissioner will accept returns filed without this information and will not seek to pursue its inclusion in order to complete the requirements of the return. The Commissioner’s exemption is based upon the PIE providing the following: 1. Written application by the Fund Manager advising of each individual PIE who will be filing returns on this basis. While applications for multiple PIEs may be made, the application of each PIE will be considered separately. 2. The PIE must calculate its unit pricing on a daily basis. 3. The Fund Manager must include with the application, a declaration that provision of all information as per the return form adversely affects the ability of the PIE to provide daily unit pricing. 4. To clarify, the return information to which the Commissioner’s exemption relates, are the following: • Gross Income • Deductible Expenses • Net Income/Loss • Net land Class Income/Loss • Combined Income/Loss • Formation Loss Used • Land Class Loss Brought Forward • Land Class Loss Amount carried forward • Land Class Loss Claimed Importantly, the return format remains the same with the exemption allowing zeros 0.00 to be entered in these fields when completing the return. PIE File Upload Specification V1.3 43 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] The Commissioner considers that the temporary position that was in place can now be made a permanent exemption. Accordingly PIEs that have already received the temporary exemption can continue to file the monthly returns covering investors who exit during the year on that basis. New PIE registrants that meet the above criteria need to apply for exemption from providing full return information. 5.5 Foreign Investment PIE Return Completion We have been advised that it would be difficult for some PIEs to separately report, in the PIE returns, income of notified foreign investors (NFIs) at a gross (without expenses being deducted) basis and a net basis for other investors. A further concern for Foreign Investment Variable-rate PIEs (Variable-rate PIEs) is the retention and reporting of the various income types, whether it was sourced from New Zealand or overseas and the tax payable at each of the applicable rates. In order to do so and complete the PIE return form (IR 852), significant changes would be required to be made to existing fund accounting systems currently in use. The measures undertaken referred to below would be acceptable to Inland Revenue. It is expected that these should allow PIEs to comply with the requirements for the completion of returns for Foreign Investment PIEs without the need for significant system changes, while at the same time providing high level assurance to Inland Revenue as to the accuracy of those returns. IR 852 PIE Periodic Return - Version 3/Version 4 It is understood that PIEs may want to retain the use of version 3 of the IR 852 return in respect of Foreign Investment Zero-rate PIEs (Zero-rate PIEs) while using the version 4 (with additional fields for Income attributed to NFI and Tax on NFI income) for Variable-rate PIEs. I advise that Inland Revenue has no objection to members using either version 3 or version 4 of the return in respect of Zero-rate PIEs but would require the use of version 4 for Variable-rate PIEs. IR 854 Investor Certificates The new version 5 of the IR 854 will be required to be used from 1 April 2020 in respect of both Zero-rate and Variable-rate PIEs. This new version includes additional fields for joint investors. For NFIs it also includes reporting the additional personal level investor details and units held at year end. The income and tax being reported in the existing fields. The tax credits may also be reported as if the investor was a zero-rated investor. IR 853 Annual Reconciliation PIEs using the file upload service will be able to use version 3 or version 4. Effectively the only change in the file sent to Inland Revenue will be the version number. This also provides the opportunity to align version numbers for the series of PIE returns. Supporting Information for Returns Filed Due to the changes noted above it may not be feasible for the IR 852 returns of Foreign Investment PIEs to be reconciled at a high level (as is possible in respect of other PIE returns). This is due to expenditure not being deductible to NFIs (but deductible in respect of resident investors) and, in the case of Variable-rate PIEs, the tax payable by NFIs being based on a combination of tax rates. Notwithstanding this, Inland Revenue would still require sufficient high level assurance that the figures for PIE income and tax included in these returns are accurate. In this regard a copy of the Foreign Investment PIE’s trial balance and year to date totals as at 31 March be separately emailed to investment.desk@ird.govt.nz. If further information is sought in respect of a particular return it will be requested directly. PIE File Upload Specification V1.3 44 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] This information would only be required in support of annual PIE returns to 31 March each year and would not be required for exit or returns for other periods throughout the year. Inclusion of Resident Withholding Tax (“RWT”) Credits Attributable to Notified Foreign Investors Inland Revenue accepts that, depending on their current fund accounting systems, PIEs may or may not choose to include these credits in the returns of their Foreign Investment PIEs. In the event of these credits not being included in returns filed, any subsequent requests for their inclusion under section 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 would be considered on the facts pertaining to the request along with the relevant Inland Revenue Standard Practice Statement.

Pillow Talk and tax evasion - brothel owner sentenced
=====================================================

**12 May 2023**

A Wellington brothel owner has been sentenced to 11 months home detention on two representative charges of tax evasion.

Zhi Rong Zhou pleaded guilty to the charges in August 2022 and was sentenced in the Wellington District Court on May 12.

The 40-year-old arrived in New Zealand in 2000 and became involved in a number of businesses including the brothel, Pillow Talk. He also owned four properties worth nearly $4 million.

Investigations began into his tax affairs in 2020 and included searches of two of his properties and an analysis of txt messages from his mobile dating back to 2015. It found two of the properties were rented out, but no rental income was declared for tax purposes.

He ran Pillow Talk, hired workers, advertised their services, managed bookings, and took a third of worker’s earnings. Up until 2019, Pillow Talk used only cash as there were no EFTPOS or credit card facilities at the brothel.

Zhou knowingly failed to account for all of the business activity he was involved in to evade the assessment and payment of income tax and GST of $663.513.83 - made up of $183,682.04 in income tax, $452,834.01 in GST, and $26,997.78 in Working for Families Tax Credits.

There was dispute about how much the average daily gross earnings of the business were, but the courts accepted Inland Revenue’s method. IR assumed all the cash deposited into Zhou’s New Zealand bank accounts represented one-third of the cash payments made by Pillow Talk clients.

IR also used other sources such as text messages, sex worker rosters and hand-written records of customers to work out what the average daily gross earnings of the business were.

Justice Touhy was satisfied that Zhou was liable to return GST on the basis that his Pillow Talk business was the supplier of sexual services for which the recipients - its clients - paid for.

For most of the time under investigation Zhou was receiving an income tested benefit and receiving Working for Families Tax Credits.

Zhou had already repaid $300,000 but was ordered to pay a further $150,000 in reparations and ordered to do community work.

Inland Revenue says while most people are honest and pay tax on all their income, those who intentionally avoid paying tax or claim money they are not entitled to, are robbing honest people of services they might have had.

That is why we help people do the right thing and act when people deliberately try to avoid paying tax.

There are several ways everyone can help make sure everyone pays their fair share. [https://www.classic.ird.govt.nz/tax-crime/stop-tax-crime/](https://www.classic.ird.govt.nz/tax-crime/stop-tax-crime/)

Policy and Legislation
======================

Alongside migrating products to new systems and processes, an extensive programme of policy changes was implemented as part of transformation.

The changes made to policy and legislative settings aimed to:

*   make it easier for customers to get things right and hard to get wrong
*   reduce compliance effort and costs for customers
*   enable businesses to focus on running their businesses with tax as a secondary consideration
*   make it more difficult for people to fall into debt and easier for them to manage their payments
*   boost overall levels of compliance
*   support the use of digital technology.

Policy changes were aligned with when products moved to new systems and processes so the impacts on customers and businesses could be carefully managed. For example, automatic year-end income tax assessments were introduced when income tax was moved to our new system. This was the biggest change for individuals in approximately 20 years. Other significant changes to policy settings which enabled the move to automatic assessments included the move to payday filing for employers and changes to reporting requirements for payers of investment income.

Public consultation
-------------------

Consultation on policy changes was key to helping us to shape the programme and gaining input and commitment from external stakeholders. We began the process in June 2014 with a tax conference, held in conjunction with Victoria University. The aim of the conference was to help develop a policy vision, map out the key areas for consideration, and help inform concrete policy proposals for full public consultation.

Public consultation took the form of a number of government discussion documents and officials’ issues papers released between 2015 to 2020. The first in the Making tax simpler series was a green paper released in March 2015. This sought views on whether the ideas outlined in the paper were heading in the right direction and focused on the right things, before more work was done on them. It provided an opportunity for stakeholders to help set the priorities for change and shape the way we administer the tax system.

Policy changes enabled fundamental changes such as automatic end-of-year income tax assessments for individuals to be introduced. Having a clear roadmap and ensuring it was highly visible helped to highlight the most opportune times for making policy changes.

A number of government discussion documents and officials’ issues papers were released from 2015 to 2020.

Policy Issues - New rules for international venture capital
===========================================================

2005 amendments to the Income Tax Act remove a tax barrier to unlisted NZ companies gaining access to offshore private equity and venture capital.

**_Section CB 2(1) and CB 2(4) of the Income Tax Act 1994 and section CW 11B of the Income Tax Act 2004_**

### Introduction

Amendments to the Income Tax Act remove a tax barrier to unlisted New Zealand companies gaining access to offshore private equity and venture capital. The changes target non-resident institutional investors such as foreign pension funds that are tax-exempt in their own jurisdictions and are established or resident in a number of approved countries. Tax-exempt institutional investors, such as foreign pension funds, account for a substantial proportion of international venture capital. These changes are similar to those enacted in Australia in 2001.

### Background

The term "venture capital" is used typically to describe a variety of private equity investments, from funding of new companies and early stage expansion capital to management buy-in and buy-out transactions for established companies. As a rule, venture capital investment concerns investments into unlisted companies.

Before the amendments, there were no special tax rules for venture capital investment. Therefore a venture capital investor that purchased shares in an unlisted New Zealand company would be taxed on any gains according to ordinary tax concepts.

Under these principles, dividends are taxed as gross income when they are derived, and profits derived on the sale of shares are taxed if the shares are held on revenue account. Broadly, shares are held on revenue account if they are purchased with the dominant purpose of resale, or if the profits from sale form part of the investor's business income.

The application of these rules to non-resident investors is subject to the provisions of a double tax agreement (DTA) if the non-resident is resident in a country with which New Zealand has a DTA. In the context of venture capital investment, our DTAs will not generally remove New Zealand's ability to tax revenue account share profits. In other words, before these amendments, non-resident venture capital investors investing in New Zealand would be taxed on realised share profits if they held the shares on revenue account.

The nature of venture capital investing, combined with the capital/revenue distinction, resulted in complexity and uncertainty for non-residents contemplating venture capital investment in New Zealand.

The new rules target non-resident venture capital investors established or resident in an approved country that are sensitive to the imposition of New Zealand tax. Non-resident investors will generally be sensitive to such tax if they are tax-exempt in their own jurisdiction, since their tax-exempt status will mean that they will not be able to claim, or make use of, a credit for New Zealand tax paid. In the venture capital context this is an important issue because a number of institutional investors that invest in venture capital internationally, such as United States pension funds, are tax-exempt in their home jurisdiction.

The new rules use the availability of a tax credit (or other similar compensation) for New Zealand tax paid as a proxy for whether an entity is sensitive to the imposition of New Zealand tax. This should ensure that foreign tax-exempt institutional investors can qualify for the exemption.

It is very common for tax-exempt institutional investors to invest in venture capital opportunities via a foreign fund. In a venture capital context, foreign funds pool capital from a number of different investors and invest the capital in a number of different local fund managers. Therefore, to be effective, the new rules also accommodate such foreign funds.

In addition, the tax rule that limited the ability of special partners in a special partnership to offset special partnership tax losses against their other income has been repealed. This is designed to facilitate New Zealand resident investors investing alongside non-resident investors in venture capital through a special partnership.

### Key feature

The main provisions giving effect to the new venture capital tax rules are contained in section CB 2(1)(g) and section CB 2(4) of the Income Tax Act 1994 and section CW 11B of the 2004 Act. The main features of the new provisions are as follows:

*   Profits derived by a qualifying foreign equity investor (QFEI) on the sale of shares in unlisted New Zealand resident companies that do not engage in certain prohibited activities are exempt from income tax.
*   A QFEI can either be a direct non-resident investor, an investor in a foreign "flow-through" limited partnership or a foreign "flow-through" entity.
*   To qualify as a direct QFEI the non-resident must satisfy the following main criteria:
    *   The person must be resident in a country with which New Zealand has a DTA (excluding Switzerland).
    *   The person must be unable to benefit from a tax credit in its own jurisdiction for any tax that New Zealand would have imposed if it were not for the exemption.
*   For a person to qualify as a QFEI in a foreign limited liability partnership the partnership must satisfy the following main criteria:
    
    *   The partnership must be established under the laws of a country with which New Zealand has a DTA (excluding Switzerland).
    *   The partnership must have at least one limited partner.
    *   The general partner of the partnership must be resident in a country with which New Zealand has a DTA (excluding Switzerland).
    *   All partners with a greater than ten percent interest in the partnership must be:
        *   resident in country with which New Zealand has a DTA (excluding Switzerland); and
        *   unable to benefit from a tax credit in their own jurisdiction for any tax that New Zealand would have imposed if it were not for the exemption.
    
    *   For a foreign flow-through entity to qualify as a QFEI it must meet the following main criteria:
        *   The entity must be established under the laws of a country with which New Zealand has a DTA (excluding Switzerland).
        *   All members with a greater than ten percent interest in the entity must be:
            *   resident in country with which New Zealand has a DTA (excluding Switzerland); and
            *   unable to benefit from a tax credit in their own jurisdiction for any tax that New Zealand would have imposed if it were not for the exemption.
*   Section HC 1 has been repealed. This provision prohibited the partners of special partnerships from offsetting special partnership tax losses against their other income.

### Detailed analysis

The venture capital exemption is provided by the addition of new paragraphs (g) and (h) to section CB 2(1) of the Income Tax Act 1994 and the addition of CW 11B(1) to the 2004 Act. These provisions provide that the proceeds from the sale of shares by an eligible investor in certain unlisted New Zealand companies will be exempt from income tax if a number of criteria are met. The rules for determining which non-resident investors qualify are contained in the definition of "qualifying foreign equity investor" (QFEI) in section CB 2(4) of the 1994 Act and section CW 11B(4) of the 2004 Act. The new provisions do not change the current treatment of dividends that non-residents derive from the underlying companies.

#### Concept of eligible investment

New paragraphs (g) and (h) of section CB 2(1) and section CW 11B(1) list the criteria under which an amount may qualify as "non-residents' exempt income". Broadly, to be exempt, an amount must be derived by a QFEI from the sale of shares in an unlisted New Zealand resident company that does not have as a main activity one of the listed prohibited activities.

Venture capital investment can be made directly into a particular unlisted company (by purchasing shares directly in that company) or indirectly (by purchasing shares in a holding company that on-invests into the particular unlisted company). The new venture capital rules contemplate both scenarios. Section CB 2(1)(g) and section CW 11B(1)-(2) concern direct investment, while section CB 2(1)(h) and section CW 11B(1) and (3) concern indirect investment via a holding company.

Under both paragraphs, a number of criteria must be met in order for the investment to qualify for the exemption. Several of the criteria under each paragraph are very similar or the same - the main, common criteria will be discussed first. The criteria that are specific to investment directly and via a holding company will then be discussed.

##### Common criteria

_Applies to shares and options to purchase shares_

The exemptions in section CB 2(1)(g) and section

CB 2(1)(h) of the 1994 Act and sections CW 11B(1) of the 2004 Act are limited to the sale of a share or an option to buy a share. The exemption is limited to shares and options to buy shares because a key characteristic of venture capital investment is that the venture capital investor's return is connected directly with the performance of the company into which the investment is made. This is why a debt investment is not included in the exemption.

The current definition of "share" in section OB 1(a) encompasses investments that have both debt and equity characteristics. That is, in subparagraph (ii) of section OB1(a) a debenture to which section FC1 applies is included in the definition of "share". A debenture of this type is one where the interest payable is determined by reference to the dividends payable or the company's profits. As the return from such a debenture is linked directly to the performance of the company, it is appropriate that such an investment is included in the new venture capital rules.

This definition would not encompass a share option because a share option is not a direct "interest in the capital of a company". However, the economic

substance of a share option (the option to purchase shares in a company at a given price at some time in the future) is clearly akin to an equity interest in that company. Therefore the sale and purchase of an option to buy a share is included in the new rules (section CB2(1)(g); section CB 2(1)(g)(i); section CB 2(1)(h); section CB2(1)(h)(i) of the 1994 Act and section CW 11B(1)(b) of the 2004 Act).

The purchase of a note that is convertible into shares is also encompassed by the exemption, provided that the conversion occurs before the sale is made (section CB 2(1)(g)(i); section CB 2(1)(h)(i) of the 1994 Act and section CW 11B(1)(b) of the 2004 Act). This is consistent with the Australian approach and provides further flexibility when investing in venture capital.

_Investments held for at least 12 months_

To qualify for the exemption, a QFEI must have purchased the share, share option or convertible note at least 12 months before the share or share option is sold (section CB 2(1)(g)(i); section CB 2(1)(h)(i) of the 1994 Act and section CW 11B(1)(b) of the 2004 Act). This requirement is designed to ensure that the investment is genuinely venture capital in nature. That is, one of the key factors that distinguish venture capital from other types of investment is that the stock is generally held for the medium to long term. (For this reason venture capital is often referred to as "patient equity".)

##### Direct investment

_Listing requirements_

To qualify for the exemption, the shares purchased by the QFEI must either be unlisted on a "recognised exchange" at the time of purchase or, if they are listed at the time of purchase, they are de-listed at some stage within a year following the purchase (section CB 2(1)(g)(iii)(A), (B) of the 1994 Act and section CW 11B(1)(d) of the 2004 Act). A recognised exchange is defined in section OB1. Broadly, it can be described as an exchange market established in New Zealand or anywhere else in the world that exhibits certain criteria that are likely to produce genuine market values for the stock that is traded.

_Main activity cannot be a prohibited activity_

To qualify for the exemption, the company into which the investment is made cannot, for the entire period of the investment, carry on as its main activity any of the activities listed in section CB 2(1)(g)(iv)(A)-(H) of the 1994 Act and section CW 11B(2)(a)-(h) of the 2004 Act). The prohibited activities include land development and ownership and the provision of financial services.

_Investment into holding companies_

Section CB 2(1)(h) of the 1994 Act and section CW11B(3) of the 2004 Act ensure that a venture capital investment made via a company that on-invests (the holding company) into the ultimate investee company can still qualify for the exemption. The provisions are designed to ensure a level of commercial flexibility when making venture capital investment.

In a private equity context, holding companies typically engage as their main activity in the provision of funding to the ultimate investee companies. Given this main function, it is likely that an investment into such a holding company would not qualify under section CB2(1)(g). This is because the holding company would probably be considered to have as a main activity the provision of financial services or investing passively. (Both are prohibited activities under section CB2(1)(g)(iv)(D) and (H) and section CW 11B(2)(a) to (h).) Section CB 2(1)(h) and section CW 11B(3) overcome this problem by providing that an investment into a holding company can qualify, provided a number of criteria are met. (These criteria are additional to the criteria that are common to direct investment and investment into a holding company that are discussed above.)

##### Listing requirements

To qualify for the exemption, there must be some time during the 12 months following purchase of the investment when the shares of the holding company that is invested into are not listed on the official list of a recognised exchange (section CB 2(1)(h)(iii) of the 1994 Act and section CW 11B(1)(d) of the 2004 Act). This is the same criterion as for direct investment.

In addition, there is a requirement that the companies that the holding company invests into (both New Zealand resident and non-resident companies) not be listed on a recognised exchange at some time during the period of the investment in the holding company. There is also a requirement that there be at least one point in time during the period of the investment when each of the ultimate investee companies and the holding company is not listed on a recognised exchange (section CB 2(h)(vii) and section CW 11B(3)(c)).

##### Activity of holding company

The holding company must have as its main activity the provision of capital, either as debt or equity, to other companies (section CB 2(1)(h)(iv) and section CW11B(3)).

##### Activities of New Zealand resident companies invested into

The New Zealand resident companies that the holding company invests into do not have as their main activity any of the prohibited activities that apply to direct investments, unless the activity is the provision of financial services or passive investment (section CB2(1)(h)(v)(A) and section CW 11B(3)(a)(i)). This is to ensure that if the holding company investment route is taken, the companies that ultimately receive the benefit of the investment are in the same category as those that are targeted by the direct investment exemption.

The exception that is provided for New Zealand resident companies invested into that provide financial services or engage in passive activities is designed to accommodate an investment by a holding company into another holding company (second-tier holding company). This explains why there is a requirement that the second-tier holding company cannot have as a main activity the provision of financial services or passive investment activity unless the activity is the provision of capital to other companies (section CB 2(1)(h)(v)(B) and section CW 11B(3)(a)(ii)).

The rules have also been designed to accommodate chains of New Zealand resident holding companies. This is achieved by allowing the second-tier holding company to provide capital to companies that are similar in nature to the second-tier holding company (third-tier holding companies) or are the target investee companies (section CB 2(1)(h)(v)(C) and (D) and section CW 11B(3)(a)(iii) and (iv)). The inclusion of the words "directly or indirectly" in these provisions is designed to ensure that multiple tiers of holding companies are accommodated by the rules.

##### Activities of non-New Zealand resident companies invested into

A non-New Zealand resident company cannot provide capital to a New Zealand resident company, either directly or indirectly, that has as a main activity any of the prohibited activities listed in section CB2(1)(g)(iv)(A) to (H), section CB 2(1)(h)(vi), section CW11B(2)(a)-(h) and section CW 11B(3)(b)). This rule is designed to ensure that the new rules cannot be used to direct investment into ineligible activities via an offshore holding company.

##### Concept of eligible investor

The automatic venture capital exemption in paragraphs (g) and (h) of section CB 2(1) and section CW 11B(1) is available only to certain non-resident investors. A qualifying investor is defined as a "qualifying foreign equity investor" (QFEI), of which there are three categories (section CB 2(4) and section CW 11B(4)). The first category targets non-residents that invest directly into New Zealand venture capital opportunities, while the other two categories target indirect investment via foreign limited liability partnerships and foreign flow-through entities.

_Investment directly into New Zealand_

This category is aimed at non-resident venture capital investors that provide the capital to the ultimate investee company directly. The rules that determine whether a person qualifies as a QFEI under this category are contained in section CB 2(4)(a) and the definition of "foreign exempt person" in section CW 11B(4). The main criteria that must be satisfied in order to qualify under this category are discussed below.

##### Resident in an approved country

To qualify as a QFEI under this category, the person must be non-New Zealand resident and resident in a country that is approved for the purpose of the definition of QFEI (section CB 2(4)(a)(i) and section CW 11B(4), paragraph (a) of the definition of "foreign exempt person"). With the exception of Switzerland, this list contains all countries with which New Zealand currently has a DTA in force. These countries are:

*   Australia
*   Belgium
*   Canada
*   China
*   Denmark
*   Fiji
*   Finland
*   France
*   Germany
*   India
*   Indonesia
*   Ireland
*   Italy
*   Japan
*   Korea
*   Malaysia
*   Netherlands
*   Norway
*   Philippines
*   Russia
*   Singapore
*   South Africa
*   Sweden
*   Taiwan [**1**](#01)
    
*   Thailand
*   United Arab Emirates
*   United Kingdom
*   United States of America

The new rules in section CB 2(7) and section CW 11B(6) contain the provisions for including and withdrawing countries. This list is amendable by Order in Council.

The presence of a DTA will allow Inland Revenue to invoke the exchange-of-information Article of the DTA in order to receive information on particular investors and transactions. This will assist in the administration of the new rules.

To be included on the list it is necessary for the DTA country to engage in effective exchange-of-information. For this reason Switzerland is not included on the list. It is recognised that effective information exchange agreements may be negotiated in the future outside the context of a full DTA. If this occurs there may be some scope to extend the list of eligible countries beyond those with which there is a DTA.

##### Inability to make use of a credit for New Zealand tax paid

To qualify for the exemption, the non-resident investor must be unable to claim a tax credit or other compensation for any income tax that New Zealand tax laws may, but for the exemption in the new section CB2(1)(g) and (h) and section CW 11B(1), have levied on the income (section CB 2(4)(a)(v) and section CW11B(4), paragraph (e) of the definition of "foreign exempt person"). This inability must result from the investor's special status under the tax laws of its home jurisdiction. The formulation targets investors that are tax-exempt in their own jurisdiction owing to their special status under the tax laws there, rather than their particular circumstances at any point in time. For example, a non-resident that is unable to utilise a credit because it is in a tax loss position for the year would not qualify as a QFEI.

##### The inability to make use of a credit cannot arise from flow-through status

The non-resident must also be treated by the tax laws of the country in which it is resident as the person who derives the proceeds from the sale of the shares (section CB 2(4)(iv) and section CW 11B(4), paragraph (d) of the definition of "foreign exempt person"). This is designed to exclude from this category of QFEI foreign vehicles that are treated by the tax laws of their countries as flow-through for tax purpose. Broadly, a flow-through vehicle is not taxed as an entity. Instead the income flows through to the vehicle's investors and is taxed according to those investors' individual tax status.

If foreign flow-through vehicles were not excluded from this category of QFEI it would be possible that such vehicles that New Zealand may treat as being resident in an approved country would qualify under this category. This is because such vehicles could maintain successfully that the fact that they are not taxed as an entity automatically means that they are unable to benefit from a credit for New Zealand tax that would otherwise be imposed. This would not necessarily be the correct result because the determination of whether a foreign flow-through vehicle should benefit from the exemption should depend on whether the main investors in the vehicle can benefit from a tax credit for any New Zealand tax imposed. The rules concerning the other two categories of QFEI (paragraphs (b) and (c) of section CB2(4) and paragraphs and section CW 11B(4) ("foreign exempt partnership" and "foreign exempt entity") have been designed to ensure that this determination is made appropriately.

_Foreign limited liability partnerships_

This category of QFEI is designed to accommodate non-resident venture capital investors in foreign limited liability partnerships (FLLPs) that New Zealand treats as transparent for tax purposes. In this context "transparent" means that, instead of taxing the foreign vehicle as an entity, New Zealand tax rules would tax the investors in the vehicle directly, based on their interest in the vehicle. The rules are designed to provide the exemption to the non-resident person investing in the vehicle, provided that the vehicle meets a number of criteria. The rules are contained in section CB 2(4)(b) and the definition of "foreign exempt partnership" in section CW 11B(4), and the main criteria are discussed below.

_Established under the laws of an approved country_

To qualify as a QFEI under this category, the non-resident person must be an investor in an unincorporated body that is established under the laws of an approved country (section CB 2(4)(b)(i) and section CW 11B(4), paragraph (a) of the definition of "foreign exempt partnership"). It is also necessary to accommodate FLLPs that are established under these State laws of an approved country. This is because in a number of countries that have federal systems, it is a particular state law rather than the federal law that establish these vehicles. Therefore the subparagraphs also provide for bodies that are "established under the laws of part of such a territory".

##### Must have the main characteristics of a limited partnership

The unincorporated body must exhibit the main characteristics of a limited partnership (section CB2(4)(b)(ii)-(v) and section CW 11B(4), paragraphs (b)-(e) of the definition of "foreign exempt partnership"). Therefore the body must be one that:

*   consists of persons (section CB 2(4)(b)(ii) and section CW 11B(4), paragraph (b) of the definition of "foreign exempt partnership");
*   is treated by the tax rules of the other country as flow-through body (section CB 2(4)(b)(iii) and section CW 11B(4), paragraph (c) of the definition of "foreign exempt partnership");
*   has at least one general partner who is involved in the running of the body, has a controlling interest in the body and is liable for all the debts of the body (section CB 2(4)(b)(iv) and section CW 11B(4), paragraph (d) of the definition of "foreign exempt partnership"); and
*   has at least one limited partner who has a limited involvement in the running of the body, does not control the body and has limited liability for the debts of the body (section CB 2(4)(b)(v) and section CW 11B(4), paragraph (e) of the definition of "foreign exempt partnership").

##### General partners resident in approved territory

The unincorporated body's general partners must all be resident in an approved territory (section CB 2(4)(b)(vi) and section CW 11B(4), paragraph (f) of the definition of "foreign exempt partnership"). The general partners are the people in the body that are responsible for the business activities of the body. Therefore it is likely that they will have access to the necessary information concerning investors and investments. Requiring general partners to be resident in an approved country (that is also a country with which New Zealand has a DTA with an effective exchange-of-information Article) should ensure that Inland Revenue is able to administer the rules effectively.

##### Substantial investors are resident in an approved territory

To qualify as a QFEI under this category, the non-resident person must be an investor in an unincorporated body where all the investors that own ten percent or more of the capital of the body are resident in an approved territory (section CB 2(4)(b)(vii) and section CW 11B(4), paragraph (g) of the definition of "foreign exempt partnership"). This provision will ensure that the significant investors in the body are resident in a country with which New Zealand has a DTA with an effective exchange-of-information Article. This should ensure that Inland Revenue is able to administer the rules effectively.

##### Substantial investors in the body are not able to benefit from a tax credit

To qualify as a QFEI under this category, the non-resident person must be an investor in an unincorporated body where all the investors that own ten percent or more of the capital of the body are unable to benefit from a tax credit for New Zealand tax that would, in the absence of the exemption, be payable (section CB 2(4)(b)(viii) and section CW 11B(4), paragraph (h) of the definition of "foreign exempt partnership"). This criterion is designed to ensure that the main ultimate investors are sensitive to the imposition of New Zealand tax.

_Foreign flow-through entities_

This category of QFEI is designed to accommodate non-resident venture capital investors that invest through a foreign flow-through entity that is established as a separate legal entity in the country in which it has been established. The criteria that will determine whether the foreign flow-through entity will qualify as a QFEI under this category are very similar to those that apply to the FLLP category. The following explains the main qualification criteria for foreign flow-through entities where they are different from the FLLP QFEI category. (The rules are contained in section CB 2(4)(c) and the definition of "foreign exempt entity" in section CW 11B(4).)

##### Established as a legal entity under the laws of an approved country

To qualify under this category, the foreign hybrid must be established as a legal entity under the federal or state laws of the country in which it is established and must be established under the laws of an approved country (section CB 2(4)(c)(i) and section CW 11B(4), paragraph (a) of the definition of "foreign exempt entity").

##### Membership

The foreign flow-through entity must have members that hold interests in the capital of the entity and are entitled to shares of the entity's income (section CB 2(4)(c)(ii) and section CW 11B(4), paragraph (b) of the definition of "foreign exempt entity"). In order to ensure commercial flexibility and accommodate current structures, it is not necessary that the members' entitlement to income is in direct proportion to their interest in the capital of the entity.

##### Not resident in a country that taxes the foreign hybrid as an entity

To qualify under this category, the foreign flow-through entity cannot be resident in a country that has laws that tax the foreign flow-through entity as an entity on its income (section CB 2(4)(c)(iii) and section CW 11B(4), paragraph (d) of the definition of "foreign exempt entity"). This provision ensures that a foreign flow-through entity that is taxed as an entity in the country in which it may be resident for tax purposes does not qualify for the exemption. Such entities should not qualify because their taxable status in their country of residence will make it unlikely that they are sensitive to the imposition of New Zealand tax.

#### Tax treatment of venture capital not covered by the exemption

The new tax rules for venture capital are not intended to affect the current tax treatment of venture capital investment that is not covered by the new exemptions. Under the current tax rules, profits from the sale of shares will be taxable only if, broadly, the shares were purchased with the dominant purpose of resale or the profits form part of the investor's business income. The new exemption is designed to remove a risk that certain foreign investors could be caught by these rules. In this sense the new rules should be viewed as a "safe harbour" for the investments of a certain category of non-resident investors.

_Application date_

The new venture capital rules apply from 1 April 2004.

#### Special partnerships

The preferred method of venture capital investment internationally is through the use of limited liability vehicles that are "flow-through" for tax purposes. This means that any income of the entity is borne by the partners and not taxed at the entity level.

To properly facilitate the flow of international venture capital into New Zealand it is necessary to ensure that the special partnership rules that provide limited liability and flow-through treatment properly reflect the way international venture capital is carried out. Section HC 1 has been repealed to remove a tax barrier to the operation of the special partnership rules. Section HC 1 is the provision that prevented special partners of a special partnership from offsetting their special partnership tax losses against their other income.

The rule was introduced to counter a number of aggressive tax schemes that occurred in the 1980s. It has been repealed because the deferred deduction rules (contained in sections ES 1 to ES 3 and sections GC 29 to GS 31) should provide the necessary protection against abusive tax schemes. The removal of section HC 1 will be helpful for venture capital investment into New Zealand because it will remove a barrier to local entities investing alongside international venture capital investors.

_Application date_

The repeal of section HC 1 applies to special partnership gross income and allowable deductions for the 2004-05 and subsequent income years.

There are special tax rules for trustees that invest in portfolio investment entities (PIEs).

Prescribed investor rates (PIR) for trusts
------------------------------------------

Trustees who are New Zealand tax residents and who invest in a [multi-rate PIE (MRP)](/api/glossary/item?id={410C66D9-6D77-4180-BAED-71164C774ECD})
 must collectively choose 1 [PIR](/api/glossary/item?id={512D9328-39AB-4FC1-8E40-B4782AD917E5})
 for their trust from the following options.

*   28% as a final tax.
*   17.5% and include PIE income and tax paid in the end of year income tax return.
*   10.5% only if the trust is testamentary (from a will) and include PIE income and tax paid in the end of year income tax return.
*   0% and have the income or loss and tax credits flow through to the trust's end of year income tax return.

Trustees of superannuation funds cannot choose 10.5%.

Trustees of charitable trusts can only notify 0%.

If the trust does not provide a prescribed investor rate to the MRP, PIE income will be taxed at the default rate of 28%. This default rate is not the same as notifying at 28%. The PIE income must be included in the trust’s end of year income tax return.

PIE income and end of year income tax return
--------------------------------------------

A trust’s MRP income must be included in an end of year income tax return if the:

*   trustees chose a prescribed investor rate of 0%, 10.5% or 17.5%
*   trust has been zero-rated (taxed at 0%)
*   default rate of 28% was applied.

Losses cannot be included in trust returns if you choose 10.5% or 17.5%.

If the trust and the MRP both have a standard 31 March balance date, the income is received and attributed in the same year's tax return. If they have different balance dates, the trust includes the income in the tax return for the year the end of the PIEs balance date falls in.

Information handling
--------------------

Dividends or distributions received from an MRP are excluded income and are not included in the trust’s income tax return. A dividend from a listed PIE is excluded income unless the trustees choose to include it in the trust’s income tax return.

If a trust’s income is taxed at the notified 28% PIR, it is not included in the income tax return.

For all other PIRs, including the default 28% rate, the income is included in the trust’s income tax return.

The trustees then determine if it should be allocated as beneficiary income or remain as trustee income.

If allocated as beneficiary income by a trust that is not a PIE, it is taxed at the beneficiary’s marginal tax rate with a credit allowed for the PIE tax paid. The PIE income is not included in the PIE calculation in the individual’s income tax return or assessment.

Prescribed investor rates (PIRs)
--------------------------------

If you're an individual and a New Zealand tax resident, your portfolio investment entity (PIE) income will be taxed using your [prescribed investor rate (PIR)](/api/glossary/item?id={512D9328-39AB-4FC1-8E40-B4782AD917E5})
.

The prescribed investor rates are 10.5%, 17.5% and 28%.

You need to let your PIE know what your PIR is. If you do not provide your PIE with your PIR, you'll be taxed at the default rate of 28%. 

If you invest in a [multi-rate PIE (MRP)](/api/glossary/item?id={410C66D9-6D77-4180-BAED-71164C774ECD})
, you need to provide them with your IRD number and PIR. A common type of MRP is a KiwiSaver scheme. For new investments you have 6 weeks to provide your IRD number or the MRP will close your account.

You may be taxed at 0% (zero-rated) if you exit from an MRP during the quarter (withdraw your investment entirely), or if you're a [transitional resident](/api/glossary/item?id={40B013B8-DE6C-49DB-AD13-FF1F0162FEDD})
 with an investment in a foreign investment zero-rate PIE.

PIE income and your end of year tax assessment
----------------------------------------------

### 2021 and future tax years

For the 2021 tax year onwards, we'll check if you've used the correct PIR for the full year. If not, the tax difference will be included in your income tax calculation. This will appear as a PIE debit or PIE credit in your income tax assessment.

#### Income for Working for Families Tax Credits and student loans

If your PIE income is from a locked-in fund, it is not included as income for Working for Families Tax Credits or student loan purposes. A locked-in fund is a retirement savings scheme that has a rule preventing you from readily accessing your funds until you reach a specified retirement age. A KiwiSaver scheme is an example of a locked-in fund. If you are not sure you should check with your MRP.

### 2020 and earlier tax years

For the 2020 and earlier tax years, if your PIE income or loss was taxed at your correct or higher PIR, it is not included in your end-of-year tax return or assessment. No refund is available for overpaying PIE tax.

However, your [](/api/glossary/item?id={410C66D9-6D77-4180-BAED-71164C774ECD})
MRP income or loss must be included in your end-of-year tax assessment if you've:

*   used a PIR that's too low
*   been taxed at 0% because you exited an MRP during a quarter
*   chosen not to include your worldwide income as a new tax resident when choosing your PIR. 

If you included PIE income or loss in your tax return or assessment, you’ll need to make an income adjustment to exclude any locked-in PIE income. You’ll also need to add in any non-locked-in PIE income that is not already included. Complete the 'Adjust your income service' in myIR when completing your income tax return or complete the 'Adjust your income – IR215' form.

[Adjust your income for Working for Families and student loans](/income-tax/income-tax-for-individuals/adjust-your-income/make-end-of-the-year-adjustments)

#### Change of residency

If you become a non-tax resident, your PIR should be 28% from the date you leave New Zealand. You need to let your MRP know as soon as possible.

If you become a tax resident, you generally need to include your worldwide income when working out your PIR. However, if your income for your first 2 years as a tax resident will be a lot lower than your worldwide income for the past 2 years, you can choose to not include your worldwide income when working out your PIR.

--------------------

[Multi-rate PIEs (MRPs)](/api/glossary/item?id={410C66D9-6D77-4180-BAED-71164C774ECD})
 generally need to provide details of your income by 15 May or 30 June of the following tax year. If you do not receive details from your MRP or you think the investor statement is wrong, you need to contact the MRP.

There are no record keeping requirements when all of the following apply:

*   the PIE income is attributed by the MRP to an individual who only has income taxed at source
*   the individual has provided their IRD number to all payers.

The exception to this is when an investor is required to provide details of their attributed PIE income for the purpose of a student loan repayment obligation. In this case a record of the attributed PIE income must be kept for 12 months after the end of the income year in which the income was received.

Records must be kept for at least 7 years where an investor is an individual and either:

*   received other untaxed income
*   did not give their IRD number to a payer.

[All Income tax dates](/index/key-dates#f:@irsccoresubject=[Income tax])

If you're an overseas investor, you can either be a

*   notified foreign investor
*   non-resident investor.

Portfolio investment entity (PIE) income is taxed differently depending on your situation.

Notified foreign investors
--------------------------

If you're a non-resident who holds an investment in a foreign investment PIE, you can notify the PIE you want to be a notified foreign investor (NFI).

To be an NFI, you cannot be:

*   resident in New Zealand
*   a controlled foreign company
*   a non-resident trustee of a New Zealand trust
*   a foreign investment fund with a New Zealand resident who has an income interest of 10% or more.

You'll need to provide your full name, date of birth, home country address and your IRD number equivalent.

Prescribed investor rates (PIRs) for non-residents
--------------------------------------------------

If you're an NFI in a foreign investment variable-rate PIE, you must use the [prescribed investor rate (PIR)](/api/glossary/item?id={512D9328-39AB-4FC1-8E40-B4782AD917E5})
 applicable to the income types and sources.

If you're an NFI in a foreign investment zero-rate PIE, you must use the 0% PIR. 

If you tell your [multi-rate PIE (MRP)](/api/glossary/item?id={410C66D9-6D77-4180-BAED-71164C774ECD})
 that you've either become a notified foreign investor or stopped being one during a year, the PIE income or loss may be included in your income tax assessment for the year. There are a number of potential scenarios the PIE needs to consider. Refer to our ‘Portfolio investment entity guide – IR860’ under the heading 'Investor changes residence'.

If you're a non-resident (individual or entity) and are not a notified foreign investor, then your PIR is 28%. You cannot choose a lower rate.

Multi-rate PIE income and your tax return
-----------------------------------------

Income from an MRP must be included in your tax return if you:

*   used a PIR that's too low
*   have been taxed at 0% (zero-rated) because you exited an MRP during a quarter, except for NFIs of a foreign investment PIE
*   have been incorrectly treated as an NFI.

Dividends or distributions from an MRP are excluded income. This means they’re not included in your end-of-year tax return or assessment.

If you exit an MRP that files quarterly, any remaining interest may be paid to us instead. We'll be paid the interest within a month after the end of the quarter that you exited in. You'll be entitled to a tax credit for this amount in your annual income tax return or assessment.

BR Prd 22/02 | 21 February 2022 Page 1 of 5 Product Ruling – BR Prd 22/02 This is a product ruling made under s 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Ovato Residential Distribution NZ Limited (Ovato Residential). Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of: •ss DA 2, RA 5, RD 5, RD 7 and RD 8; •s 6 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the engagement of Supervisors by Ovato Residential under an Independent Contractor Contract (the Contract) to provide certain supervisory services in relation to the delivery of unaddressed mail such as free newsletters, community newspapers, magazines, directories, circulars and samples and other similar items to households and other premises throughout New Zealand. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1)Ovato Residential is in the business of distributing unaddressed mail such as newsletters, newspapers, circulars, flyers, mailers, catalogues, pamphlets and other similar items to households and other premises throughout New Zealand. 2)Supervisors are people who are contracted or are to be contracted by Ovato Residential to provide certain supervisory services in relation to the delivery of unaddressed mail in New Zealand. 3)Ovato Residential also contracts with Deliverers, although they are not technically parties to the Arrangement. Deliverers are people who physically deliver the unaddressed mail from drop-off locations to households and other premises throughout New Zealand. BR Prd 22/02 | 21 February 2022 Page 2 of 5 4)Ovato Residential distributes only unaddressed mail. Ovato Residential is not registered as a “postal operator” under the Postal Services Act 1998, as it is not involved in the carriage of “letters” (as defined in s 2 of the Postal Services Act 1998) or addressed mail. 5)The Contract contains the following defined terms and their meanings. •“Contractor” means the same as “Supervisor”. •“Distributor” means the deliverer who physically delivers the unaddressed mail and this term is equivalent to and interchangeable with the term “Deliverer”. •“Manual” means the Supervisor’s Instructions published by Ovato Residential. 6)Ovato Residential provides a Manual to the Supervisors that contains the Supervisor’s Instructions published by Ovato Residential. This does not, however, affect the nature of the contractual relationship between Ovato Residential and the Supervisors. Main terms of the Contract 7)Under the heading “The Services”, the Contract requires the Supervisor to: •Ensure all unaddressed mails are delivered to households in accordance with Ovato Residential’s instructions. •Be aware that Ovato Residential may vary the volume of deliveries or make changes in areas serviced by the Supervisor. •Be responsible for the appointment of Deliverers. •Oversee the delivery of material by contracted Deliverers in a defined area and to complete related tasks. •Not pay Deliverers directly. •Familiarise themselves with, and fully comply with, the Manual (and any amendments) and any applicable legislation, including that related to tax and health and safety. 8)Under the heading “Payment”, the Contract states that Ovato Residential shall pay the Supervisor for services rendered. The basis for calculating the payment is the quantity for each job, as shown on the Supervisor’s worksheet (or contractor invoice inquiry) for the Deliverers supervised by the Supervisor. Schedule 2 specifies the fees Ovato Residential is to pay the Supervisor. 9)All payments the Supervisor receives are gross payments. The Supervisor is solely responsible for their own Accident Compensation Corporation levies, income tax BR Prd 22/02 | 21 February 2022 Page 3 of 5 liabilities and GST liability, or any other income-related payments that may be legislated for in the future. As the contractor is not an employee, the contractor expressly acknowledges that they shall not be entitled to any employment-related payments or benefits. 10)Under the heading “Motor Vehicle, Telephone, Office and Storage Facilities”, the Contract states that the Supervisor is responsible for providing their own equipment (such as personal office supplies, a telephone, a vehicle, and wet weather gear) at their own expense. The Supervisor is also responsible for ensuring that such equipment is well maintained, safe and fit for purpose. The Supervisor will be responsible for all costs and services incurred in providing the services. 11)Under the heading “Liability and Claims”, the Contract states that the Supervisor shall be responsible for all errors, omissions, loss or damage that are their responsibility as established by standards of service and compliance with the Manual as Ovato Residential requires. This means that Ovato Residential will not be liable to the Supervisor for any loss or damage resulting from the Supervisor’s deliberate actions or negligence or where there is a breach of any term of the Contract, including the Manual. 12)The Supervisor must take out an insurance to indemnify Ovato Residential against any damage or loss arising from the Supervisor’s actions or relating to the services that the Supervisor will provide. 13)Under the heading “Relief Supervisor”, the Contract states that the Supervisor shall appoint a Relief Supervisor to temporarily undertake the obligations of the Supervisor if the Supervisor is unable to work due to illness or temporary absence. An appointment of a Relief Supervisor by the Supervisor must have written approval from by Ovato Residential. The Supervisor is solely responsible for payment and all other obligations to others who help them in this way. 14)Under the heading “Termination”, the Contract states that either party may terminate the Contract by giving the other party one month’s notice in writing. Furthermore, Ovato Residential may terminate the Contract immediately if there has been a serious breach. 15)Under the heading “Relationship”, the parties acknowledge that the Supervisor is an independent contracting party and not an agent or employee of Ovato Residential. 16)Under the heading “General”, the Contract provides a process of resolving any dispute or conflict that arises. 17)The Contract includes two schedules: BR Prd 22/02 | 21 February 2022 Page 4 of 5 •Schedule 1 contains the personal information of the Supervisor contracted by Ovato Residential. •Schedule 2 specifies the Supervisor’s rates of payment based on quantities and weights of items. 18)The Contract will remain materially the same as the version provided to Inland Revenue on 22 November 2021. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: (a)For the purposes of the “PAYE rules”, payments Ovato Residential makes to a Supervisor under the Contract will not be “salary or wages”, or “extra pay”, or a “schedular payment” within the meaning of those terms as defined in ss RD 5, RD 7 and RD 8 of the Act respectively. (b)For the purposes of s DA 2(4) of the Act, any payment Ovato Residential makes to a Supervisor under the Contract will not constitute “income from employment”. (c)Under s RA 5(1)(a) of the Act, Ovato Residential is not required to withhold tax from payments it makes to a Supervisor under the Contract. (d)For the purposes of the GST Act, s 6(3)(b) will not exclude the provision of services by any Supervisor under the Contract from the definition of “taxable activity” in s 6(1). The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 1 December 2017 and ending on 30 June 2024. This Ruling is signed by me on the 21st day of February 2022 Graham Poppelwell Group Lead BR Prd 22/02 | 21 February 2022 Page 5 of 5 About this document Product Rulings are issued by the Tax Counsel Office and Customer and Compliance Services. Product Rulings set out the Commissioner’s view on how tax laws apply to a particular “product” – which is an arrangement that a specified taxpayer is likely to enter into with a number of people on identical terms. Taxpayers who enter into the arrangement described in a Product Ruling may apply the ruling but are not obliged to do so. Product Rulings are binding on the Commissioner. This means that if you are entitled to apply a Product Ruling and you have calculated your tax liability in accordance with the ruling, the Commissioner must accept that assessment. A Product Ruling applies only to the taxation laws and arrangement set out in the ruling, and only for the period specified in the ruling. It is important to note that a general similarity to an arrangement covered by a Product Ruling will not necessarily lead to the same tax result.

Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1)Ovato Residential is in the business of distributing unaddressed mail such as newsletters, newspapers, circulars, flyers, mailers, catalogues, pamphlets and other similar items to households and other premises throughout New Zealand. 2)Ovato Residential distributes only unaddressed mail. Ovato Residential is not registered as a “postal operator” under the Postal Services Act 1998, as it is not involved in the carriage of “letters” (as defined in s 2 of the Postal Services Act 1998) or addressed mail. 3)Ovato Residential engages the Deliverers under the Contract, which includes a Deliverers’ Handbook that sets out the conditions that the Deliverers agree to abide by. BR Prd 22/03 | 21 February 2022 Page 2 of 4 Main terms of the Contract 4)Under the heading “Description of Services”, the Contract requires the Deliverer to deliver product as provided by Ovato Residential on a pre-agreed schedule to private addresses, and the parties acknowledge that the Deliverer is an independent contractor and not an agent, partner or employee of Ovato Residential. 5)Under the heading “Payment”, the Contract states that the Deliverer is solely responsible for their own Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) levies, income tax liabilities and GST liabilities. The Deliverer also acknowledges that the Contract is not a contract of employment governed by the Employment Relations Act 2000 and the Holidays Act 2003. Both parties acknowledge and agree that all payments received by the Deliverer pursuant to this agreement are gross payments. 6)Under the heading “Delivery Payment Rates”, the Contract specifies the standard minimum rates based on the number of items delivered, type of item and weight. 7)Under the heading “Reduction/Variation of Workload”, the Contract states that due to the nature of Ovato Residential’s business, it may cease to distribute any regular publications without notice, and that the volume and timing of work may vary. 8)Under the heading “Performance of Services”, the Contract states that: •The Deliverer may subcontract the services, or otherwise engage or obtain assistance from others to perform the services. •The Deliverer may provide and use (at the Deliverer’s cost, expense and risk) a car, trolley or other carrying equipment in connection with the delivery of the items. Scooters and motorcycles are also acceptable. •The Deliverer is an independent contractor and as such is free to select their own means and methods of performing the services and the hours during which they will perform the services, as long as they keep within the delivery window Ovato Residential has requested. •The Deliverer is responsible/liable for all errors, omissions, loss or damage that are the Deliverer’s responsibility/liability as established by the Contract. 9)Under the heading “Termination”, the Contract states that either party may terminate the Contract by giving the other party 14 days’ notice in writing. Furthermore, Ovato Residential may terminate the Contract immediately if there has been a serious breach. 10)The Deliverers’ Handbook part of the Contract provides the following information to the Deliverer: •which houses to deliver to and how to deliver circulars; BR Prd 22/03 | 21 February 2022 Page 3 of 4 •when deliveries are to be done and what the regular delivery days are; •getting the correct number of circulars; •what to do in the event of absence; •reporting injuries and other problems with deliveries to their Supervisor; •dealing with dog issues and interference with delivered material; •completing an ACC form in the case of injury (the handbook reiterates that Deliverers are self-employed and states that they should not enter Ovato Residential as an employer on the ACC form); •disposing of excess circulars; •delivering during daylight and taking care crossing roads; •health and safety procedures. 11)The Contract will remain materially the same as the version provided to Inland Revenue on 22 November 2021. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: (a)For the purpose of the “PAYE rules”, payments Ovato Residential makes to a Deliverer under the Contract will not be “salary or wages”, or “extra pay”, or a “schedular payment” within the meaning of those terms as defined in ss RD 5, RD 7 and RD 8 of the Act respectively.

Tax Payments - when received in time (Dec 03) (WITHDRAWN)
=========================================================

Withdrawn PRC-101 Tax Payments - when received in time (Dec 03). Statement provided for historical purposes only.

Withdrawn
---------

This statement has been withdrawn and is provided for historical purposes only.

Tax payments - when received in time

This statement also appears in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 15, No 12 (December 2003).

### Introduction

1.  This Standard Practice Statement (SPS) sets out the Commissioner's practice for accepting tax payments as having been made in time.

### Application

2.  This SPS replaces SPS PRC-100 _Tax payments - when received in time_ and will apply from 19 December 2003.

### Background

3.  SPS PRC-100 _Tax payments - when received in time_ (_Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 10, No 4 (April 1998)) set out when the Commissioner would accept payments as having been made in time.  Since that publication there have been changes in the way taxpayers make payments to Inland Revenue.  The purpose of this SPS is to reflect those changes and inform taxpayers when a payment will be accepted as having been made in time.  
      
    
4.  This SPS refers to:
    *   Payments by post
    *   Electronic payments
    *   Physical delivery
    *   Post-dated cheques
    *   Weekends and public holidays
    *   Tax pooling, and
    *   Tax transfers.  
        

### Standard Practice

5.  This standard practice applies to all tax types, including Goods and Services Tax (GST) and Child Support payments.

**Payments by post**

6.  Payments will be accepted as being received in time if mailed and postmarked on or by the due date.  
      
    
7.  For Rural Delivery taxpayers, the date of payment is when it is received by New Zealand Post or similar provider.  It is not when the payment is placed in the taxpayer's personal mail box for collection.

8.  An overseas postmark cannot be used to determine the date a payment was received by Inland Revenue from a taxpayer living or working overseas.  Accordingly, normally the time of actual receipt by Inland Revenue will be used.

**Electronic payments**

9.  Taxpayers may make payments electronically, including internet banking.  A payment will be received in time when it has been electronically paid or direct credited into an Inland Revenue account either on or before the due date.  Internet payments must be completed prior to the end of the banks' online business hours to be recorded as received on that specific day.  Internet payments after these online business hours will be processed on the next business day.   
      
    
10.  In the context of electronic payments, "business hours" means the hours a bank makes available to customers to initiate electronic payments on any given day.  Payments made after these hours will be processed by the bank as at the next business day.

_Overseas payments_

11.  A payment will be received in time when it has been electronically paid or direct credited into an Inland Revenue account either on or before the New Zealand due date.

**Physical delivery**

12.  A payment will be accepted as being received in time if it is deposited into an Inland Revenue drop box by the close of business on the due date. 

_Westpac payments_

13.  Taxpayers may also make payments at most branches of Westpac.  Payments can be made over the counter or via drop boxes.  The payment is received in time if it is physically handed into a Westpac branch by the close of business on the due date.

**Post-dated cheques**

14.  Inland Revenue will not bank post-dated cheques until the specified date. A cheque that is post-dated after the due date, even though it is received on or before the due date, will be treated as late.  This applies to payments that are posted or physically delivered.

**Weekends and public holidays**

15.  If a due date falls on a weekend or a public holiday (including a provincial anniversary day), Inland Revenue will accept a payment without charging a penalty when it is handed in or posted on the next working day.

_Electronic payments_

16.  If a due date falls on a weekend or a public holiday (including a provincial anniversary day), then an electronic payment will be accepted as in time when it is credited into an Inland Revenue account on the next working day.

_GST payments_

17.  Payments will be accepted as being received in time if mailed and postmarked on or by the due date.  GST payments are due on the last working day of the month.  There is one exception to the GST rule.  GST payments, which would normally be due on the last working day of December, are due on 15 January.

**Tax pooling**

18.  In cases of tax pooling, the date of payment is when the intermediary makes the tax payment to Inland Revenue.  For more information on the implications of tax pooling please refer to _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003).

**Tax Transfers**

19.  For the rules regarding the transfers of overpaid taxes please refer to _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 14, No 11 (November 2002).

10 Dec 2003
Privacy Impact Assessment Addendum – High Wealth Individuals Research Project 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Privacy Impact Assessment - Addendum 1 October 2022 Financial Collection – conducted in two parts 1. To minimise compliance costs on individuals, Collection 3, the Financial Collection, was split into two parts – Financial Collection (Collection 3A) and Supplemental Financial Collection (Collection 3B). In Collection 3A a section 17GB notice was issued to all individuals (HWIs and disclosed partners) and in Collection 3B a section 17GB notice was only issued to those individuals for whom Inland Revenue held insufficient or inadequate financial statement information for entities they had previously disclosed. 2. The section 17GB notice for Collection 3A was issued in June 2022 with responses due in August 2022 (unless an extension was granted). Collection 3A asked for a range of financial information about things such as expenditure, inheritances, real property, investments and trusts, to enable estimation of the income measures, the attribution of some sources of income to individuals and the calculation of the effective tax rates. If individuals were not able to provide the information requested about trusts, they were asked to provide contact details for someone who could. 3. The actual process used for Collection 3A (as well as Collection 2 – Family Details) involved sending a blank excel spreadsheet along with a guide on how to complete the spreadsheet. These documents were emailed to the individuals and their nominated representative from the Qualtrics platform. If the Project team did not have an email address the documents were couriered. Once completed, the spreadsheet was uploaded via Qualtrics, emailed to the Project’s email address (entity.collection@ird.govt.nz) or posted back. 4. Less than 10% of the Project’s population were involved in Collection 3B. These section 17GB notices were issued in early August 2022 and responses are due in mid-September (unless an extension has been granted). The financial information requested in this notice matches certain fields in the IR10 form. Significant effort went in to cleaning up the data that had previously been submitted to enable internal data to be used wherever reasonably practicable. Further, to minimise the amount of additional information required from individuals, t hresholds were applied and the periods for which information was required was limited to the minimum acceptable for the Project’s needs. Where multiple individuals had disclosed an entity in their response to Collection 2 (Entity Collection), the information was only sought from one person. 5. The data collection method for Collection 3B differed from Collections 1, 2, and 3A as spreadsheets were pre-populated with the specific entities and particular financial years that were required. Previously, blank spreadsheets or forms were used. 6. To ensure the correct individuals, entities and financial years were selected for Collection 3B, in-depth review of the data was undertaken and matched to the Collection 3B criteria. This included manual inspection of a large proportion of the data output against the criteria, disclosure statements, START, related DIP tables and the Companies Office website. Privacy Impact Assessment Addendum – High Wealth Individuals Research Project 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 7. A thorough manual quality check of the prepopulated spreadsheets and emails was undertaken as part of the email sending process. This included checking the entities and years against the data used to generate output, as well as checking back to the disclosure statements provided by the individual. This work was only undertaken by individuals on the Rawa Data Team. 8. The prepopulated spreadsheets and guide were sent by encrypted email from the Project’s email address (etrproject@ird.govt.nz), rather than from the Qualtrics platform ( only staff on the Rawa Data Team APL have access to this inbox). Where no email address was held for either the individual or an authorised representative, a prepopulated hardcopy spreadsheet and guide were couriered. Completed spreadsheets can be uploaded via the Qualtrics platform, emailed or posted . 9. As with prior collections and subject to what is described below, information will be transferred to the secure spaces) and deleted from the email inbox, and hard copies destroyed. The secure spaces are the secure SharePoint site and POW. Use of secure SharePoint sites 10. As Excel spreadsheets have been used for the Entity and Financial Collections, the most efficient way to clean and process the disclosed data has been via Microsoft Power Query and other Microsoft 365 tools. A full security risk assessment was done for the Microsoft 365 environment before it was rolled out at Inland Revenue, so risks were identified and managed. 11. In addition to cleaning and checking collected data within Microsoft Power Query, it is more efficient and transparent to use the secure SharePoint site, Excel and native tools (e.g., tables) for some analysis, due to the complex nature of matching and analysing the collected information in conjunction with the information already held by Inland Revenue. Furthermore, more of the Rawa Data Team (who are on the authorised persons list and therefore may view all information relating to this project) will be able to provide quality assurance for the analysis. 12. To manage security risks, t eam members will only use their approved Inland Revenue device and will not utilise the web portal, email data to each other, or attempt to remove by other means (e.g., external USB drives). 13. The use of a restricted-access SharePoint library for the cleaning and processing of information collected under section 17GB, and some analysis, is different to the anticipated process that was described in the Privacy Impact Assessment dated 7 December 2021. However, the SharePoint library is subject to access controls (only the Rawa Data Team have access to this library) which can be audited, and this approach has proven to be the most efficient way to manage the large amounts of data used by the Project. A n updated diagram showing the flow of information is set out below. 14. The restricted-access SharePoint library containing family details information collected under section 17GB and recording compliance with section 17GB notices (referred to in the Privacy Impact Assessment at pages 8 and 14) is separate and distinct from the SharePoint library described above. Privacy Impact Assessment Addendum – High Wealth Individuals Research Project 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Ongoing checks to ensure no project-related information is on START 15. A small amount of Project-related correspondence has been located on START (Inland Revenue’s tax system). It appears that a number of participants or representatives have sent written correspondence or submitted disclosure statements through MyIR, and occasionally, Inland Revenue personnel outside of the Project have entered case notes on START which references the participant’s involvement with the Project. The reasons for these correspondences include that participants or representatives suspected that correspondence may be illegitimate or spam, or they were unaware that the Project is not using MyIR for any correspondence. 16. The Project team has developed processes to ensure any confidential information is moved from START into the secure location for information relating to the Project, and that any data is deleted from START. Ongoing checks will ensure that any further information entered into START will be removed, although it is expected that this will not be an ongoing problem as the Project moves from the information collection stage into analysis. Access 17. The APLs have been updated to reflect changes in personnel and additional resourcing as required: I. Rawa Data Team – 15 people II. Family Details – Rawa Data Team and 9 additional people III. IT & Technology - 26 people 18. The IT & Technology APL was created so Inland Revenue’s technological support teams could triage IT issues and requests raised. These requests include invitations to the project’s ECHO site or technological/communications issues (e.g. encrypted emails). Access for a variety of technological purposes was foreshadowed at page 14 of the Privacy Impact Assessment, but a specific APL has been created to ensure Privacy Impact Assessment Addendum – High Wealth Individuals Research Project 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] oversight of this activity. Although there are 26 people on the IT & Technology APL, access is only permitted as is required to address technology issues and information disclosed is the minimum necessary to address the particular issue. 19. There are two email addresses associated with the Project - the Project’s general email address (etrproject@ird.govt.nz) which is used for general correspondence and the Entity Collection email address (entity.collection@ird.govt.nz) which is where completed disclosure statements are submitted by email or any substantive queries about the section 17GB notices are sent. To allow for processing of returned disclosure statements, and to promptly answer any questions, those with access to the Project’s general inbox (etrproject@ird.govt.nz) have been added to the Rawa Data Team APL. This ensures that any section 17GB information that comes into the Project via email is only seen by the Rawa Data Team. Unique Identifiers 20. In Collection 2 individuals were asked to create a unique identifier for each entity that was disclosed. The purpose was to create an extra layer of privacy protection if the Project needed to disclose an entity back to the individual or nominated representative. This step was not completed by all. As such, when entities are disclosed back to an individual in Collection 3B, the unique identifier will be included (where one was provided) along with the entity name as disclosed (which may or may not be the correct legal name or name held by Inland Revenue). The entity’s IRD number will not be used. 21. A unique identifier has also been allocated to each family unit (HWI, domestic partner and any qualifying children), known as the Family ID or FAM ID. The family unit is not information that Inland Revenue currently holds but it is required for this analysis as the measures of income will be applied separately to HWIs and their family. It will allow data to be aggregated from an individual to a family level. 22. The unique identifier is a number (1 through to the number of families) and is only recorded in the Project’s secure data storage spaces such as SharePoint and the POW. I t is not available to anyone outside the APLs. It is a temporary identifier that will be destroyed at the completion of the Project. Data and Information Management Plan 23. A Data and Information Management Plan (DIM Plan) has been created for the Project. The purpose of the DIM Plan is to ensure appropriate data, information, and knowledge management related due diligence is being conducted for the Project. The DIM Plan sits alongside the PIA. In the DIM Plan the high-level areas of the Project’s activity have been broken down into their process, system, role, and data and information facets. Inland Revenue’s data and information related enterprise risks have then been applied to these facets to identify specific risks. Controls and their owners have been identified to manage risks.

This includes understanding whether the tax system is effective and efficient in delivering on the policy intent - including meeting the Government’s distributional objectives; is operating as intended; and remains fit for purpose. Inland Revenue currently lacks important information to be able to evaluate the equity and efficiency of the tax system in an evidence-based way. A key gap in the information base is information on full economic income ( which seeks to measure the increase in an individual’s ability to consume goods and services over a period). This information gap is especially apparent for high wealth individuals (HWIs), who as a small cohort are not well sampled in current surveys that capture information on wealth, such as the Household Economic Survey (HES). Given this, Inland Revenue received funding in 2021 to undertake research aimed at better understanding the level of progressivity observed in New Zealand, by seeking to understand the amount of tax HWIs pay relative to economic measures of income. To do this, Inland Revenue has identified a HWI population group and is seeking to estimate various concepts of economic income and effective tax rates for t his group for the period 2016-2021. For comparability purposes, the information and methods used within the Project will closely relate to those used by Stats NZ, where appropriate. In terms of data sources, Inland Revenue is first utilising reasonably available internal data (administrative data) and external data sources (e.g. public databases) on the HWIs. However, there are gaps in this data and therefore Inland Revenue will need to collect information from the individuals. Initially, the HWI lead will be asked to provide details of their partner and dependent children (as defined). This is required because the Project will calculate measures of income for the family unit. Inland Revenue will then collect information on the entities and business undertakings the HWI lead and their partner, respectively, have an interest in. Then, the HWI lead and their partner will respectively be asked to provide a range of financial information that will be used to calculate measures of economic income. The HWI lead will also be asked to provide equivalent information for any dependent children (subject to a threshold). All three of these requests will be made under section 17GB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). Information collected under section 17GB cannot be used by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue in proceedings against that person (section 17GB(2)). Consistent with this, Inland Revenue has put in place a number of operational procedures to ensure that the information collected for this Project is only used for the purpose of the Project. These are detailed in this PIA. The information will be used to produce a public report on the effective tax rates (ETR) paid out of economic income for these households, to be published in mid-2023. This report will enrich the evidence base available on the progressivity of the tax system and will contribute to improved policy advice in the future. The report will not provide personally identifiable information on any individual. Privacy Impact Assessment – High Wealth Individuals Research Project V1 5 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 1.2 Governance A Governance Group was formed in March 2021 to oversee the Project. Membership is made up of tier 2 and tier 3 officials from across the department. The group includes a nominated member from the Treasury’s Tax Strategy team, and a Stats NZ official attends as an observer, to ensure cross government co-ordination. Membership on the Governance Group does not grant access to collected information. As at the date this PIA is issued, membership of the Governance Group is: • David Carrigan, Deputy Commissioner, P olicy and Regulatory Stewardship (PaR S) – Chair • Tony Morris, Significant Enterprises • Tina Maclean, Intelligence Leader • Chris Cullinan, Intelligence Leader • Geoffrey Frost, B usiness Transformation • Ron Grindle, Business Transformation • Nominated member from the Treasury Tax Strategy team • Phil Whittington, Chief Economist, PaRS • Karen Whitiskie, Legal Services. This Project is led by a project team within the PaRS business unit. Services are provided to this team from other parts of Inland Revenue. 1.3 Scope of the PIA This PIA covers the life cycle of information collected for the Project. This includes the collection, storage, use, flow, access, disclosure and disposal of the information. 1 An assumption is that Qualtrics will be the main collection instrument. The security features of Qualtrics are discussed in this PIA (see IPP 5). The matters set out in the PIA are current as at the date of issue. 1 The GDPR is not relevant as we are not requesting information from individuals who are resident in the EU. Privacy Impact Assessment – High Wealth Individuals Research Project V1 7 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] ‘Personal information’ is any information that is capable of identifying a living human being. It doesn’t have to be sensitive or negative information just so long as someone could be identified by it. However, the level of sensitivity, and impact on individuals, will influence the privacy risks in managing the information. 2 Personal information 2.1 Information to be used in the Project Personal information will be used and collected in this Project. This will include names, contact details, IRD numbers, connections to entities, financial details and family relationships. The Project will use personal information: • already held by Inland Revenue, • sourced from public registers, such as the Companies Register; and • new information collected directly from individuals. Personal information will be collected at three main points of time: 1. Collection 1 – Family details November 2021: HWIs will be asked for information on their family details, such as the name, date of birth, contact details and IRD numbers (if known) of their partner and the number of dependent children (as defined). They will be asked to provide the names, date of birth and IRD number (if known) of dependent children that hold significant assets or earn significant income. 2. Collection 2 – Entity links Approximately February 2022: HWIs and, separately, their partners will respectively be asked to supply information in relation to entities and business undertakings in which they have a non-portfolio interest. HWIs will also be asked to provide information on entities that their dependent children (identified in Collection 1) have a significant interest in. An interest will include where, for example, the individual is a settlor, trustee, named beneficiary and/or appointer of a trust, and where the individual is a shareholder of a company. 3. Collection 3– Financial information Approximately June 2022: HWIs and, separately, their partners will respectively be asked to provide a range of financial information on themselves and on entities they have an interest in. In some instances, information may be requested directly from entities. This information will include entity balance sheet and income statement information, information on investments, and holdings of significant personal assets (e.g. real property). De minimis thresholds will apply where appropriate. While the lead and partner will receive separate requests, they may choose to provide consolidated information. The personal information described above is required to calculate the income measures and effective tax rates required for the purpose of the Project. These measures are calculated on a family unit basis. Only personal information that is required to fulfil the purpose of the Project will be used. Privacy Impact Assessment – High Wealth Individuals Research Project V1 8 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 2.2 Information flows Qualtrics will be the main collection platform. In Collection 1 HWIs were asked to complete an online form via Qualtrics, however, they could also respond by email and by mail. Collections 2 and 3 will use Qualtrics to deliver spreadsheets for individuals to download and complete, to be uploaded via Qualtrics, or provide an on-line form. If an individual does not upload the information via the secure Qualtrics platform they will need to use secure email. Collected information will ultimately be stored in the Policy Only Workspace (POW) within the Data Intelligence Platform (DIP). The DIP has undergone a Certification and Accreditation (C&A) process conducted by Inland Revenue’s Chief Information Security Officer. POW can only be accessed by the Rawa Data Team (RDT). Following receipt from collection, information will be transferred to the POW and deleted from Qualtrics and emails, and hard copies destroyed. Information may be temporarily stored in a restricted SharePoint site as part of the process of transferring the information into the POW. Some limited i nformation (for example, names, IRD numbers and contact details) will remain in a restricted SharePoint site for the purposes of contacting individuals, sourcing internal data and to record compliance with the section 17GB notices. Information sourced from tax returns and public registers will be transferred into the DIP RIMU lab and accessed by the RDT from there. T hese labs (POW and RIMU), where they are restricted to the RDT, are called the secure data lab. Analysis will take place in the secure data lab. Only non-identifiable information will be shared outside of the secure data lab (an exception is information used to assess compliance with and enforce a section 17GB notice). Only aggregate or synthetic data that does not identify individuals will be released publicly (see IPP10). Collected information will be destroyed on completion of the report (synthetic data may be retained). A data plan setting out the flow of data will be created and approved at Deputy Commissioner level. Privacy Impact Assessment – High Wealth Individuals Research Project V1 14 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Individuals on the RDT APL have access to all collected information. The RDT APL is made up of a small number of identified data and policy analysts, an d people from CIE required to extract data from Q ualtrics. Individuals on the RDT APL will be provided a letter of expectations setting out the expectations of this APL. This includes not sharing the information outside of those on the RDT APL and following the sharing protocols (below). Additionally, these people will need to declare a conflict of interest if in future work at Inland Revenue that work involves knowledge of any HWIs they have gained knowledge of through the Project. New APLs may be needed if individuals have needs to access limited data sets, for example, named analysts for analytical support or Legal Services representatives in relation to non- compliance with section 17GB notices. Multiple APLs are created to ensure individuals’ access to information is restricted to business need. Inland Revenue administration staff have access to Inland Revenue tools, platforms and documents associated with these. They will not access information without a specific reason to do so, such as a major technology issue. These people could include, but are not limited to, SharePoint Administrators, Workplace Technology Services and DIP administrators . Audit logs are in place so that any activity can be tracked. All Inland Revenue staff are subject to confidentiality obligations. Before an Inland Revenue employee performs their first official duty they must complete a declaration of confidentiality (see s18B(1)). Any unlawful disclosure of taxpayer information by an Inland Revenue employee is a potential criminal offence with a maximum sentence of six months imprisonment and a $15,000 fine (see sections 18(1) and 14(C)). Unlawful disclosures include disclosures that are made internally within Inland Revenue without a legitimate business purpose or lawful authority. This obligation by law continues after an Inland Revenue employee has left the organisation (see s16C(4)(b)(ii)). Beyond the possibility of criminal prosecution, a breach of confidentiality will be a matter of serious misconduct under Inland Revenue’s Code of Conduct. Access to information that is otherwise restricted to those on APLs would be in accordance with permitted disclosures and disclosures required by law, as described below (IPP 11). Storage To ensure only authorised persons have access to collected information, the collected information will be held in the Policy Only Workspace in the DIP ( except as noted below and during the process to transfer to POW). Access to POW is limited to a subset of people on the RDT APL (approximately 5 people). These people will undertake the analysis of collected information in POW. Access to the secure data lab can be audited if required. There are three circumstances where collected information will be stored in a restricted access SharePoint page: • The first is a master list of the name, contact details and authorised agent for the HWI lead. This information is not collected under section 17GB but is restricted to those with a business need relating to the Project. • The second is names, IRD numbers and contacts details of HWI partners and dependent children, obtained pursuant to section 17GB. This information is restricted to the Family details APL and is needed to contact people and obtain administrative data. • Third, entity and financial information may be temporarily stored in a restricted SharePoint site until importation into the POW in the DIP is finalised and useability is confirmed. If there is any delay in converting hardcopy documents to electronic form, these documents will be stored in a safe (for which access is restricted to a single person). Hardcopy documents will be securely destroyed following being converted to electronic form.

Low Privacy Impact Assessment – High Wealth Individuals Research Project V1 26 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 4.2 Summary of risks There is a potential risk that Inland Revenue may seek to obtain more information from individuals than is needed or that individuals may consider the request unreasonably intrusive or burdensome. This risk will be addressed by taking steps to ensure that each category of information requested is required for the purposes of the Project and it is not practicable for the project team to obtain it from other sources. The risks to unauthorised use of the information (that is, for purposes other than the Project) are mitigated by storing collected data in a secure data lab or restricted sites, which only authorised persons can access. These authorised persons are listed and are given clear expectations of how to handle the data. Additionally, data collected under section 17GB will be destroyed at the end of the Project and this will be audited by the IKM team. There is a risk that agent contact details are wrong on Inland Revenue’s system or that the wrong agent is contacted. Only limited information (names) will be shared with agents until a specific authorisation is obtained for the Project. There is a risk that individuals’ contact details may not be up to date on Inland Revenue’s systems. We will use contact details on Inland Revenue’s START system and run a verification process for this information. All communications are subject to a two- person addressee checking process before being sent to minimise sending errors. Letters are couriered in a secure package, and personal service used if an address is doubtful. Partners are treated as separate individuals for information gathering purposes. The only information Inland Revenue will disclose on one partner to another is name and that they are in the population. Couples may choose to provide a joint response, but this is not required.

Privacy (Information Sharing Agreement between Inland Revenue and New Zealand Police) Order 2014
================================================================================================

2014 Order in Council approves a new information-sharing agreement between IR and the NZ Police for the prevention or investigation of crime.

The Privacy (Information Sharing Agreement between Inland Revenue and New Zealand Police) Order 2014 approves a new information-sharing agreement between Inland Revenue and the New Zealand Police. Under the agreement, Inland Revenue will be able to share personal information with the New Zealand Police for the prevention, detection, investigation of, or use as evidence of, a serious crime.

Information will only be shared when:

Privilege for in-house legal advice not waived
==============================================

2014 case note - High Court found that advice provided to the CIR by an in-house lawyer was privileged and privilege had not been waived by the CIR.

Case

Accountants First Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2014\] NZHC 1723

Legislative References

Evidence Act 2006

### Summary

The High Court dismissed the application. The Court found that advice provided to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") by an in-house lawyer was privileged. Privilege in the legal advice had not been waived by the Commissioner.

### Impact of decision

The advice of in-house lawyers attracts privilege in the normal way and will be upheld if they are not involved in the executive function. The court will be reluctant to go behind a lawyer who provides evidence that they were giving legal advice in the course of providing professional legal services.

Waiver in terms of section 65(3)(a) of the Evidence Act 2006 will only occur if the legal advice is put into issue in the proceeding. It is well established that this requires both asserting reliance on the advice, as well as injecting the substance of the advice into evidence. A bare reference to legal advice will be insufficient to amount to a waiver of privilege.

### Facts

This decision relates to an interlocutory application brought by the applicant ("Accountants First Ltd") challenging the Commissioner's claim of legal professional privilege for advice provided by an in-house lawyer employed by the Commissioner.

The substantive matter is a judicial review. The applicant is a tax agent. Along with its principal, Mr Imran Kamal, the applicant was convicted of tax evasion under the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA"). Consequently, a decision was made by the Commissioner under section 34B of the TAA to remove the applicant from the list of tax agents. The applicant is seeking judicial review of that decision.

### Decision

The Court found that the lawyer's role in the process leading to the decision to cancel the applicant's standing as a tax agent did not compromise his status within the process as an independent legal adviser. The legal advice in issue was given in direct response to a request for legal advice and the circumstances did not undermine the subsequent claim of privilege. There was no strength to the allegation of waiver.

#### _Legal advice_

In _Martinovich v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2014\] NZHC 1357 at \[29\], Fogarty J asked whether the in-house provider of advice was:

*   A lawyer on the Commissioner's staff who is a decision maker, exercising a delegated power to decide and thus performing an executive function, on the one hand, \[or\] a lawyer giving legal advice to a decision maker.

The applicant submitted the lawyer in question was so involved in the decision-making process that led to the removal of the applicant's tax agent status that his advice documents did not attract legal privilege.

Privilege was claimed over two documents. The first was advice given by email following a request on 8 August 2013 for legal advice in relation to the applicant's matter from the manager of the Community Compliance Unit of the Customer Services Group.

The second document was created eight days later. Another official involved in the process asked the lawyer for a copy of the legal advice and for further legal advice on the matter. This was provided by email.

The Court found that the circumstances supported the claim of privilege. The lawyer was employed to give internal legal advice. The lawyer described the request as being legal advice and the Court saw no reason to go behind that.

Further, the Court found the fact that the lawyer later authored a document within the process that did not attract privilege did not undermine the character of the advice given a month earlier.

The Court also noted that the lawyer was not in any sense the decision maker. His advice may be an important part in the process, but as noted in _Miller v CIR_ (1997) 18 NZTC 13,001 at 13,020, that did not rob it of its privileged status.

#### _Waiver_

The Court found there was nothing in this argument. The decision maker prepared an affidavit for the purposes of the judicial review proceeding in which she identified the documents that she had, and which she considered in reaching her decision. That was the only reference to the legal advice. The decision maker did not claim to have specifically relied on the advice, to have found it influential, nor did she seek to write the contents of the advice into her affidavit.

The Court held that it was well established that mere reference to a document does not threaten privilege, and that was the case here. While the limits inherent in judicial review, for example no cross-examination, mean the obligation of candour is strong, it does not mean that privilege did not apply or that there was something wrong in claiming it.

Procedural irregularities in tax assessments
============================================

2008 case note – Appeal against decision that income tax assessments valid and correct - assessment process, irregularities in assessment, jurisdiction of TRA.

Case

JD & CE Henson Partnership & Ors v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 1976, Tax Administration Act 1994, Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994

### Summary

Taxpayers' appeal against TRA decision which held that the income tax assessments were valid and correct. Taxpayers alleged that the assessments were invalid as they failed to quantify the amount of tax due and that the TRA lacked jurisdiction to hear a case where there were no valid assessments before it. Alternative argument on the correctness of the assessments. Appeal dismissed.

### Facts

This was an appeal by the taxpayers against a decision of the Taxation Review Authority in which the Authority upheld the validity and correctness of the Commissioner's income tax assessments.

The High Court dismissed the taxpayers' appeal.

The taxpayers operated as a partnership. Following an investigation, the Commissioner issued manual notices of assessment for the 1992-1995 income tax years on 17 September 1996. The notices of assessment set out the adjustments to be made to the assessable income of the taxpayers but did not state the amount of tax to be paid. On 15 October 1996, the Commissioner issued statements of account setting out the amount of tax to pay.

Following discussions with the taxpayers, further notices of assessment were issued on 20 February 1997. These notices were manually prepared and specified the adjusted assessable income of the taxpayers without specifying the amount of tax to be paid. On 26 February 1997 statements of account were issued which set out the amount of tax to be paid as a result of the reassessments.

Following a disagreement over the validity of the Commissioner's assessments and the taxpayers' purported dispute of the assessments, the taxpayers commenced Judicial Review proceedings against the Commissioner. The Judicial Review proceedings were subsequently settled. The settlement deed stated that there were "exceptional circumstances" that permitted the Commissioner to invoke his power under section 89K of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to accept the taxpayers' late notices of proposed adjustment. The deed stated that the notices of assessment issued on 17 September 1996 were to be treated as if they had been issued after 1 October 1996, which enabled the dispute to be dealt with under the statutory disputes procedure. The taxpayers' challenge proceedings in the TRA were unsuccessful.

### Decision

Appeal dismissed.

_Jurisdiction issue_

*   Tax liability has to be quantified and recorded for there to be a completed assessment. At the time the notices of assessment dated September 1996 and February 1997 were issued the assessment process was not completed. However, there is specific statutory authority which provides that procedural irregularities will not invalidate an assessment. In this case, what occurred was that the Commissioner made assessments that were irregularly notified to the taxpayers.
*   The settlement deed entered into between the Commissioner and the taxpayers cannot be read to confine the parties to only disputing the assessments dated September 1996 and February 1997. When the parties entered into the deed they were aware that it was the Commissioner's income tax assessments for the 1992-1995 tax years which were being disputed. The deed was executed against a statutory background in which Parliament made express provision that procedural irregularities could not invalidate an assessment. The judge reaffirmed the Court of Appeal in _Miller,_ which referred to the need to avoid permitting "formalism run riot". Her Honour stated that to hold otherwise would be "overly formal, unrealistic and nonsensical".

_Correctness issues_

*   The taxpayers had incorrectly included a $6,400 capital payment as income in the 1992 year; the Commissioner's assessment in 1993 was to correct this error. There is nothing to suggest that the appellants were prejudiced by the adjustment not being made in the same tax year.
*   The Commissioner had treated the overdrawn current account as a deemed dividend to Mr Henson and assessed it as income. The onus of proof was on Mr Henson to prove that he held half of his shares in the company on trust for his wife (and as such the deemed dividend was assessable income to the partnership). The evidence provided at the hearing as to whether the shares were held on trust was "at best, equivocal" and there was no contemporaneous material to support the contention. This appeal failed on the evidence.
*   The Commissioner had disallowed the partnership's claim for a deduction for management consulting fees of $27,000 and $24,000 in respective tax years, for fees charged to the partnership by Standard 88 Limited. The burden of proof is on the taxpayers to prove that either the expenses had been incurred or that the alleged burglary resulting in loss of the documentation had occurred and her Honour noted that "more than self-serving oral evidence is required."

PRODUCT RULING – BR PRD 18/02 This is a product ruling made under s 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Harbour Fund III GP Limited. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of ss BD 1(4), BD 1(5), BG 1 and YA 1. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the receipt by the Harbour Fund III Limited Partnership (the Fund) of proceeds (Proceeds) pursuant to individual funding agreements (the Funding Agreement) that the Fund will enter into with litigation claimants (the Claimants) to a proposed class action against Carter Holt Harvey Limited and the other Carter Holt Harvey entities, under which the Fund will agree to pay all legal and other costs incurred by the Claimants, in return for a share of the Proceeds. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. The offshore parties to the Arrangement 1. The Fund is situated in the Cayman Islands and has been established to make litigation and arbitration funding available for all types of claims other than personal injury, divorce or defamation proceedings. 2. Under the law of Cayman Islands, the Fund does not have separate legal personality from its partners. The Fund is not the beneficial owner of its assets, which are held by Harbour Fund III GP Limited (the General Partner), in accordance with the terms of the Fund's limited partnership agreement. Office of the Chief Tax Counsel Te Tari o te Rōia Tāke Matua Asteron Centre 55 Featherston Street PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 New Zealand Telephone: 04 890-1500 Facsimile Numbers: 2 3. The Fund provides funding for litigation claimants all around the world who have met certain criteria. The criteria include the creditworthiness of the defendant, the legal merits of the case, the expertise of the legal team and the likely legal fees. 4. The Fund is advised by Harbour Litigation Cayman Limited (the Investment Advisor) a company incorporated in the Cayman Islands. The Investment Advisor has been contracted by the General Partner under an investment advisory agreement to perform investigation, evaluation and due diligence services in respect of potential claims for which funding is sought. 5. Preliminary investigation and due diligence services have in turn been subcontracted by the Investment Advisor to Harbour Litigation Funding Limited (the Sub-Advisor) which is a company incorporated in England and Wales, under a sub-advisory agreement. 6. Details of the activities undertaken by the Investment Advisor and by the Sub- Advisor (together the Advisors) when investigating and evaluating potential claims are set out below. Summary of the normal investment procedure 7. The Advisors ensure that the business of the Fund is known to interested parties. However, the Advisors do not actively or routinely seek to identify and locate specific claims for which funding might be provided. 8. Once a request for funding is received a confidentiality agreement is entered into, and the Advisors conduct a preliminary assessment. Information is gathered regarding the claim, and an immediate analysis is conducted to assess whether the claim is likely to satisfy the Fund's criteria. If the claim is unlikely to satisfy the criteria, it will generally be rejected at this stage. 9. If a claim passes the first stage of analysis, the Fund will, if appropriate, enter into a letter of intent, usually with the claimant directly, but in the case of a class/group action, with the legal representative seeking funding on behalf of the claimants. This procedure has been adopted because there are too many claimants to execute separate documents with and they may not yet have been identified. The Sub-Advisor will then conduct a more detailed due diligence to ascertain whether the claim would be likely to meet the criteria for funding. 10. An Investment Committee established by the Investment Advisor then meets every few weeks to evaluate the legal merits of the cases for which funding is sought which satisfy the Fund’s criteria. The Investment Committee reviews updates on the progress of existing funded claims. 11. At the conclusion of each meeting the Investment Committee, where appropriate, make a formal recommendation to the Board of the Investment Advisor, about investing in proposed new claims. The Investment Committee also reports to the Board of the Investment Advisor on existing funded claims if there have been material adverse developments in the case of existing funded claims. 3 12. The Board of the Investment Advisor then considers the recommendations made by the Investment Committee at its monthly meeting. Where the Board of the Investment Advisor considers that a proposed claim is likely to meet the Fund's criteria for funding, a recommendation is made by the Board of the Investment Advisor to the Board of the General Partner, which has the authority to invest in claims on behalf of the Fund. 13. The Board of the General Partner then meets to consider the recommendations made by the Board of the Investment Advisor. 14. Where the Board of the General Partner (on behalf of the Fund) considers that a recommended claim is meritorious, the Fund will make funds directly available for the claim by entering into a funding agreement or funding agreements with the claimants. How the decision to fund this Claim was made 15. The Sub-Advisor was approached in January 2017, via email, by Adina Thorn in relation to the possible funding of a representative action in relation to cladding supplied and fitted in buildings throughout New Zealand. The potential claim, would be based in negligence and breach of statutory duties, and was expected involve over 200 Claimants with a claim for damages in excess of NZD $40m (the Claim). 16. In accordance with normal procedure summarised above, this approach for funding was subjected to the preliminary review and assessment process. It was subsequently concluded that the Claim could potentially satisfy the Fund's criteria. 17. Due diligence was then undertaken by the Advisors, and ultimately a recommendation was made to the Board of the General Partner that the Claim be approved for funding. 18. At its March 2017 meeting in the Cayman Islands, the Board of the General Partner approved the Claim for funding. 19. The parties then attended to the finalisation of anticipated timetables and funding amounts, and appropriate documentation was prepared for the Fund to record the terms on which funding would be provided to Claimants. 20. A draft of the Funding Agreement was prepared, to record the terms on which the Fund will make funding available to Claimants for their legal and other costs incurred in relation to the Claim. A draft relationship agreement (Relationship Agreement) was prepared to record the various invoicing and reporting requirements that will apply to Adina Thorn lawyers acting for the funded Claimants throughout the proceedings. 21. The Relationship Agreement was finalised and entered into on 26 May 2017 by the Fund and Adina Thorn lawyers. The Funding Agreement was finalised at the beginning of February 2018 with Claimants progressively entering into the Funding Agreement from that time. 4 Funding Agreement 22. The Funding Agreement records the terms on which the Fund agrees to make funds available to Claimants (i.e., individuals or groups who have suffered damage within the scope of the Claim) for Claimants Legal Costs. The phrase Claimants Legal Costs is defined in clause 20.1 of the Funding Agreement. It includes legal fees incurred in relation to the Claim, and any costs incurred by the Claimants (subject to certain exclusions) should the Claimants be ordered to pay the legal costs of the defendant or any other party involved in the Claim. Pursuant to the terms of clause 9, the Claimants have agreed that in the event that the Claimants are successful, the Fund will receive the Proceeds. 23. The Claimants will comprise individuals, groups of individuals and companies (or their respective representatives, such as liquidators or administrators) that are home and building owners, affected by defects in cladding used in the construction of their homes and buildings. Some of these Claimants are unable to bring a claim under the Weathertight Homes Resolution Services Act 2006 (WHRS Act) on account of their buildings having been constructed outside the 10 year limitation period imposed by the WHRS Act. 24. While the Claimant group is located in both New Zealand and other countries, including Australia and the United Kingdom, it is the applicant's understanding that all the properties to which the Claim relates are located in New Zealand. This Ruling only considers or rules on the Arrangement to the extent it relates to New Zealand properties. Funding process 25. Funding for the Claimants Legal Costs will be made available under the Funding Agreement in two stages. The first stage comprises the point up to which all the pre-conditions for full funding are satisfied, and a statement of claim has been filed. 26. The Applicant advised that due to the process of confirming claimants taking time, Claimants will be confirmed as being part of the Claimant group on a progressive basis during the first stage of funding. Claimants will continue to be confirmed up until (and potentially after) the time that the statement of claim is filed. It is possible that Claimants could be confirmed and enter into the Funding Agreement after the second stage of funding has commenced. 27. During the first stage, legal fees will be incurred for work which will benefit all Claimants including Claimants who are accepted towards the end of the first stage. The definition of Claimants Legal Costs (clause 20.1 of the Funding Agreement) overcomes a potential problem associated with the timing of, and allocation of, legal costs, which were incurred before a Claimant entered into the Funding Agreement. This clause provides that Claimants will agree that each Claimant's proportionate share will be allocated by reference to the value of their claim, regardless of when each Claimant entered into the Funding Agreement. 28. Provided that the Claim satisfies the preconditions for full funding, the Fund will, after the completion of the first stage, fund the second stage of the Claim. Funding will be provided for the second stage of the Claim until such time as the 5 Fund terminates its obligations under the Funding Agreements or the proceedings are concluded (whether by settlement or judgment of the courts). Fund's entitlement to Proceeds 29. In the event that the Fund funds stage one and two of the Claim, and the Claim is successful, the Fund will be entitled to receive the Proceeds. The amount of the Proceeds will be calculated on the basis set out in the Funding Agreement. Clause 9.1 (a)(i) to (vi) outlines how the Proceeds will be allocated between the Fund and the Claimants. 30. In accordance with the Funding Agreement, Adina Thorn lawyers will receive and hold any damages, costs and settlement sums received in respect of a Claim on bare trust for the Fund and the Claimants in the proportions agreed until such time as the relevant amounts are paid to the Fund and to the Claimants. All amounts received from the defendant must first be paid to the Fund who will be paid in priority to the Claimants, who shall each receive such sum as is equal to their share of the remaining damages, costs or settlement sum. Control of Claim 31. Control of the Claim will rest with the Claimants. The Fund will have no ability to instruct Adina Thorn lawyers or dictate how the proceedings are to be conducted. Clause 5 of The Funding Agreement expressly acknowledges that the Fund has no control over or right to make decisions about the proceedings. Only the Claimants, through the Representative Claimant (the Representative Claimant) may instruct Adina Thorn lawyers and determine, for example, that the claims that will be pursued and what actions will be taken or decisions made on a day to day basis in respect of the conduct of the proceedings. 32. Clause 6.1 (e) of the Funding Agreement provides that at any time Claimants will be entitled to change Adina Thorn lawyers. While the prior written agreement of the Fund is required, this clause provides that the Fund’s consent to such a change is not to be unreasonably withheld. However, in order to continue to receive funding under the Funding Agreement, the Claimants will be required to ensure that the new lawyers executes a deed in favour of the Fund under which the new Adina Thorn lawyers agrees to be bound by the terms of the Relationship Agreement as if they were the lawyers. 33. Clauses 5, 6 and 13 outline the Claimants obligations under the Funding Agreement. They include taking certain actions and to provide certain instructions to Adina Thorn lawyers in relation to certain anticipated future events including: in relation to the pursuit of an appeal should the Fund wish to provide funding for an appeal, and in relation to settlement decisions should settlement be recommended or not recommended (as the case may be) by Adina Thorn lawyers. 34. The Applicant states that because this is a class action, Claimants will also agree on entering into the Funding Agreement the manner in which the proceedings will be conducted and the representative claimant will instruct Adina Thorn lawyers. This is to ensure that the funded Claimants agree at the outset how the proceedings will be conducted, and so that the Fund can be confident that the proceedings are being conducted in an optimal manner. 6 Termination 35. Clause 1 of the Funding Agreement contains an initial cooling off period of 20 days. Clause 12 provides that a Claimant will not be able to unilaterally terminate its obligations under the Funding Agreement. Claimants will only be entitled to actively terminate their obligations if there has been a material breach by the Fund which has adversely affected the Claimant's interests and which has not been remedied by the Fund within 30 days. 36. Clause 12 of the Funding Agreement enables a Claimant to opt out of the class action if the Claimant gives instructions to Adina Thorn lawyers or otherwise exercises a right to opt out of the proceedings. However if the Claim is subsequently successful the Fund is still entitled to recover its share of the Proceeds as if the Claimant had not opted out of the class action. 37. Clause 11 of the Funding Agreement provides that the Fund will have the right at any time to terminate its obligation to contribute to future legal costs in respect of the Claim. Key contractual terms relating to process 38. Claimants will agree to take certain actions and provide certain instructions to Adina Thorn lawyers in relation to the manner in which the proceedings will be conducted, and in relation to certain potential future events. These obligations are contained in the following clauses: • Clause 5: Conduct of Proceedings. • Clause 6: Claimant’s Obligations. • Clause 9: Application of Proceeds. • Clause 13: Settlement Decisions. • Clause 19: General Provisions. 39. Pursuant to clause 6 of the Funding Agreement, each Claimant will agree: • That the Representative Claimant will determine in consultation with Adina Thorn lawyers what claims will be pursued \[clause 5.1 (a)\]. • That the Representative Claimant will give day to day instructions to Adina Thorn lawyers and will make binding decisions on behalf of Claimants \[clause 5.1 (b)\]. • That the Claimant will provide all information and documents required by Adina Thorn lawyers, will deal promptly with all requests made by Adina Thorn lawyers and will co-operate generally with Adina Thorn lawyers \[clause 6.1 (m)\]. • That the Claimant will act reasonably and commercially in the prosecution of the proceedings and in accordance with the advice of Adina Thorn lawyers \[clause 6.1 (d)\]. • That the Claimant will accept and follow Adina Thorn lawyers reasonable legal advice including in relation to settlement \[clause 6.1 (i)\]. 7 • That the Representative Claimant is authorised to make or take any action constituting a settlement decision provided that Adina Thorn lawyers has advised such action is reasonable \[clause 13.1\]. • That Adina Thorn lawyers are authorised to and instructed to accept on the Claimant's behalf, any settlement proposed where the Claimant has not initially wanted to act in accordance with the advice of Adina Thorn lawyers and the matter has been referred to independent counsel for opinion, with the independent counsel having recommended that Adina Thorn lawyer’s advice is reasonable in all the circumstances \[clause 13.3 and 13.4\]. 40. In addition, each Claimant will agree under the Funding Agreement that the Fund is entitled to communicate directly with Adina Thorn lawyers, and that the Fund is entitled to receive any information which has or may have a material impact on the Claim or the proceedings \[clause 6.1 (c)\]. The Relationship Agreement between Adina Thorn Lawyers and the Fund 41. The terms and conditions in the Relationship Agreement are consistent with the above provisions in the Funding Agreement.

Profit distribution plans
=========================

The tax treatment of profit distribution plans has been amended from 1 Oct 2012 so that bonus shares issued under a PDP are treated as a dividend for tax purposes.

_Sections CD 7, CD 7B, CD 8, CD 23B, CD 43, RE 14, RE 15, RF 10 and YA 1 (definition of "bonus issue", "profit distribution plan", "taxable bonus issue") of the Income Tax Act 2007_

A profit distribution plan (PDP) is a scheme offered by companies whereby the company advises all its shareholders that they will be issued with bonus shares on a particular date. The shareholders are asked if they would like to have the company repurchase those bonus shares immediately after the shareholder receives them. If the shareholder does not elect to have some or all of their bonus shares repurchased, the default option is for the shareholder to retain the bonus shares.

The tax treatment of PDPs has been amended so that bonus shares issued under a PDP are treated as a dividend for tax purposes. These changes were necessary to ensure that the tax treatment of PDPs is consistent with the current policy around imputation credit streaming and the taxation of bonus issues.

### Background

Under the previous tax treatment, the bonus issue of shares under a PDP were treated as a non-taxable bonus issue meaning that if a shareholder retained the bonus shares they were not subject to tax. However, if the shareholder elected to have the bonus shares repurchased by the company, the repurchase proceeds were treated as a taxable dividend. Imputation credits could be attached to the cash dividend by the company and used to credit the tax payable by the shareholder.

The previous tax treatment of PDPs was the subject of a specific Inland Revenue product ruling in 2005 (BR PRD 05/08). The ruling held that a distribution of shares under a PDP is treated as a non-taxable bonus issue and consequently does not constitute a dividend in the hands of the shareholder. The ruling was made subject to certain conditions, including that the company making the bonus issue had sufficient credits in its imputation credit account to have fully imputed a cash dividend equal to the bonus issue not redeemed for cash.

After this product ruling, the tax treatment of PDPs was further reviewed and in 2009 the Government announced its intention to amend the tax treatment of PDPs. Later that year, officials released an issues paper, _The taxation of distributions from profit distribution plans_, for public consultation.

In 2009 the Capital Market Development Taskforce specifically considered the tax treatment of PDPs and made the following recommendation:

*   The Taskforce considers it important that the tax system treats substitutable transactions neutrally. If PDPs are substitutable for ordinary dividend payments with optional reinvestment, the tax treatment should ideally be identical in both cases. The same goes for other close substitutes. Otherwise, there is a danger that investment decisions will be biased towards companies that offer PDPs, and that there could be significant loss of tax revenue from normal dividend taxation.  
      
    At the same time, the Taskforce considers it desirable that the tax system does not impede the supply of capital. A decision on the tax treatment of PDPs should, therefore, take into account the fact that PDPs are an effective way for companies to raise capital.  
      
    **Recommendation**: We recommend that changes to the tax treatment of PDPs should be made as part of a broader review of tax settings and take into account any adverse impacts on capital-raising costs.

In 2011 Inland Revenue officials consulted seven interested parties on draft legislation based on the proposal to treat distributions from a PDP as a taxable bonus issue in lieu.

### Detailed analysis

Several amendments have been made to achieve the policy intent. The key amendments are as follows.

#### Taxation of bonus shares

New section CD 7B treats as a dividend bonus shares issued under PDPs. The amount of the dividend is the amount offered by the company for the repurchase of the shares.

#### Repurchase of shares under a PDP

New section CD 23B is intended to prevent cash amounts under a PDP from being taxed twice. If a shareholder elects for their bonus shares to be repurchased under a PDP, section CD 23B ensures that the repurchase proceeds are not taxable under the ordinary dividend rules. That is, it is only the bonus issue under a PDP that is the taxable event.

For clarification, there are a few points to note:

*   Section CD 23B is not intended to apply to on market repurchases. This section is only intended to apply to shares that are repurchased under PDPs and not to share repurchases generally.
*   Section CD 22 is not intended to apply to section CD 23B. Section CD 22 generally applies when a company pays an amount to shareholders, other than on liquidation, because of the off->market cancellation of shares in the company. This section allows the available subscribed capital of the company (which is generally equal to the amount paid to the company to subscribe for its shares) to be returned to shareholders tax-free if certain criteria are met. New section CD 7B states that section CD 22 does not apply in relation to a share issued under a PDP and repurchased by the company under that plan. If section CD 22 applied to new section CD 23B this could potentially result in double taxation; first when the company issues the bonus shares under a PDP, and secondly when the off-market share cancellation takes place.
*   If shares are repurchased by the company outside of the PDP scheme, the ordinary tax rules regarding share repurchases will apply.

**Application date**

The application date of the changes is 1 October 2012.

================================================================================================================

If your cryptoasset mining activity is a profit-making scheme, you need to pay income tax on any profits you earn from the scheme. This may include paying tax on your:

*   mining rewards when you receive them
*   profits from selling your mining rewards.

If your profit-making scheme includes [proof of stake](/api/glossary/item?id={04254A7C-6D31-495D-B22B-B45D668A6DEE})
 mining (staking), you may also have to pay income tax on profits from selling your staked cryptoassets.

All amounts you get from the profit-making scheme are included as your income. This includes cryptoassets and money.

Working out if your cryptoasset mining is a profit-making scheme
----------------------------------------------------------------

Your mining activity may fall short of being a business. For example, if it is a small operation and is only carried on for a short time.

But if your main purpose for mining cryptoassets is to make a profit you may be using cryptoassets for a profit-making scheme. This is because mining is not a simple transaction. It generally involves a series of steps or a plan of action (a scheme).

Priya starts mining Bitcoin early from her PC

Priya heard about Bitcoin in late 2010 through an online forum and liked the idea.  She could see online that people were willing to pay 20 cents for 1 Bitcoin when just a month ago it had only been worth 6 cents.

Priya learned how to mine Bitcoin on her desktop computer. Over the next 3 years she earned thousands of Bitcoins. She sold some of her Bitcoin whenever she thought the price was good. She stopped mining in 2013 but continued selling her Bitcoins whenever she thought there had been a good increase in value.

Priya is carrying on a profit-making scheme.

While Priya is interested in the potential of Bitcoin generally, her main purpose for mining was to earn Bitcoin and make a profit from selling it. This profit-making purpose is clear from Priya’s actions over the years.

Priya will need to pay income tax on the:

*   Bitcoin rewards and transaction fees she earned
*   profits she made from the sale of Bitcoin.

Ariana sets up a cryptoasset staking operation

In 2014 Ariana heard about crypto X. It was a new coin in the crypto market that used proof of stake to validate transactions.

Ariana bought a large number of crypto X and set up a staking operation.

She earned staking rewards (paid in crypto X) and added them to her original stake of crypto X.

Ariana regularly spent time on her staking operation and looking at the crypto market. Whenever Ariana thought there had been a good increase in the price of crypto X she sold some to cash-out.

Over the next 3 years Ariana sold all her crypto X in a number of separate transactions.

Ariana was carrying on a profit-making scheme.

She had a speculative plan to make a profit from buying, staking and selling crypto X at the time she first purchased crypto X. She carried out that plan and make a profit from it.

Her purpose of making a profit from the scheme as a whole (not just from the staking rewards which were only a small percentage of her overall holding) was supported by her actions over the years.

Ariana will need to pay income tax on the:

*   crypto X she received from staking
*   profits from the sale of all her crypto X.
\[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] FINAL Programme Business Case Addendum Business Transformation Implementing a digital revenue system March 2022 Ve rsion: FINAL IN C ONFIDENCE Proactive release: This document has been released by Inland Revenue under section 18(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This release supports the purposes of the Official Information Act 1982 by increasing progressively the availability of official information to the people of New Zealand. Table of Contents Page 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Section Page Executive Summary 3 The Economic Case 5 The Commercial Case 19 The Financial Case 21 The Management Case 25 Appendices 29 Executive Summary Page 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Transformation has involved a combination of changes to policy settings, processes, technology, Inland Revenue’s operating model and organisation design, and people capabilities. A multi-year, multi-stage programme, transformation has been far more than an upgrade of technology and has meant changing every aspect of the way Inland Revenue operates. The intent was to deliver a modern, digital revenue system that made tax and payments simpler and more certain for customers. This has been achieved. New Zealand now has a revenue system: • Based around customers’ needs • Easy to understand and interact with • Using n ear real-time information • Digital and highly automated • Systems and software doing most of the work • More responsive, flexible, and certain for customers • Future proofed to accommodate change. The programme has been implemented on time, under budget, and has achieved its investment objectives. • Customers have online services that meet their expectations for being able to interact digitally with Inland Revenue and which give them certainty and visibility and make it easier for them to pay and receive the right amounts. • Effort has reduced for customers. Tax assessments are largely automated for individuals and businesses can use their own systems to calculate and pay their tax. • With its new analytical capabilities, it is quicker for Inland Revenue to identify when customers are getting things wrong and to work with them proactively. This is helping to ensure customers meet their obligations and receive the payments they are entitled to. • Government now has the ability to make policy changes far more quickly and cost-effectively, as demonstrated by Inland Revenue’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. • Inland Revenue’s systems are robust and reliable and available when customers need to use them. • Inland Revenue is working more efficiently and effectively and costs to the taxpayer have reduced. The investment made in transformation has created the systems and processes required to enable Inland Revenue to operate in the digital age. In total, Inland Revenue is handing back $441 million of the funding approved from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2024. What has been delivered. From 2017 to 2021, six releases across four stages were successfully implemented, progressively moving products to new systems and processes and making improved services available to customers. Digital services are enabling customers to do as much for themselves as possible in a way and at a time that suits them. Through their myIR account customers can file returns, make payments, advise Inland Revenue of changes in their circumstances, and apply for support online. Use of Inland Revenue’s digital channels has increased significantly in recent years, with user sessions for myIR trebling from 17 million for the year ended 30 June 2016 to 50 million for the year ended 30 June 2021. Over the same period, use of Inland Revenue’s website nearly doubled from 29 million to 57 million sessions. To support the successful migration of products, a co- existence solution was built to ensure heritage systems and processes would continue to run in parallel. This solution was adjusted for every release as products and data were shifted, enabling Inland Revenue to continue to provide services to customers without dropping the ball. Huge amounts of customer data was successfully moved from the old system to the new system. Over the 5 year period, Inland Revenue moved approximately 30 million accounts, 77 million returns, 470 million transactions and 770 million KiwiSaver contributions. Alongside migrating products, an extensive programme of policy changes was also implemented. Changes to policy settings were aligned with the movement of products to new systems and processes to minimise the change impacts for customers. For example, automatic year-end income tax assessments were introduced when income tax was migrated. This was the biggest change for individuals in approximately 20 years. Other significant changes to policy settings which enabled the move to automatic assessments included the move to payday filing for employers and changes to reporting requirements for payers of investment income. End-of-year refunds are automatically calculated and paid to individuals based on the information Inland Revenue holds about them. Since they were introduced for the tax year ending 31 March 2019, Inland Revenue has paid $1.8 billion directly into people’s bank accounts. Page 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Businesses can now choose to work out and pay tax as a by-product of normal business processes, rather than calculating and paying it separately. They can provide Inland Revenue with information from their own systems. Higher levels of automation and rules built into systems mean straight forward transactions are processed with no human intervention. For example, around 93% of GST returns are processed straight through, ensuring customers get valid refunds quickly. Compliance now happens in real time. Transformation has made things simpler for customers and there has been significant shift in both filing and payment compliance as a result. On time filing was at 85% at 30 June 2016, the year immediately before transformation began and as at 28 February 2022 was 96%. On time payments are up around 4% over the same time period. Over the last five years, the focus of compliance has moved from the end (enforcement after the event) to ‘Right from the Start’. The quality and frequency of the data Inland Revenue collects has improved and a significant investment has been made in analytics. The focus is now on real time integrity, providing opportunities to intervene earlier when customers get it wrong, either accidentally or deliberately. This reduces the need for post-return work, whether that is debt collection or audit and investigation. Compliance checks are increasingly occurring at the time a transaction takes place. Every return that can generate a refund is checked automatically and upfront checks have been built into application processes for COVID-19 related support. Inland Revenue is far more able to respond to government priorities. Throughout delivery of the programme, Inland Revenue has continued to support the Government’s priorities, including its response to COVID- 19. New Zealand now has a very responsive and robust revenue system, which has enabled relief packages such as the small business cashflow (loan) scheme and the resurgence support payment to be delivered within weeks. It is easy for customers to check their eligibility for support online and, if they are, payments arrive in their accounts within days. This would simply not have been possible before transformation. Mobile workplace technology has meant Inland Revenue could keep providing services during several significant disruptions in recent years, including the Kaikoura earthquake, long-term building closures due to seismic issues, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Inland Revenue would have been severely constrained in these situations prior to transformation. What has made transformation successful. Inland Revenue has reflected on the factors that made it possible to successfully implement a multi-year, multi- st age, highly complex programme. These include: • Investing in the right capability. Inland Revenue recruited an experienced team with a track record in delivering transformational change. • Choosing the right partners. Having the right partners is critical and Inland Revenue developed very strong partnerships with its d elivery partners. Core technology decisions were made early. • Leading from the top. The Commissioner was the Senior Responsible Owner and a Deputy Commissioner had a sole focus on transformation. Transformation can’t be an add on to a busy day job. • Developing a clear vision and roadmap. The programme roadmap set out the starting point (GST) and overall phasing. Strong programme disciplines helped to ensure that transformation remained on schedule. S cope was managed tightly by strongly relying on out-of-the-box processes to avoid unnecessary configuration or customisation. • Establishing strong and effective governance. This was instrumental in establishing the disciplines needed for successful delivery and was supported by a robust approach to risk management and active financial management practices. • Building and maintaining stakeholder and customer support. Actively engaging with customers and stakeholders helped Inland Revenue to put customer needs at the centre of its thinking. • Adapting as you go. As a result of lessons learned, Inland Revenue actively changed its approach as the programme progressed. These insights were shared with stakeholders, including other agencies. • Taking people on the journey. From early on, Inland Revenue was open with its people about what the changes would mean, including being a smaller organisation at the end. A significant investment in capability development readied people for their next opportunity, whether with Inland Revenue or not. Al though the programme will close by 30 June 2022, Inland Revenue will continue to transform by further leveraging the capabilities that have been delivered. Inland Revenue will continue to look for opportunities to further reduce effort for customers and improve their experiences. Page 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] THE ECONOMIC CASE Confirming delivery of the preferred way forward This section outlines what has been achieved as a result of transformation and confirms that the programme investment objectives have been met. The transformation programme has achieved the outcomes intended Page 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] In this final addendum, it is useful to start with a reminder of why Inland Revenue embarked on its business transformation programme. In the mid-to-late-2000s Inland Revenue was facing a number of significant challenges: • a risk of operational failure affecting tax and payments, • slow and costly policy implementation, • inability to meet customers’ expectations of modern services, and • inability to optimise information across the public sector. In March 2013, the government accepted that there was a “case for change” and agreed to modernise the revenue system through re-engineering business processes, supported by new technology. In November 2015, the government agreed to invest in transformation to reduce customer effort and cost, improve compliance levels, make policy changes faster and more cost effectively, improve systems resilience, and make Inland Revenue more efficient. Inland Revenue’s business transformation programme has involved a combination of changes to policy, process, technology, and people capabilities. It has been far more than an upgrade of technology and has changed every aspect of the way Inland Revenue operates. Transformation provided the opportunity to fundamentally review how the revenue system is administered to make tax and payments simpler and more certain for customers. The intent was to deliver a modern, digital revenue system that enabled customers to do as much for themselves as possible in a way and at a time that suited them. The objectives of transformation The transformation programme had six investment objectives: • Improving the customer experience by making it easier and simpler for taxation and social policy customers, with a particular focus on enhanced digital provision of services. • Delivering new and more effective services to improve customer compliance and help support the outcomes of social policies. • Increasing the secure sharing of intelligence and information to improve delivery of services to New Zealanders and improve public sector performance. • Improving agility so that policy changes can be made in a timely and cost effective manner. • Minimising the risk of protracted system outages and intermittent systems failure. • Improving productivity and reducing the cost of providing Inland Revenue’s services. These objectives have been achieved. The examples provided in this addendum are illustrative of the outcomes that have been achieved, rather than an exhaustive list of all the changes introduced by transformation. Please refer to Appendix A for a timeline of the major changes introduced by transformation. Throughout a period of significant change, customers have continued to have trust and confidence in Inland Revenue. As at 28 February 2022, 91% of customers said they had trust and confidence in Inland Revenue, compared to 88% as at 30 June 2016, the last full year before changes began to be implemented. Outcome 1: It is easier and simpler for customers to do what they need to do using digital services Customers now have digital services for all the taxes and social policies that Inland Revenue adminsters. Use of these services is growing. The percentage of individual income tax payments made digitally was 99% as at 28 February 2022. The percentage of returns received electronically has increased from 73% for the year ending 30 June 2016 to 99% as at 28 February 2022. Paper filing is now the exception with around 99% of employment information filed digitally. The changes introduced by transformation have meant that: • Many interactions with Inland Revenue are automated, for example end of year refunds. • Customers have more options available to them to keep themselves on track, for example being able to set up instalment arrangements through myIR. The transformation programme has achieved the outcomes intended Page 7 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] • New products are designed with a digital first approach, for example the COVID-19 response products. End of year assessments for individuals are automated. Following the introduction of changes to employment and investment income reporting and a new year-end process, most individuals now don’t need to do anything at the end of the year to work out whether they have a refund or tax to pay. Inland Revenue does it all for them and customers can see the results in myIR. The year ending 31 March 2019 was the first time income tax assessments were automatically issued to individuals. For that year, Inland Revenue automatically refunded $650 million to 1.5 million customers. For the year ending 31 March 2020, 1.8 million individual customers automatically received $714 million in refunds. For the year ending 31 March 2021, $455 million had been refunded to 1.3 million customers as at 30 June 2021. Final figures are not yet available as customers have until April 2022 to file their 2021 returns. The year ending 31 March 2021, was the first full year Inland Revenue received more frequent employment and investment income information. This, combined with new analytical tools, has enabled Inland Revenue to intervene earlier where things aren’t right to help customers pay and receive the right amounts. As a result, average, end-of-year refunds and bills to pay are reducing as intended as shown in the diagrams below. Inland Revenue has improved its approach each year, including speeding up the issuing of assessments. Around two thirds of assessments, approximately 2.1 million, were issued within 11 working days in 2021. It is easier and quicker for customers to claim their donations tax credits refunds. Donations tax credit claims are now scanned and analytical tools verify receipts in straightforward cases. This means these straightforward claims are processed and paid with no human intervention. For the year ending 30 June 2021, 82% of claims were made digitally. Prior to transformation, this was a paper process with customers filling in a form and mailing it with their receipts to Inland Revenue. Receipts were keyed into Inland Revenue’s systems manually. Refunds could take weeks to get to customers. Online services are enabling greater self-management for customers. There are more options available to customers to manage their own affairs. For example, for the year ended 30 June 2021, customers set up 57,000 instalment arrangements themselves in myIR to pay off debt. This represented 41% of the total instalment arrangements set up. Previously, customers would have had to contact Inland Revenue to arrange this. The final stage of transformation went live in two releases in 2021, expanding the range of digital services available to customers. Since 1 March 2021, paid parental leave customers have been able to apply for and track the progress of their application, view next payment details, and view and maintain their personal details. Customers and their employers no longer have to provide an income estimate, The transformation programme has achieved the outcomes intended Page 8 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] as Inland Revenue pre-populates customers’ income for them as part of the application process. Inland Revenue only asks for information not already held and automates as many applications as possible. Previously, everything was paper-based and paid parental leave payments were not in myIR, Inland Revenue’s secure online service. It is easier for the owners of unclaimed money 1 to track their funds down and claim them, and for the financial institutions or agencies involved to comply with the rules. Owners are able to claim their money through myIR. This has reduced the information they need to provide as Inland Revenue already knows who they are and they just need to prove ownership. Previously, customers had to email or write to Inland Revenue. For duties and New Zealand foreign trusts, customers are able to manage their obligations through myIR, making it significantly easier for them to meet these obligations. Since October 2021, child support customers have had better visibility of their obligations and payments in myIR. They are also able to do more for themselves, including registering online and advising Inland Revenue of any changes in their circumstances. Information sharing and communication with other agencies has improved through the use of portals and secure file transfer. 1 Money (such as a bank deposit) which has become disconnected or detached from its owner. Unclaimed money is passed on from the holder The processing of payments and employer deductions has been streamlined and is helping to ensure that receiving carers get their child support as soon as possible after the due date. Payments now get to carers faster. From November 2021 onwards, child support payments are passed on by the 23 rd of the same month, as long as the liable (paying) parent has paid on time. Previously, payments were made on the 7 th of the month following the due date. In addition, Inland Revenue can now make payments directly to overseas bank accounts. Previously the department sent cheques, and since it stopped using cheques in March 2020 has used a series of work arounds to release funds overseas. In October 2021, Inland Revenue upgraded the online services all customers use. A more modern look and feel for myIR, and simplified presentation of information, is making it easier for customers to focus on what is relevant and important. The layout adapts to fit the size of any screen without loss of functionality, making it seamless to use myIR across different devices, including mobile phones. Simplified navigation is allowing customers to easily find and do what they need to do. Surveys after go-live showed that: • Overall, seven in ten individual customers found it quite or very easy to do what they need to do. • Around eight in ten business customers found it quite or very easy to do what they need to do. after 5 years to Inland Revenue as the custodian until the funds can be claimed. Owners have up to 60 years to claim their funds. • Overall, seven in ten intermediaries from smaller organisations and six in ten from larger organisations found easy to do what they need to do. As high users of myIR, intermediaries will have been very familiar with the previous version. This demonstrates of the benefits of choosing a commercial-off-the-shelf system as it is “evergreen”. This means that systems are updated on an ongoing basis so they are always up-to-date. An upgrade was not possible in FIRST, Inland Revenue’s heritage core processing system. Upgrades will become part of the normal cycle of events in the years to come so that customers and Inland Revenue itself benefit from the latest advances in technology and services. Small-to -medium sized businesses who use digital services say they make things quick and easy. Comments from Inland Revenue’s 2021 survey of small- to-medium sized businesses show that improvements to online services and Inland Revenue’s website and the ability to file from software are making a difference to those using them. “Linking GST to Xero accounting software has saved me a lot of time and calculations. End-of-year taxes are made easy with Xero.” The transformation programme has achieved the outcomes intended Page 9 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] “Being able to log in to myIR - I can access information quickly and do my GST returns easily. Sending email correspondence from here has also been handy.” “I find the website a great source of information. Anything I need to research is pretty easy to find so overall, it has been quite straightforward keeping up to date with all our tax obligations” COVID-19 products have been designed to make it easy for customers to apply for support. The small business cashflow (loan) scheme, resurgence support payment, loss carry-back scheme, and writing off interest on late payments have been designed to make it easy for customers to check their eligibility, apply for support, and receive the payments or relief they are entitled to. Digital services and upfront checks have provided customers with certainty as quickly as possible. The vast majority of applications have been made online with around $4 billion in funds paid out in total for the loan scheme and resurgence support payment within a day or two. Outcome 2: It is easier for customers to pay and receive the right amounts and harder not to The vast majority of Inland Revenue’s customers try to do the right thing. As a result of transformation, it is easier for customers to do so and this is evident in customers’ behaviour. The percentage of returns filed on time was 96% as at 28 February 2022, a significant increase on the 85% recorded for the year ended 30 June 2016. The percentage of tax payments made on time increased from 87% to 91% over the same period. The changes introduced by transformation have meant that new processes and new capabilities are making it seamless and low effort for customers to meet their obligations and receive the right entitlements. Inland Revenue is better able to use the information it holds to help customers pay and receive the right amounts. This is evident in the improvements made to the administration of Working for Families payments and prescribed investor rates. Analytical capabilities are enabling Inland Revenue to put checks in place upfront and to identify compliance risks more quickly and act on them in more targeted ways. This can be seen with the COVID-19 products and the bright- line property rule. Working for Families customers have certainty sooner. In February each year, Inland Revenue assesses entitlements for approximately 380,000 Working for Families customers which will apply from 1 April. This is known as rollover. This process is now faster and more accurate, providing certainty to customers sooner, following the move of Working for Families to new systems and processes in April 2019: • Previously, it took more than 12 hours to rollover entitlements in old systems and processes. Now, it takes around 30 minutes. • Previously, Inland Revenue notified customers over a 4 to 5 day period what their future entitlements would be. Now, notifications are sent as soon as entitlements have been calculated. • Based on what occurred for the 2021 rollover, Inland Revenue expects to let around 95% of customers know what their entitlements will be through myIR. This is up from around 80% previously. Increasingly, people are on the correct prescribed investor rates. When income tax moved to new systems and processes in April 2019, it became clear that approximately 1.5 million people were on an incorrect prescribed investor rate (PIR). Prior to this it was not possible for Inland Revenue to determine whether people were on an incorrect rate as an individual’s income details were not all held in one place. This was one of the limitations of Inland Revenue’s heritage systems and processes and, as a result, portfolio investment entity income was not associated with in dividual customers. P eople on a PIR that was too high could not get their overpaid tax refunded as it was a final tax and those on a PIR that was too low paid tax at their marginal tax rate (which was often higher than their PIR). Following changes to legislation, from 1 April 2020, Inland Revenue has provided portfolio investment entities with correct PIRs for people on an incorrect rate. From the year ending 31 March 2021, portfolio investment entity income is included in the end-of-year income tax assessment process and automated where The transformation programme has achieved the outcomes intended Page 10 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] possible. This means that people on a PIR that is too high have their overpaid tax refunded and those on a rate that is too low pay tax at the correct PIR rather than their marginal tax rate. Since April 2021, one of the new gateway services 2 available has been a PIR calculator that financial institutions can call on-demand and in volume to obtain their customer’s recommended PIR. These changes are helping to ensure that customers who don’t choose the correct PIR for their circumstances don’t unknowingly end up paying too much tax that they cannot get back as was historically the case. Inland Revenue is better targeting its activity to help support customers. Using its new analytical capabilities, Inland Revenue is better able to target activity based on customer need. For example, before the 2021 end-of-year square up for Working for Families customers Inland Revenue contacted all families new to the scheme to let them know what to expect. This is an example of proactively using the information already held about customers to help build their understanding. 2 Gateway services enable direct machine-to-machine interactions between systems Legislative changes to support the final release in the programme will make it easier for customers to pay the right amount of child support and stop debt compounding. Policy changes are being implemented progressively to reduce the complexity of child support, improve fairness, and increase compliance. Since 1 April 2021, Inland Revenue has not charged incremental penalties on late child support payments. Other policy changes came into effect when child support moved to new systems and processes on 28 October 2021. These changes are making it easier for liable parents to keep on top of their payments. For example, employer deductions are now compulsory for parents new to paying child support. Inland Revenue estimates that around 70% of child support deductions will be made through employers following this change. From 1 April 2022 there will be changes to how child support is assessed. For example, a wider definition of “income” will include investment income. Analytical capabilities are enabling Inland Revenue to better support customers to pay and receive the right amounts. The analytical capabilities in both the data and intelligence platform and START 3 , Inland Revenue’s new core platform, are making it easier for customers to 3 START stands for simplified tax and revenue technology and is the name Inland Revenue has chosen for the GenTax software provided by FAST Enterprises LLC. comply and harder not to. A significant amount of non- compliant activity can now be stopped at the earliest possible stage. • START Discovery Manager enables Inland Revenue to identify errors and issues requiring review. • Rules in START Integrity Manager prevent revenue loss by ensuring people only receive the payments they are entitled to and enable compliance activity to be better targeted. These rules can be adjusted very quickly when needed. • START Decision Support Manager helps Inland Revenue to make better decisions by providing data and analysis to support and recommend the most appropriate actions. • The data and intelligence platform is enabling the large variety of data Inland Revenue collects to be quickly collated and made sense of and made available to respond to emerging trends and inform decisions for customers. These capabilities complement each other and are enabling Inland Revenue to better support customers to get things right and better target its compliance activity for those who choose not to. Many straight-forward transactions are now automated, with rules in systems stopping those that need review. It is just as important to stop revenue going out the door The transformation programme has achieved the outcomes intended Page 11 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] when it shouldn’t be as it is to ensure people pay and receive the amounts they should. Every return that can generate a refund is checked automatically. All amended returns are checked and screened. Between 1 July 2020 and 30 June 2021, approximately 117,000 returns across all tax types were identified that had errors or potentially fraudulent with a value of just over $300 million. Please note this data is unaudited. For the year ending 30 June 2021, donations tax credit claims worth $16.7 million were identified that were either an error or potentially fraudulent. Of this, claims totalling $2.5 million were referred to Inland Revenue’s audit teams to investigate. Previously Inland Revenue would have had to increase its workforce significantly to identify these incorrect claims and to cope with the extra audit and debt work. More compliance effort is now upfront rather than waiting until the end of the year when customers may find themselves in debt. One of the benefits of new capabilities is that a high trust approach is not high risk. Inland Revenue can now find the right balance between looking at the applications for support or returns that need to be looked at without unnecessarily stopping those that should go through. Compliance checks have been built into application processes for COVID-19 products. Around 14,000 applications for the small business cashflow (loan) scheme totalling $200 million were stopped by upfront checks as at March 2022. This represents around 10% of the applications received. Approximately 135,000 applications for the resurgence support payment (RSP), around 15% of the applications received, had also been stopped at the same date. When the RSP was introduced in February 2021, Inland Revenue was able to build on its experiences with implementing the small business cashflow (loan) scheme to ensure appropriate checks were in place up front. This learning has continued as each RSP is activated. For example, when the RSP was activated for the Wellington region on 1 July 2021, the rules were adjusted based on some behaviour observed with the two rounds of payments activated for the Auckland region in February 2021. Customers with applications that are stopped by the upfront checks relating to location are now automatically sent a web message about their application, rather than having to wait for Inland Revenue to contact them. This is a much more efficient way of working and was not something Inland Revenue was able to do when the small business cashflow (loan) scheme was launched. Inland Revenue’s approach to compliance for the RSP took account of feedback from the Auditor General on the Ministry of Social Development’s approach to checking wage subsidy compliance. Applications that have been approved are randomly selected to validate that those customers who made it through the up-front checks were entitled to receive the RSP. Inland Revenue is working more efficiently to ensure compliance with bright-line obligations. Property compliance has been one of the first focus areas to benefit from the data and intelligence platform (DIP), with an initial focus on bright-line. Having built a data asset that brings together Inland Revenue data alongside Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) and commercial third party data, the DIP is beginning to provide a view of what is happening with property transactions throughout the country. Every property transaction since 2015 has been assessed to try to determine what kind of sale it was and therefore what tax rules apply. Every month, there are, on average, 3,000 transactions which are under the bright-line period and the DIP identifies those which are potentially subject to the bright-line rule. In November 2020, Inland Revenue sent information to customers (or their agent as directed) who had sold a property within the bright-line period and not indicated it as their main home. Since August 2021, this information has been sent to customers (or their agent) within a month of the sale. The information sent to customers is simply reminding them that if the sale is subject to income tax due to the bright-line property rule, then any profits from the sale must be declared in their income tax return when it becomes due. Where they do need to return the income, customers (or their agents) are asked to complete the property sale information form and submit it with their annual income tax return. Customers (or their agents) are The transformation programme has achieved the outcomes intended Page 12 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] also asked to let Inland Revenue know if the transaction is not subject to the bright-line rule. This approach is delivering results: • For the year ended 30 June 2020, 91 voluntary disclosures were received. • For the year ended 30 June 2021, 397 voluntary disclosures were received – a 300% increase compared to the previous year. By prompting more people to come forward and self- correct Inland Revenue’s compliance specialists are freed up to focus on the more non-compliant customers. Inland Revenue is now able to work more efficiently and effectively when transactions are identified that do require a closer look. Comparing cases selected by the DIP with those selected before the platform was in place shows the time saved in preparing bright-line cases for audit. The time spent preparing cases dropped from 15 hours to 10 hours and the time spent auditing decreased from 30 hours to 8 hours. However, effort for small-to -medium sized business has not yet reduced as much as expected. While the aim of the transformation programme was to reduce compliance effort for all customers, smaller businesses were expected to benefit to a greater degree. Approximately 90% of businesses have five or fewer employees and, typically, compliance tasks are performed by the owner/operator. Inland Revenue has regularly surveyed owners of small- to-medium sized businesses (SMEs) to understand how much time and effort they spend meeting their tax obligations. The 2013 survey is the baseline for measuring compliance effort reductions for SMEs. At that time, the median time SMEs spent on meeting their tax obligations was 36 hours a year. The 2021 survey showed that SMEs reported spending 5 fewer hours on compliance in 2021 compared to 2013. This is below the target Inland Revenue set itself of 15 fewer hours for the 2020/21 year. The COVID-19 pandemic has created very challenging business conditions, particularly for SMEs. While there has been a significant amount of Government support available to businesses affected by the pandemic, they need to apply for and demonstrate they are eligible for this support. In addition, Inland Revenue has been encouraging businesses to stay on top of their compliance obligations by filing on time, even if they are not in a position to pay the amounts owing. The graph below shows how perceptions of the time spent on tax compliance have changed since 2013. The introduction of mandatory payday filing from 1 April 2019 appears to have had an impact, with time spent complying with PAYE obligations being one of the main drivers of the increase in time since the 2018 survey. Although SMEs say they are spending more time on compliance, the acceptability of the time spent on tax has improved since 2018. In 2021, more SME owners agreed (60%) that the time their business spends on tax matters is acceptable to them than disagreed (17%). The percentage agreeing that the time is acceptable has increased since 2018 (when it was 55%). Reducing effort for SMEs will continue to be an ongoing area of focus for Inland Revenue. Outcome 3: The information Inland Revenue holds is more up-to-date and accurate and can be accessed more easily As a result of transformation, the range of participants in the revenue system has expanded significantly. Third parties are now able to connect to Inland Revenue’s systems to securely access, submit and share data to provide a broader range of services to their clients. This has enabled customers to interact with the revenue system through their natural systems of choice. The two examples given here show what it now possible. Gateway services are making it easier for third parties and Inland Revenue to exchange information. A suite of new gateway services was made available in April 2021. These were co-designed with software providers. Gateway services enable direct machine-to- machine interactions between external systems, The transformation programme has achieved the outcomes intended Page 13 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] “software”, and START (Inland Revenue’s new core processing system). They are a fast, high-volume channel and allow software providers to offer improved filing and client management services to tax agents in their chosen practice management software package. The new gateway services offer several advantages. They provide improved support for filing with the ability to retrieve filing obligations, pre-populate returns with data that Inland Revenue holds, retrieve the status of returns, and amend already submitted returns. This improved returns service, alongside the ability to access an extended set of notifications relating to the client and the return itself will enable tax agents to better manage and track their clients’ positions. Gateway services are two-way, enabling tax agents and Inland Revenue to exchange information. The gateway services that have been developed also provide the ability for other customers to file and update their information such as employers, banks and KiwiSaver scheme providers. Transitioning of KiwiSaver providers to new gateway services was completed during 2021. Three of the new gateway services enable KiwiSaver providers to query the KiwiSaver membership data and contribution history Inland Revenue holds in real-time. Previously, providers had to contact Inland Revenue by phone or email to request this information which usually took more than a week (often several) and required manual effort. Providers can now do this securely, in real- time, and at volume from their systems. The IRD number validation service is being used by banks, KiwiSaver providers, tax agents and payroll providers to ensure that their clients are correctly identified thus improving data quality and reducing error rates. The 7 new customer application programming interfaces (APIs) enable external partners to securely query and update the data Inland Revenue holds about customers in real-time from their systems. These APIs are heavily used by tax agents. The improvement in the accuracy and timeliness of this data benefits Inland Revenue, its partners, and the other government agencies with whom Inland Revenue shares data. Information is shared with MSD to support the administration of the wage subsidy scheme. Having more up-to-date employment income information as a result of employers moving to payday filing from 1 April 2019 has enabled Inland Revenue to effectively support the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) in delivering the COVID-19 wage subsidy scheme. Information about self-employed individuals, employers and employees is shared with MSD which enables many applications to be automatically approved. Many however need further clarification and initially a direct 0800 number was established for MSD staff to connect directly with Inland Revenue. A portal has been in place since 11 June 2020 and allows approved MSD people to access the information they need to verify applications directly, reducing the number of calls and the manual work, and ensuring applications are processed efficiently. To protect individuals' privacy, MSD users have read-only access to selected data, limited to the minimum data necessary in order to verify whether or not any particular wage subsidy scheme application should be approved. The portal benefits customers as their applications can be processed more quickly, benefits MSD through an improved ability to administer the subsidy scheme, and benefits Inland Revenue as far fewer calls are received from MSD to validate information. Outcome 4: Decision-makers have greater agility Government now has substantially improved agility for the products Inland Revenue administers. A number of new products, not originally within the scope of transformation, have been delivered by the programme. This includes the products introduced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. For a full list of the additional scope delivered, please refer to appendix B. The department’s support of the response to COVID-19 demonstrates the speed with which new products have been developed and made available. Two products introduced in response to COVID-19 illustrate what is now possible: • The Small Business Cashflow (Loan) Scheme was announced by the Government on 5 May 2020. Applications opened on 12 May 2020. Inland Revenue had been working on the scheme since mid-late March 2020. • The Resurgence Support Payment (RSP) was announced by the Minister of Finance on The transformation programme has achieved the outcomes intended Page 14 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 15 December 2020 and went live for the first time on 23 February 2021 as a result of a resurgence of COVID-19 in Auckland. Since then, 10 rounds of the payment have been activated. In both cases, it took a little over a month to design, build and test the first phase. Experiences with implementing products previously in Inland Revenue’s old systems and processes suggest that delivering the RSP would have taken around 3 to 4 times longer. This level of agility can be preserved by having a system that deals with 90% of transactions, with exceptions handled by people. Implementing earlier components of the COVID-19 response provided a good basis for implementing the Resurgence Support Payment. To implement the RSP, Inland Revenue adopted established design patterns within START. Although the RSP may appear to be a different product, it shares a common design with the small business cashflow (loan) scheme. The reuse of existing patterns, and the fact that START is a commercial-off-the-shelf system will help to ensure that the RSP is able to evolve to meet the future needs of government and/or customers. To ensure that as many applications as possible could be automatically processed and those that should be stopped for review were, Inland Revenue drew on its experiences with implementing the small business 4 Applications closed on 13 January 2022 cashflow (loan) scheme and supporting MSD to administer the wage subsidy scheme. Decision Support Manager was used for the first time in the assessment of applications. The upfront integrity rules held in Decision Support Manager can be quickly adjusted if new issues emerge. A second resurgence of COVID-19 in Auckland in February 2021 meant the RSP was opened to a second round of applications on 8 March 2021. The original design anticipated there could be a need for further applications, with potentially overlapping timeframes, so very little configuration of the system was required. Further applications were available following a tourist to Wellington testing positive to COVID-19 on 23 June 2021. The Delta outbreak which began on 17 August 2021 resulted in successive rounds of resurgence support payments being made available. As at March 2022 4 , around 840,000 payments totalling $2.9 billion had been made to approximately 231,000 customers. Inland Revenue’s ongoing response to COVID-19 demonstrates the benefits of the investment made in transformation and the agility decision-makers now have. Outcome 5: Inland Revenue’s systems are robust and reliable All four stages of the transformation programme have now been successfully implemented in a series of releases from 2017 to 2021. All the products Inland Revenue administers are now running on START. Please refer to appendix C for the programme roadmap and to appendix D for information about the effort involved in migrating products from heritage systems to new systems and processes. Decommissioning of heritage systems is well underway. FIRST, Inland Revenue’s core heritage processing system, was switched off on 30 November 2021. In addition to START, and in line with the all-of- government strategy of moving to digital first and cloud- based solutions, Inland Revenue has adopted a number of other COTS applications: • Sitecore – manages the content of public facing websites, as well as the internal intranet. • Microsoft 365 – the platform on which Inland Revenue’s people operate. This enabled the roll out of laptops and tablets which allowed Inland Revenue to operate seamlessly during COVID-19 disruptions. It also ensures all information created by any staff member is stored securely centrally, thus reducing the risk of data loss. • Oracle cloud applications – a fully cloud based ‘as-a- Service’ solution supporting Inland Revenue’s finance and human resources functions, which has been named Ātea. • Oracle web centre content – supports Inland Revenue’s knowledge and document management platform, which has been named STAX. The transformation programme has achieved the outcomes intended Page 15 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] • ServiceNow – Supporting the I nland Revenue-wide Service Desk. • SAS – a managed suite of products making up the data and intelligence platform (DIP). • Microsoft Sentinel – an information security repository allowing any information security risks or incidents to be managed. • One Identity Manager – a cloud-based service that enables identity governance and administration including privileged access management. • Atlassian (Jira, Confluence) – a suite of products supporting project delivery and risk and issue management. Systems are configured to Inland Revenue’s requirements with minimal customisation. Inland Revenue’s new infrastructure is performing very well as evidenced by its stability in coping with a significant increase in volumes. During 2021, the third round of automatic end-of-year income tax assessments for individuals saw Inland Revenue’s systems handle substantially higher loads than in 2020. Applications for COVID-19 support and relief further added to the load. Inland Revenue’s systems would simply not have been able to cope with the volumes experienced as recently as 2- 3 years ago. System availability targets were consistently exceeded during 2020/21. The number of critical incidents Inland Revenue experiences has declined, with few if any affecting customer-facing services. Three disaster recovery exercises have been successfully run, with the most recent in November 2020. Inland Revenue has moved to a new workplace environment, where everyone is mobile-enabled. People being able to work effectively remotely enables Inland Revenue to respond quickly and smoothly to disruptions, such as COVID-19 and building closures. As a result, Inland Revenue’s organisational resilience has increased significantly. The evergreen nature of the services and products that are now used to deliver services, including technology infrastructure, means these are all delivered as-a-service and kept up to date by trusted partners and vendors. As a result, Inland Revenue’s services and products will always be up to date. The move to cloud computing has provided numerous benefits. Inland Revenue’s systems are now off-the-shelf and cloud-based. The benefits of this approach include: • Collaboration: Third parties can communicate and share information more easily with Inland Revenue. • Flexibility: Inland Revenue’s people can access tools and data from any location. • Improved business continuity: In the event of a natural disaster, data is stored in a secure location and is able to be accessed. • Currency/efficiency: Software is regularly updated and current. Outcome 6: Inland Revenue is working more efficiently High levels of automation, straight through processes that reduce effort for customers and Inland Revenue, and digital uptake have changed the nature of Inland Revenue’s work considerably. As customer effort has reduced, Inland Revenue’s work effort has reduced. The size of Inland Revenue’s workforce has reduced commensurately with an FTE profile as at 30 June 2021 that is 28% less than it was at 30 June 2016. Processing times have improved significantly, providing customers with certainty sooner. The following examples illustrate the speed with which Inland Revenue can now process transactions. KiwiSaver and student loans moved to new systems and processes in April 2020. KiwiSaver providers apply for the government contribution on behalf of their members after 30 June each year. In the first 5 days of July 2021, Inland Revenue processed more than 2.6 million claims for $904 million in total, representing the bulk of the claims. On 5 July 2021 alone, 1.2 million claims were processed overnight in 35 minutes. This was the first year Inland Revenue was able to keep up with incoming demand and process and pay claims on the same day. Error rates were well down on 2020, as the issues that were causing many of the errors have been addressed. The transformation programme has achieved the outcomes intended Page 16 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Previously, the quickest Inland Revenue managed to catch up on processing the backlog of errors was 12 days. Closing a student loan used to be resource intensive for Inland Revenue, resulting in delays for customers. The information needed to close a loan took time to arrive, as employer monthly schedules (replaced by payday filing in April 2019) were filed at the end of the following month. This meant the majority of loans were overpaid by the time Inland Revenue took any action to close them. In most cases, multiple contacts with customers were required to sort things out. This meant delays in closing the loan and refunding overpayments. Customers could wait months for overpaid amounts to be refunded to them, resulting in unnecessary frustration. Overall, each account took about 40 to 45 days to finalise and required considerable follow up with employers and customers. Now, the vast majority of loan closures are processed overnight. For example, between January and June 2021, 97% of straightforward closures were processed overnight. Child support moved to new systems and processes in October 2021. New systems and processes are far more efficient. This can be seen, for example, with the automated population of case information being sent to Services Australia for child support cases managed under the reciprocal agreement. The monthly schedule Inland Revenue sends to Australia outlining payments collected on their behalf can now be produced automatically in a matter of minutes. Previously it could take up to two days to produce and was highly manual. Inland Revenue now automatically notifies employers or the Ministry of Social Development when deductions need to be made from income or a benefit to pay a liable parent’s child support. Since go-live Inland Revenue has automatically set up over 6,000 deductions from income that would previously have been done manually and taken longer. These are deductions for newly liable parents, parents already paying by deduction and whose source of income has changed, and parents who have defaulted on their payments. Inland Revenue is better targeting its specialist resources to help support customers. Inland Revenue’s customer compliance specialists are able to focus on more complex, higher value customer interventions, such as audits or investigations. Imputation transactions provide a good example of this in practice. These transactions are often misunderstood by both agents and customers and are recorded incorrectly as a result. The data and intelligence platform enables risks and reporting anomalies to be quickly identified. This has significantly reduced the time (from potentially hours to a few minutes) needed to identify which cases should be reviewed by one of Inland Revenue’s compliance specialists. Specialists assigned a case can easily access a report which highlights the risk areas for review and includes all the detail required to review imputation returns. Inland Revenue’s organisation design has fundamentally changed. Organisation design changes were progressively introduced from February 2018 to support the move to a customer-centric, intelligence-led, agile and inclusive organisation. As part of the re-design, management layers were streamlined to support the move to broad-based roles, with leaders focusing on managing people rather than managing work or tasks. A new model for delegations has been adopted, empowering customer-facing staff to resolve more issues for customers at first contact. Working as part of a networked team is now standard practice across Inland Revenue. This was amply demonstrated by the way we responded to COVID-19. Networked teams bring people with different skills and experience together to implement new initiatives and to improve things or resolve issues for customers. The transformation programme has achieved the outcomes intended Page 17 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Tracking achievement of these outcomes. Achievement of the investment objectives is measured against a number of lead and lag indicators shown on the next page. For the 2020/21 year, Inland Revenue achieved seven out of the ten indicators for which there are quantitative measures. The measures not achieved were: • The percentage of customers who find it easy to comply. While this is increasing, this measure is tracking up more slowly than expected. Notwithstanding the significant changes introduced since 2017, 82% of customers say they find it easy to comply. • Reduction in compliance time for SMEs. The target for 2020/21 was not achieved, with a saving of 5 hours compared to a target of 15 hours. It appears that COVID-19 and payday filing are having an impact. However the cumulative value of the time saved is above target. Inland Revenue recognises that achieving the targeted time savings by 2023/24 will be challenging, and that an on-going focus on reducing effort for SMEs will be required. • Annual reduction in Inland Revenue’s administrative costs. This was not achieved for 2020/21 as decisions were made to delay some organisational changes in light of COVID-19. However the cumulative reduction in costs is above target and Inland Revenue is confident it will achieve the targeted savings by 2023/24. Although the transformation programme will close by 30 June 2022, Inland Revenue will continue to track and report against its benefit commitments through until 2023/24.

From 2018/19 onwards, Inland Revenue reports on the overall percentage of digital uptake measured in returns filed electronically. 6 Inland Revenue had intended to run the SME compliance cost survey again in 2020, however the impacts of COVID-19, especially on smaller businesses, resulted in a decision being taken to delay the survey until 2021. The 2018 survey has been used as an indicative result. 7 The additional revenue is already included in the government’s revenue forecasts. This indicator is rated as achieved based on increases in proxy measures. 8 These figures do not include investment decisions made by Ministers to support the Government’s response to COVID-19 of $36.9m in 2020/21, $26.5m in 2021/22, and $22.7m in 2022/23. Page 19 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] THE COMMERCIAL CASE Confirming arrangements for the services and products required for on-going operations This section outlines the commercial arrangements Inland Revenue has put in place for the post-transformation environment and the work that will continue beyond programme closure. Enduring commercial arrangements are in place Page 20 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Inland Revenue has moved from a build and maintain environment to using commercial-off-the-self (COTS) solutions. The heritage approach of on-premises perpetual licencing has given way to hosted as-a-service solutions. As a result, Inland Revenue is now more reliant on its key partners to enable services to be delivered to customers. This has necessitated a different approach to commercial relationships, one built on high-trust and collaboration rather than a more traditional service level agreement arrangement. During the implementation of transformation, relationships with key implementation partners were managed by the programme. The initial contracts covered the services and solutions needed to support implementation. As these relationships were always intended to be long-term and as the programme nears a close, the focus has shifted to the ongoing support arrangements needed with partners. The key long-term relationships for Inland Revenue include: • FAST Enterprises LLC (FAST) who provide the core processing platform and customer-facing digital services. • Oracle who provide the enterprise support services platform. • SAS who provide the data and intelligence platform. • Spark who provide data centre and hosting services. 9 Management of user accounts, roles, and access rights for individuals in an organisation. • Microsoft who provide Microsoft 365 and Azure cloud services. • AKQA who provide web services. • TeamIM who provide information knowledge management services. Management of these relationships has now transferred to their enduring home in Inland Revenue’s new organisation structure and appropriate commercial arrangements have been put in place. Work underway. There is a small amount of work to be completed prior to the closure of the transformation programme by 30 June 2022. Decommissioning of heritage systems and processes is proceeding at pace and will be completed by programme closure. Alongside this activity, commercial arrangements with the providers of heritage services and solutions are being terminated to enable Inland Revenue’s heritage data centres to be fully decommissioned. In December 2021, Inland Revenue terminated its mainframe agreement with Unisys and handed FIRST, its heritage core processing system, over to Unisys to begin decommissioning. This was a key milestone for the programme. Other work underway which will be completed before programme closure includes: • Privileged access management and identity governance services 9 is on schedule to replace the heritage identity management processes and systems in March 2022 to enable the exit from the data centres. Further work will be completed in April/May 2022 to conclude this work. • Mobile-Desktop-as-a-Service is an interim solution enabling Inland Revenue’s contact centre staff and FAST’s developers to work from home during pandemic related disruption. This arrangement will be required until Inland Revenue has a new contact centre solution in place. Enduring commercial arrangements are in place Page 21 THE FINANCIAL CASE Confirming the return of funding This section outlines the forecast total costs for transformation and the funding Inland Revenue will return to the Crown at the conclusion of the programme. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] The programme has come in under budget and is returning funding to the Crown Page 22 Confirming the return of funding. This section outlines the forecast total costs for transformation and the funding Inland Revenue will return to the Crown at the conclusion of the programme. With the programme closing on 30 June 2022, this financial case (prepared in March 2022) documents the near completed financial results for transformation, including: • A forecast cost outturn and the funding amount to be handed back to the Crown. • An update on the commitment made in the November 2015 business case regarding Inland Revenue’s funding contribution to transformation. • An update on the business case commitment regarding the size of Inland Revenue’s post-transformation operating baseline. The forecast amounts assume that all the transformation-related technical adjustments submitted through the Budget 2022 technical initiatives process are approved by Cabinet. The transformation programme will come in under budget. Inland Revenue can now provide an estimate of the cost to complete transformation with a high level of confidence. Forecast total capital and operating spend will be approximately $1,641 million over the 10-years from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2024, with an approximately further $450 million for depreciation and capital charge over the same period. This means forecast programme savings of $227 million (12%) across capital and operating expenditure and $214 million ( 32%) for depreciation and capital charge. The combined savings to be handed back to the Crown are therefore approximately $441 million (17%), with a further capital saving of nearly $23 million repurposed by Cabinet for other priority spending in Inland Revenue. The forecast savings could increase slightly once the programme is formally closed and final costs are known. The tables below and on the next page show the total forecast transformation spend for capital and operating and depreciation and capital charge over the 10-year period, broken down by: • Pre-design and design phases (1 July 2014 to 31 December 2015) • Implementation (1 January 2016 to 30 June 2022) • Residual activities 10 deferred due to COVID-19 (1 July 2022 to 30 June 2024) • On-going operating costs until 30 June 2024 • Depreciation and capital charge to 30 June 2024 (shown in separate table). ($ million) Pre-design & design Actual Implementation Forecast Residual activities Forecast One-off costs Forecast On-going to 30/6/2024 Forecast Total spend Forecast Approved funding Budget Forecast underspend Forecast Self-funding increase 11 Total savings handed back to Crown Forecast Capital - 463 21 484 - 484 590 (106) (21) (127) Operating 74 915 35 1,024 133 1,157 1,257 (100) - (100) Total capital & operating 74 1,378 56 1,508 133 1,641 1,847 (206) (21) (227) 10 The residual activities were deferred because the programme had to temporarily redeploy resources to priority COVID-19 initiatives. These activities include work to complete our future-proofed contact centre capability, the optimisation of START and enterprise support services as well as finish embedding new organisational capabilities. 11 Inland Revenue increased its internal capital contribution by self-funding the capital for the residual activities ($21 million). This freed-up an equivalent amount of externally funded capital which can now be returned to the Crown. Capital and operating savings handed back to the Crown thus increased from $206 million to $227 million. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] The programme has come in under budget and is returning funding to the Page 23 ($ million) Total spend Forecast Approved funding Budget Forecast underspend Forecast Depreciation 304 443 (139) Capital charge 146 221 (75) Total depreciation & capital charge 450 664 (214) Savings were achieved through a combination of: • Active commercial practices, with a dedicated team of procurement professionals with significant experience in managing complex, multi-vendor environments. • Tight scope management, with a strong reliance on implementation of out-of-the box processes and no unnecessary configuration or customisation. • A strong focus on delivery, with any delays short-lived and managed within internal contingencies. • Rigorous financial management practices, with regular reviews of budgets and forecasts to ensure we delivered value for money. • Active risk management including regular risk identification and mitigation as well as an annual update of the Quantitative Risk Analysis (QRA) for the cost estimates. Furthermore, Inland Revenue was able to make use of several ‘as-a-Service’ offerings that were not available in the market when the costs for transformation were modelled in the November 2015 business case. These offerings significantly reduced the amount of capital spending, with a corresponding reduction in depreciation and capital charge expenses. Some of the depreciation and capital charge underspend is also due to capital expenditure being incurred later in the programme than was assumed in the business case. 12 The assumption made is that the recommendation to hand back this funding will be approved in the Budget 2022 technical package. Most of the transformation underspend has been returned to the Crown as a saving, with a smaller amount redirected by Cabinet to another priority. Of total generated savings of nearly $464 million over the 10-year period ending 30 June 2024, Inland Revenue has returned nearly $441 million to the Crown. Cabinet agreed to repurpose a further capital funding saving of almost $23 million, through a capital to operating swap, to help manage increased demand and integrity issues related to COVID- 19 within Inland Revenue (CAB-12-MIN-008 refers). Of the total $441 million hand back to the Crown, $12 million was returned in the 2021 October Baseline Update, $160 million was returned in previous years and an amount of $269 million is being returned through the Budget 2022 technical package. The table below shows the amounts handed back over the life of the programme.

Expressed in a different way, this equates to a hand back of nearly 32% of the new Crown funding approved for transformation ($441 million of $1,384 million), i.e. this excludes the funding contributed by Inland Revenue. The commitment made in the November 2015 business case to self-fund a significant portion of the capital and operating costs of transformation has been achieved. In the November 2015 business case, Inland Revenue committed to contributing between 40% and 50% of transformation capital and operating funding from internal sources in the 10-year period from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2024. This included a contribution from balance sheet capital reserves as well as savings from the operating baseline. As shown in the table below, Inland Revenue is forecasting to achieve this commitment, with approximately 47% of the capital and operating funding for transformation coming from internal sources. Self-funded cost ($ million) Self-funded amount Forecast Total spend Forecast Self-funded percentage Forecast Business case commitment Capital 280 484 58% Operating 478 1,157 41% Total capital & operating 758 1,641 47% 40% - 50% Inland Revenue’s contribution for the depreciation and capital charge costs was modelled at a minimum of 56% in the business case. As explained previously, the forecast final depreciation and capital charge costs are significantly lower than originally modelled, however the Inland Revenue dollar contribution remained the same as modelled at 13 E xcludes inflation to ensure comparability with the 2015 business case. 14 To ensure a like-for-like comparison between the two years, some adjustments have been made including the removal of time-limited new policy initiatives introduced in the interim as well as transformation design costs in 2014/15 and residual activities in 2022/23. $413 million. Inland Revenue’s percentage contribution to the depreciation and capital charge cost therefore increased to about 90%. In real terms, Inland Revenue’s post-transformation operating baseline is considerably lower than its pre-transformation baseline; this exceeds the department’s November 2015 business case commitment to achieve post-transformation baseline neutrality in real terms. Modelling for the November 2015 business case showed that administrative savings resulting from transformation would offset new operating costs including depreciation. Inland Revenue committed to delivering an operating baseline post-transformation that would be about equal in real terms to the pre-transformation baseline. This commitment has been exceeded. As shown in the table below, while the like-for-like nominal baseline is about the same (1% higher), the post-transformation operating baseline expressed in real terms 13 has reduced by 15%.

Enduring management and governance arrangements are in place Page 26 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Inland Revenue been making changes to its organisation design and policies and practices since 2017 to reflect changes in the nature of its work and to ensure the department could operate sustainably once the programme closes. In addition, a dedicated workstream was established as part of the final stage of the programme to ensure a smooth transition of the services, processes, frameworks and methods that will endure after the programme closes. Since the last addendum was prepared in October 2020, Inland Revenue has: • updated its governance arrangements • completed changes to its organisation design • updated its Enterprise Risk Management Framework and Risk Management Policy • agreed on-going benefit monitoring commitments. Governance arrangements Inland Revenue’s governance arrangements have continued to evolve to ensure they remain fit for purpose. Two new enterprise-level governance bodies have been established: • The Enterprise Priorities and Performance Committee (EPPC) was established in September 2020. EPPC governs Inland Revenue’s performance, health and delivery of key initiatives and activities, and ensures the focus is on the right areas to achieve the strategic direction set by the Strategic Governance Board. • The Data and Information Governance Authority (DIGA) became part of Inland Revenue’s executive-level governance system in August 2021. DIGA ensures Inland Revenue has transparent and accountable governance arrangements that provide oversight of the management and use of data. An updated governance structure for Inland Revenue is shown in the column on the right. Organisation design Inland Revenue is working more efficiently. Higher levels of automation and rules built into systems mean straight forward transactions are processed with no human intervention. For example, around 93% of GST returns are processed straight through, ensuring customers get valid refunds quickly. As customer effort has reduced, the nature of Inland Revenue’s work has changed. This has freed Inland Revenue up to focus on customers who need help and support and those who choose not to comply with their obligations. The size of Inland Revenue’s workforce has reduced commensurately, with 28% fewer full-time equivalents (FTEs) as at 30 June 2021 compared to 30 June 2016. The reduction of 1,556 in the number of FTEs was achieved by adopting a set of workforce management principles. This meant that redundancies were limited to around 450, some of which were voluntary, with the balance achieved through attrition. Enduring management and governance arrangements are in place Page 27 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] A full organisational redesign was completed, beginning in 2017 and concluded during 2021. The new operating model enables Inland Revenue to harness collective strengths and knowledge to solve issues, innovate and improve services using new digital capabilities and networked ways of working, and delegate decisions closer to the customer. Since 2017, Inland Revenue has created new capability-based roles, more flexible teams, and new leadership models.  Capability-based roles are focused on transferable skills such as customer service or digital literacy as well as new capabilities such as data analytics, enabling people to build their capabilities as work has changed. The first three new organisation groups were established in February 2018 to enable a stronger focus on meeting customers’ needs - two Customer & Compliance Services groups, one focused on individuals, families and micro-businesses and one on small, medium and significant enterprises, and the Information and Intelligence Services group. These were followed by new structures and models for Policy and Regulatory Stewardship in 2019 and the Tax Counsel Office in 2020. In 2021, the final organisation design changes resulted in new functions being established for the post-transformation environment. The Corporate and Enabling Services organisation design has resulted in a number of changes which became effective from 1 March 2021. These changes included the establishment of a number of new teams including: • The Planning, Design and Delivery (PDD) group prioritises, designs, schedules and implements changes to START and related business processes resulting from policy changes, government initiatives, budget changes, annual returns, system and service pack upgrades, continuous improvement or other change demand. This group reported to the Deputy Commissioner Transformation until 31 December 2021 and has now transitioned to become part of Customer and Compliance Services (CCS). The Deputy Commissioner, Transformation is providing support and mentoring until the programme closes at 30 June 2022. • The Enterprise Service Delivery team in the Enterprise Services business group has similar responsibilities to PDD for the systems that support the day-to-day running of Inland Revenue. • The Strategic Portfolio Stewardship team in the Enterprise Design and Integrity (ED&I) business group supports enterprise planning, risk management, performance monitoring and reporting, investment analysis, and a portfolio of change initiatives. • The Strategic Architecture team in ED&I ensures there is a clear link between strategy and implementation by translating strategy and policy into integrated, connected and feasible design, which is aligned with organisational frameworks, processes and systems. The team supports Inland Revenue’s decision making by providing system- wide thinking and an end-to-end perspective. When PDD was established it was made up of three business units - Design and Delivery, Capability and Outcomes (C&O), and Customer Experience Design (CXD). Detailed design was completed for the Design and Delivery team by March 2021 as part of the Corporate and Enabling Services design. Detailed design for C&O and CXD was completed in November 2021. Also In November 2021, Inland Revenue established the Compliance Strategy and Innovation team in CCS. This team provides an enduring home for the START analytics work and brings in compliance planning and intervention design work. Inland Revenue’s organisation design changes are now complete with new capability-based roles, more flexible teams and new leadership models. Mobile workplace technology is enabling Inland Revenue’s people to work from anywhere. Inland Revenue kept providing services during several significant disruptions that occurred during the implementation of the programme, including the Kaikoura earthquake, long- term building closures due to seismic issues, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Enduring management and governance arrangements are in place Page 28 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Risk management In October 2021, Inland Revenue updated its Enterprise Risk Management Framework to support accountability, ownership and stakeholder confidence that risks are identified and managed effectively. All risks at Inland Revenue are visible and transparent through the use of an Enterprise Risk Management tool with robust dashboard functionality. Inland Revenue’s Enterprise Risk Management Framework is consistent with the International Risk Management Standard (ISO 31000:2018) and is aligned to The Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of Treadway Commission (COSO) Enterprise Risk Management Framework 2017. In October 2021, Inland Revenue also updated its Risk Management Policy. This policy provides clarity on the objectives of risk management at Inland Revenue, and ensures roles and responsibilities are in place to collectively manage risks. The Strategic Governance Board oversees risk management and the Risk and Assurance Committee provides independent oversight. Progress tracking of benefit realisation Responsibility for reporting progress has been handed over from the programme to its enduring home in Inland Revenue’s new organisation structure. The Performance and Reporting team, part of Strategic Portfolio Stewardship in ED&I, is now accountable for ongoing track and reporting of Inland Revenue’s benefit commitments. To ensure visibility for stakeholders, progress against benefits and outcomes, including the table of lead and lag indicators, will be published in Inland Revenue’s Annual Reports for 2022, 2023 and 2024. Appendix A – High level transformation timeline Page 29 19 November 2015 Cabinet approved the detailed business case enabling implementation to begin. 2 June 2016 The Taxation (Transformation: First Phase Simplification and Other Measures) Bill was enacted. This Bill contained legislative changes to support transformation by removing out-dated legislative requirements and simplifying some administrative processes. 7 February 2017 Stage 1 go-live (GST moved to new systems (START) and processes). Prior to this a number of key activities such as the establishment of new data centres were completed. 21 February 2017 The Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill was enacted. This Bill contained the legislative changes needed to support Stage 1 and measures to simplify tax processes. February 2018 The first three groups in Inland Revenue’s new organisation design were established: Customer & Compliance Services – Individuals, Customer & Compliance Services – Business, and Information & Intelligence Services; 3000+ staff move to new roles. 29 March 2018 The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017–18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Bill was enacted. This Bill contained measures to improve the accuracy of tax collected through the year, changing the reporting requirements for employment and investment income information. 17 April 2018 Release 2 go-live (withholding taxes, FBT, and gaming machine duty moved to new systems (START and processes; the accounting income method (AIM) for provisional tax and the automatic exchange of information with international tax treaty partners (AEOI) were implemented; payday filing was introduced on a voluntary basis). 7 September 2018 A pilot version of Inland Revenue’s re-designed website was released for customer feedback, focused on child support. 11 February 2019 The first phase of the new enterprise support services platform (Ātea) went live, moving budgeting and forecasting functions to new systems and processes. Early 2019 The new data and intelligence platform (DIP) was implemented. The DIP enables the vast and varied data Inland Revenue collects to be quickly collated and made of sense of. 1 April 2019 The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018-19, Modernising Tax Administration and Remedial Matters) was enacted.

This Bill contained legislative changes to simplify and modernise the administration of KiwiSaver and student loans repayments. 17 April 2020 Release 4 go-live (KiwiSaver, student loans and PAYE processing moved to new systems (START) and processes; investment income reporting changes became mandatory). \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Appendix A – High level transformation timeline Page 30 May 2020 First release of the new and improved tax technical website went live, with rulings, determinations, interpretation statements and other tax technical documents accessible on the new site. 7 September 2020 Third release of Ātea - sustainability and affordability functions go live. 1 March 2021 Stage 4, Release 1 go-live (paid parental leave, unclaimed money, duties and NZ foreign trusts moved to new systems (START) and processes). 1 March 2021 The final groups were established as part of our new organisation design– Enterprise Services and Enterprise Design & Integrity. 24 March 2021 The Child Support Amendment Bill was enacted. This Bill contained a range of measures to support the October release. 30 March 2021 The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020-21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill was enacted. This Bill contained measures to improve the administration of unclaimed money. 28 October 2021 Stage 4, Release 2 go-live (child support moves to new systems and processes (START), the online services customers use and the software Inland Revenue’s people use is upgraded). 30 November 2021 FIRST, Inland Revenue’s heritage core processing system, is switched off. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Appendix B – Additional scope delivered during transformation Page 31 Following decisions made by Cabinet, there have been additions to the scope of transformation since the Detailed Business Case was prepared in November 2015. The accounting income method (AIM) option for provisional tax. AIM was implemented as part of Release 2 in April 2018, enabling small businesses to better match their provisional tax payments to when they earn their income. AIM means businesses can pay smaller amounts of provisional tax more often and get refunds of overpaid provisional tax during the year. Until AIM, businesses paid provisional tax at set times of the year, regardless of when they earned their income. Implementation costs for AIM were included within the overall funding approved for transformation. The automatic exchange of information (AEOI) with international tax treaty partners. New Zealand is one of many jurisdictions that has committed to a global initiative led by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) on the automatic exchange of financial account information (AEOI) using the Common Reporting Standard (CRS). Tax authorities will exchange this information to ensure everyone pays the right amount of tax. AEOI was implemented as part of Release 2 in April 2018. Additional funding of $32.2 million was provided to Inland Revenue as part of Budget 2016 to implement AEOI. In September 2016, Inland Revenue sought approval to drawdown $21.5 million of this amount. The decision to implement AEOI in START provided technology solution certainty and enabled costs to be revised. Best Start. Best Start payments are $60 per week per child for babies born on or after 1 July 2018. Families can choose to receive the payment every week, every fortnight or once a year, in line with other Working for Families payments. To meet delivery timeframes, Best Start was first implemented in Inland Revenue’s heritage systems and processes (for which additional funding was provided) then migrated to new systems and processes as part of Release 3 in April 2019. The costs for migrating Best Start to new systems and processes as part of Release 3 formed part of the overall funding approved for transformation. Research and Development Tax Incentive. The Research and Development Tax Incentive (RDTI) operates as a tax credit and features a 15% tax credit on up to $120 million of eligible expenditure. It has been available to eligible businesses since the 2019/20 income year. Inland Revenue is the administering agency of the RDTI, supported by Callaghan Innovation. The RDTI was delivered as part of Release 4. Additional funding of $4.3 million over 4 years was provided as part of Budget 2018 for one-off implementation costs for the R&D tax incentive. Hours paid. Collection of hours paid information was included as part Release 4 in April 2020 and did not require additional funding. This information is collected from employers who file through software and who already record their payroll on this basis. This will help to improve the administration of Working for Families and Child Support. These payments are partly determined by the hours people are paid for. COVID-19 response initiatives. Inland Revenue’s swift response to COVID-19 amply demonstrates the benefits of the investment made in transformation and the agility decision-makers now have. The initiatives were delivered while Inland Revenue was organising its people to work remotely, preparing for the implementation of Release 4 in April 2020 and the peak tax season, including the 2020 automatic income tax assessments. In early 2020, Inland Revenue was the lead agency on two COVID-19 response bills and prepared a Supplementary Order Paper (SOP) for another. These introduced a number of changes including: • Allowing Inland Revenue to share information with other government agencies to assist them in their response to COVID-19. For example, Inland Revenue \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Appendix B – Additional scope delivered during transformation Page 32 supported MSD to administer the wage subsidy scheme as it relies on data held by Inland Revenue to verify applications. Inland Revenue shared information about self-employed individuals, employers and employees with MSD which enabled many applications to be automatically approved. Initially, supporting Wage Subsidy applications was very labour-intensive. However in June 2020, Inland Revenue developed a portal to allow MSD to self- serve some queries. • Authorising the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, on behalf of the Crown, to lend money under the small business cashflow (loan) scheme. Following a resurgence of COVID-19 in early 2021, The Taxation (COVID-19 Resurgence Support Payments and Other Matters) Bill was enacted on 18 February 2021. The Resurgence Support Payment was announced by the Government on 15 December 2020 and made available for the first time on 23 February 2021. Revised eligibility criteria to make the small business cashflow loan scheme available to more businesses by also took effect from early February 2021. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Appendix C – Programme roadmap Page 33 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Appendix D – Release effort Page 34 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Stage 1 Stages 2 and 3 Stage 4 Feb 2017 Release 2 April 2018 Release 3 April 2019 Release 4 April 2020 Release 1 March 2021 Release 2 October 2021 Products migrated to START • GST • Co-existence • Withholding taxes • Fringe benefit tax • Payroll subsidy • Gaming machine duty • Income tax • Working for Families • KiwiSaver • Student Loans • Back-end processing of PAYE • Paid parental leave • Unclaimed money • NZ foreign trusts • Duties • Child support • Upgrade to online services • Version 12 major upgrade Customer readiness Seminars for customers 0 250 350 Face to face seminars replaced with webinars due to COVID-19 Webinars for customers 3 15 15 16 8 14 Customers contacted 630,000 368,000 2,000,000 1,091,000 14,300 1,000,000 Programme readiness Accounts migrated 880,000 1 million 19.7 million 7 million 7,000 570,000 Returns migrated 8.1 million 13 million 15 million 38 million 12,000 2.8 million assessments Transactions migrated 23.6 million 2 million 142 million 172 million 1.4 million 129 million Contributions migrated n/a n/a n/a 767 million n/a n/a Web logons updated n/a n/a 8.3 million n/a n/a n/a Time to load data into START 17 hours 11 hours 33 hours 54 hours 4 hours 35 hours Time to remove data from FIRST 12 hours 10 hours 30 hours 21 hours n/a 23.5 hours Number of cut-over tasks More than 350 More than 540 More than 1,150 More than 1,250 891 More than 1,150 Hours to cut-over 113 hours 93 hours 185 hours 168 hours 48 hours 140 hours Total tests completed 15 15,462 46,304 94,204 76,293 1,554 35,801 Business readiness Staff trained 2,700 2,700 3,600 3,800 520 3,600 15 There was a change in approach for testing from Stage 4, Release 1 in March 2021 as subsequent releases used as much of the already delivered design patterns as possible. Most of the testing effort was put into areas where the products had unique requirements. In practice, this meant less testing on functions common to all products, which allowed the focus to be on the areas of real complexity or risk.
Page 3 IN CONFIDENCE Part A Updates to the Programme Business Case This section summarises material changes since the last addendum to the Programme Business Case was prepared in October 2018. The most significant update is to the economic case. The commercial and management cases have also been updated. No changes have been made to either the strategic or financial cases. Executive Summary Page 4 IN CONFIDENCE Fundamental changes to the revenue system over the last three years have delivered significant value to New Zealanders. The successful implementation of Release 3 on 26 April 2019 marks a significant milestone in the transformation of the revenue system. Policy and legislative settings have changed. Customers and partners interact with Inland Revenue in a completely different way. Inland Revenue’s organisation design and capabilities are organised around customers. Supporting all of this are new systems and processes. All taxes and Working for Families are now on the new system, as is all customer information such as contact details. While these significant changes have at times put pressure on participants in the revenue system, their value is now evident. It is much less effort for customers The way customers interact with Inland Revenue and the revenue system has now fundamentally changed. Changes to the collection and use of employment and investment income information have enabled more far- reaching changes to be made, including the introduction of a new year-end process for individuals. The combination of these changes means that for most individuals, tax will be correctly withheld and assistance provided at the time it is needed. As a result, customers no longer have to rely on a year-end process to be certain they have paid and received about the right amounts. Customers receiving social policy entitlements can be more confident they are doing the right thing, as, in the main, these rely on accurate income information. Inland Revenue has supported the approximately 200,000 employers to move to payday filing, and approximately 2.9 million individual customers to adapt to a new year- end process. Online services are now available for all taxes. Customers can provide information, set up payment arrangements, and keep track of everything online. More and more customers are using them, with 89% of returns filed electronically for the year ending 30 June 2019. Individuals can see their personal details and all the income Inland Revenue pre-populates for them in their online account (myIR). Businesses can interact with Inland Revenue through their software and all their information is in one place in myIR. As at 30 September 2019, the majority of employers (98%) are filing digitally, with around 48% of payday returns filed through software. A wider range of intermediaries can act on their clients’ behalf, see the same information as their clients, and do everything online their clients can do. These changes make it easy for customers to do what they need to do, with 80% saying they find it easy to comply for the year ending 30 June 2019. Small-to-medium sized businesses say they are spending nine fewer hours a year meeting their tax obligations and say new digital services are making a real difference. Since the first changes were made in early 2017, the value of the time saved by these business owners is $280 million. It is simpler to pay and receive the right amounts Employers are providing employment income information more regularly. Payers of investment income are able to provide information about recipients more regularly, along with some new information where they have it. They will have to do so from 1 April 2020. This information is now stored in one place by Inland Revenue so it can be quickly collated to identify inconsistencies and errors. This means Inland Revenue can work with customers to help them get things right before the amounts involved get too big. Salary and wage earners now automatically get a refund or bill for tax to pay at the end of the year. For the year ending 31 March 2019, 1.3 million people received refunds worth $572 million and 271,000 people have $95 million to pay. It is easier for customers to comply and harder not to Improved analytical capabilities are enhancing the integrity of the revenue system by providing a real-time view of issues customers are struggling with and areas that might require closer investigation. All returns are now automatically risk-profiled. Inland Revenue now has more tools at its disposal to make smarter decisions about where to focus its resources. As a result, compliance activity can be better targeted through cost-effective interventions ranging from advice and education where needed to enforcement where necessary. Page 5 IN CONFIDENCE Errors and non-compliance, both inadvertent and deliberate, are being better detected and detected earlier through rules, created by Inland Revenue’s compliance experts. These are constantly adjusted as customer behaviour changes. Inland Revenue can now act more quickly to provide support where customers need it and also when obligations are being deliberately avoided. Inland Revenue is working more efficiently to collect and distribute money Broader, capability-based roles with more decision- making abilities mean that, increasingly, customers only have to talk to one person to get a query resolved. New workplace tools and internal systems and processes are enabling Inland Revenue’s people to do more for themselves and work more flexibly and efficiently. Since transformation began, Inland Revenue has made savings of $60 million from improved administration. Further efficiencies will follow as a result of increased automation and as the legislative changes implemented as part of Release 3 are embedded. The revenue system is more agile and resilient It is easier for Inland Revenue to make changes and deliver the outcomes policy-makers are looking for as new systems are configurable. Involving customers and third parties earlier has enhanced the policy development process. New infrastructure is more robust and secure, with customer-facing online services available 99.4% of the time for the year ending 30 June 2019. More solutions are being provided as-a-service or off-the-shelf meaning Inland Revenue can scale up quickly when needed. The addition of the research and development tax incentive and collection of hours paid information to scope are further evidence of increasing agility. Independent, external reviews confirm the good progress being made Regular, independent assurance reviews provide confidence that transformation is well managed and governed and that benefits are being progressively realised. Programme costs and benefits Transformation continues to track well within the funding envelope approved by Cabinet in 2015, Progress against monetary and non-monetary benefits is also tracking well as demonstrated by the results for the year ending 30 June 2019 for the lead and lag indicators. Inland Revenue recognises there is no room for complacency While transformation is now well advanced and has been successful to date, there are still two big releases ahead. Student loans and KiwiSaver will migrate to new systems and processes in April 2020, followed by Child Support in April 2021. In addition, a range of policy changes will be introduced, subject to legislation. These are complex products with many different stakeholders and for Child Support in particular, affect some customers with complex personal circumstances. Withheld under Section 9(2)(f)(iv) of 18(c)(i) of the Official Information Act 1982. Page 6 IN CONFIDENCE THE ECONOMIC CASE Delivering the preferred way forward This section provides an update on progress in delivering transformation and realising the agreed benefits and outcomes. The preferred way forward, programme roadmap, and release plan are unchanged. Modernisation of the revenue system is progressing well Page 7 IN CONFIDENCE Transformation continues to be implemented as planned: • Cabinet has agreed to policy changes to improve the administration of KiwiSaver and Student Loans as part of Release 4 in April 2020. • A new data and intelligence platform has been implemented. • Changes to Inland Revenue’s capabilities and organisation design continue. • Release 3 (the third of five planned releases) was successfully implemented on 26 April 2019, completing the migration of tax products to START. 1 The benefits of the changes being made are becoming increasingly evident. Because employment and investment income information are reported to Inland Revenue more often, people who only earn this type of income now have their end-of-year refund or tax to pay worked out for them. This information is now stored in one place and means Inland Revenue can associate more of a person’s income with them and identify things that aren’t right. New analytical capabilities are enabling Inland Revenue to look at any errors and separate potentially fraudulent behaviour from inadvertent mistakes and respond accordingly. Some transactions are stopped and referred to a person for review. In other cases, areas of complexity and confusion have been highlighted where customers 1 START stands for simplified tax and revenue technology and is the name Inland Revenue has chosen for the GenTax software provided by FAST Enterprises LLC and third parties need help to get things right. The prescribed investor rate is a good example. New systems and processes mean more and more customers are using online services as they are quick and convenient. As at 30 June 2019, 89% of returns were filed electronically and 98% of employers provided employment income information electronically. Together, these changes are making it simpler and easier for customers to meet their obligations and pay and receive the right amounts. The revenue system is working as designed – to be simple, open and certain. Delivering the future revenue system Delivering the future revenue system requires changes to policy, data, processes, people, and technology.  Simplifying policy and legislative settings A review of policy and legislative settings to support, enable, and optimise the benefits from business transformation is nearly complete. A number of significant legislative changes were implemented as part of Release 3 in April 2019. From 1 April 2019, employers have been required to provide employment income information to Inland Revenue on a payday basis. Since 1 April 2018, when payday filing was introduced on an optional basis, Inland Revenue has been supporting the approximately 200,000 employers to ensure they meet their new obligations. As at 30 September 2019, approximately 191,000 employers had filed approximately 3.4 million payday returns since 1 April 2019. A small portion of employers have not yet filed a payday return. Inland Revenue has been proactively contacting them to understand if they require any assistance. More businesses are now required to file electronically. From 1 April 2019, businesses that withheld more than $50,000 of PAYE and employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) in the previous tax year have been required to file online. From 1 April 2019, payers of investment income have been able to provide more detailed recipient information more frequently if they choose to. This becomes mandatory from 1 April 2020. Also from 1 April 2020, companies and Māori Authorities will be required to provide information about the recipients of investment income. Changes to the collection and use of employment and investment income information have enabled more far- reaching changes to be made, including the introduction of a new year-end process for individuals. The combination of these changes means that, for most Page 21 IN CONFIDENCE THE COMMERCIAL CASE Sourcing the services and products required for delivery This section outlines the suppliers Inland Revenue is working with to implement the future revenue system. Commercial arrangements support all-of -Government principles Page 22 IN CONFIDENCE The major procurement activity required to successfully implement transformation has largely been completed. All procurement is consistent with the principles of the Government Rules of Sourcing. Key suppliers Since the last addendum to the Programme Business Case was completed in October 2018, Inland Revenue has completed contract negotiations with a number of suppliers of products and services. These include: • Sitecore and AKQA for a web-content management solution. • Oracle for the technology solution that underpins Ātea. • Accenture and PrimeQ for services to implement Ātea. • Deloitte for ongoing support for identity and access management services. • FAST for ongoing support arrangements for START. • Assurity for testing services (pending completion of negotiations). • Unisys for the Mainframe-as-a-Service and data centre housing extensions to enable completion of Release 5 and successful disengagement and decommissioning. Efforts are now focused on agreeing the contract with Unisys to facilitate the decommissioning. All-of -government/shared services capabilities Inland Revenue continues to consume common capabilities and ICT capabilities where they exist, meet the department’s business needs and are cost-effective. Inland Revenue is working with other agencies to determine how the underlying business process model for Ātea can be shared across agencies. New Zealand businesses Inland Revenue seeks a wide range of providers for transformation and will continue to do so. Opportunities are actively promoted to the market place, including New Zealand businesses – for example, advertising on GETS and communications with vendors. Vendors are not chosen based on where they come from. The Government Rules of Sourcing are very clear that this is not allowed. To increase transparency, each year Inland Revenue publishes a list of the New Zealand tax resident suppliers it has spent over $500,000 with. For the year ending 30 June 2019, the total percentage spend on New Zealand companies was 35%. Following decisions made by Cabinet (CAB-19-MIN- 0213.02 refers), Inland Revenue has adjusted its definition of a New Zealand company to align with amendments to the Government Rules of Sourcing. For the purposes of procurement, the definition of a New Zealand business from 1 October 2019 is A business that originated in New Zealand (not being a New Zealand subsidiary of an off-shore business), is majority owned or controlled by New Zealanders, and has its principal place of business in New Zealand. The definition of a New Zealand company Inland Revenue previously used was based on whether the company is considered a New Zealand resident for tax purposes. A company is considered a tax resident if it is incorporated in New Zealand, or if control by company directors is exercised in New Zealand, or if it has its centre of management in New Zealand, or if It has its head office in New Zealand. Both delivery partners, FAST and Accenture, have recruited New Zealand staff. FAST has employed 35 New Zealanders and Accenture have employed over 40. Page 23 IN CONFIDENCE THE MANAGEMENT CASE Ensuring successful delivery This section outlines updated management arrangements for the programme, including assurance, benefits and risk management. Transformation continues to be well managed and governed Page 24 IN CONFIDENCE Since the last addendum to the Programme Business Case was prepared in October 2018, Inland Revenue has: • updated programme management arrangements • completed independent assurance reviews, and • regularly reviewed and updated risks. Governance arrangements remain unchanged. Programme methodologies and approaches and Inland Revenue’s change management approach also remain unchanged. Programme management arrangements Following Release 3 go-live in April 2019 and the completion of initiatives such as the deployment of work place technology, the structure and resource model for transformation was reviewed to ensure it is right-sized for the remainder of the programme, out to 2021. The high-level organisational structure for transformation as at July 2019 is shown below. The changes made since November 2018 are: • Some roles are no longer required. The Director Programme Management Office (PMO) role was put in place to set up the release plan and improve delivery processes. As the focus is now predominantly on the delivery of Releases 4 and 5, with two sub-programmes (intelligence-led and Ātea) being delivered in conjunction with business groups, this broad role is no longer needed. The Organisation Change Management and Training Lead role has not been replaced. Change support has been embedded in Releases 4 and 5 and in the intelligence-led and Ātea programmes. • Some reporting lines have changed. The PMO Lead now reports to the Deputy Commissioner, Transformation. Communications now reports to the Principal Transformation Director. The Director New Service Platform now reports to the Chief Technology Officer. • Some new roles have been established. Two dedicated senior leaders have been appointed to lead Releases 4 and 5. The Release 5 Lead will also lead the close out of the programme. Page 25 IN CONFIDENCE Progress tracking Delivery progress is evaluated through: • Independent quality assurance and Gateway reviews. • Oversight by the Senior Responsible Owner and governance groups. • Management and oversight from the Deputy Commissioner, Transformation and members of the programme leadership team (PLT). • Monthly red amber green (RAG) status reporting against the 10 keys. 5 Programme assurance A programme of regular assurance reviews provides confidence that transformation continues to be well managed and governed. Since the Programme Business Case Addendum was completed in October 2018, two further independent assurance reviews have taken place. • A Gateway 4 (Readiness for Service) review in March 2019. • KPMG completed their IQA9/TQA8 review in May 2019. Reviews continue to be positive, while noting transformation remains high risk. In July 2019, the Office of the Auditor General (OAG) began a performance audit of benefits management for transformation. The OAG are looking at measures and measurement systems for assessing and reporting on the 5 Scope, risk, issues, inter-dependency, schedule, resource, stakeholder engagement, delivery partners, financials and benefits benefits (to customers, the Crown, the department, and others) derived from transformation. Inland Revenue understands the OAG expects to complete their review by the end of 2019 and report to Parliament in March 2020. Benefits management Progress in realising benefits is regularly tracked and reported. Since the Programme Business Case Addendum dated October 2018, the following reports have been delivered: • In January 2019, a progress update on benefit realisation was included in a wider sustainability update provided to the Performance and Investment Committee (PIC). • In March 2019, a paper to the Portfolio Governance Committee (PGC) and PIC provided visibility of the process for confirming Release 4 benefits and facilitating a stocktake of progress to date in realising the benefits and outcomes set out in the 2015 business case. • Eleven case studies demonstrating realisation of benefits were provided to PGC and PIC to note between February 2019 and September 2019. • In May 2019, the results of the 2018 survey of SMEs perceptions of the time and costs of meeting their tax obligations were p rovided to PGC and PIC and reported to the Minister of Revenue and Cabinet. • A comprehensive update of progress across all non- monetary and monetary benefits was reported to the Strategic Governance Board in September 2019, and subsequently shared with central monitoring agencies, independent assurance reviewers and the Office of the Auditor-General. Risk management Identification and management of risks remains a strength of the programme. As at September 2019, there were 55 risks for transformation managed by the programme leadership team, of which the most significant (13 as at September 2019) are reported each month to the Portfolio Governance Committee. The top risks for transformation are support for heritage systems ending in 2021, the time taken to resolve major incidents, retaining people and the timing of benefit realisation. Mitigations are in place for all risks. Page 26 IN CONFIDENCE Part B Additions to the scope of transformation This section summarises additions to scope since the last addendum to the Programme Business Case was prepared in October 2018. Some additions to scope have been agreed Page 27 IN CONFIDENCE The additions to scope are the result of decisions taken by Government. The Government’s research and development tax incentive legislation and the collection of hours paid information initiative have been added to the scope of transformation since October 2018, demonstrating improved agility. Rese arch and Development Tax Incentive The Research and Development (R&D) Tax Incentive is part of the Government's strategy to increase the amount of R&D done in New Zealand. The R&D Tax Incentive operates as a tax credit and features a 15% tax credit on up to $120 million of eligible expenditure. It is available to eligible businesses from the 2019/20 income year. The benefits of the Incentive The Government has announced a goal of raising New Zealand’s total R&D spending to 2% of GDP by 2027. The R&D Tax Incentive is aimed at encouraging more business investment in R&D. It will support businesses of all sizes to undertake R&D. Who the Incentive will apply to Businesses doing R&D in New Zealand can be eligible if they have a core R&D activity and satisfy the eligibility criteria, regardless of their legal structure. 6 The R&D Tax Incentive applies from the beginning of the 2019/20 income year, which means the date from which it applies depends on An activity is a core activity if it is: • undertaken in New Zealand using a systematic approach, and • is intended to create new knowledge or things, and • is intended to resolve scientific or technological uncertainty. Businesses must own the results of their R&D activities or be able to use the results for no extra cost. The Government estimates that 2,000 to 3,000 businesses will be able to benefit from the R&D Tax Incentive. This compares to the approximately 300 businesses receiving Growth Grants from Callaghan Innovation, which are being replaced by the Incentive. Implementation approach Inland Revenue will be the administering agency of the R&D Tax Incentive, supported by Callaghan Innovation. In the first year of the Incentive (the 2019-20 income year), to claim the Incentive businesses will need to: • Enrol online through myIR before they file their re turns • Submit an R&D supplementary return online through myIR, and • Include their R&D tax credit claim amount in their income tax return. the balance date of each claimant. For most standard balance date (31 March) claimants, the R&D Tax Incentive will apply from 1 April 2019. In the second year of the Incentive (the 2020-21 income year), to claim the Incentive businesses will need to: • Enrol online if they didn’t enrol in year 1 • Obtain in-year approval (either by obtaining general approval or opting into the significant performer regime) – applications are made online through myIR • Submit an R&D supplementary return online through myIR • If they are in the significant performer regime, submit an R&D certificate alongside their supplementary return, and • Include their R&D tax credit claim amount in their income tax return. The R&D Tax Incentive is being delivered as part of Release 4. Funding Additional funding of $4.3 million over 4 years was provided as part of Budget 2018 for one-off implementation costs for the R&D tax incentive. Legislation The Taxation (Research and Development Tax Credits) Act 2019 was enacted on 7 May 2019. The R&D tax Incentive scheme commenced from 1 April 2019 for most businesses. 6 Page 28 IN CONFIDENCE Future development From year two (the 2020/21 income year), most businesses will be required to get their R&D activities approved by Inland Revenue (supported by Callaghan Innovation) before they can claim the credit. Businesses that spend more than $2m on eligible R&D in a given income year can choose to opt out of general approval into the significant performer regime (which includes an optional approval process called criteria and methodologies approval). The Government intends to run a pilot approval process in the first year of the regime (the 2019/2020 income year). The aim of the pilot is to ensure the general approval and criteria and methodologies approval are ready to be rolled-out more broadly from year two. Changes to the regime are proposed in the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans and Remedial Matters) Bill, which is currently before Select Committee. This includes proposals to enable more businesses to access refundable R&D tax credits, by removing the current refundability eligibility criteria completely and replacing the $255,000 cap on refundability with a new cap based on labour- related taxes. Hours paid The Government’s decision to collect hours paid information is included in the scope of Release 4. Who this will apply to This information will be collected from employers who file through software and who already record their payroll on this basis. Not all employers will be required to provide this information. Inland Revenue expects more employers to do so as digital uptake increases over time. The benefits of collecting this information Collecting this information will help to improve the administration of Working for Families and Child Support. These payments are partly determined by the hours people are paid for.

It should be read in conjunction with the: • Programme Business Case dated 22 October 2013, • Programme Business Case Addendum dated October 2014, and • Programme Update and Detailed Business Case dated November 2015. The most significant updates are to the economic and management cases. The commercial case has been updated. No material changes have been made to either the strategic or financial cases. Inland Revenue has made good progress Good progress has been made since November 2015. A release plan has been developed which sets out the sequence (within stages) in which taxes and entitlements will be moved to new systems and processes. The first two releases have been successfully implemented. It’s now easier for customers to manage their GST, withholding tax, fringe benefit tax and gaming machine duty obligations. The Making Tax Simpler consultation with New Zealanders on policy changes has been completed, and some legislative changes have already been implemented. The methodologies and frameworks adopted for design, development, data conversion, testing, implementation, assessing readiness, and change management have all contributed to the success of the first two releases. They are reviewed after each major release. Inland Revenue has begun changing its organisation design and capabilities. Three new organisation groups were established from February 2018 and changes have been made to Inland Revenue’s working environment to support the new design. Programme governance and management arrangements have been updated to ensure that transformation remains well supported and focused on delivering the commitments made. Contract negotiations have been completed with a number of suppliers of products and services. Common capabilities continue to be consumed where they exist, meet Inland Revenue’s business needs and are cost- effective. The benefits of these changes are being realised Positive results are evident across each of the six benefit areas. Benefit area Progress as at 30 June 2018 Easier for customers • 82% of customers find it easy to comply • Improved online services are available for GST, withholding tax, fringe benefit tax and gaming machine duty Benefit area Progress as at 30 June 2018 Policy agility • Government has more agility for GST, withholding tax, fringe benefit tax and gaming machine duty System resilience • Technology infrastructure has been strengthened Compliance cost savings • 86% of customers filing GST electronically • 87,000 customers filing GST through software • Customers spending 10 less hours a year on their GST obligations Administrative savings • Release 1 targets have been achieved Additional Crown Revenue • Included in government forecasts from the 2018/19 year Independent reviews confirm transformation is on track Regular, independent assurance reviews provide confidence that transformation continues to be well managed and governed. There have been some additions to scope The following initiatives have been added to scope since November 2015: • The accounting income method (AIM) option for provisional tax (Release 2). • The automatic exchange of information (AEOI) with international tax treaty partners (Release 2). • Best Start (Release 3). The Research & Development Tax Incentive and the findings of various working groups are emerging areas of work which are likely to have implications for the scope of transformation. In confidence Page 5 THE ECONOMIC CASE Delivering the preferred way forward This section provides an update on progress in delivering transformation. The preferred way forward and programme roadmap remain unchanged. Modernisation of the revenue system is well underway In confidence Page 6 Inland Revenue has made good progress since the Detailed Business Case was prepared (November 2015): • The Making Tax Simpler consultation with New Zealanders on policy changes has been completed, and some legislative changes implemented. • Changes have been made to Inland Revenue’s capabilities and organisation design. • A release plan has been developed and sets out the sequence (within stages) in which taxes and entitlements will be moved to new systems and processes. • The first two releases have been successfully implemented. • Benefits are being realised. There have been no changes to: • The preferred way forward, option 3B. • The overall cost and benefit assumptions. • The four-stage programme roadmap. Simplifying policy and legislative settings A review of policy and legislative settings to support, enable and optimise the benefits from business transformation is well underway, with some changes already enacted. A series of Making Tax Simpler discussion documents, designed to consult New Zealanders on possible changes, have been released: • Towards a new Tax Administration Act (November 2015). • Better administration of PAYE and GST (November 2015). • Better business tax (April 2016) – this was an issues paper rather than a discussion document. • Investment income information (July 2016). • Modernisation of the Tax Administration Act (TAA) (December 2016). • Better administration of individuals income tax (June 2017). • Better administration of social policy (July 2017). In June 2016, the Taxation (Transformation: First Phase Simplification and Other Measures) Bill was enacted. This Bill contained legislative changes to support transformation by removing out-dated legislative requirements and simplifying some administrative processes. In February 2017, the Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill was enacted. This Bill contained the legislative changes needed to support Stage 1 and the business tax reforms announced as part of Budget 2016. In March 2018, the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017–18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Bill was enacted. This Bill contained the policy changes resulting from the administration of PAYE and GST and investment income information consultation processes. Also in March 2018, the Government approved policy changes to the TAA (including the role of tax intermediaries and rulings and assessments). The next step is legislative change. In April 2018, the Government approved policy settings for PAYE error correction and adjustments for payday reporting, and changes that will simplify individuals’ income tax. The next step is legislative change. Where possible, changes to policy settings are being aligned with other changes made by transformation. This will minimise impacts for customers and Inland Revenue. Further policy and legislative changes may result from the Tax Working Group’s recommendations or the work of the Welfare Expert Advisory Group. Until firm recommendations are available it is difficult to assess the impact on Inland Revenue. Making more intelligent use of information Improved analytical capabilities will enable Inland Revenue to better use the information and data it has to better understand customers’ needs and provide them with more timely and targeted services. A new data and intelligence platform is expected to be implemented by early 2019. Improved digital channels are key to enabling customers to self-manage. Beginning from mid-2018, Inland Revenue’s website is being revamped and a new myIR landing page will be introduced. The first stage of a redesigned website, focusing on Child Support, was released in September 2018 to provide customers with an opportunity to provide feedback. These changes will help customers find what they’re looking for faster, help them to understand their In confidence Page 7 obligations and entitlements and make it easier for them to do what they need to do. Inland Revenue has begun the transition to an intelligent workplace. This includes the phased rollout of an enterprise content management solution, an advanced analytics platform and capabilities, new tools such Skype for Business and Microsoft Office 365, and a new enterprise support services (ESS) platform. Inland Revenue approached the government of New South Wales to license their business process model for ESS for use across the public sector in New Zealand. Inland Revenue is adapting the model for New Zealand. The model covers processes such as human resources, finance and procurement. Having consistent processes across agencies will enable efficiencies as people will not have to learn new processes when they move between agencies. As part of Inland Revenue’s ESS solution, e-invoicing will be introduced. E-invoicing will enable suppliers to submit their invoices digitally to Inland Revenue. The invoice will be processed and paid, provided it meets the required procurement checks. Inland Revenue expects to be able to process, and potentially pay, invoices more quickly. A pilot for e-invoicing is expected in mid-2019. Fitting revenue processes seamlessly into people’s lives A key part of transformation is integrating processes into people’s lives and businesses’ natural systems. This requires Inland Revenue to work with and through others to deliver the high-quality services New Zealanders expect. As a first step towards greater integration, Inland Revenue worked with software providers to enable customers to file GST through their accounting software. This demonstrated that there is customer demand for these types of services and laid the foundation for future improvements. There is a strong appetite within the software developer community to work jointly with Inland Revenue to deliver customer outcomes – early engagement and involvement in solution design are key. AIM is further evidence (see page 21) of this approach. Creating an organisation that works together better to improve outcomes for customers Inland Revenue is creating a workforce with the right knowledge and capabilities to meet the needs of customers both now and in the future. Those designing customer services will be as close to the customer as possible and people working with customers will be empowered to make more decisions and resolve customers’ issues more quickly. Five key shifts underpin the new organisation design: A new organisation design will enable people at Inland Revenue to apply their skills more broadly to a range of work, work together more closely, provide better services to customers, and make the most of a new and evolving working environment, supported by technology. Customer-facing areas have changed first Three new groups were established in February 2018: • Customer and Compliance Services – Individuals • Customer and Compliance Services – Businesses • Information and Intelligence Services. Changes have been made to Inland Revenue’s working environment to support the new organisation design: • A new decision making model and broader delegations has been introduced. • Workflows have been configured to new roles so that people get work relevant to their customer segment, skills and abilities. • Performance, recognition and pay approaches have been redesigned. New delegations, combined with broader roles, means that customers will have their queries responded to more quickly and will be able to talk to one person to get more of their queries resolved. In confidence Page 8 Implementing a modern technology platform (START 1 ) Transformation has moved to a model of a series of releases within stages to reduce risk and business and customer impacts, as shown below. Major releases will typically occur on an annual cycle in each of the next four years, to align with the beginning of the tax year. 1 START stands for simplified tax and revenue technology and is the name chosen by Inland Revenue for the GenTax software provided by FAST Enterprises LLC In confidence Page 9 Release 1 (Stage 1) – February 2017 GST was migrated to new systems and processes in February 2017. In addition, some elements of foundational technology were replaced, including new data centres and the workflow management system for contact centres. This release improved experiences for customers, reduced compliance costs for small–medium sized businesses, and delivered administrative savings for Inland Revenue. • More customers are filing their returns electronically – 86% as at June 2018, an increase of 7% compared to the previous year and an increase of 13% compared to two years ago. • The number of customers filing their GST through their software is steadily increasing – more than 87,000 as at June 2018 from a pilot of 500 customers in December 2016. • Customers are spending 10 fewer hours a year meeting their GST obligations. • Inland Revenue has exceeded the administrative savings target for the first release. Release 2 (Stage 2) – April 2018 Release 2 went live on 17 April 2018 and further improved customer experiences and reduced the effort required by businesses to meet their obligations: • Employers can send their information to Inland Revenue digitally and on payday if they choose to do so. • It is easier for customers to meet their obligations for withholding taxes, fringe benefit tax, payroll subsidy, and gaming machine duty by using new online services. • Income information is now collected in START enabling pre-population of individuals’ information to begin - this information will be available at the end of the 2018/19 year. As at 30 June 2018, more than 30,000 withholding returns had been filed using new systems and processes and approximately 3,000 payday returns had been filed by just over 500 customers. Release 3 (Stage 2) – April 2019 The scope of Release 3 is: • Completing the migration of income tax and migrating Working for Families to new systems and processes. • Implementing and operating a data and intelligence platform. • Revamping digital channels and services. • Implementing new tool sets and equipment to support Inland Revenue’s new ways of working, including networked teams and more remote working. • Implementing a new software-as-a-service platform for Inland Revenue’s enterprise support services. Once Release 3 has been delivered, all taxes will be administered in START. From this point, government will have significantly improved agility for tax products. Customers will have: • on-line services for all tax products - for example customers will be able to file returns, set up payment plans and include attachments on-line • integrated tax and business processes • faster, more accurate tax information, providing near real-time visibility of tax • faster tax refunds • less likelihood of tax debt and more payment options. A new year-end process for individuals (subject to legislation) will mean all refunds and tax to pay of more than $20 will be automatically issued. Releases 4 and 5 (Stages 3 and 4) Release 4 in April 2020 will enable end-to-end processing of employer information, KiwiSaver and Student Loans in START. Digital services will further improve, enabling customers to do more and more for themselves and interactions and interventions will be better targeted to customers’ needs. Inland Revenue’s corporate functions will also be transformed. Release 5 in April 2021 will enable end-to-end processing of Child Support in START, and complete delivery of any remaining products. Heritage systems and any supporting infrastructure that has been built to support co-existence will be decommissioned. In confidence Page 10 THE COMMERCIAL CASE Sourcing the services and products required for delivery This section outlines the suppliers Inland Revenue is working with to implement the future revenue system. A number of long-term commercial arrangements have been entered into In confidence Page 11 The major procurement activity required to successfully implement transformation has largely been completed. All procurement is consistent with the principles of the Government Rules of Sourcing. Key suppliers Since the Detailed Business Case was completed in November 2015, Inland Revenue has completed contract negotiations with a number of suppliers of products and services. These include: • Accenture for design services. • FAST Enterprises LLC (FAST) for software and implementation services. • Revera, a subsidiary of Spark, for all-of-Government (AoG) data centres • Vodafone for network connectivity to move us to the AoG common capability (Telecommunications-as-a- Service). • Unisys for on-going support for FIRST. • Deloitte for identity and access management services. • Assurity for testing services. • Team Asparona for an enterprise content management solution. • SAS to provide a new data and intelligence platform. Negotiations with Sitecore and AKQA for a web-content management system are ongoing. 2 A company is considered resident if it is incorporated in New Zealand; or if control by company directors is exercised in New Zealand, or if it has its centre of Licence negotiations are continuing with Oracle, the preferred technology provider for enterprise support services. Representatives of the Government Chief Digital Officer and Treasury attended vendor presentations during the procurement process. All-of-government capabilities Inland Revenue continues to consume common capabilities and ICT capabilities where they exist, meet the department’s business needs and are cost-effective. Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Software Framework Agreements, Telecommunications-as-a-Service (TaaS), and the Cloud Framework Agreement for Amazon web services are being used by Inland Revenue. A supplier of workplace equipment (laptops) was selected from the all-of-government hardware panel. New Zealand businesses Inland Revenue seeks a wide range of providers for transformation and will continue to do so. Opportunities are actively promoted to the market place, including New Zealand businesses – for example, advertising on GETS and communications with vendors. Vendors are not chosen based on where they come from. The Government Rules of Sourcing are very clear that this is not allowed. management in New Zealand, or if it has its head office in New Zealand To increase transparency, each year Inland Revenue publishes a list of the New Zealand tax resident suppliers 2 it has spent over $500,000 with. From 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2018, $384m has been spent on companies and individual contractors providing services to transformation, of which $282m (74%) has been spent on New Zealand tax resident businesses. Both delivery partners, FAST and Accenture, have recruited New Zealand staff. FAST has employed 23 New Zealanders as START developers out of 65 total employees in New Zealand. Accenture have employed in excess of 40. In confidence Page 12 THE MANAGEMENT CASE Ensuring successful delivery This section describes the governance and management arrangements for implementation, outlines the change impacts and change management approach for releases, and describes how benefits are being managed and tracked for the programme. Transformation continues to be well managed and governed In confidence Page 13 Since the Detailed Business Case (November 2015) was prepared, Inland Revenue has: • updated programme governance and management arrangements • adopted programme methodologies and frameworks • completed a number of independent assurance reviews, and • regularly reviewed and updated risks. Programme governance and management arrangements The programme governance structure as at June 2018 is shown below. The changes made since November 2015 are: • In July 2017, Inland Revenue reviewed its governance arrangements ahead of the implementation of Release 2. Governance arrangements now consist of a Strategic Governance Board with five committees– Performance and Investment; Customer- centric; Organisation Development; Technical Governance and Portfolio Governance. Transformation provides regular updates to both the Portfolio Governance Committee (PGC) and Performance and Investment Committee (PIC). • The replacement of the Design Integration Forum with the Design Authority, and the Technical Design Integration Forum with the Technical Design Authority. • The discontinuation of the Business Owners Forums (BOF), with the exception of the data BOF which has been replaced by the Data Owners Forum. • The establishment of the BT Release Management Meeting. The high-level organisational structure for transformation as at June 2018 is shown below. The changes made since November 2015 are: • Some roles have been renamed – Customer Experience Alignment to Director, Digital Change; Organisational Change & Training to Organisational Change Management & Training; Technical & Architecture to Enterprise Architecture Transformation Lead. • Some new roles have been established – Director, New Service Platform, the Release Management roles, and Programme Manager, Intelligence-led. • Some reporting lines have changed – the Senior Business Transformation Lead now reports to the Enterprise Architecture Transformation Lead; the Business Case and Policy leads now report to the Principal Transformation Director; Co-existence, Foundational, and Business Deployment now form part of the release teams. The enterprise support services work now forms part of the responsibility of the Programme Manager, Technical Architecture Delivery. • The two Commercial Director roles have been combined and the Head of Commercial & Procurement now reports to the Deputy Commissioner, Corporate Integrity & Assurance. In confidence Page 14 Programme methodologies and approaches Changes since November 2015 are: • Business transformation methodologies have been refined following the appointment of Accenture as Inland Revenue’s design partner and FAST Enterprises LLC as Inland Revenue’s implementation partner. • A two-speed delivery approach has been adopted to provide appropriate models for different types of releases. • Approaches in key delivery areas have been developed to ensure consistency, including management of data, testing, and assessing readiness for change. • Change management processes are in place. Programme controls remain unchanged. Business Transformation Methodology (BTM) Inland Revenue’s business transformation methodology is complemented by FAST’s implementation methodology and Accenture Delivery Methods (ADM). FAST’s methodology will apply to deliverables FAST lead and manage. FAST’s nine step process is shown below. Accenture Delivery Methods (ADM) defines the project work that needs to be done and how it can best be accomplished. Included within ADM are methods, estimators, tools, architectures and procedures. ADM covers four major areas: • Management Methods - drive discipline and broad- based oversight to ensure identified value is delivered. • Outsourcing Methods - deliver on-going services across application management, technology infrastructure and business processes. • Planning Methods - identify value creation opportunities, formulate business strategies and plan solutions. • Development Methods - design and build solutions and all of their elements including business processes, systems and organizations. A more agile approach has also been developed to deliver initiatives more quickly. Delivery model Transformation has adopted a multi-method delivery approach and is implementing change through two delivery lanes - orange and blue: • The orange lane represents rapid, continuous change releases. • The blue lane represents major START releases. Inland Revenue has developed an enterprise release plan, covering all changes across the organisation including transformation releases. As two releases have already been successfully implemented, future enhancements to these systems and processes will be managed as a business-as-usual change rather than a transformational change. The diagram below shows which changes are being delivered by transformation and which by the wider business. Data cleansing, conversion and migration approach Data conversion provides a base set of historic data in START to support business needs. The key steps are: • Identify and create an inventory of all possible heritage data sources, including information such as registration or financial information, the technology and platforms used for data storage, and people with expertise on specific data. • Determine the integrity and quality of data. • Convert the data from FIRST to START – extract, load, reconcile, test and purify. • Complete user verification - knowledgeable users view converted data in START and compare it to how it is used and appears in heritage applications. Any problems with converted data are logged and managed. • Run mock conversions to verify that data is being converted correctly by performing the same steps that will occur during the live conversion. In confidence Page 15 Testing approach Inland Revenue’s approach to testing the changes being implemented by transformation is outlined in the Test Strategy and Plan. Testing of new systems and processes includes a number of phases: • Unit/verification testing ensures that individual components and modules within each system perform as they should. • Assembly testing ensures that the integration layer, which links core and satellite systems, works as it should and that data flows across it as it should. • Business system testing involves Inland Revenue staff testing the functionality within START and how START interacts with other systems. This phase includes integration testing. • Technical interface testing ensures that connections between applications are established and working. • Scaled business simulation testing practices the go- live step by step including the migration of data, and processes following go-live such as return filing. • Partnership testing covers testing with external parties. • User acceptance testing confirms that systems and processes will fulfil the business requirements. • Final regression testing ensures that previously developed and tested software still performs the same way after it is changed or interfaced with other software. • Functional security testing ensures that only authorised users have access to features of a system. • Infrastructure testing tests the setup of or changes to any hardware, network or software. • Performance testing verifies that requirements such as response times and transaction rates have been achieved. • Security testing verifies that solutions conform to minimum security standards. • Disaster recovery testing confirms that the disaster recovery plan can be executed. • Operational readiness testing validates deployment and operational tasks, including database backup, database recovery, software installation and configuration. In addition to these formal test phases, other checks are completed: • Verifying data conversion. • Customer user experience validation involves customers trying out and providing feedback on new services. • Technical cutover testing tests the full deployment in a technical sense. Rollback is tested as part of this phase to confirm that Inland Revenue could revert to the pre-implementation state if required. The Test Strategy and Plan is reviewed following each major release. Readiness framework Inland Revenue has developed a comprehensive and robust business readiness framework for determining readiness for go-live. The framework uses checkpoints to regularly assess the readiness of customers, business partners and Inland Revenue itself for changes in the lead up to go-live. Readiness is assessed across four major areas: • Customer readiness – are customers ready to use the service changes? • Service providers – are service providers ready to use and support the service changes? • Inland Revenue’s readiness – is the business ready to receive and deliver the service changes? • Programme readiness: o Does the solution meet the required levels of quality? o Can cutover be achieved within the agreed timeframe and at an acceptable level? o Can the changes be supported once implemented? At a more detailed level, there are also assessments of the readiness of data, processes, infrastructure, applications, policy, quality assurance, support and deployment. There are six readiness checkpoints. Each checkpoint has a defined purpose and pre-defined conditions that must be met to provide confidence that the preparations for go-live are on track. The checkpoints will confirm that “Inland Revenue is where it expects to be” at key points. Based on the results of the checkpoints, decisions may be taken to implement contingency options or, in the worst case scenario, to delay go-live. There are clear accountabilities for making the decision to go-live. A go-live committee is chaired by the Senior Responsible Owner (SRO), and membership consists of four deputy commissioners. Its role is to recommend to In confidence Page 16 the Commissioner the deployment of changes into production or to recommend roll-back if cutover criteria have not been met. Change management Effective change management is essential to ensure that new services and capabilities are adopted by customers and Inland Revenue people. A customer impact assessment and change management approach is developed and implemented for each release. As the level of change has been increasing with each new release, Inland Revenue’s focus on engagement and communication activities is expanding. Customer readiness has an “inside/out” focus (i.e. did Inland Revenue deliver the planned activities?) and “outside/in” (i.e. based on engagement and customer feedback/surveys are the impacted customers aware of and ready for the change?). Regular checkpoint monitoring before go-live allows Inland Revenue to target areas where more information is required. Readying Inland Revenue people for change includes: • Organisation impact assessments are used to guide the scale and intensity of change management required for particular areas of the business. • A change management plan identifies the change activities needed, including training (on-line, classroom and on the job learning), communications, and user support post-go-live. 3 Scope, risk, issues, inter-dependency, schedule, resource, stakeholder engagement, delivery partners, financials and benefits • Detailed training, communications and user support plans. This ensures: • a consistent process for people, regardless of the nature of the change; • scalable and repeatable change processes; and • greater efficiency and transparency for impacted people. Inland Revenue proactively engages with the Public Service Association (PSA) and TaxPro to ensure they understand and support the change management approach and processes. Note that change management in this context is distinct from the management of change processes as set out in Inland Revenue’s employment agreements. Progress tracking Delivery progress is evaluated through: • Independent quality assurance and Gateway reviews. • Oversight by the SRO and governance groups. • Management and oversight from the DC Transformation and members of the programme leadership team (PLT). • Monthly red amber green (RAG) status reporting against the 10 keys. 3 Programme assurance A programme of regular assurance reviews provides confidence that transformation continues to be well managed and governed. Since the Detailed Business Case in November 2015, a number of independent assurance reviews have taken place. KPMG have undertaken five reviews: • IQA4/TQA3 – March 2016 • IQA5/TQA4 – December 2016 • IQA6/TQA5 – August 2017 • IQA7/TQA6 – May 2018. • IQA8/TQA7 – October 2018. Four Gateway reviews have been undertaken: • Gateway 3 (investment decision) - February 2016 • Gateway 0 – July 2017 • Gateway 0 (strategic assessment)/4 (readiness for service) – March 2018. • Gateway 0/4 – October 2018. In general, the reviews have all been positive and indicated that transformation is on a firm footing and is being is well managed and governed. Benefits management Achievement of the investment objectives is measured against a number of lead and lag indicators and through a series of case studies as shown on the next two pages.

Risk management Identification and management of risks remains a strength of the programme. As at June 2018, there were 56 risks for transformation managed by the programme leadership team, of which the most significant (14 as at June 2018) are reported each month to the Portfolio Governance Committee. The top risks were in the following areas: • Maintaining momentum – ensuring that critical resources are retained, workloads are managed, and that milestones continue to be met as FIRST is unsupported from June 2021. • Co-existence – Inland Revenue is now running two production systems and more products and services are now split across FIRST and START. • External decision-making – the risk that changes in priorities result in extended timescales or that external decision making takes longer than planned. In confidence Page 20 Part B Additions to the scope of transformation Cabinet has agreed some additions to scope In confidence Page 21 Following decisions made by Cabinet, there have been additions to the scope of transformation since the Detailed Business Case was prepared in November 2015: • The accounting income method (AIM) option for provisional tax. • The automatic exchange of information (AEOI) with international tax treaty partners. • Best Start. These additions to scope are evidence of improved agility given the speed with which they were implemented. The Research & Development Tax Incentive and findings of working groups are emerging areas of work which are likely to have implications for the scope of transformation. AIM On 14 March 2016, Cabinet approved the implementation of a business tax package (CAB-16-MIN-0089 refers) including AIM. AIM is a significant initiative aimed at further reducing customers’ compliance costs by providing a “pay-as-you-go” option for provisional tax for businesses with turnover of less than $5 million. AIM was implemented as part of Release 2 in April 2018, enabling small businesses to better match their provisional tax payments to when they earn their income. As at 30 June 2018, more than 1,100 customers were using AIM. The benefits of AIM Until AIM, businesses paid provisional tax at set times of the year, regardless of when they earned their income. This was in part why some businesses consistently rated provisional tax as the most stressful part of running their business. AIM removes a lot of this stress by enabling small businesses to pay their provisional tax as they earn income, and by fitting provisional tax into the business processes they already have in place. All businesses using AIM have to do is enter their accounting information into their software and their provisional tax payment will be calculated for them. AIM means businesses can: • Pay smaller amounts of provisional tax more often. • Get refunds of overpaid provisional tax during the year. • Avoid paying interest or penalties provided they pay what their software tells them to, on time. • Have their provisional tax calculations done for them by their software. • Have their information sent to Inland Revenue by their software – no extra step required. Who AIM will suit AIM will suit different types of small businesses. New businesses, growing businesses, businesses that are really busy at some times of the year and not at others, businesses that already use accounting software, and businesses that find it hard to forecast their income accurately could all benefit from using AIM. Success in terms of customer uptake and software innovation will take time to eventuate. AIM represents a significant shift and some businesses and their advisors will likely adopt a ‘wait and see’ approach. Implementation approach AIM is a good example of how Inland Revenue is working with others to design and deliver services. To develop the policy, legislation and software to support AIM, Inland Revenue worked with a wide range of parties. Unlike other tax products, AIM is offered by software providers rather than Inland Revenue. Software developers deliver the solution and are closer to the customer base. A key part of Inland Revenue’s approach was to involve software providers early and create an environment that allowed them to actively contribute to and challenge the solution design. In mid-2016, Inland Revenue hosted the first collaboration workshop to design how AIM would work within software. The workshop brought together a range of key parties interested in offering AIM including software developers, accountants with small businesses as clients, and Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand (CA ANZ). Workshops were held regularly during the development of AIM to collaborate on the design, implementation and communication of AIM. These workshops were very successful and a key part of building support for AIM. In confidence Page 22 Regular engagement resulted in building a common understanding of what was required for success. In addition, Inland Revenue built a community of practitioners from across industry and government to quickly test ideas. Involving end users and their representatives early helped to ensure that decisions were based on customer needs and on delivering the best possible customer experiences. Funding Implementation costs for AIM were included within the overall funding approved for transformation. AEOI On 25 April 2016, Cabinet approved the business case for AEOI (CAB-16-MIN-0189.25 refers). Through the implementation of AEOI, New Zealand is playing its part in helping to combat global tax avoidance. New Zealand is one of many jurisdictions that has committed to a global initiative led by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) on the automatic exchange of financial account information using the Common Reporting Standard (CRS). The benefits of AEOI Globalisation has made it easier for people to invest money outside their tax residence jurisdiction. This has provided opportunities for offshore tax evasion. Financial account information is required by law to be collected by financial institutions around the world for reporting to tax authorities. Tax authorities will exchange this information to ensure everyone pays the right amount of tax. Who AEOI applies to Foreign tax residents who currently have an account with a New Zealand financial institution may have their financial account information reported to Inland Revenue. This information may then be shared with a person’s home country or jurisdiction, if New Zealand has an AEOI exchange relationship with them. Information about New Zealand tax residents with financial accounts in any of the jurisdictions participating in the AEOI may be shared with Inland Revenue. Implementation approach In April 2016 Inland Revenue’s Investment Board agreed that AEOI would be implemented in START to ensure one implementation for AEOI, and to align technology delivery and change management with the wider changes being made by transformation. This minimised change impacts for both customers and staff. The Board agreed that START was a good fit for delivering the technology capability required as: • START had the functionality required already built in: START was configured to support the capability required and did not require any customisation. • Information about customers’ incomes, whether earned in New Zealand or overseas, would be held in one place. • Inland Revenue would be able to more effectively match data received through AEOI with information already held about customers. • START was scalable for Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). Now that the functionality has been built in START, it is also being used to securely exchange Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) disclosures with the United States. This has enabled Inland Revenue to decommission the stand-alone systems and processes that previously supported FATCA disclosures. Funding Additional funding of $32.2 million was provided to Inland Revenue as part of Budget 2016 to implement AEOI. This funding was separate to the funding approved for transformation. In September 2016, Inland Revenue sought approval from the Ministers of Finance and Revenue to drawdown $21.5 million of this amount. The decision to implement AEOI in START provided technology solution certainty and enabled costs to be revised. Best Start On 17 November 2017, Cabinet approved the implementation of Best Start as part of the Families Package (CAB-17-MIN-0516 refers). Best Start is part of Working for Families Best Start payments are $60 per week per child (up to $3,120 a year) for babies born on or after 1 July 2018. In confidence Page 23 Families can choose to receive the payment every week, every fortnight or once a year, in line with other Working for Families payments. All eligible families will receive $60 a week until their baby turns one, no matter what their household income is. If their household income is less than $79,000 a year before tax, then they will continue to receive $60 a week until their child turns three. After their child’s first birthday, families earning between $79,000 and $93,858 a year before tax will continue receiving a reduced payment until their child turns three. Families earning over $93,858 a year before tax are not entitled to Best Start after their child turns one. Best Start payments replaced the Parental Tax Credit from 1 July 2018. Implementation approach Families apply for Best Start through SmartStart: • SmartStart is a cross-government online initiative providing step-by-step information and support to help families access the right services for them and their baby. • Parent can access SmartStart though any device and register the birth of their child, apply for an IRD number for their baby, and apply for Best Start. • It’s an easy and quick digital service that saves parents from having to fill out three different forms for two different departments. Best Start was delivered by Inland Revenue in its existing heritage systems, so that payments could start as quickly as possible. As it is a component of Working for Families, Best Start will be migrated to START as part of Release 3 in April 2019. Funding Additional funding of $6.43 million was approved by Cabinet on 27 November 2017 to implement the Families Package in heritage systems. The costs for migrating Best Start to new systems and processes as part of Release 3 form part of the overall funding approved for transformation. Research and development tax incentive In February 2018, Cabinet agreed to implement a research and development (R&D) tax incentive by 1 April 2019 (CAB-18-MIN-0056 refers). The tax incentive will apply from the 31 March 2020 income tax year. Cabinet has also agreed that by April 2020 there will be some form of support for businesses in tax loss, and that the R&D tax incentive will replace the Growth Grants provided by Callaghan Innovation over time (CAB-18-MIN- 0051 refers). Inland Revenue, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, and Callaghan Innovation expect to seek decisions on the final design of the policy from Cabinet in September 2018. The benefits of the incentive The Government has announced a target to increase New Zealand’s R&D expenditure to 2% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) over 10 years, from the current level of 1.26%. Business expenditure on R&D (BERD) is recognised as a key indicator of business innovation. This is critical for New Zealand because it supports economic diversification, raises productivity, creates high-value jobs, and improves social and environmental well-being. It is common for governments to support BERD as without it businesses tend to invest less in R&D than is optimal. Who the incentive will apply to The intent is for all businesses to be eligible for the R&D tax incentive, provided they meet the eligibility criteria. Implementation approach Inland Revenue will be the administering agency of the R&D tax incentive, supported by Callaghan Innovation. Businesses will be able to register through myIR and claim the tax incentive at the end of the tax year, i.e. 31 March 2020. Inland Revenue is currently working through how the R&D tax incentive will be implemented. Funding Additional funding of $4.3 million over 4 years was provided as part of Budget 2018 for one-off implementation costs for the R&D tax incentive. In confidence Page 24 Legislation Legislation was introduced to Parliament in October 2018. Emerging work A number of reviews, including the Tax Working Group, Welfare Expert Advisory Group, Holidays Act Working Group, Review of Paid Parental Leave, and Pay Transparency, have the potential to result in further change for Inland Revenue, employers, businesses, intermediaries, and families. The currently known dates are: • September 2018 – interim report from the Tax Working Group. • February 2019 – final advice from the Welfare Expert Advisory Group. • May 2019 – Holidays Act Working Group due to report back with recommendations. Until firm recommendations from working groups are available, it is difficult to assess the impact on Inland Revenue’s capacity of any additional work. There is no doubt that transformation presents considerable opportunities. When considering how to maximise these, the challenge will be how to do so without further increasing what is already an inherently high-risk undertaking, while balancing the volume and pace of change for a range of stakeholders.
Page 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Part A Updates to the Programme Business Case This section summarises material changes since the last addendum to the Programme Business Case was prepared in October 2019. The most significant update is to the economic case. The commercial and management cases have also been updated. No changes have been made to either the strategic or financial cases. Executive Summary Page 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] The advent of COVID-19 has had a significant impact on people and economies everywhere. Inland Revenue’s response to the challenges presented by the pandemic and the need to act swiftly to support New Zealanders have provided a very visible demonstration of the benefits of transformation. Inland Revenue has played a key role in supporting the Government’s response to COVID-19, while continuing to deliver services, provide support to customers, and implement further changes as part of transformation. The agility delivered by transformation was a significant enabler of the Government’s response to COVID-19. Decision-makers have significantly more agility than previously to make changes to policy and legislative settings. A focus on keeping solutions as simple as possible for both customers and Inland Revenue means that previous system constraints are no longer an issue. This is a huge change as the answer to “can the system do this and do it at a reasonable price” is now almost always yes rather than no for initiatives that are a good fit with Inland Revenue’s core capabilities. However, other constraints, such as the need to ensure that both customers and Inland Revenue itself are ready for changes, are now more evident. The flexible and iterative nature of START 1 means that new products or services that adopt out-of-the-box processes and use established patterns can be implemented much more quickly than previously. This 1 START stands for simplified tax and revenue technology and is the name chosen by Inland Revenue for the GenTax software provided by FAST Enterprises LLC approach combined with a focus on minimising exceptions and working with other agencies was very evident during the initial response to COVID-19. These ways of working will be even more important as the country recovers. Inland Revenue has supported the Ministry of Social Development to administer the Wage Subsidy. Initially this was through sharing information and providing a verification service for applications where this was needed. More recently, Inland Revenue has made a portal available to Ministry staff to enable them to self-serve the majority of queries. Providing Ministry staff with access to the relevant information held in START took just 15 working days from when the portal was approved by Inland Revenue’s governance forums until it was up and running. Business tax changes have been implemented to free up cashflow, including a provisional tax threshold lift, the reinstatement of building depreciation and writing off interest on the late payment of tax. In addition, the small business cashflow (loan) scheme and loss carry-back scheme have been introduced. Both schemes have proven to be successful, with 104,000 applications for the loan scheme and $1.6 billion in loans approved and $105 million in funds re leased to 2,500 customers through loss carry-back as at 9 October 2020. The small business cashflow (loan) scheme provides a very good demonstration of Inland Revenue’s agility. It was 39 working days from the initial decision to begin some preparatory work until the launch of the scheme. It took just 10 days from when the Government confirmed its intentions until the scheme was launched. These timeframes were unthinkable as recently as a couple of years ago. However, these results were not achieved without cost. Work had to be re-prioritised and resources re-directed to enable people to focus on the higher priority COVID-19 response work. The continued delivery of services to customers was made possible by transformation. Inland Revenue quickly shifted the majority of its people to working remotely once the impacts of COVID-19 became clear. This was enabled by the investment made in workplace technology as part of transformation. As a result, Inland Revenue was able to continue to support customers and ensure they pay and receive the right amounts. The second year of automatically issued income tax assessments was largely completed during this period, with 3.1 million assessments issued and $ 688 million in refunds paid as at 30 June 2020. For the first time, Inland Revenue implemented changes remotely and Release 4 successfully went live. On 16 April 2020, KiwiSaver and student loans and the back-end processing of PAYE moved to new systems and processes. Page 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] A remote go-live was made possible by the investment in tools and technology in recent years which enabled people to work remotely, and by the well-practiced processes developed for previous releases. The cutover team were very well prepared and very clear about what was required of them, having practiced the execution of every required task multiple times. Going live in the early days of the COVID-19 Alert Level 4 lock down was not an easy call to make, and it was the right one. Not going live would have delayed making new services available to customers which make it easier for them to get the help they need and would have made it more difficult for Inland Revenue to support the Government’s response. Customers now have access to a wider range of services and more information and options. For example, all customers experiencing financial difficulties can apply for relief through a simple, new myIR service. The benefits for customers of the changes made in Release 4 are evident. A key consideration throughout transformation has been reducing effort for customers. Employers, particularly those using gateway services, are finding filing easier, with 89% saying they find it quite or very easy. All employers’ information is now held in one place. The vast majority of individual customers say they like the automatic income tax assessment process as it is straightforward and minimises the actions required from them. Changes were made when the process ran for the second time in 2020 to further improve customer experiences. As a result, Inland Revenue received fewer calls and complaints. Over 80% of student loan customers are finding it easy to understand and do what they needed to do in myIR. KiwiSaver customers are finding myIR easy to use. Processing times are now much faster providing customers with certainty sooner. Around three quarters of members’ KiwiSaver contributions are now processed in a few days, compared to the 20 to 23 days this used to take. Closing a student loan is now an overnight process that previously took up to 42 days. The final stage of the transformation programme has been re-planned as a result of the impacts of COVID-19. The end of the transformation programme is now in sight. Moving the remaining products to new systems and processes will now happen in two releases during 2021, rather than in a single big release as previously planned. Paid parental leave, duties and foreign trusts will move on 1 March 2021, with Child Support and an upgrade to Inland Revenue’s online services likely to follow in October 2021. Transformation will be completed in 2021/22 and is on track to complete within the funding envelope approved by government in 2015. The final stage includes work to complete decommissioning of heritage infrastructure and transition the processes, frameworks and methods the transformation programme has built to Inland Revenue’s future operating model. This will help to ensure the benefits of transformation are enduring. Realisation of benefits is well advanced. The non-financial benefits of policy agility, system resilience and making things easier for customers have been very evident in Inland Revenue’s response to COVID- 19. Overall trends in financial benefits are positive with administrative savings increasing year-on-year. The result for compliance effort reduction for small to medium sized businesses is indicative only this year, as the planned 2020 survey was not run due to COVID-19. The 2018 results have been used in the absence of any new information. There are still challenges ahead. Although risk has reduced somewhat, significant risks remain. Operational risk will remain elevated until Inland Revenue completes transformation and fully migrates off heritage systems and processes. Child Support implementations are notoriously complex and difficult. While Inland Revenue is simplifying requirements as much as possible, this remains a very complex product. In addition, despite Inland Revenue’s best efforts at readying customers for change, there are likely to be difficulties as Child Support customers have complex circumstances and can be hard to reach. Completing transformation will need to be balanced against any future COVID-19-related work and trade-offs may be required. Page 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] THE ECONOMIC CASE Delivering the preferred way forward This section provides an update on progress in delivering transformation and realising the agreed benefits and outcomes. The preferred way forward and programme roadmap are unchanged. The implementation plan has been updated as a result of the impacts of COVID- 19. Modernisation of the revenue system is nearing completion Page 7 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Transformation continues to be implemented as planned: • The final policy changes to be implemented as part of transformation were being considered by select committee prior to the General Election. The proposed changes aim to simplify the administration of Child Support as part of Stage 4 in late 2021. • New analytical capabilities are shaping how Inland Revenue supports customers to pay and receive the right amounts and comply with their obligations. • Changes to Inland Revenue’s enterprise support services, capabilities and organisation design continue. • Release 4 was successfully implemented on 16 April 2020, completing Stage 3 and moving KiwiSaver, student loans and the back-end processing of PAYE, to START. The external environment has changed significantly since the last addendum to the programme business case was completed in October 2019. The advent of the COVID-19 global pandemic has required all organisations and individuals to adapt. Inland Revenue’s response to COVID-19 amply demonstrates the benefits of the investment made in transformation. • Inland Revenue was able to quickly shift the majority of its people to a remote working model once the impacts of COVID-19 became clear, as a result of the investment made in workplace technology as part of transformation. • Go-live of Release 4 was completed remotely. This was made possible by the investment in tools and technology in recent years which enabled people to work remotely, and by the well-practiced release management and change management processes developed for previous releases. The cutover team was very well prepared and very clear about what was required of them, having practiced the execution of every required task multiple times. • Inland Revenue has played a significant role in delivering the Government’s response to COVID-19. The department has supported the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) to administer the Wage Subsidy. Business tax changes to free up cashflow, including a provisional tax threshold lift, the reinstatement of building depreciation and writing off interest on the late payment of tax have been implemented. A very successful small business cashflow (loan) scheme and a loss carry-back scheme have been introduced. The small business cashflow loan scheme demonstrates the agility now available. The scheme successfully went live at 12.01am on 12 May 2020. It was 39 working days from the initial decision on 13 March 2020 to begin some preparatory work until the launch of the scheme. It took just 10 days from when the Government confirmed its intentions on 25 April 2020 until the scheme was launched. During the first 5 to 10 minutes Inland Revenue had received 43 applications, with 600 received by 1:20am. As at 9 October 2020, Inland Revenue had received 104,000 applications and approved $1.6 billion in loans. The vast majority of applications have been online, with less than 300 not made through myIR. Delivering the future revenue system Delivering the future revenue system has required changes to policy, data, processes, people, and technology. The majority of these changes have already been made, with one final stage to go.  Simplifying policy and legislative settings A review of policy and legislative settings to support, enable, and optimise the benefits from business transformation is in its final stages. A Bill containing the final transformation policy changes to improve the administration of Child Support has had its first reading and was being considered by select committee before the General Election. A Supplementary Order Paper (SOP) to this Bill proposes to repeal child support incremental penalties and simplify the penalty write-off provisions. Another SOP to the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020-21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill proposes changes to the Unclaimed Monies Act. Some changes implemented in earlier releases continue to be embedded. From 1 April 2020, payers of investment income have been required to provide more detailed recipient information more frequently to Inland Revenue. Companies and Māori Authorities have been required to Page 21 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] where they need help to get it right. These capabilities are also making it harder for people to deliberately avoid their obligations or to claim things they are not entitled to. For example, potentially fraudulent or incorrect refunds are identified and stopped during processing. This is helping to prevent revenue loss which increases the assessed revenue available to government. How progress is measured/monitored The agreed basis for monitoring progress is proxy measures and case studies given the difficulty of direct attribution. Two case studies have been completed to date. The percentage of returns filed on time and filed electronically increased significantly for 2019/20 to 93% and 96% respectively. Both measures have increased by 7% over the last year as shown in the graph below. Benefit area 6: Inland Revenue is more efficient Target state By 2023/24, Inland Revenue will deliver cumulative administrative savings of $495 million. All things being equal, Inland Revenue will be 25-30% smaller than it was at the start of transformation, with reductions across all business groups. Progress to date – 2019/2020 results On a cumulative basis, Inland Revenue is ahead of target with savings of $118 million compared to the target of $95 million. The 2019/20 target of $80 million was not achieved, with Inland Revenue achieving $57 million in savings. Planned organisational changes were deferred due to Release 4 and COVID-19. Changes were put on hold to enable Inland Revenue’s people to focus fully on supporting customers and the Government’s response to the pandemic. Changes to Inland Revenue’s organisation design will now take place later than the timeframes originally envisaged. In addition, there was always expected to be some inter- year variability in administrative savings as new systems and processes bed in. This has been evident in the results achieved to date. Inland Revenue achieved more savings than expected in both the 2017/18 and 2018/19 years, meaning that cumulative savings are ahead of target. Overall the trend is positive with annual savings increasing year on year. How progress is measured/monitored Digital uptake is a lead indicator for the achievement of administrative savings, as this indicates that work effort is reducing. Digital uptake is well ahead of where Inland Revenue expected it to be. As at 30 June 2020, digital uptake was at 96%, an increase of 7% since 30 June 2019 and well above the target of 72%. The benefits of a digital revenue system are becoming increasingly evident. Inland Revenue is already seeing the nature of its work changing. For example, the volume of manual work for Working for Families has reduced considerably compared to last year. The number of manual calculations required as part of the 2020 automatic income tax assessment process was around half what it was last year. This was also true of rollover ( when customers’ entitlements for the following year are estimated and communicated to them) which happens in February each year. Employer errors are starting to disappear which is having a considerable impact on work effort. The 120,000 line items in error on employer schedules previously is now down to around 14,000. This is the result of a deliberate focus on designing out errors when products and services are moved to new systems and processes. For student loans, improved border management query processes have resulted in a huge reduction in the number of cases requiring manual intervention. Prior to Release 4, around 2,000 to 3,000 cases a month required Page 22 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] one of Inland Revenue’s staff to look at them. In May 2020, just 17 cases required manual intervention. Analytical capabilities are enabling Inland Revenue to work more efficiently and deliver very cost-effective interventions to help ensure customers pay and receive the right amounts. Inland Revenue is better able to target its activity, delivering productivity improvements. Progress tracking for all benefit areas Achievement of the investment objectives is measured against a number of lead and lag indicators as shown in the table on the next page. Inland Revenue achieved seven out of the ten indicators for which there are quantitative measures. The measures not achieved for 2019/20 were: • The percentage of customers who find it easy to comply. While this has increased slightly since last year, it appears it is taking longer than expected for customers to adopt new services and become comfortable with them. There are positive signs however, with student loan customers in particular being very positive about how easy it is to use new services. • Reduction in compliance time for SMEs. The result for 2019/20 is indicative as it is based on the 2018 survey rather than the 2020 survey, which was deferred due to COVID-19. However the indicative, cumulative value of the time saved is well above target. • Annual reduction in Inland Revenue’s administrative costs. This was not achieved due to the deferral of planned organisational changes in light of COVID-19. However, the cumulative reduction in costs is above target. Page 24 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] THE COMMERCIAL CASE Sourcing the services and products required for delivery This section outlines the suppliers Inland Revenue is working with to implement the future revenue system. Commercial arrangements support all-of -Government principles Page 25 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] The major procurement activity required to successfully implement transformation has largely been completed. Inland Revenue is increasingly turning its attention to ensuring that arrangements for the commercial relationships that will endure once the transformation programme closes are in place and sustainable. All procurement is consistent with the five principles of Government procurement. Work underway Since the last addendum to the programme business case was completed in October 2019, Inland Revenue has continued to work with a range of suppliers on the products and services needed to support transformation. The services sought this year include: • Privileged access management and identity governance administration services – a recommendation for a preferred supplier and approach has been through Inland Revenue's governance forums. Once budget has been allocated, participants in the request for proposal process will be notified and Inland Revenue will progress negotiations with the preferred supplier. . • Evidence management – the signing of a Master Services Agreement is imminent. This will enable implementation and a s ubscription agreement will follow. As part of an initial market scan, Inland Revenue worked with a number of agencies, including the Serious Fraud Office, the Department of Internal Affairs, and the Ministry of Justice to understand their approaches and capabilities. Activity to be completed There are two significant pieces of work to be completed over the next year. As part of the enterprise support services programme of work, Inland Revenue plans to replace its payroll solution. Inland Revenue is closely aligned with the all-of- Government payroll programme to ensure the department’s requirements and approach are consistent with the broader government sector. On 30 September 2020, a payroll request for proposal was released. While the majority of Inland Revenue’s people could work remotely easily and effectively during the COVID-19 lock down period, some could not. It was not possible for some contact centre roles for example, as some software cannot currently be accessed remotely. Inland Revenue is looking at solutions to enable this. Work is also underway to establish the commercial arrangements that will be required once transformation is complete. Some suppliers will not have an on-going role in providing products or services to Inland Revenue once transformation is complete. The focus with suppliers in this category is to ensure good knowledge transfer so that Inland Revenue has the capabilities needed to continue to successfully run the department following the closure of the programme. Other suppliers will have an on-going role to play, albeit in a different capacity. For example, the skills and experience required during the design, build and implement phases are different to those needed during the support and optimisation phases. The focus for suppliers in this category is to ensure that commercial arrangements are established that set both Inland Revenue and suppliers up for success once transformation is complete. All-of-government/shared services capabilities Inland Revenue continues to consume common capabilities and ICT capabilities where they exist, meet the department’s business needs and are cost-effective. Inland Revenue continues to work with other agencies to leverage the investment made in Ātea. In February 2020, the Digital Government Leadership Group (DGLG) agreed a work programme to enable the process model developed by Inland Revenue for human resources, finance, asset management and procurement functions to be adopted as a common process model for all-of-Government. The work programme is headed by senior leaders from the functional lead agencies: • The Public Service Commission for human resources. • Treasury for finance and asset management. • The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment for procurement. • The Government Chief Digital Officer for digital government services. \[IN CONFIDENCE\] implementation of Oracle technology produced to date. Agencies using the common process model and Inland Revenue configuration will have an accelerator for implementing Oracle cloud-based technology. New Zealand businesses Inland Revenue has sought a wide range of providers for transformation. Opportunities have been actively promoted to the market place including New Zealand businesses – for example, advertising on GETS and communications with vendors. In line with achieving broader cultural, economic, environmental and social outcomes from government procurement, Inland Revenue is considering how opportunities can be created for New Zealand businesses through the department’s procurement activity. Information and communications technology has been identified as one of the priority sectors for increasing access to government contracts for New Zealand businesses. Inland Revenue has developed a social procurement strategy focused on achieving better buying outcomes and therefore greater public value. The department is aiming to drive better social and environmental outcomes through its supply chain and spend with suppliers. Social procurement evaluation criteria have been incorporated into the supplier selection process. Each year Inland Revenue publishes a list of New Zealand suppliers it has spent over $500,000 with. For the purposes of procurement, the definition of a New Zealand business is A business that originated in New Zealand (not being a New Zealand subsidiary of an off- shore business), is majority owned or controlled by New Zealanders, and has its principal place of business in New Zealand. Using this definition, between 1 July 2014 and 31 March 2020, where Inland Revenue incurred more than $500,000 on contractors and consultants providing services across the business transformation programme, the total percentage spend on New Zealand companies was 36%. Based on whether a company is considered a New Zealand resident for tax purposes, the total percentage spend was 73%. A company is considered a tax resident if it is incorporated in New Zealand, or if control by company directors is exercised in New Zealand, or if it has its centre of management in New Zealand, or if it has its head office in New Zealand. Both delivery partners, FAST and Accenture, have recruited New Zealand staff. FAST has employed 50 New Zealanders over the last 4 years and had 34 New Zealanders on staff as at May 2020. Accenture have employed over 40. The objectives of the work programme are to improve consistency of processes, provide greater resilience, enable more effective processes, and deliver on-going efficiencies. COVID-19 has resulted in delays in getting the work programme fully up and running. In October 2020, the DGLG agreed the next steps to progress the work programme. In December 2020, the DGLG will consider the longer-term approach to the common process model, including access, governance, and funding. In addition, as part of the agreed arrangements for the implementation of Ātea, any material or information developed for Inland Revenue is able to be reused across government. This will enable other agencies using the same technology platform as Inland Revenue (Oracle) to accelerate delivery as they will not have to start from scratch. Oracle provides upgrades to its software (which Inland Revenue has named Ātea) every quarter. Inland Revenue has automated the testing of these upgrades and is exploring options for enabling other agencies to leverage this capability. Inland Revenue will also explore how its e-invoicing capability can be leveraged by other agencies, for example working with software developers to establish standard design patterns. Withheld under s18(c)(i) of the OIA performed an independent quality assurance review of the common process model and the approach and material developed to support the Page 26 Page 27 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] THE MANAGEMENT CASE Ensuring successful delivery This section outlines updated governance and management arrangements for the programme, including assurance, benefits and risk management. Transformation continues to be well managed and governed Page 28 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Since the last addendum to the programme business case was completed in October 2019, Inland Revenue has: • updated programme governance and management arrangements • completed independent quality assurance reviews, and • regularly reviewed and updated risks. Programme methodologies and approaches and Inland Revenue’s change management approach remain unchanged. Programme governance arrangements From February 2020, some changes were made to streamline Inland Revenue’s g overnance system. The Performance and Investment Committee, Organisation Development Committee and Customer-Centric Committee were paused and then formally closed in August 2020. The governance decisions that would have been made at these forums will be made through the remaining governance bodies. An updated governance structure for the programme is shown in the diagram below. Programme management arrangements Following Release 4 go-live and the re-planning of the final stage of the programme, the management structure of the programme was reviewed to ensure it is fit-for-purpose for the remainder of the programme. As a result, the Release 4 Programme Manager and Release 5 Programme Manager roles have been renamed to reflect the workstreams remaining in the final stage of the programme. The high-level structure for transformation as at July 2020 is shown in the diagram below. Progress tracking Delivery progress is evaluated through: • Independent quality assurance and Gateway reviews. • Oversight by the Senior Responsible Owner and governance groups. • Management and oversight from the Deputy Commissioner, Transformation and members of the Programme Leadership Team (PLT). • Monthly red amber green (RAG) status reporting against the 10 keys (scope, risk, issues, inter-dependencies, schedule, resource, stakeholder engagement, delivery partners, financials and benefits). Page 29 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Programme assurance A programme of regular independent assurance reviews provides confidence that transformation continues to be well managed and governed. Since the last addendum was completed in October 2019, four further independent assurance reviews have taken place. • A Gateway 4 (Readiness for Service) interim review in October 2019. • KPMG completed their tenth independent quality assurance and ninth technical quality assurance review (IQA10/TQA9) in January 2020. • A Gateway 4 (Readiness for Service) review in March 2020. • KPMG completed their IQA11/TQA10 review in July 2020. Delivery of the final report was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Reviews continue to be positive, while noting transformation remains high risk. Summaries of each review are published on Inland Revenue’s website. The Office of the Auditor General (OAG) tabled their performance audit of benefits management for transformation in August 2020 (please refer to page 18). Benefits management Progress in realising benefits is regularly tracked and reported. In addition to the programme business case 6 Paid parental leave and Inland Revenue’s payroll application run off SAP. addendum dated October 2019, the following reports have been delivered: • Nine case studies demonstrating realisation of benefits were provided to the Portfolio Governance Committee to note between July 2019 and September 2020. • A comprehensive update of progress across all non- monetary and monetary benefits was reported to the Strategic Governance Board in September 2020. Progress for 2019/20 will be shared with central monitoring agencies and independent assurance reviewers. Risk management Identification and management of risks remains a strength of the programme. As at October 2020, there were 54 risks for transformation managed by the programme leadership team, of which the most significant (15 as at October 2020) are reported each month to the Portfolio Governance Committee. The top risks for transformation are reliance on SAP 6 , FIRST satellite functions, and KiwiSaver business-to- business exchanges after July 2022 preventing full decommissioning of Inland Revenue’s heritage data centres. There are strong mitigation plans in place for these risks. Page 30 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Part B Additions to the scope of transformation This section summarises additions to scope since the last addendum to the programme business case was prepared in October 2019. Some additions to scope have been agreed Page 31 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] The additions to scope during 2020 are the result of decisions taken by Government in response to COVID-19. Inland Revenue’s swift response to COVID-19 amply demonstrates the benefits of the investment made in transformation and the agility decision-makers now have. The initiatives were delivered while Inland Revenue was organising its people to work remotely, preparing for the implementation of Release 4 and supporting customers following go-live, and preparing for the peak tax season, including the 2020 automatic income tax assessments. To achieve this, Inland Revenue focused on: • Making processes as easy and simple as possible for customers to reduce effort for them at a highly stressful time. • Ensuring requirements were as clear and as simple as possible. • Leveraging the digitally-based revenue system to ensure as a wide a reach as possible. • Clearly understanding the source of data and, where it did not exist, ensuring it could be obtained in way that made implementation simple and straight forward. It should be noted that these results were not achieved without cost. The final stage of the transformation programme was re -planned as a result, as some work underway was paused to enable people to focus on the higher priority COVID-19 response work. Inland Revenue was the lead agency for a number of initiatives. Inland Revenue was the lead agency on two COVID-19 response bills and prepared a Supplementary Order Paper (SOP) for another. The COVID-19 Response (Taxation and Social Assistance Urgent Measures) Act 2020: • reintroduced depreciation deductions for non- residential buildings; • increased the threshold for having to pay provisional tax from $2,500 to $5,000; • increased the low value asset threshold; • brought forward the application date of broader refundability for the research and development tax credit by one year to the 2019/20 income year; • allows Inland Revenue to remit interest on a late tax payment if the taxpayer’s ability to make the tax payment on time was significantly adversely affected by COVID-19; • allows Inland Revenue to share information with other government agencies to assist them in their response to COVID-19; • removed the work hours eligibility requirement from the in-work tax credit; • allows people on a temporary visa, that would not otherwise meet the Working for Families residence criteria, to qualify for Working for Families if they receive an emergency benefit from the Ministry of Social Development (MSD); • ensures that GST does not apply to payments of the COVID-19 Wage Subsidy or the COVID-19 leave payment; and • restores the rates for the winter energy payment from 2021 onwards to $450 per year for single people with no dependent children and $700 per year for couples and people with dependent children. The COVID-19 Response (Taxation and Other Regulatory Urgent Measures) Act 2020: • introduced a temporary tax loss carry-back measure; • gave the Commissioner of Inland Revenue a temporary discretionary power to modify due dates, timeframes, or procedural requirements for taxpayers who are impacted by COVID-19; • authorised the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, on behalf of the Crown, to lend money under the small business cashflow (loan) scheme; and • ensures that special assistance granted under the COVID-19 New Zealanders Stranded Overseas Support Programme has the same treatment for tax and social policy purposes as for the equivalent payments of main benefits, NZ Super, and the veteran’s pension. SOP No. 488 proposed amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 relating to the small business cashflow (loan) scheme and the temporary tax loss carry-back regime, to ensure that those measures work as intended. Page 32 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] The measures are intended to support ordinarily viable and currently vulnerable businesses. As at 9 October 2020: • Approximately 104,000 applications for the small business cashflow (loan) scheme had been received and approximately $1.6 billion in loans approved. • Around 2,500 customers had opted into the loss carry-back scheme and received approximately $105 million in funds released. As at 12 October 2020: • Approximately 52,000 customers had use of money interest remitted, to a total value of $5.6 million. • Approximately 20,000 customers had entered into an instalment arrangement and the total estimated value of interest supressed was $15 million. Inland Revenue also supported other agencies with the response to COVID-19. Inland Revenue supported MSD to deliver the Wage Subsidy as part of the COVID-19 response package. While the Wage Subsidy is administered by MSD, it relies on data held by Inland Revenue to verify applications. Initially, supporting Wage Subsidy applications was very labour-intensive. Inland Revenue shared information about self-employed individuals, employers and employees with MSD which enabled many applications to be automatically approved. Many however needed further clarification and initially an 0800 number was established specifically for MSD staff to connect directly with Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue answered more than 350,000 calls from MSD staff between March and early June 2020. The extension of the Wage Subsidy provided the opportunity to improve support for MSD. Inland Revenue developed a portal to allow MSD to self- serve some queries. Customers are benefitting as their applications can be processed more quickly, and both MSD and Inland Revenue are benefitting from improved administration of the subsidy. The portal has been in place since 11 June 2020 and allows approved MSD people to access the information they need to verify applications directly, reducing the number of calls and the manual work, and ensuring applications are processed efficiently. To protect individuals' privacy, MSD users have read-only access to selected data, limited to the minimum data necessary in order to verify whether or not any particular Wage Subsidy application should be approved. Inland Revenue only verifies applications where there is some complexity, for example large employers and any exceptions for self-employed customers. These are still managed via a phone call. The portal also supports COVID-19 Income Relief Payments. The information required to assess eligibility for these payments is different from that required to assess applications for the Wage Subsidy. MSD requires access to employer and income data to undertake post-payment integrity work. MSD staff are assigned as a user for either the Wage Subsidy or the Income Relief Payments – not both. This is to protect the integrity of the revenue system and ensure that information shared with MSD is only used for its intended purpose. The speed with which the portal was implemented is further demonstration of the benefits of transformation. It took just 15 working days from when the proposal to build the portal was approved through Inland Revenue’s governance forums until the portal was up and running. This was enabled by Inland Revenue’s new core technology, new workplace technology, and new ways of working. A networked team, including representatives from MSD, was established to co-design the portal and develop the necessary information-sharing arrangements simultaneously. The flexible and iterative nature of START meant that changes could be made overnight if needed.

Programme business case
=======================

We presented our business transformation programme business case to Cabinet in November 2015. The aim was to get approval to start the first stages of our transformation.

Our work on setting the foundations for the business case started much earlier, in 2011. We presented our first programme business case in 2013 and a further addendum in 2014. It took several years to be clear about what we wanted to achieve and to understand what would be needed.

We focused on outcomes, opportunities and how to best use the wider eco-system such as policy, process, technology, and people.

We built the 2015 business case using the following foundations.

Clear and simple strategy
-------------------------

Transformation provided the opportunity to review how the revenue system is administered. The intent was to deliver a modern, digital revenue system:

*   based around customers’ needs
*   that is easy to understand and interact with
*   that is based on near real-time information
*   that is digital and highly automated
*   where systems and software do most of the work
*   that is more responsive, flexible, and certain for customers
*   that is future-proofed to accommodate change
*   that allows for services to be delivered with others both inside and outside government.

Investment required to transform
--------------------------------

The investment needed to transform the organisation has to cover everything that you will encounter. As an example, here are some of the higher-level categories that required investment.

*   Business process change.
*   Change management.
*   Co-existence, working with both the old and new systems and processes together.
*   Organisational change, including structure, roles, operating models and if required, redundancies.
*   Policy and legislation change.
*   Core technology solution.
*   Digital and customer experience solutions.
*   Supporting technologies (what it will take to join solutions together including networks and security and data centres).
*   Information management.
*   Analytics.
*   Supporting systems that may be needed, such as back-office systems, finance and so forth.

On ramps and off ramps
----------------------

When we submitted our business case there was a lot of concern that if the programme went off the rails, then there had to be a way to stop and exit the programme. This is why we use the term on/off ramps. In reality, a multi-year programme has no option to stop or exit. Once you start leaving it incomplete, it creates all sorts of other problems and generally increases your cost of co-existence.

Multi-year appropriation funding
--------------------------------

This is essential for a transformation programme. Without multi-year funding, you will:

*   spend significant time in administration trying to move money around
*   lose significant productivity while teams spend a lot of their time building the case for the next phase, and
*   find it difficult to commercially negotiate the best deals.

Co-existence
------------

You need to have a clear view of the impact of co-existence and the resulting cost to the organisation. Do not underestimate the impact of having to run multiple processes or systems. In our case, co-existence lasted right up to the final release.

Clear roadmap of the stages or phases
-------------------------------------

Be clear about what you are delivering and when you will deliver. This will become crucial in allowing you to report consistently against progress.

Cabinet updates
---------------

Due to the size of the investment, it is important to make sure your original business case recommends regular progress updates.

Investment objectives guided the programme business case
--------------------------------------------------------

We developed investment objectives early in the process to guide the plan’s development. These need to be clear and in plain English that both the organisation and Ministers could relate to them.

A clear and simple engagement plan
----------------------------------

This meant regular engagement with Minsters, including the Minister of Finance, and Corporate Centre involvement in the programme business case’s development. For example, we seconded a Treasury official to support in the development of the case.

Being clear about the proposed Programme structure
--------------------------------------------------

Dedicated leadership is essential. Transformation cannot be an ‘add on’ to a busy day job.

Planning to deliver the benefits
--------------------------------

Benefits were a clear part of the story from the beginning. At first, we focused on dollars or time saved, and as transformation progressed, we became more customer focused. Our focus then started to reflect the benefits of helping customers get it right from the start, rather than punishing them when they got it wrong. We were very aware of the need to design the benefits into both the vision and the delivery. If the design did not deliver benefits, it was not right. Delivering the benefits was essential for success and for paying for the programme.

Not underestimating the change management required
--------------------------------------------------

Delivering Transformation meant there was little space for anything else. We planned for and put a dedicated focus on change management. This included intensive internal stakeholder work during design, readiness, and delivery. This made sure we had continued support at all levels, and business ownership and integration of outcomes.

Putting customer needs at the centre of your thinking
-----------------------------------------------------

By including our customers and stakeholders in the design and testing, we were able to put customer needs at the centre of our thinking. Over this time, we gained a deeper understanding of how customers behave and their likely reactions to changes. We organised ourselves around customer types and shifted to a ‘right from the start’ mindset.

Programme Management Office - What we learnt
============================================

People
------

Include the Programme Management Office lead as part of the programme leadership team so they get the right messages, direction, context of decisions and can more effectively support the Programme Management Office and by extension, the programme.

The Programme Management Office lead should be focused on delivery not strategy and should have a similar expectation of the whole Programme Management Office team.

Recruit the right people for the job, set high standards and retain the key members of the team if you can, to maintain continuity and knowledge.

Have an organisation structure with clear roles and responsibilities. Work out what needs to be managed and by who and help the wider programme team understand who the go-to person should be.

Clear definition of the Programme Coordinator role in particular allowed coordinators to get on with their own work, in a comparable way, while embedded in their workstream teams.

Having a dedicated tools team within the Programme Management Office to provide support and training on programme management tools to all programme members, for example JIRA and SharePoint, facilitated the smooth running of the transformation programme.

Including Programme Coordinators in the testing and set up of the new project tools – JIRA and SharePoint - worked well. It helped build their capability and their ability to train and assist others in their workstreams.

Be adaptive and pragmatic, support and respect each other’s skills.

Governance
----------

Establish and maintain a governance framework and terms of reference. Tailor governance to fit the stage / phase of the programme.

Create a framework that supports the use of tools, workflows and processes, with agreed terminology, nomenclature, conventions, governance hierarchies and processes.

Establish the framework, controls and methods early on and follow them but be adaptable when it makes sense to make changes. The use of framework became fundamental to how we organised work and work streams and dictated the structure of the team.

Set up forums to manage and provide visibility of critical areas, for example risk and finance meetings. Risks were reviewed every fortnight at the programme leadership team meeting, however a standalone risk meeting was held monthly, attended by the full programme leadership team as the owners of the risks.

Expect governance to evolve and adapt over the length of the programme. Learn from your mistakes and be open to learning. If something works well in one workstream, consider adopting it in other areas.

Be flexible and adaptive, with a view towards continuous improvement and a focus on outcomes.

Process
-------

Ensure the key programme processes created by the Programme Management Office have visible endorsement from the top, to encourage people to respect and stick to them.

Have clear and well managed processes so everyone knows what to do or not do, especially in key areas such as:

*   programme change requests (PCRs),
*   deliverables,
*   schedules,
*   risks and issues.

Communicate them clearly, with regular follow ups to make sure they are being followed and are understood.

On a large transformation programme, on-boarding and off-boarding takes up a significant amount of time. It requires efficient consistent processes to ensure new staff can start work on their first day with everything they need (logon, laptop, access to tools and so on).

Having the right project management tools – in our case JIRA and SharePoint– allowed information to be integrated across the programme.

Standardise documentation across the programme workstreams by creating templates where possible. Also creates efficiencies through reuse or adaption.

Assigning responsibilities for collating and communicating updates to Programme Management Office documentation proved an effective use of time.

Document management
-------------------

Take the use of metadata to identify documentation seriously and support all document owners to do likewise. Without this, it can be extremely hard to relocate documents over a multi-year transformation.

Create standards around the use and maintenance of documents and have a process for version control, especially for key artifacts. For example:

*   only have one copy of a document
*   encourage the use of links to documents for reference rather than taking a copy
*   if using an existing document as the basis for a new document change the title.

In addition to managing and retaining documents considered to be deliverables – decide early on what other documents will become key artefacts and ensure they are identified and managed right from the start.

Resource management
-------------------

If resource management is handled within the Programme Management Office, setting up a robust, straightforward process which people leaders will follow and stick to is essential.

Advertise jobs internally before you go to market. This helps ensure a good mix of internal and external resources on the programme at any one time.

Set up standard role profiles for use within the programme, to simplify recruitment and ensure clarity. If people leave, you need to know the precise role you are recruiting for and be certain of the number of people already doing that job.

Programme planning

When Cabinet agreed to invest in transformation in November 2015, it noted that delivery would be achieved in 4 overlapping stages across a 5-year period, completing delivery in 2021. These stages were:

*   Stage 1: Enabling secure digital services 2016-2017.
*   Stage 2: Streamline income and business tax processes from 2017 to 2019.
*   Stage 3: Streamline social policy delivery from 2018 to 2020.
*   Stage 4: Complete delivery of the future revenue system from 2019 to 2021.

![The transformation timeline showing the overlap of workstreams](/-/media/project/ir/home/graphics/about-us/buisness-transformation/business-transformation-guide/high-level-timeline.png?modified=20220524033831)

The roadmap showed simply and clearly what we would deliver and when. It was also customer and stakeholder-centred. We recognised the need to manage change carefully, and not to overload different customer groups with change all at once.

Initially, we had thought there would be on and off ramps in the roadmap, presenting a series of investment decisions over the life of the programme. It became apparent, however, that the transition to new systems and processes must be completed once started. Therefore, the major investment decision had to be taken right at the beginning of the programme.

We implemented a lot of policy change during transformation and were able to manage this and fit it into the delivery cycle. Having a clear roadmap and ensuring it was highly visible helped to highlight the most opportune times for making policy changes.

### The programme roadmap

This early roadmap set out GST as the starting point for the programme and the overall phasing. However, the stages were broad enough for us to adjust our approach when needed.

Following the successful implementation of Stage 1 (moving GST into the new administration system START), we determined that taking a release-based approach for Stages 2 and 3 would ensure that implementation of the new tax and social policy changes were:

*   logically sequenced,
*   grouped to enable efficient use of resources, and
*   delivered so as not to overload our people and different customer groups with change all at once.

This release approach enabled the programme to deliver the Tax on Income products (Release 2: 2017 to 2018 and Release 3: 2018 to 2019) and at the same time deploy Working for Families, the first social policy product. This was followed by Release 4 for KiwiSaver and student loans from 2019 to 2020. As a result of the pandemic in 2020, Inland Revenue used its new functionality to deliver the government’s response to COVID-19 for businesses, Stage 4, (moving the final social policy products into our new system and the first upgrade of that system (START), was delivered in two releases in 2021.

### Programme delivery plan

Delivery of the future state design required balanced consideration of the impact on our people and customers, delivery risk, technology, integration complexity and policy.

The Programme delivery plan document defined the scope of what future state outcomes would be delivered within each release of the programme and was aligned to the financial plan. This allowed us to manage scope, schedule resources and risks while understanding both internal and external communications requirements.

The programme delivery plan was a point in time view that was reviewed and updated throughout the life of the programme in line with technology choices, delivery achievements and any change to scope.

The Programme Management Office used this point in time view to baseline each stage and release. Detailed schedules were created for each workstream and project under the release. This enabled the Programme Management Office to track progress or ‘earned value’ in a standard way across the programme. The planning standards we applied remained the same whatever method was used to deliver the agreed scope or outcomes and were called out in several external audits as an exemplar.

[START release plan - Sequencing options (PDF 1MB) Download document](/-/media/project/ir/home/documents/about-us/bt-guide/delivering-the-transformation/getting-going/programme-management-office/programme-planning/start-release-plan---sequencing-options.pdf?modified=20220805032449&modified=20220805032449)

Financial management

While the programme had a multi-year appropriation, considerable time was spent before the commencement of each stage and release to ensure that the investment was appropriate for the scope, deliverables and the contribution to the end state outcomes. This was done through a baseline process.

At high-level, guiderails were developed to ensure that investment was balanced across each part of the programme to achieve the agreed scope and outcomes. This set off a detailed planning process which included resource and financial planning. On completion this was tested against the high-level guiderails.

### Tracking against the baseline

Once the allocation of funding was agreed, scope confirmed and plans baselined, the programme change process kicked in. This ensured any movement from the approved baseline was formally considered and approved. The baseline was tracked in detail and underpinned status reporting right across the programme. Over the course of the programme there were several baselines, with each one running for approximately 12 months.

At a programme level, an out-year process (looking at the financial year ahead) ensured that the programme had enough funding at the end of each period to complete the whole programme of work. Careful and considered management of the programme contingency was important and this was done on a risk basis. The monthly finance meeting also considered financial risks and impacts so that any risk to funding was highly visible.

Programme reporting

The Programme Management Office managed the collation of reports across the programme for each workstream and programme area.

Key reports and deliverable in this area included:

**The 10 keys**

This provided transparency to all stakeholders on the programme’s health and performance. Insights and inputs allowed us to adjust plans and behaviours as we went. The 10 keys covered:

1.  Stakeholder engagement.
2.  Scope.
3.  Schedules.
4.  Financials.
5.  Resources.
6.  Risks.
7.  Issues.
8.  Delivery partners.
9.  Benefits.
10.  Inter-dependencies.

### Red, Amber, Green (RAG) status guidelines

We used the Red Amber Green (RAG) status when reporting progress and status at workstream and programme level.

### Monthly Portfolio Governance Committee dashboard

The Portfolio Governance Committee was one of the most important governance forums (see Governance) at which we presented on the status of the transformation every month. The monthly dashboards covered:

*   Overall Red Amber Green (RAG) status and schedule performance for the transformation.
*   Key messages including opportunities, escalations, special notes, required decisions, requests for direction and so on.
*   Go-to-green plans for areas requiring remedial action to get back on track.
*   Programme-level risks and/or issues under escalation management.
*   A rolling eight-week window of key activities/dates of the future focus of the programme.

### Central Monitoring Agencies reports

Reports completed for the Portfolio Governance Committee on a monthly basis were provided to Central Agencies bi-monthly. An extended detailed version of the Portfolio Governance Committee dashboard, focussed on the 10 keys and including workstream reports, was then provided to Central Monitoring Agencies and used as a discussion point at regular monitoring meetings.

### Transformation updates

Inland Revenue was directed to provide updates on transformation to Cabinet by July and December each year. The updates were the principal vehicle for reporting on Inland Revenue’s progress in realising benefits. Once considered, these 6-monthly Cabinet updates were published on Inland Revenue’s website.

### Business Transformation status report for Joint Ministers

The report provided Joint Ministers with an updated on the following areas:

*   progress against the plan
*   the current Phase of work
*   highlights and challenges.

Risk strategy and management

Our Programme risk management approach recognised that change initiatives of any size and particularly major programme transformations are high-risk undertakings. While programme risks cannot be eliminated entirely, with the right focus and management approach, many can be anticipated and reduced.

### Risk management plan

Our risk management plan describes the specific management activities that were undertaken to support the execution of the programme’s risk strategy. Specifically, it sets out:

*   the approach used to identify, review and manage risks and issues at programme, sub programme and workstream levels
*   the roles and responsibilities for risk and issues management within the programme
*   the reporting processes.

### Issues management

Managing issues effectively on a large-scale programme is also crucial to its success. The programme risk management plan therefore provided criteria for issues to be reported, escalated and managed appropriately.

Programme assurance

Government requires a major monitored programme to be subject to very regular reviews throughout its life. And this was the case for our transformation. With additional scrutiny from our internal governance boards, we took a highly proactive approach to ensure full transparency and that:

*   there was an overall plan for implementing assurance activities
*   there was capacity for conducting planned and ad hoc reviews
*   ongoing Independent Quality Assurance (IQA), Technical Quality Assurance (TQA) and Gateway reviews were undertaken at key milestones of the Programme, for example before a release go live
*   there were Office of the Auditor General (OAG) reviews
*   Internal reviews and reviews of our vendors and business partners continued throughout the programme.
*   progress was continuously monitored by Central Monitoring Agencies.

Resource management

The Project Management Office was responsible for planning and coordinating the resource requirements of the transformation. Specialist resources were brought in to the team to manage resource requirements including people, accommodation and equipment. While this is not a traditional model, it did make our Project Management Office a truly operational and delivery-focused team.

At a programme level, resources were tracked using a formal process, where each programme role was assigned a role number. A resource would be requested, the vacancy number checked and recorded, then the request would be formally assessed and approved by the lead with appropriate delegations before recruitment could commence.

Partners and vendors followed a slightly different process which was managed through a Statement of Work with key resources identified and managed.

Deliverables management

The size and complexity of the transformation meant that we worked with many hundreds of documents which required a robust control system to be in place to manage them. All programme-level artefacts were control documents. Specifically, these included but were not limited to:

*   The Programme Management Plan.
*   Transformation updates to Cabinet.
*   Baseline programme plans and release plans.
*   Design artefacts including requirements, business blueprints, business profiles, solution specifications, and business function definitions.
*   Programme level strategies.
*   Any Master Services Agreement with third parties and associated Statement of Work.
*   Formal Request for Proposal (RFP) responses from third-party providers.
*   Operations manuals issued to third-party providers.

Underpinning all these activities was the Programme Management Plan, an internal reference document which supported us to execute the agreed scope and achieve our key objectives.

Programme Management Plan
-------------------------

The Programme Management Plan describes the programme management process and activities, and includes detail around scope, timeline, delivery methodologies and governance arrangements. It also sets out the responsibilities of the programme and how all these aspects will be managed.

The Programme Management Plan was a living document, updated throughout the life of the programme as Inland Revenue transformed.

purpose of the Programme Management Plan (PMP) is to serve as a key reference document for the Business Transformation (BT) Programme. It describes the programme management processes and activities and includes detail around scope, timeline, delivery methodologies and governance arrangements. It also sets out the responsibilities of the programme and how all these aspects will be managed. The PMP is an internal reference document which supports the programme in the successful execution of agreed scope and in achieving its key objectives. Further, the PMP is used as a key guiding document in the support and management of the programme’s key stakeholders. It is not intended to serve as a design document. The PMP is a living document throughout the life of the programme and will be updated on a regular basis as the programme changes and IR transforms. The following key documents should be read in conjunction with the PMP to gain full insight into the BT Programme. • Programme-level Benefits Management and Realisation Plan • Benefit Management Strategy • Programme Update and Detailed Business Case • Programme Business Case Addendum • BT Framework • BT Operating Model • Business Transformation Methodology (BTM) • Delivery Plan • Release 3 Scope • Release 4 Scope • Stage 4 Scope • BT Programme Change and Release Definitions Page 10 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 2 Inland Revenue (IR) for the Future IR for the Future is the key strategic vision for the organisation and Business Transformation (BT) is integral to its execution and the outcomes it addresses. Te Pae Tawhiti, our te reo Māori name for IR for the future, literally translates as 'the distant horizon'. 2.1 Our Mission We contribute to the economic and social wellbeing of New Zealand by collecting and distributing money. Our mission is our cornerstone, and everything we do individually, as teams, and as an organisation, connects to it. 2.2 Our Vision Our vision is what we want IR to become: A world-class revenue organisation recognised for service and excellence. IR for the Future focuses on three key areas – Our Purpose, Our Strategic Focus and Ourselves. Figure 1: IR for the Future Our Work/Our Priorities describes what is important for the organisation to focus on and achieve, and what everyone's contribution is in that. Figure 2: Our Work Figure 3: Our Priorities Page 11 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] The Delivering our future visual helps to tell our strategic story. It i s the companion piece to IR for the future. Figure 4: IR Delivering our Future Page 12 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 3 Programme Background 3.1 Overview The Business Transformation (BT) Programme aims to realise the vision of, and deliver the capabilities required to meet, the strategic objectives outlined in IR for the Future. Delivering the BT will contribute to achieving growth in voluntary compliance and reduction of compliance costs for customers, while providing a foundation that supports Government policy changes in the future. 3.2 Critical Success Factors and Business Principles The Critical Success Factors and business principles that apply to BT are detailed below. These factors and principles form the key foundation for managing all elements of the programme. The business principles are: • the Programme will be business-led and endorsed • there will be a key focus on understanding and delivering the benefits committed. • there will be a key focus on ensuring that the solutions that are selected, developed and deployed are simple, robust, adaptive, and appropriate for, and approved by, the Inland Revenue • there will be a key focus on ensuring that the Programme supports the approved business strategy and target operating model • the establishment of effective governance for the Programme will be essential, and there will be a key focus on ensuring that these governance provisions are adhered to • there will be a key focus on providing effective and rigorous Programme management for all components of the Programme. The Programme management approach will provide for full transparency of all components and phases of the Programme, and will follow a strict entry/exit criteria approach with Portfolio Governance Committee (PGC), and/or Enterprise Priorities and Performance Committee (EPPC), and/or Strategic Governance Board ( SGB) approvals for key dates • effective resourcing will be a major priority, including dedicated resources from the business, as well as key vendors • there will be a key focus on managing the organisational change process, including gaining effective stakeholder commitment and buy-in throughout the Programme • all elements of the Programme will be managed as an integrated Programme, under well-defined governance arrangements, and a single Programme Office and management regime • delivery of the Programme will be guided by an integrated Programme Delivery Method, which is compliant with the Managing Successful Programmes (MSP) approach; and • ensuring a balanced focus on the six key dimensions as summarised in the chart below. Figure 5: Business Transformations Critical Success Factors (click link) Page 13 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 3.3 Programme Constraints The major constraints which may affect the Programme are listed below. • Government priorities: The government’s legislative programme will continue to have implications for B usiness Transformation (BT) . IR will need to take government priorities and the legislative programme into account during programme planning activities. • Availability of resources: A vailability of resources with the right skills and expertise within IR, New Zealand or internationally. • Support two technology environments: As IR continues to transition to a new platform, it will need to support both FIRST and the new technology environment. • Information sharing: Sharing of information is limited by tax secrecy and privacy legislation. • Delegated authorities: IR must operate within delegated authorities and secure ministerial approvals as required in accordance with the agreed tolerances. • Impacts on Customers: A key consideration is ensuring that the impacts on customers are minimised. Maintaining service levels while delivering the programme will be a key planning consideration. • Limited change windows: Some changes may need to be aligned to business cycles and/or tax years. • Ability to handle change: T he capacity of Inland Revenue, customers and other stakeholders to absorb change. 3.4 Programme Assumptions The key assumptions identified for the programme are as follows: • Resourcing: The resources needed to support the critical path are in place. These resources, supported by subject matter experts and shared services in the wider business, have the capacity and capability needed to support a challenging timeframe for the completion of the current phase. • Ministerial decisions: Programme planning takes into consideration enough time to engage and consult with Ministers and all material is provided to the Central agencies and Ministers in accordance with agreed timeframes. All decisions that are required to support critical milestones are achieved. • Programme Governance: The Senior Responsible Office (SRO), P ortfolio Governance Committee (PGC), design forums will have the necessary Delegated Authority to support the execution of the current phase. The PGC provides an appropriate level of challenge and oversight to the programme, whilst allowing decisions to be made at the pace required. • Communications: A robust Communications Plan (high level), Media Plan and Stakeholder Plan are in place, along with the resources necessary to support these plans and effectively manage stakeholders and communications activities. • Sourcing: The programme maintains multiple sourcing channels and approaches. Existing MSAs are in place for our key business partners and service providers, and for these; SoWs will be put in place as appropriate. For new partners the programme will establish both MSAs and SoWs as required. For smaller and more direct sourcing, e.g. contractors, the programme will put in place individual contracts that are managed via People & Culture. • Tax and Social Policy: IR continues to remain accountable for the same set of tax and social policy products as today and should be prepared to assume accountability for administering additional products. • Agreed target state: IR for the Future is the desired end-state. BT is focused on delivering the operating model for IR (including technology platform), with the primary objective being to support the achievement of IR for the Future. Page 14 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] • Compliance Costs: The shifting of compliance and administration costs between Inland Revenue and taxpayers should only occur if there is a net overall gain for the betterment of New Zealand. • Legislation change: P olicy and legislation changes are defined, developed and approved on time, and can be implemented in line with the BT Programme roadmap. 3.4.1 Investment Objectives Through transformation, IR aims to achieve the following investment objectives: • Improving agility so that policy changes can be made in a timely and cost-effective manner. • Delivering new and more effective services to improve customer compliance and help support the outcomes of social policies. • Improving productivity and reducing the cost of providing our services. • Improving the customer experience by making it easier and simpler for our taxation and social policy customers, with a focus on enhanced digital provision of services. • Increasing the secure sharing of intelligence and information to improve delivery of services to New Zealanders and improve public sector performance. • Minimising the risk of protracted system outages and intermittent systems failure. Business Transformation will enable a modern, customer-centric revenue system for New Zealanders. This investment in business transformation will deliver the following non- financial and financial benefit commitments: \[Information redacted\] Page 15 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 3.5 Outcomes and Benefits Realisation Business Transformation is enabling IR to deliver significant benefits to the Crown, customers and the department itself. The 2015 Programme Update and Detailed Business Case and the Programme-level Benefit Realisation Plan describe the benefits, measures and frequency of measurement in more detail. Links to these documents can be found in the PMP Appendices. 3.5.1 How we are measuring and reporting progress Three key outcomes are the measures of success against which we track our progress – these are: 1. Easier for customers 2. Reduced time and cost to implement policy 3. Inland Revenue is more efficient Progress is monitored through key performance indicators (KPIs) and outcome measures: • The KPIs track delivery progress against ten aspects of programme health, including benefits. These “10 keys” are reported to the Ministers of Finance and Revenue every month as part of the programme’s monthly status update. • The outcome measures track achievement of the investment objectives and realisation of benefits. These are reported in the Programme Business Case Addendum prepared by December each year and published on Inland Revenue’s website. Progress towards achieving the three outcomes is measured against several “lead and lag indicators” and through a series of case studies. The indicators and case studies are the basis for monitoring Inland Revenue’s progress in realising benefits and outcomes, as agreed with Joint Ministers and the central agencies. 3.5.1.1 External reporting Business Transformation is required to provide progress updates to Cabinet by July and December each year. These updates are a key vehicle for reporting progress in realising benefits and any other material shifts. Ministers will make decisions about any trade-offs that may need to be considered which impact benefit realisation. Since 2018, Business Transformation prepares a Programme Business Case Addendum by December each year, to help to maintain traceability to the 2015 business case. The Addendum documents progress and any material changes to scope or other aspects of the 2015 business case. The annual Addendum also reports progress in realising benefits and outcomes against monitoring thresholds provided by lead and lag indicators. Transformation’s progress towards achieving these three key outcomes is measured against the “lead and lag” indicators (indicator thresholds for dollar benefit figures reflect lower benefit range) that were agreed with the central agencies and Joint Ministers in 2017. \[Information redacted\] Page 16 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 3.5.1.2 Internal reporting Business Transformation (BT) benefit reporting aligns with Inland Revenue’s existing financial and business performance reporting cycles, and draws on enterprise data. Page 17 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 3.6 IR’s Future State Architecture The complete set of solution blueprints outlines how we will move the entire organisation from our current way of working to the way we will work in the future. Detail can be found on IR’s Business Solution Blueprints site which contains the executive summary, detailed blueprint and other documents for: • Core Tax and Social Policy • Customer Experience • Intelligence Led • Technology and Enterprise Integration • Organisation Design • Policy Business Transformation Vision: Green Paper • Enterprise Support Services • Technology Change and Operations Figure 7: IR’s Future State Architecture Page 18 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 3.7 Solution Architecture The Solution Architecture defines the target state technology architecture for IR at the end of BT. It represents the technology domains and sub-capabilities that will form the target state to provide technology services to IR staff and all its customers. The Solution Architecture diagram was originally developed in late 2015. Due to the large amount of Change that has been delivered through BT to date, as well as the forthcoming scope and developed thinking around the delivery of technology at IR (e.g. Cloud-first), the diagram has been updated to align with this. It includes input from architectural frameworks, roadmap changes and system/capability ownership changes etc. Figure 8: Future State Solution Architecture Mode Page 19 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 3.8 Enterprise Wide Change Management Effective Organisational Change Management (OCM) is essential across all stages of the Programme. Change Management discipline forms a core part of the approach. Up to and including Release 3, the Programme OCM Lead led enterprise wide change management through a horizontal integrated model with vertical, release-based delivery responsibilities, including new organisation design and deployment, people transition and capability uplift. With Release 3, the Programme reached a tipping point where change became managed directly through each of the releases, and enterprise wide change management responsibilities were unbundled across Release Change Lead roles. 3.8.1 Release Organisational Change Management From June 2019, all Change Leads/Managers work directly to their Programme Managers. BT will retain experienced change lead capability. A robust organisation change methodology will continue to guide change management within and across releases and this will continue to adapt and mature with the team. Change Leads will continue to act as a ‘networked team’ and be responsible for change integration across releases. \[Information redacted\] IR will be provided with ongoing independent advice through health check reviews on behalf of the Portfolio Governance Committee every six months. This will help ensure that the direction, change solutions and teams are on track and continue to be fit for purpose, and importantly will help IR stay true to its original change vision whilst at the same time working with IR to assess how well the release changes are embedding. Page 20 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 3.8.2 Organisation Design and Deployment In 2019, responsibility for completing and integrating the organisation transformation was transitioned to a Future Operating Model (FoM) team. The Future Operating Model is being led by the Executive Leadership Team (ELT) with specific ELT members assigned to lead specific areas of focus, supported by the Future Operating Model team to provide organisation design support, role design, employment relations, management of change and communications. Underpinning the Future Operating Model is the principle of ELT collectively and visibly leading change, giving consistent and connected communication, and having groups implement at their own pace. 3.8.3 People Capability Uplift IR’s transformation business case recognised that a different approach would be needed to enable a transformed and future fit workforce that is adaptive to rapid and ongoing changes to customer demand, technology disruption and the future of work. The people capability uplift work originated from IR’s Organisation Design blueprint. The capability uplift work has focussed on identifying and developing capabilities IR needs into the future and using those as a basis for an integrated system of people practices and processes centred around empowerment, agility and adaptability. The 12 bespoke People Capabilities have been designed and integrated into IR’s organisational design and people practices – roles, performance, Learning & Development (L&D) and career development. IR people now have integrated tools and guidance to continue to develop and evolve their capabilities. From 2015/16 through to 2018/19, the people capability work has been funded by BT. Since 2017, People & Culture have been accountable for delivery. On 30 June 2019, BT investment concluded, and People & Culture became accountable for funding and the ongoing embedding and evolution of the capability approach. Page 21 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 4 Programme Governance Effective execution of the programme requires focused and effective governance and management. This section introduces IR’s governance system and outlines the programme’s governance and management structures, including roles and responsibilities. 4.1 IR’s Executive Level Governance System The Governance function, which is part of the Governance and Ministerial Services team, has the following functions: •ownership and responsibility for the Executive Level Governance within IR. •provide independent advice to governance chairs and members and to people preparing items for them so that the governance system runs smoothly. •ensure that the information going to the Board and Committees is timely and clear, and that they’re being given a joined-up view from across IR. •make sure governance decisions are accurately recorded and appropriately shared. •provide advice to make sure the governance system changes over time so that it continues to meet the needs of the changing organisation. •support people who are bringing items to the Board and Committees, making sure the papers meet expectations and get good outcomes. •Provide a big-picture view and inform IR’s senior leaders to help them govern the organisation. IR's governance system divides responsibilities across four executive-level governance bodies, Strategic Governance Board, Technical Governance Committee, Portfolio Governance Committee and Enterprise Priorities and Performance Committee. Underneath these sit a number of management-level governance bodies. These are usually responsible for specific programmes and projects or other aspects of IR's functional work. The Governance Do main Specialists will work with contributors and governance Chairs to ensure the right conversations are coming to the appropriate place. Refer to the diagram of the governance system to find out more. 4.1.1 Business Transformation Contribution BT is involved with the following IR executive governance meetings: •Strategic Governance Board (SGB): BT reports to the SGB on any elements of transformation that impact the strategic direction of the organisation, and SGB makes any high-level strategic decisions as required, including, any matters relating to scope, finances and benefits that are outside the delegations of the Programme or the Portfolio Governance Committee (PGC). •Portfolio Governance Committee (PGC): The PGC ensures the Programme is well managed from a cost/benefit, timeline, quality, risk and issues perspective and that the Programme is taking a customer-centric approach to transformation. BT reports monthly to the Committee. T he PMO Governance Advisor works with the Governance Domain Specialists on agenda items raised by the Programme and ensures documentation for the pack aligns to the PGC agenda. The PGC is attended by the DC Transformation and selected PLT members as applicable. •Enterprise Priorities and Performance Committee (EPPC): The EPPC provides an agile governance forum to allow for timely conversations. This Committee is responsible for monitoring the organisation’s performance, health and delivery of key initiatives and activities, including discussing key risks and issues. While BT delivery is governed primarily at PGC, BT will at times submit items to EPPC to test ideas and seek feedback. Such items may then need to be submitted to PGC for final approval. 4.2 Programme Governance groups and management forums An overview of the programme’s governance groups, and management forums is provided in the diagram below: Page 22 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Figure 10: IR Governance & BT Operating Model Further programme governance detail can be found in the PMP Appendices Page 23 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 4.3 Executive Leadership 4.3.1 Senior Responsible Owner (SRO) Role In the role of SRO, the Commissioner Inland Revenue (CIR) ensures that the assigned programme meets its investment objectives and delivers the benefit enablers. The SRO ensures that the Programme is prepared and reviewed at appropriate stages. The SRO also takes ownership of the business case. This role cannot be delegated. Responsibility As SRO, the CIR ensures IR allocates the necessary executive and financial commitment to the DC Transformation on behalf of the Programme. The SRO undertakes this role with the appropriate organisational accountability and power to maintain Programme momentum in a dynamic business environment. 4.3.2 Deputy Commissioner, Transformation Role The Deputy Commissioner, Transformation is the appointed representative of IR and ensures that the day-to-day business decisions are made for the Programme. The primary responsibilities of this role is firstly as Programme Director with internal and external focus, the approving of programme deliverables on behalf of IR, taking overall responsibility for the timely delivery of IR’s obligations, allocating internal and contractor resources to the Programme, monitoring significant risks in conjunction with the Programme Manager(s), addressing of business issues escalated for resolution or escalating these issues for resolution to the PGC, approving and/or escalating PCRs, managing the overall Programme budget including internal costs, and reporting programme progress to the PGC. Responsibility The Deputy Commissioner, Transformation is responsible for: • overall leadership and day to day management of Programme, including internal communications, and status updates to PGC, and ELT members • ensuring that his colleagues on the ELT and the CIR are kept fully informed on progress, issues and risks associated with Transformation • development of Ministerial updates and expediting for approval • Ministerial stakeholder management • all procurement and sourcing of all products and services required • contract management of all service provider(s) contracted for the required products and services • programme and project management – focus on deadlines, deliverables, costs, and quality of solution • identification and management of issues and risks • driving the pace and schedule of the Programme • developing and enforcing programme methods and standards • business process definition • stakeholder management and communications • organisational impact assessment • organisational design • assistance with strategic integration of major change initiatives • learning and development (transactional change management and capability build) • design of BT interventions • aligning the Programme to business strategy • benefits tracking and realisation, including organisational effectiveness • coordination and control of communications and stakeholder management associated with the programme. Page 24 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 4.4 Programme Delivery Approach When Cabinet agreed to invest in transformation in November 2015, it noted that delivery would be achieved in four overlapping stages across a five-year period, completing delivery in 2021. These stages were/are: • Stage 1: Enabling secure digital services 2016-2017 • Stage 2: Streamline income and business tax processes from 2017 to 2019 • Stage 3: Streamline social policy delivery from 2018 to 2020 • Stage 4: Complete delivery of the future revenue system from 2019 to 2021. Following the successful implementation of Stage 1 (START for GST), the programme determined that taking a release-based approach for Stages 2 and 3 would ensure that ongoing implementation of the new tax and social policy changes were: • logically sequenced. • grouped to enable efficient use of resources; and • risk was minimised for the business and IR customers This “release” approach enabled the programme to deliver the T ax on Income products (Release 2: 2017 to 2018 and Release 3: 2018 to 2019) and at the same time deploy Working for Families, the first social policy product. This was followed by Release 4 for KiwiSaver & Student Loans from 2019 to 2020. The programme is now completing the final stage of transformation, Stage 4, and will formally close down at the conclusion of the Stage as planned. Stage 4, the overarching umbrella implementing change across five workstreams, is the final phase of the Business Transformation Programme and extends from 1 July 2020 to the end of June 2022. Most programme activity will be completed by the end of 2021, with the period in early 2022 focused on decommissioning, key data archiving initiatives and the final programme transition to business as usual, and programme closure activities. Figure 11: Stage 4 Workstream Overview Page 25 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] The five workstreams that make up the final stage are: • Workstream 1 (WS1): START Delivery • Workstream 2 (WS2): Technology Optimisation & Decommissioning • Workstream 3 (WS3): Intelligence Led • Workstream 4 (WS4): Enterprise Support Services • Workstream 5 (WS5): Transition and Business Integration The delivery workstreams 1 to 3, will continue to deliver major, minor and independent “releases: • START major releases which includes all the necessary components to build out “end- to-end” the new tax and social policy solution); • START minor releases which could include enhancements to existing functionality or new functionality; or • Independent releases of supporting business or technical change that could include Organisation Model Implementation, Information Knowledge Management (IKM), Advanced Analytics, Digital Experience or Technology infrastructure. Workstream 4 delivering Human Capital Management and Enterprise Performance Management functions concluded work in June 2020. Workstream 5 is part of, but independent from programme delivery and is responsible for transition of enduring processes, frameworks and tools that IR will need to be successful post BT. This stream will also be responsible for closing out the BT Programme. 4.5 Programme Stage and Release Plan The release plan is Inland Revenue’s (IR’s) view of the sequence in which all taxes, services and entitlements will be moved to new systems and processes, thereby realising the programme objectives, and delivering the agreed benefits to IR. The release plan was endorsed by IR’s Portfolio Governance Committee (PGC) on 24 August 2017. Figure 12: Programme Stage and Release Plan Page 26 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 4.5.1 Release Naming Scheme The release naming scheme has been developed to support the release structure and delivery sequencing. Figure 13: Release Naming Scheme 4.6 BT Release Sequencing and Planning Approach The following principles are taken into consideration when shaping the release scope and implementation sequence of the BT Programme: • Risk minimisation – business and technical • Ability to implement in the required time frame (do ability – size of release) • START major releases will be scheduled to align to an appropriate time frame based on the product and/or tax type affected • Initiatives will be implemented at appropriate times aligned to business requirements and to compliment the START solution taking into consideration START Major release windows • Business impact – allowing enough time between releases for change to “bed in” • Policy change considerations (timing of legislative change) • Aligned to achievement of benefits as early as possible • Enablement of the new organisation • Affordability The Programme Release Plan is reviewed at the end of each major release (or at least yearly) to ensure that the sequence remains logical, relevant, and appropriate. Page 27 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 4.7 Release Delivery Model Modernising the revenue system requires wide-ranging change as outlined in the Release Delivery Model. Figure 14: IR’s Transformation Release Delivery Model Page 28 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 4.8 Roles and Responsibilities 4.8.1 RACI Model: Solution Design and Delivery The following diagram provides a view of the RACI applied to the solution definition, design and delivery phases of the Release. The diagram provides at minimum the overarching positioning of the key roles and how these are fulfilled in the design and delivery phases of the Release. There are formal IR organisation job descriptions for these roles. Figure 15: Solution Design and Delivery RACI Page 29 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 4.9 Scope and Timeline The BT programme is being delivered in 4 Stages which commenced in early 2016 and due to conclude at the end of 2021: • START Delivery of the new Tax and Social Policy solutions commenced in 2016 with the key objective of safely migrating all tax & social policy products from the heritage FIRST system to the new START solution, implementing new legislation, including what we needs to be in place to support the government’s COVID-19 response, and Optimise the solution for already delivered products where there is clear and quantifiable benefit to do so (subject to business prioritisation); the solutions have been progressively delivered in Major releases as follows: o 2016 to 2017: Stage 1 - START Release 1 (GST) o 2017 to 2018: Stage 2 - START Release 2 (Tax on Income) o 2018 to 2019: Stage 3 - START Release 3 (Tax on Income & Working for Families) o 2019 to 2020: Stage 3 - START Release 4 (KiwiSaver, Student Loans and PAYE) o 2020 to 2021: Stage 4 – WS1: First Release (Paid Parental Leave, Unclaimed Money, Foreign Trusts, Duties) o 2020 to 2021: Stage 4 – WS1: Second Release (Child Support and START v12 Upgrade): this release will complete the START solution and enable the close out of FIRST and all satellite systems o 2021 to 2022: Stage 4 – WS2: Decommissioning and Data Archiving • Digital Experience initiatives are mainly aligned to the major releases and has responsibility for onboarding our partners to the new solutions and for partner testing across the broad ecosystem. • WS2: Technology Optimisation and Decommissioning is working to ensure that by 2021, IR’s technology landscape is simplified, stable and fit for purpose. Fit for purpose includes having fully supported up to date hardware and software. To do this we’ll physically decommission the Unisys Data Centre. This includes server, storage and network infrastructure, all production and non-production environments. This workstream will also look to ensure that production and non-production environments which remain post business transformation, are optimal and of a size to support business operations. It will also close out the programme as we decommission our old systems and platforms including FIRST, the Enterprise Data Warehouse, and \[INFORMATION REDACTED\]. Decommissioning started in 2017. • WS3: Intelligence Led (Intel Led) will be progressively deliver Content and Knowledge Management and the Information Hub functions during 2019-2021 and will continue working to bring together two distinct programmes of work – data and analytics – and – information and knowledge management – into one cohesive eco- system. The focus will be on accessibility, behaviours and capability uplift, to ensure we embed and continue to optimise intelligence-led activity across IR. • WS4: Enterprise Support Services (ESS) progressively delivered C orporate Functions, Finance, Human Resources and Procurement during 2019-2020. • WS5: Transition and Business Integration (T&BI) will take an enterprise wide view and focus on the support and transition of knowledge, practices, and processes back to the business, to enable the programme to wind down and the business to progressively take on the responsibility for delivering change. • Stage 4 OTHER release changes – BT will deliver additional tax and social policy changes and prioritised solution, process and processing Optimisation between 2019 to 2021, subject to stakeholder, business and legislative requirement. Page 30 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 4.9.1 Confirming Stage 4 B enefits Building on the process used to validate Release 3 and Release 4 benefits, the Benefit Realisation Co-ordination Group (BRCG) has facilitated a process in mid-2020 and subsequently in February 2021 with subject matter experts and senior business group representatives to estimate and validate expected benefits from Stage 4. The BRCG is tasked by the ELT with: • Ensuring that the right people are involved in benefit realisation. • Ensuring there is clear identification of the business impacts from Releases. • Identifying any gaps. • Providing assurance to the ELT and ensuring that there is clarity on: - What is going to be different for customers and for Inland Revenue. - What level of benefit will be realised, by when and from which areas? - Any dependencies that are key to realising those benefits • Escalating any risks, issues or further detailed design and/or transition issues requiring ELT’s direction. The BRCG process seeks to ensure that there is a high level of business confidence in the benefit assumptions and estimates. Both the quantum and realisation timeframes will be tested, informed by the detailed design, legislative and process changes that will be introduced for Child Support in the programme’s final release in October 2021. Stage 4 benefits and accountability for their realisation will be confirmed by September/October 2021 and reported to the Portfolio Governance Committee and the Strategic Governance Board (for approval). This report-back will include a progress update against all benefit areas (financial and non-financial). The timeframe for report-back will enable the validated Stage 4 benefit estimates to inform the September sustainability update, the October Baseline Update and the 2021 Programme Business Case addendum. Page 31 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 5 BT Programme Cost Management The objective of these guidelines is to provide a consistent approach to the accommodation of costs incurred by the BT Programme and those incurred by business units in support of the BT Programme. 5.1 BT Programme Costs As per Inland Revenues standard project charging model, the BT Programme covers direct costs incurred by business units in support of programme deliverables, this includes: Internal resource costs – all staff that are formally assigned or seconded to BT via the BT Sourcing and Onboarding (SOF) approval process are to charge time to the programme using the IR time recording system. This includes permanent staff, fixed term hires, independent consultants, and temporary staff engaged directly by the BT Programme. External Professional Service costs – the costs of all Contractors/consultant firms engaged directly by the BT Programme. Programme Occupancy costs – standard IR fixed overhead charges recognising the costs incurred by Facilities management (rental, site support, cleaning) and TS&O (IR desktop & telephony access) to accommodate the BT Programme team. The monthly charge is based on the number of FTE’s assigned to the programme each month; this includes contractors and consultants who are in an IR site. Travel and accommodation – costs incurred directly in the execution of BT Programme deliverables, this includes the travel cost for IR SMEs or testers who are working for the programme. Training and development – costs associated with equipping staff that are directly affected by BT, including training on new and/or changed business processes, and training on new and/or changes to the enabling technology will be absorbed by the BT Programme. This will include the following: • Advanced subject matter and business skill training – training and development associated with advanced concepts required for impacted roles, for example root cause analysis, continuous improvement, analytics, negotiation skills, and influencing skills • Changes to business processes – including training on all changes to business processes affected by BT • Training in new enabling tools – including training in the selected COTS, \[INFORMATION REDACTED\], or any other new tools deployed as part of BT. Other expenses – costs incurred directly in the execution of Programme deliverables, examples include conference hall hire and catering for BT Programme events. Hardware and software – applications and hardware required to meet programme deliverables including physical and virtual server costs and programme management tools. Excludes ‘as a service cost. Warranty periods – costs incurred to accommodate 90 days warranty and Early Life Support after a Release Go-Live. Production Support – team to support START environment for past releases will remain in Programme until 2021. Page 32 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 5.2 Costs to be accommodated by IR Business Units Business Units cover the following indirect costs: Indirect Resource costs – business units will not recover the costs of staff who are not directly assigned or seconded to the BT Programme, this includes staff who are: • Involved in requirements gathering, user testing, governance or document review/approval (this includes the attendance at governance meetings, design councils, BOF meetings, CRP’s, workshops, or approval of BT design documents, or blueprints. Ongoing support costs - ongoing licence or maintenance charges initiated by BT workstreams will be transitioned to IR business units immediately. Training and Development – cost of professional development including: • Basic Literacy and Numeracy - Training and development associated with addressing basic literacy and numeracy, including basic computer literacy training • Foundation Skills - Training and development with foundation subject matter expertise, e.g., training associated with the fundamentals of service delivery management, where such training would be required regardless of whether BT were to proceed. Tools or software – costs of providing access to business units to tools or software that BT Programme has procured for use on the programme. 5.3 Baseline Cost Profile The Baseline is the approved fiscal envelope (budget) for BT to deliver transformational change. The budget for each Baseline, typically covering a 12-month period, is determined through a bottom-up process. It consists of the cost of the effort including other non- personnel related costs required to deliver the agreed scope of work for the specific period that each Baseline covers. The final baseline for the Programme that covers all of Stage 4 is Baseline 9 which is from 1 July 2020 to 30 June 2022 (a two-y ear period). 5.4 Programme Delegations To ensure the appropriate decisions and approvals are provided within the Programme, Business Transformation adheres to strict guidelines in relation to financial delegations and other IR policy. Further detail on the Business Transformation delegated authorities can be found in the PMP Appendices. Page 33 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 6 Programme Delivery Methodology and Management Approach 6.1 Business Transformation Methodology (BTM) To effectively manage the BT Programme, a Business Transformation Methodology (BTM) was developed. The methodology is a combined programme and project methodology that is tailored to meet the needs of each stage, release and initiative. The methodology aligns with recognised programme methodologies such as Managing Successful Programmes (MSP) and reflects the Treasury’s Better Business Case guidance. It also meets the criteria set for programme methodologies by Central Monitoring Agencies. The methodology has been developed in accordance with the following principles: One BTM • The BTM will apply to the programme, release and work package levels. • The methodology will be tailored to meet the needs of each specific stage, release and initiative work package, including the requirements for non-technical initiatives. • Any tailoring will be discussed and refined in consultation with partners before any variations are made. • For the Solution Delivery Phase, BTM will be complemented by \[Information redacted\]. • Detailed activities will be delivered using the approach and templates as outlined in ADM. Aligning to Managing Successful Programmes (MSP) • This methodology has been refined to align with MSP and the Treasury’s Better Business Case guidance. Drawing on existing IR Methodologies • Where the BTM can draw on existing IR products and processes, these will be used as a starting point, with amendments made where required supporting transformation. • Alignment between existing IR methodologies and the BTM has been achieved by aligning tools, templates and language where possible. All aspects of the programme and its sub-programmes will follow the BTM unless specifically agreed. Maintaining Agility • To complement the BTM, a more agile approach has been developed to support the Programme where appropriate and beneficial. A more agile methodology will help IR to deliver initiatives more quickly by increasing the frequency of delivery and IR’s ability to adapt to customer requirements. • Refer to the Business Transformation Methodology for further information on the Business Transformation Agile methodology. The development of the methodology included stakeholders and practitioners from the wider Change Group and compared a programme-level, transformation methodology with existing frameworks for the Change Initiative Lifecycle (CIL), System Development Lifecycle (SDLC) and Project Management Framework (PMF). The BTM has been amended to reflect aspects of these frameworks, including emphasis on the customer voice in Design, alignment with the Better Business Case process and adoption of relevant templates where they already existed within the business. Page 34 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 6.2 BT Programme Prioritisation Principles 2018 to 2021 The BT Release and Transition Plan sets out the delivery releases that will, when fully delivered in 2021, achieve the benefits laid out in the business case. As the programme delivery cycles progress there is a need to group then prioritise new and existing initiatives in a way that enables the programme to manage the planned releases within a major release window given the various contentions that will arise including resources and technology environments. Problem Statement • Large-scale time-based release cycles require a specified delivery scope that can be achieved in the agreed timeframe and aligned to a pre-determined go live date. Headroom should be planned to allow for changes to be accommodated during a major release cycle. • Scope orchestration needs to consider the best use of resources, balancing resource contentions and aligned to achieving the programme outcomes and benefits as quickly as possible. • IR needs to accelerate change where practical which means that non-START releases must be able to deliver in release windows that do not impact the major releases (will need to “shoot the gap”). This includes significant enhancement to customer experience and the delivery of digital services. • Between major START releases IR will leverage the delivered solutions to achieve our customer, digital and intelligence lead vision. Key Objectives & Success Criteria for 2018 and 2019: Priority Objectives: • Safely move the in-scope tax and social policy products from FIRST to START. Products will be implemented in START in a way that enables future policy and product agility • Working for Families recipients must have no disruptions to entitlements including being paid on time for the correct assessment amount as per the Feb 2019 roll over process • Most customers will use new MyIR instead of existing MyIR. New MyIR must be fit for purpose and offer the same or better service for individuals and smaller tax agents • Tax Agents must be able to close out the 2017 to 2018 tax year without disruption • E file users will still require this service and it must work in the same way as it does today • Customers with an income tax filing date of 7 July 2019 must be able to do all required activities in START in a timely manner without disruption • Payday reporting is compulsory from April 2019, all customers required to file on a payday basis must be able to do so by 1 April 2019. Electronic submission is compulsory for Payday reporting employers. • The CCS-I, CCS-B and IIS organisation units will be operational and embedding Key Objectives & Success Criteria for 2020 and 2021: Priority Objectives: • Safely move all the remaining in scope tax and social policy products from FIRST to START. • All products and services to be decommissioned in FIRST by July 2021 and the resulting systems and infrastructure closed. • Payday reporting is fully implemented and has completed a full business units. • There is no year-end square up required for employers from that point on. • Investment income reporting changes are implemented in 2020 enabling the straight through processing of investment income information for the 2021 income year. Page 35 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] • Most salary & wage earners and beneficiaries will be straight through processed based on tolerances from 2020 and increasingly from 2021. • All additional information required to complete the tax processing for more complex customers must be enabled through any channel that meets customer needs. • Working for families will be increasingly automated when new policy is approved and implemented this will enable the right amount to be paid without requiring a year end square up process. • The CCS-I, CCS-B and IIS organisation units will be fully operational and effective. • IRs policy and corporate services will be implementing new organisation designs. • Intelligence capability is fully enabled allowing IR to assess and deliver customer services to meet customer needs and to target campaigns appropriately. • Online services are fully available in multi device formats, with easily actioned summary views of information with easy access (barriers to access must be low). • All returns that do not require any additional information are pre-populated by the 2021 income year and straight through processed, information is enabled on multi devices 6.3 BT Scope and Design BT Scope is defined by PRODUCT, delivered using a PRODUCT based approach, requiring business functions, processes & technology to be transitioned safely, PRODUCT by PRODUCT to the new application platform. 6.3.1 Preparation Preparation for the major START Release includes completing a Product Strategy and Roadmap for each of the products being transitioned to START, F inancial estimates are updated providing a fresh view of the programme out year costs. Business profiles provide a view of the current state. Product strategies provide a view of the vision and desired outcomes, with the product roadmaps capturing the delivery of continuing, new, and emerging requirements, including policy, and delivering legislation. Business blueprints provide a view of the future state Cost to benefit analysis provides the must do, should do, could do view of scope. Collectively these documents and business artefacts inform the baseline scoping exercise. 6.3.2 Scope and Planning High level business requirements are gathered from the business profiles, product strategies, business roadmap documentation and the business blueprints. P roduct strategy overviews inform the outcomes for our Customers, Partners, the Government, and IR, using themes, guiding principles and desired features to form a view of scope. Work, opportunities, strategic and core business requirements, pain points and ideas are gathered into a backlog, the backlog is reviewed using a hypothesis statement, refined understanding, scaled assessment of benefit vs cost, detailed understanding of expected outcomes followed by review, prioritisation, orchestration, validation and finally approval from business and programme governance to form the baseline scope. 6.3.3 Definition / Design The Design Phase for each Release is split into two sub-phases: • High Level Design, and • Detailed Design. Page 36 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] During each subsequent phase of the programme, the High-Level Design will be validated, required updates will be made and the detailed designs developed for that release of work. Product designs (target business profiles), versioned by release, are developed, providing a time boxed release specific view of the c urrent state. These designs present the high-level solution target state, Big Rock’s (design decisions, policy items, external integration definition), k ey items, a pproved characteristics, features, and functions targeted for change. The design captures the current issues and business pain points and identifies opportunities. At the end of the Release there is an activity to update to reflect the “as built” or the “new current state” Product Designs are used to develop the Solution Designs per jellybean or Business Function De finitions (BFD’s). BFD’s are release specific detailed solution requirements, p oint in time definitions, mapped to level 3 processes and contain; Business Rules, Coexistence approach, Customer Impact, Channel Impact, Key Business Process Considerations, Organisation Impact, Technical Integration, Service Area: Assumptions, Definition, Actors, Preconditions, Metrics, Triggers, Conditions, Systems, Correspondence, Content and Reports, etc. The B FD d efines the business function scope which informs Test Scenarios & Change Plan, further key Delivery phase artefacts. \[Information redacted\] Figure 16: Scope to Design Process 6.3.4 Enhancing the Design Approach To ensure optimal solution delivery, aligned to customer and business outcomes, delivering strategic objectives, f ocus areas include ensuring that: • Customers are closer to the design and included earlier in the design process • The design for each Release is aligned to achieving the transformational outcomes and benefits set out in the Business Blueprints and Product Designs • The right people are involved in design decision making at the right time • A mechanism and process are in place to capture design decisions, and escalate promptly at the right time based on risk 6.3.5 Applying the learnings Customer and Digital Design (CX, DX) • Develop an integrated end-to-end customer & digital experience design across all channels to compliment the FAST Implementation Methodology. IR’s Channel Strategy and Customer Blueprint are key inputs. • Design to align to Customers preferred channels & contact points. Customer research, journey maps and voice of the customer outputs are an input to the design of inbound and outbound customer contact points. • Future design of customer interactions will be part of the integrated customer design regardless of the form or substance of that interaction (e.g. forms, letters, web content, emails, text messaging, IVR, click to chat). Business Architecture and Design • Ensure that the right people are involved in the Definition and Design working sessions that includes an appropriate representation especially in the CX, DX design area. Page 37 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] • Everyone involved in definition and design to be fully versed in the Business Blueprints and the transformational objectives of those blueprints. Blueprints will be updated to show transitional states (by major release). • Ensure that everyone involved in the design process has a pre-requisite knowledge of customers and the customers’ scenarios of use that they are designing to. That’s both internal and external customers. This will be achieved via design immersion sessions at the commencement of definition and design and at key points during. • Design decisions are currently logged during the definition sessions in addition decision review points will be scheduled regularly and be highly visible including weekly design review and design review workshops. Escalation criteria will be clear – propose that the Business Blueprints and the customer scenarios of use be the basis for setting design parameters. 6.4 \[Information redacted\] BTM is complemented by the supplier delivery methods and implementation methodology 6.4.1 \[Information redacted\] 6.4.2 \[Information redacted\] 6.5 Programme Management Approach The Programme’s BTM incorporates core programme management approaches that are used to successfully execute the Programme. These are fully aligned with the MSP Framework. Programme management approaches are applied consistently across all phases of the programme. 6.5.1 Overview Below is an overview of the key aspects of BT’s programme management approach. These approaches are discussed in more detail throughout the document. 6.5.1.1 Planning and Control • There is visibility and accountability for schedule, cost, quality and benefit targets through periodic status reporting and communication to stakeholders. • The programme places an emphasis on the management of project scope through setting agreed baselines at the outset of the Programme and managing deviations through a formal review and approval process. • Deliverable based management has been adopted, involving clearly defined deliverable structure/content, defined review and approval procedures and deliverable based progress tracking. • The Programme follows organisational financial policies and procedures, which are maintained by Performance, Finance and Facilities. These can be found on the Planning and Finance page on the intranet. 6.5.1.2 Finance and Budget Management • In November 2015 the Programme secured a funding envelope for all four stages from Cabinet, including a contingency. • The Strategic Governance Board approved the baseline scope of Stage 4 – the final stage – of the Programme and the funding for this stage in July 2020. • Budgets are allocated by work-stream with an overall contingency held at the Programme level. • Programme leads are accountable for managing within their work-stream budget. Any forecast deviations are managed through a formal review and approval process. Page 38 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] • Budgeting & Forecasting support and financial advice is provided by the Portfolio finance team. • The Programme provides a comprehensive report to the Portfolio Governance Committee each month on the overall financial position. This includes analysis of actual results and forecast outturn for the budget period. Financial Risks and opportunities outside of Forecast as also analysed. • Formal review and escalation approval are required by the appropriate governance board to access internal contingency. 6.5.1.3 Risk and Issue Management • The Programme has established risk and issue management practices to ensure that risks and issues : o are identified, analysed, monitored/controlled and managed on a regular basis o information is reported, prioritised and escalated by all workstreams within the Programme and as appropriate to the Programme’s governing bodies in a timely manner. • The Programme has adopted and applied the IR Enterprise Risk Management Policy and Framework (ERMP/F), which includes the Risk Management Process as described by ISO 31000:20009 a nd ISO Guide 73:2009 to identify, assess, mitigate, monitor and report on risks. • All risks and issues of the Programme captured and managed in JIRA. 6.5.1.4 Quality Management • Quality management frameworks and processes are in place to provide a considered and consistent approach to managing the quality of delivery within the programme and to reduce risk. • The Programme has an Assurance Management Plan, which includes the key independent external quality assurance reviews to be undertaken. The Assurance Management Plan is updated regularly. 6.5.1.5 Communications and Stakeholder Management • Messaging is consistent inside and outside of the Programme. • Risks that might otherwise delay or derail the Programme are identified and mitigated through effective communications strategies and stakeholder management. • Positive outcomes are achieved by effectively building stakeholder relationships, with the ability to influence outcomes. 6.5.1.6 Organisational Change Management • BT impacts and changes are understood and validated by relevant Business Groups. • IR’s readiness for change is understood and change strategies developed to manage, mitigate, and address change impacts, issues and risks. • The implementation of solutions and the realisation of benefits are supported by effective change management strategies. • Appropriate organisational structures and resources are in place to effectively support change. 6.6 General Implementation Approaches The Programme maintains a set of general approaches in key delivery areas to ensure consistent application throughout Business Transformation. \[Information redacted\] Page 39 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Figure 19: Design to Test Process 6.6.1 Data Cleansing, Conversion and Migration Approach The primary goal of the data conversion and cleansing approach is to deliver the data conversion and necessary data cleansing activities required to successfully deliver Stage 4 and enable the realisation of benefits from the Business Transformation Programme. 6.6.1.1 Inventory Data Resources Identify and inventory all possible FIRST data sources and other product specific sources. Other conversion activities typically cannot be started until this inventory has been created. The inventory will define the scope of agency data that is available for conversion. 6.6.1.2 Creating the inventory In addition to identifying sources of data for potential conversion, information useful for further actions should be collected. This information will include but will not be limited to: • Types of information such registration or financial information • Inland Revenue personnel such as subject matter experts with expertise regarding specific data • Technology and platforms used for data storage. This task will be done for each release. 6.6.1.3 Reviewing the inventory for integrity and quality Once the inventory has been created and other conversion activities can continue, each data source should be examined for integrity and the quality of its data. This process should seek to determine if the data in the resource is a master data source and is consistent, reliable, and complete. This process will require the conversion team to be granted access to the resources inventoried. If granting access requires a protracted process and an extended amount of time, then it may be necessary to include others in the conversion team who currently have access. 6.6.1.4 Conversion Process The standard START conversion process entails • Obtaining data extracts from the source systems. • Translation of data extracted from source systems to be loaded into START. • Data loads into START via business objects tailored for Inland Revenue business needs. • Reconciliation of data converted to START. • User verification and testing of data when it arrives in START. • Data purification in the source system. Page 40 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Figure 20: Data conversion process for START 6.6.1.5 User verification While computer-based reconciliation of data extracted and loaded into START is necessary, it is insufficient to verify an accurate conversion. During user verification of converted data, knowledgeable users will view converted data in START and compare it to how it appears and is used in the source systems. This stage will greatly increase the confidence in the conversion process and can identify, for instance, incidents of data elements being converted into the wrong field on a return. As users identify issues with the converted data those issues will be logged and triaged and may lead to changes in the conversion plan. It is typical to find issues that will lead to changes in: • Data purification • Training and START Help • START development. 6.6.1.6 Mock Conversion Runs NOTE: This section addresses mock conversion runs not Mock Go-Lives. Mock conversion runs occur more frequently and earlier than Mock Go-Lives (MGLs). Because the conversion process will be a one-time use, it must be tested and trusted. To provide that high degree of trust a series of iterative mock conversions will be completed. A mock conversion, sometimes referred to as a mock run or dry run, will test the conversion process by performing the same steps as will occur during the final live conversion. Mock conversions will include extraction, translation, conversion, reconciliation, and user verification. Mock conversion runs will be executed iteratively and start as partial mock conversion runs and slowly ramp up to full mock conversion runs. A partial mock conversion run lacks either some type of data to be converted or uses limited selection criteria. A full mock conversion run contains all types of data and all data available. Successive mock conversion runs will increase the breadth and/or depth of data in “step” fashion as START configuration for each step becomes more advanced. For example, some steps will include: • Customer level data • Customer and Account level data • Customer, Accounts, and Period level data • Customer, Accounts, Period, and Collection data. Page 41 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] It is important that mock conversion runs use, as close as possible, the actual steps, data, infrastructure, and users that will be involved in the final conversion. This will confirm that the conversion process is accurate, complete, and efficient. Mock conversion runs will verify the following: • The steps in the conversion process are correct and in the proper order • Data is being converted correctly • Assumptions regarding data volumes • The timing of conversion events including but not limited to: • Length of time required for the final full conversion is run • Pre-conversion and post conversion batch jobs in START • Prioritisation and sequencing of reconciliation tasks. • The adequate allocation of hardware resources for conversion. 6.6.2 Testing Approach The approach and procedures for all phases of testing within the Programme is described in the Test Strategy and Plan. Below is a summary of key objectives and test phases for the Programme. BT Programme testing will consist of the following test phases: 6.6.2.1 Functional Testing • Unit/Verification Testing to ensure that field, screen, individual component and modules within each system perform according to the detailed design before promoting the change to the subsequent phases of testing. For START the verification component is where business users are engaged in development iterations. • System Testing or Business System Testing (BST) to ensure that the functional modules and workflow components of the applications perform together according to the test scenarios. Business System Testing includes regression testing of impacted applications or business process. Testing with Converted Data is included inside the BST test phase where applicable. Assembly testing of the interaction of code in is also included in this test phase where applicable. • Integration Testing is where testing is undertaken in a fully integrated domain in a manner like the context of use in the business environment. Integration testing is carried out during business system testing. The scope of testing will be scenario centric aligning to the integrated design across multiple systems. Integration Testing includes regression testing in the integrated context. • Scaled Business Simulation (SBS) Testing covers testing of the conversion, launch sequence and subsequent business processing following launch. The testing is equivalent to an “end-to-end integration test” in a full-scale environment. The testing includes simulated business activity using manual and automated methods. The testing will “time-travel” to significant business events such as GST filing dates to validate the business processing of those events. SBS may include end- to-end testing contexts as part of the SBS scenarios, however testing of integration points will have been completed during business systems test. • Customer Interaction Testing (CIT) will be undertaken to ensure that the user experience is not negatively impacted by the programme. • User Acceptance Testing will be conducted by end users to confirm that the application and associated business processes will fulfil the business requirements. Where business have been engaged in testing earlier phases, it is expected that this phase will reconcile any earlier testing and feed UAT scope into those phases. UAT for the START solution will be integrated as part of BST and SBS and not run as a separate test phase. Page 42 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] • Final Regression Testing will be conducted on a controlled launch configuration, this testing ensures the final launch configuration is stable and complete. The testing conducted is a selection of Business System Test and Integration Test scenarios. • Functional Security Testing ensures that only authorised users have access to features of a system, and that the users have access to the functionality they need to perform their assigned duties and no more. This testing includes testing user access delegation functions. User access rights creation, updates and deletion will also be tested. • Conversion Verification is the visual inspection of data that has been extracted from the heritage systems and converted into START. START conversion team extracts a new set of data to be verified at weekly intervals and provide checklists that conversion verifiers use to perform the verification in START Verification environment. Progress is reported to Data Owners Forum (DOF). 6.6.2.2 Non-Functional Testing/Technical Testing • Infrastructure Testing covers the non-functional of the production and non- production infrastructure. Infrastructure Testing includes Environment Provisioning, high availability, networking, monitoring, security and backup/restore. Applies to the BT Tech Arch Delivery Programme. Environment Provisioning Testing is a construct of Infrastructure Testing. • Performance Testing will be conducted to verify performance requirements have been achieved. The response times, transaction rates and other time-sensitive requirements of the solution will be measured and evaluated to identify performance tuning opportunities. Testing may extend to other non-functional aspects such as high availability or monitoring. Performance testing will be managed at scale by the technical testing capability. • Security Testing will be performed by an Inland Revenue security service provider and the delivery service providers, the purpose of security testing is to verify that the delivered solution conforms to the Inland Revenue and government minimum security standards (such as NZISM) and addresses the risk identified within the Information Security Risk Assessment through the implementation of the identified controls. Security testing includes both functional testing and compliance testing leading to the Certification and Accreditation of the BT systems as fit for deployment in production. • Disaster Recovery will be conducted to validate that disaster recovery plan can be executed. • Operational Readiness to validate the deployment and operational tasks. This includes testing of operational functions such as Database backup, Database recovery, Software Installation and Configuration, Rollback, Failover, Supportability, Reliability, and Maintainability. Phase entry and exit criteria allows for test phase overlaps within the bounds of the criteria. Entry Criteria provide the basis for controlling the entry of code into the test environment for test execution. This formal process helps to ensure the appropriate level of quality is achieved to commence testing. There is an intentional move away from the traditional approach of a full completion of a test phase before entry into the next phase, the approach allows for concurrency using criteria that measures working software at a functional level. Entry Criteria is measured by way of Test Readiness Assessment. Exit Criteria are used to ensure that functionality does not exit a test phase until an appropriate level of quality has been achieved. For further information on the approach to testing within BT please read the Stage 4 Stream 1 - Release 2 - Test Approach.pptx and the D3083 Test Patterns and Standards. Page 43 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 6.6.3 Organisational Change Management Approach Effective Organisation Change Management is essential across all stages of the Programme. In accordance with the Business Transformation Methodology, Change Management discipline forms a core part of the approach. Our Change Management approach and methodology continues to evolve applying lessons learnt from previous stages and aligning to the programme operating model. 6.6.3.1 Organisation Impact Assessments and Change Management Each stage and release will have dedicated impact assessments to identify and manage impacts to IR and customers as we traverse the four stages of transformation. Due to the agile nature of the FAST Implementation Methodology and BT Operating Model, identification and planning for these impacts will be iterative as design and solution decisions are made progressively. Our impact assessments and change management plans continue to be the cornerstones of our approach. Specifically: • Understand the change impacts to tax, social policy, processes, platforms and people and validate with relevant Business Groups • Understand IR’s readiness for change and develop and implement business unit and initiative plans to manage, mitigate and address change impacts, issues and risks • Support the implementation of solutions and the realisation of benefits with effective change management strategy and plans • Put in place appropriate resources and methodologies to effectively support change. Stage 4 Workstream 1 (START Delivery) includes safely moving paid parental leave, unclaimed monies, duties and foreign trusts into START in February 2021, followed by child support and upgrading START and myIR to V12 in October 2021. All core tax and social policy products and services will be in START enabling the decommission of FIRST. There will be no co-existence. For example, this high level heatmap provides an early indicative view (as at June 2020) of the organisation impacts based on proposed Stage 4 START Delivery (Core Completion) scope. Figure 21: Stage 4 START Delivery (Core Completion) indicative organisation impacts Page 44 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Stage 4 Workstream 2 (Technology Optimisation & Decommissioning) also includes the decommissioning of all non–enduring (heritage) services, systems and applications including FIRST and all satellite processes and functions, Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) and moving \[INFORMATION REDACTED\]. Data will also be tagged for retention, archiving or disposal in line with legislative requirements as set out in IR’s Data Disposal Authorities. Workstream 2 will ensure IR will have a simplified and stable set of services and infrastructure post-BT. 6.6.3.2 Training and User Support The approach to training and user support has been developed and refined each release taking on board lessons learned and adapting to business requirements. The Programme’s Training and Organisational Change Management approach consists of comprehensive yet pragmatic strategies that aim to: • Accelerate acceptance and adoption of the new systems and processes using proven adult learning methods • Maximise the business benefits expected from the solution • Minimise disruption to business operations and/or lost productivity during execution. 6.6.3.3 Customer Impact Assessments and Change Management During the Solution Design and Delivery phases of each stage, the impacts of changing policy, solutions and deployment activities on all affected customers will also be assessed, and clear mitigation and engagement plans established to ensure that such impacts are well understood, effectively communicated, and effectively mitigated. Specifically: • Identify the customer impacts and changes brought about by the business transformation changes, and validate these with relevant Customer Groups and External Parties • Test and understand the Customer and External Parties’ readiness for change and develop and implement plans to understand and facilitate customer willingness, confidence, and ability to accept change. This high-level heat-map provides an early indicative view (as at June 2020) of the customer impacts based on Stage 4 START Delivery (Core Completion) scope. Page 45 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Figure 22: Stage 4 START Delivery (Core Completion) indicative impacts on customers. Page 46 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 6.6.4 Programme Readiness Assessment The evaluation of programme delivery in accordance with the BTM will be provided through the following mechanisms: • Independent Quality Assurance (IQA) and programme health checks (refer Assurance Management Plan. • Oversight of the programme by the SRO and governance groups • Management and oversight from the DC Transformation and PLT Leaders and • Programme Readiness Checkpoints • Evaluation of programme progress against the programme schedule will be assessed using the following tools: o weekly updates to Schedule Performance. o weekly updates to the High-Level Timeline by each PLT and workstream lead. o fortnightly/monthly RAG status reporting against the 10 Keys for Success at a workstream and programme-level against agreed criteria. 6.6.4.1 Readiness Framework Quality Control The Readiness Framework outlines the approach, content and review cadence used to assess release readiness at key checkpoints leading up to and during deployment. The framework enables the Release to complete the assessment against agreed criteria and recommend approval to move from one stage of the deployment lifecycle to the next. These criteria (or questions) are specific to a checkpoint and collectively reflect the readiness of our Customers, Service Providers, Business Units, and the Release Delivery team. The Readiness Framework enables the release to assess quality, progress, and readiness to move from one stage of the deployment lifecycle to the next. • Checkpoint 0: “Aligned” • Checkpoint 1: “Aware/Understand” • Checkpoint 2: “On Track” • Checkpoint 3: “Ready” • Checkpoint 4: “Approve” • Checkpoint 5: “Check” • Checkpoint 6: “Exit” There will be an agreed checkpoint timeline and additional checkpoints will be included as required to provide both assessment and certainty for decision makers. Refer example below. Figure 23: BT Readiness Framework Page 47 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 7 Programme Structure The high-level current structure for the BT Programme can be viewed below. \[Information redacted\] Figure 24: Business Transformation Organisational Structure Page 48 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 8 Stakeholder Management 8.1 Managing our Communications and Stakeholders IR recognises that effective communication and stakeholder engagement is critical for achieving organisational change and delivering customer benefits. Business Transformation represents a significant cultural shift for IR and has significant customer impacts, hence the requirement for delivery of consistent, unified messages to stakeholders as part of the organisational change journey. The importance of effective communications and stakeholder management across all stages is reflected in the Business Transformation Methodology and the following objectives are set out within the methodology for effective communications and stakeholder management: • Ensure consistency of messaging within the Programme, within the organisation and to stakeholders outside the organisation • Support the effective mitigation of risks and management of issues which may otherwise delay or potentially derail the Programme • Achieve influence and positive outcomes through effective management of relationships directly and by providing collateral and appropriate support for the account management and relationship management teams • Ensure internal and external change management activities are supported by robust communications strategies and plans. The below diagram shows how the activities are layered: Figure 25: High-level overview of the Business Transformation communications plan Page 49 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 8.2 Customers For IR’s Business Transformation to be effective we need to actively manage a variety of different customer segments including: • Customers (both individual and businesses of all sizes) • Service Providers who offer support to our customers to fulfil their obligations (such as tax agents, payroll providers and software developers) • the wider Government sector (both as an enabler and influencer) • Suppliers and Partners whose products we can leverage to support IR ‘s goals and obligations. Figure 26: Customer segments 8.3 Account Management Approach The BT Account Management team is the primary conduit for managing external customer and stakeholder relationships in Business Transformation to ensure delivery of IR’s Business Transformation programme objectives. This is achieved by establishing and maintaining successful engagements with customers (and/or their advocacy groups) who are impacted by IR’s transformation and by providing a channel for their feedback directly to the programme. Account Management: • through successful engagement, understand our customers future plans and requirements, assist their understanding and engagement with IR’s transformation objectives and explore how they will be impacted • engage, advise and support customers when BT changes impact them • use their deep understanding of the customer to ensure the customer voice is heard when design/solutions are being considered • provide feedback within BT on customer’s issues and concerns with change driven by BT • work alongside our customers and the programme teams to stay on track to deliver the outcomes we have agreed Page 50 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] • work alongside teams within BT and across the business to support customers impacted by BT changes and to make sure the right transformation messages are shared across all customer segments. BT Account Management work very closely with the business (Community Compliance Officers and Account Managers, Business Lifecycle Managers, External Relationships unit and other business units within IR) and within the BT Programme with the Communications and Marketing teams. BT Account Managers work alongside these existing teams to make sure: • operational teams have the right transformation messages to share with customers • impacted customers are clear about the operational vs. transformational roles • provide support across the business. For each release of the BT Programme, Account Management Strategies for each customer segments have been produced, these point-in-time views are further refined in subsequent iterations of the strategy document. The most recent Account Management Strategy is available on the BT SharePoint site. Page 51 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 9 Programme Reporting 9.1 The 10 Keys to Success - Management Approach With respect to effective planning and control of the programme, the “10 Keys” programme management framework is employed, focusing on providing proactive and transparent planning, baselining and status reporting. This framework ensures: • early indication of the Programme’s health • timely information, insights and inputs to adjust plans and behaviours. Milestones/ Deliverables/Plan Risks Scope ResourcesStakeholders Issues Delivery Partnerships Interdependencies Benefits Financials 10 Keys to Success Figure 27: Business Transformation 10 Keys to Success for Reporting The following 10 Keys to Success are considered and reported on throughout the life the programme: 1. Confirm stakeholders are committed This key is aimed at identifying, evaluating, informing, influencing and maintaining support by individuals and groups affected by or influencing the Programme. 2. Ensure the Programme scope is manageable This key is aimed at agreeing, managing and modifying, as required, the scope of work needed to be delivered to accomplish the investment objectives. 3. Plan so work, and schedule are predictable This key is focused on controlling the production and acceptance of programme services/deliverables and ensuring delivery is compliant with acceptance criteria and Delegated Authorities. A high emphasis is placed on the programme plan and ensuring that this is realistic and documents the major milestones and deliverables for all phases. 4. Ensure cost is managed and on track This key is aimed at maintaining an up to date programme forecast as well as measuring, managing and reporting actual costs in relation to the approved budget. 5. Mobilising and directing high performance teams This key is aimed at identifying, recruiting, mobilising, structuring, leading and motivating the people necessary for successful completion. Page 52 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 6. Mitigate risks This key is focused on risk identification, evaluation and development of avoidance, mitigation and other activities to effectively manage these and minimise impacts on the programme. 7. Mitigate issues This key is focused on issue identification, evaluation and development of avoidance, mitigation and other activities to effectively manage these and minimise impacts on the programme. 8. Support mutually beneficial partnerships This key is aimed at establishing and managing meaningful and effective relationships with key delivery partners, based on sound contracts and contract management processes. 9. Realise benefits This key is focused on estimating, measuring, monitoring and realising benefits to the Crown, customers and IR to be enabled by the Programme. 10. Coordinate Dependent Projects This key is aimed at identifying, planning, coordinating and controlling all projects which have a high level of dependence within and outside the Programme. 9.1.1 RAG Status Guidelines The Programme follows the BT Workstream Reporting Guidelines on the use of Red Amber Green (RAG) status when reporting progress and status at workstream and programme- level. This includes how the programme reports to key stakeholders such as the Portfolio Governance Committee (PGC), Central Agencies and Ministers. 9.2 Monthly PGC Dashboards The PGC dashboard presents a monthly programme level report providing: • overall Red Amber Green (RAG) status and schedule performance for BT • key messages to the PGC (opportunities, escalations, special notes, required decisions, requests for direction, etc.) • go -to-green plans for areas requiring remedial action to get back on track or trending to exception (Amber status or worse) • programme-level (PLT and PGC) level risks and /or issues under escalation management • a rolling eight-week window of key activities/dates to provide an inform to the PGC of the future focus of the programme. 9.3 Stage Delivery Leads Meeting The BT Weekly Watch JIRA Kanban board is used for reporting to the Stage Delivery Leads meeting. This provides three swim lanes of information for day to day action/monitoring and weekly review. • Swimlane 1: E scalated items requiring special attention and rapid decision making or active monitoring • Swimlane 2: Issues, Risks, Dependencies, Programme Change Requests PCR’s) and Deliverables that have been escalated to the PLT or PGC that are at either very high or extreme severity rating, or that have not progressed adequately. • Swimlane 3: Any unresolved Risks or Issues at PLT or PGC escalation. 9.4 Workstream Reports Workstream reports are prepared either monthly (support teams) or fortnightly (delivery teams) providing overall Red Amber Green (RAG) status and schedule performance for the Page 53 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] period, together with commentary against the keys, explaining movement, with reference to those in or trending towards exception (Light Amber or worse). Where the overall status is in or trending towards exception, go-to–green plans are provided including the impact these will have on the schedule, their status, required resources, risk and a measure of confidence in the plan’s success. These are particularly important as they may be replicated into the programme dashboard as relevant. Lastly the report includes a rolling eight-week window of key activities, dates and deliverables due (set out in the Master Deliverables List and integrated programme schedule) with RAG and completion status commentary. A section is available within the report for any escalations, special notes and/or required decisions. Workstream classification (support or delivery) can be found within the PMO reporting flow diagram. 9.5 Portfolio Governance Committee (PGC) and Central Monitoring Agencies Reports Reports are completed for the PGC on a monthly basis and provided to Central Agencies bi - monthly. An extended detailed version of the PGC dashboard, focussed on the 10 keys and including workstream reports, is then provided to Central Monitoring Agencies and used as a discussion point at regular monitoring meetings. Central Monitoring Agencies also receive the monthly progress report to Joint Ministers and the latest copy of the monthly PGC Risks and Issues. 9.6 Transformation Updates Inland Revenue has been directed to provide updates on transformation to Cabinet by July and December each year. The updates are the principal vehicle for reporting on Inland Revenue’s progress in realising benefits. Once considered, these six monthly Cabinet updates are published on Inland Revenue’s website. 9.7 BT Monthly Status Report for Joint Ministers This report provides an overview of Programme progress monthly. The report provides Joint Ministers with an updated on the following areas: • progress against the plan • the current Phase of work • highlights and challenges. For further information on reporting, please refer to the BT Reporting SharePoint site. Page 54 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 10 Schedule Management Schedule management is critical to managing delivery across the workstreams within the Programme. It is the aim of the following schedule management process to establish a clear and defined scheduling process for monitoring key milestones and deliverables across the Programme. Specifically, the process aims to: • prepare all schedules in the same format with appropriate interdependencies, linkages and logic • accurately report schedule information to all relevant stakeholders • ensure schedules aid the delivery of Executive-level reports and Business Transformation Programme direction to the Management Team • minimise the requirements for manual entry to management reporting on a weekly basis • ensure activities and deliverables drive the related dependencies throughout the Business Transformation Programme, and • anticipate, discover and report any milestone changes due to schedule movement from the baseline in a timely manner. • present the critical path. 10.1 Programme Plan The Integrated Programme Plan provides a Programme-wide timeline including key activities, deliverables, milestones and dependencies. It is updated weekly based on: • updates to the workstream schedules • updates in the workstream status reports • agreed changes via appropriate channels. 10.2 Integrated Schedule The integrated schedule is a rolled-up view of the workstream schedules from level 2 to level 5 and will be used to inform the high-level programme plan. Integrated schedule and workstream relationship: Figure 28: BT Programme Integrated Schedule Page 55 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 10.3 Key Activities To plan, track, manage and achieve the baseline Release schedule it is important to identify and schedule the key Release activities and milestones and identify the Release critical path.

This measure is taken based on the percent complete for a task. When creating a plan, the following information must be captured (at the lowest task level): • Start Date • Duration • Work (Effort) • % Complete • Finish Date ( calculated based on start date + duration) Note: Resources are not required for the calculation. Once the plan has been baselined, the values entered above are locked and used for the schedule performance calculation unless the task’s planned effort is changed and baselined in which case the revised effort is used. After the plan is updated, the following calculation is used to calculate schedule performance: If a task’s % complete = 100%, task % complete x baseline work = work completed, the schedule performance is work completed compared to budgeted work. For further planning information please refer to the BT Planning SharePoint site Page 57 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 10.6 High Level Programme Schedule Varying views of the high level Stage 4 integrated schedule are maintained to show integration and manage dependencies between workstreams, highlight key dates, miletsones and show the programme critical path.A separate view is maintained with a focus on decommissioning and meeting the important key dates and milestones for that programme of work, and then finally workstream specific high level schedules for detailed initiative manahement.

These dependencies require continued and careful management, including agreement between delivering and receiving parties, commonly referred to as a “handshake”. It is important that the programme understands the nature of these dependencies and the due dates thereof, particularly where it is dependent on the completion of inputs from dependent initiatives to ensure that milestones are met. Dependencies on key external events and decisions (e.g., from Ministers) may also impact on the programme, these often spill over into risk and risk mitigation management, which can be an effective way to create visibility and escalation if required. There are three types of dependencies within Business Transformation: 1. Workstream level Dependency– These are dependencies that a workstream has on a work product being produced by another BT workstream. 2. External to BT Dependencies – These are dependencies that a workstream has with a work product that needs to be produced by a team outside of the BT Programme but internal to IR. 3. External to IR Dependencies – These are dependencies that a workstream has with a work product that needs to be produced by a party external to IR. 11.1 Dependency Register All programme dependencies are reflected in the JIRA Dependency Register. This register includes all known and potential dependencies, including an assessment of the strength of each dependency and both the upstream and downstream impacts. The Integrated Programme Schedule also contains all known dependencies. For further information, including process documentation and key contacts please refer to the BT Dependencies SharePoint site. Page 59 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 12 Programme Tools To support the application of the programme management approach, it is necessary to utilise tools that support the key activities and tasks which are easy to use and easily accessible by all relevant parties (i.e., team members, sponsors and stakeholders). The BT PMO Tools team support and develop the BT Programme tools including Microsoft SharePoint, Microsoft Teams and JIRA. This overview details which of the BT PMO Tools should be used for what on BT. The table below maps the tools to be used for each key programme function: Figure 30: Programme tools to support Business Transformation For training or further information on BT PMO Tools please refer to the BT PMO Tools SharePoint site or email BTPMOTools@ird.govt.nz.

Master Services Agreements have been established for all major suppliers with specific statements of work entered for the delivery of Transformation Programme services. All projects and initiatives within the Programme will have documented contracts covering all external spend whether for goods or services. Regular partner management forums are established with strategic and critical suppliers as part of the governance structure of the programme. These forums are managed by the Head of Commercial and Procurement and the Manager Commercial ICT with attendance from Programme Leadership Team member(s). The DC Transformation is accountable for the management of third-party suppliers through the Head of Commercial and Procurement. The Head of Commercial and Procurement is responsible for the management of suppliers and partners on the BT Programme which includes, but is not restricted to the following: • negotiation of the commercial framework of terms and conditions that suppliers are contractually obligated to deliver within. • management of contractual deliverables. • management of change requests. • performance management of suppliers against the programme scorecard; • milestone deliverables. • managing suppliers to value add. • management of supplier innovation. • sourcing of suppliers to meet IR’s requirements. • contract management and commercial governance of the suppliers. The involvement of third-party suppliers is subject to All of Government (AoG) Procurement Rules and IR’s Buying and Expenses Policy and undertaken through the direction of the Head of Commercial and Procurement. Prior approval of the SRO or CIR in accordance with the agreed levels of financial delegation is sought for all procurement activities and involvement of a third-pa rty supplier. 13.1 Account Review Meeting The purpose of the Account Review Meeting is to provide a Monthly Forum for the management of the programme commercial arrangements and relationships with key service providers. Meetings are held monthly and include engagement effectiveness, cost management, schedule attainment and delivery performance, scope and change management, team performance, risk and issues management, delivery assurance and administration and compliance. The meetings also review the status of commercial activities (acceptances, change requests and invoicing), budget forecasts and actuals and resource planning and changes. The Account Review Meetings are chaired by the Head of Commercial and Procurement or relevant Commercial lead. The score card is shared with the PGC as applicable. Page 61 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 14 Resource Management Ensuring a smooth flow and access to the required capabilities at the right time is critical to the success of the Programme. It is integral to have initial conversations with your finance partner prior to starting the process as it will speed the process up for costing. A structured, planned and integrated approach to resource management for the programme will: • reduce programme management time spent on resource planning • hold a single source of truth and one single register of every person on the programme to hold key metadata associated with the person • increase flexibility of staff across the Programme and specific projects • facilitate getting the right people in the right place at the right time • facilitate understanding and awareness regarding Programme resource priorities across IR • enable more effective use of people resources through active career, resource and succession planning. 14.1 Sourcing and Onboarding Form (SOF) Process The process is as follows: 1. The appropriate manager completes the SOF. 2. The PLT Workstream lead with the delegated authority discusses with their Financial Analyst and approves the SOF. If the position reports directly to the PLT Workstream Lead, DC Transformation approval is required 3. The approved SOF is given to the Resource Manager, who then ensures that P&C, Recruitment, IT&C etc. are advised that the approved position is available, and they can commence sourcing. The PLT Workstream are responsible for ensuring all the recruitment policies are followed, these are available on the P&C intranet site 4. Once recruitment is completed the selected person is approved and the completed SOF is returned to the Resource Manager so that onboarding can commence. The IT aspect of this process takes five working days 5. The new staff member is inducted and onboarded.

The BT Scope Management and JIRA overview document details the background and purpose of the BT approach, and in addition provides an overview to using JIRA for this purpose. Also included is the definition of Must, Should and Could approach used. Throughout the programme requests for new and/or changes to scope (from within and outside the programme) are carefully controlled and managed via the programme change control/request process. Changes, JIRA is used to capture current and future scope, 15.1 Baselined and proposed scope Once the scope has been agreed and baselined it must be tightly managed, with various tiers of approval required for any proposed change. All proposed scope change is assessed for the impact to the baseline cost, programme work and agreed scheduled deliverables, milestones, or dependencies. Scope is captured in JIRA in the JIRA Scope Project and in accompanying documents and definition templates A MoSCoW prioritisation categorisation of “must do”, “should do” and “could do” (MOSCOW principles), together with an business impact assessment supports all scope decisions. Non-BT scope can be recorded but is retained in a Draft status for later consideration. Scope items pass through a delivery workflow from definition to completion (New/Draft, Review, Backlog, Scheduled, Completed), with the resultant status viewed and managed from the JIRA Kanban Board. The JIRA Scope project is underpinned by the following data model to maintain data consistency and allow management and control ( see Scope Management Data Model. Further scope detail can be found on the BT Scope SharePoint site. Page 63 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Figure 33: Scope Process in JIRA Page 64 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 16 Change Management Change is inevitable during the lifetime of a programme and it is important that there is a well understood and consistent approach to recording, assessing and approving change. A robust change control process helps to manage the change in a consistent manner, formulate the impacts, summarise any risks or issues arising from the change and ensure those impacted by the change fully understand the change . In addition, it ensures that the change is correctly approved and appropriately managed. The change management process is not in place to prevent change; it is in place to confirm that where change is required, it is agreed to by the relevant authority before it is executed. In all cases, the impact of the change will be considered against the agreed baseline, including considerations of the schedule, scope, business benefit, resource, and financial impact. 16.1 Programme Change Requests Programme Change Requests (PCR’s) are used to manage change. The change requests are managed in JIRA via the JIRA PCR Project. The PCR outlines who is informed of and consulted during the creation of the change request. The programme delegation framework provides guidance in determining the change approver. Once approved the Release Delivery Manager will determine who will be responsible for implementing the ‘accepted’ changes and will instruct the PMO as appropriate to update the baseline plan, budgets and any other documentation. 16.1.1 Administering Change The PMO oversees and administers the change process. This includes: • quality assuring PCR’s to confirm that they are ready for submission • maintaining programme change management standards and processes • reporting on change management to appropriate management and governance forums • maintaining soft copy records and archiving any signed hard copies of all PCRs. 16.1.2 Proposing change The change process is based on the principle that accountability for change is with the person who knows most about it. Throughout the PCR approval process, the Change Owner will have responsibility for: • drafting the PCR • co-ordinating the impact assessment (including impact on costs, benefits, and risks) • coordinating mandatory consultation with all relevant parties, such as PLT members, Implementation/Delivery Partners, and the Finance Manager • liaising with the Contract Manager if any impacts on third party Statements of Work are identified • presenting the PCR • completing any necessary activities to action the change. Page 65 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 16.1.3 Change Escalation Triggers The following table outlines who has the authority to accept change and the frequency of decision-making forums. However, if an urgent change is required, appropriate management action should be taken to seek out of cycle approval.

Figure 34: Delegations for Change Request approvals (for full detail refer to the PMP Appendices 16.1.4 When is A PCR required? • Once Scope has been baselined for a Release, and the “outcomes” as described in the scope statement are being proposed to be expanded on or reduced, a PCR is required. • Clarifications which do not have a material impact on the outcomes do not require a PCR • Once the “Design Freeze” has been invoked and the estimated effort from any of the delivery streams is “Medium” or higher, a PCR is required • When any stream indicates additional funding will be required • At the discretion of the Workstream Programme Delivery Manager or the Enterprise Architect • A team lead may request a PCR is raised for visibility purposes 16.1.5 What is the difference between a PCR lite (PowerPoint)and Full PCR (MSWord)? A PCR Lite is only used for Workstream 1 (START Delivery) and are intended to impose the least possible information gathering burden in order to carry out a pre-liminary assessment of the impact of change With a PCR Lite not all delivery teams are consulted prior to conditional approval being granted by the Design Authority to proceed with Must Do items The PCR lite preliminary assessment is brought to the Wednesday Delivery meeting where every team is given the opportunity to expand the impact and or “push back” on the Design Authority conditional approval. It is at this meeting the decision will be taken on whether a full PCR will be required Examples of additional attributes which a full PCR (MS Word) will hold are: • Full budget impact assessment resulting from the additional funding request • Alternative options for consideration • A description of the impact of doing nothing • Additional detail on the impact assessments • Impacts on Key milestone/s and or scheduled dates Page 66 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 16.1.6 Guidance and framework For further information including guidance on creating a Programme Change Request (PCR) and full PCR impact forms please refer to the BT PCRs SharePoint site.

Functional decisions relate to either Core Tax and Social Policy, i.e. START, or Non- Core Tax and Social Policy, each follow separate processes as outlined within the BT Design Decision Process. The BT PMO manages the workflow for all decisions. 17.1.1 Tax and Social Policy Decisions For all Tax and Social Policy Decision process please refer to the BT Design Decisions (BTDD) SharePoint site.

Page 68 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 18 Risk Management Risk is inherent in any programme. All projects have some degree of uncertainty due to the assumptions associated with them and the environment in which they are executed. A risk is an event or set of events that, should it occur, influence the achievement of programme objectives. The Programme risk management approach recognises that change initiatives of any size, but particularly major programme transformations are high-risk undertakings; and that a focused effort is required to ensure effective and successful delivery of the Programme and associated business benefits. It is recognised that Programme risks cannot be eliminated entirely, but many of them can be anticipated and reduced. 18.1 Risk Management Framework The Programme’s risk management framework is aligned to IR’s Enterprise Risk Management Framework and ISO 31000:2009 To maintain this alignment, the Programme: • has adopted and applied the IR Enterprise Risk Management Policy and Framework (ERMP/F). This includes the Risk Management Process as described by International Standards Organisation (ISO) 31000:20009 to identify, assess, mitigate, monitor and report on risks (refer diagram below) • Aligning the Programme’s JIRA risk project to the ERMF. • works closely with IR Corporate Risk & Assurance (CR&A) to identify changes required to fully align with the new corporate risks policies and standards • uses the CR&A Enterprise framework to assess risks and issues at Programme, Release and Workstream-levels • describes the risk and issue activities undertaken by the Programme in the Risk Strategy and Management Plan. Figure 36: IR’s Enterprise Risk Framework 18.2 Risk Management Plan The Risk Management Plan describes the specific management activities that will be undertaken to support the execution of the Programme’s Risk Strategy. Specifically, it sets out: • the approach to be used for identifying, reviewing and managing risks and issues at Programme, Sub Programme and workstream levels. • the roles and responsibilities for risk and issue management within the Programme Page 69 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] • the reporting processes. The risk and issue management process has been established to ensure that: • a robust risk and issue identification process is carried out as part of Programme planning, with an acceptable level of ‘due diligence’ applied • processes are in place for risks and issues to be analysed, monitored/controlled and managed on a regular basis • relevant risk and issue information is reported by all workstreams, and Sub Programmes, within the Programme and as appropriate to the Programme’s governing bodies • risks and issues are prioritised and escalated at the correct level for decision-making in a timely manner • there is active debate and analysis of risk and issue information at Programme governance and executive management levels. For further information on risks and issues please refer to the BT Risks and Issues SharePoint site. Page 70 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 19 Issue Management Managing issues effectively within a large-scale programme environment is crucial to its success, ensuring the programme remains on schedule and delivers the intended outcomes. An issue is an unplanned situation that has occurred and justifies management consideration and possible action. If left unresolved it will impact upon the achievement of investment objectives. An issue can also be a risk which has come to fruition and requires resolution. 19.1 Assessing Issues The Programme uses the IR ERMP/F consequence criteria to assess the issue priority rating. The Risk Management Plan also provides criteria for issues to be reported up to PLT, PGC or higher from an escalation perspective. The Programme records and manages issues using JIRA. For further information on risks and issues please refer to the BT Risks and Issues SharePoint site. Page 71 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 20 Quality Management Business Transformation manages quality on two different levels. • Firstly, the programme seeks Assurance for its stakeholders through conducting planned reviews, engaging independent quality assessments and meeting the Government Gateway requirements. • Secondly, the programme seeks internal quality control through ensuring the artefacts that are produced are of a high standard through the setting of guidelines, quality checklists and peer review. 20.1 Assurance Management Best practice according to industry standard requires that major programmes have a clear and coordinated approach towards assurance. This has been reinforced by key learning’s from major programmes of work across the public sector. The BT Quality Assurance Process ensures: • there is an overall plan for implementing proactive assurance activities. • there is capacity for conducting planned and ad hoc reviews. • ongoing IQA and Gateway reviews are undertaken at key milestones of the Programme (e.g. go-live) • internal reviews are undertaken on an as needed basis. • ongoing reviews of our vendors and business partners. • that progress is continuously monitored by Central Monitoring Agencies. Assurance is coordinated as part of the PMO function and is incorporated into regular programme planning and reporting to the PLT, PGC and other governance groups as required. An Assurance Management Plan is in place for the Programme and is updated for each release. The timings for the quality assurance reviews are regularly reviewed. 20.1.1 \[Information redacted\] 20.1.2 \[Information redacted\] 20.2 Internal Quality Control The primary objectives of quality control within the Programme are to: • provide guidelines and processes to ensure a consistency of quality across programme deliverables and adherence to appropriate quality standards for each deliverable, including adherence to IT architecture principles and reference architectures • provide confidence to the SRO and key stakeholders that all deliverables meet expectations and satisfy stated requirements and objectives • ensure the Programme proactively mitigates risks and issues regarding quality • identify improvement opportunities, which can be acted on to increase the likelihood of programme success. Page 72 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 21 Deliverables Management 21.1 Controlled Programme Documents The size and complexity of the BT Programme means that many documents are developed and require robust change control systems to be in place. All programme-level artefacts are control documents. Specifically, this includes but is not limited to: • The Programme Management Plan and documents as listed in the PMP Appendices • Transformation Updates for Cabinet • Baseline Programme Plans and Release Plans • Design Artefacts including Requirements, Business Blueprints, Business Profile, Solution Specifications and Business Function Definitions (BFDs) • Programme-level strategies • Any Master Services Agreements with third parties and associated Statements of Work • Formal RFP responses from third party providers • Operations Manual issued to third party providers. 21.2 Deliverables Quality Control To meet these objectives, the Programme has adopted several Quality Principles in relation to programme deliverables. These are: • Purpose The aim of the document must be clear. It must deliver against the agreed deliverable scope and in the Deliverables Register. • Logic The assumptions underlying the document must be explicit; recommendations must be logical and based on the evidence provided. • Accuracy Data and information used to inform the document must be accurate, with references provided as required. All material facts must have been considered. • Options As appropriate, documents must demonstrate that an adequate range of options have been considered before a recommendation has been made. It must be clear that benefits, costs and impacts on the programme are clearly understood. • Consultation It must be clear that adequate consultation with interested parties has taken place and feedback incorporated where appropriate. • Practicality Implementation, technical feasibility, timing and compatibility with wider projects and policies must be considered and documented. • Presentation The format of the document must be consistent with programme standards and IR standards as appropriate. The material must be clear, concise, well presented visually and free of errors. It is acknowledged that some external facing market documents may require a different view to that which is prescribed in the templates. • Methodology The format of the document must be consistent with the BTM and align to the programme prescribed templates. Page 73 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 21.3 Management of Deliverables Deliverables that are produced during the life of the programme are recorded in the release specific deliverables register. This includes deliverables that are led by IR and by third party providers. Responsibilities for these deliverables are as per the definitions of responsibility outlined below: • Lead and Primary Responsibility (LM) (Accountability) - rests with the organisation listed, who will have the responsibility to plan, lead, manage, coordinate, control and deliver all elements of the scope and outcomes as agreed. Lead will include active participation in the drafting and reviewing of the key content areas of the intended deliverables/IR material. • Material Contribution (MC) - rests with the organisation listed, who will have the responsibility to provide significant input into the production of the deliverable/IR material, as specified in Statement of Work (SoW). This may include subject matter expertise, research, and knowledge management, documentation, and production, compliance with quality standards, meeting deadlines, and deliverable assembly/completion. 21.4 RACI Model for Deliverable Execution The BT Programme adopts a deliverable RACI model to provide guidance around the involvement required from individuals to ensure successful deliverable completion. It is important that: • people listed in the RACI model are committed to completing areas of the deliverable that they have been assigned whether a contributor/reviewer • all deliverable expectations are set well in advance of the deliverable being made available for sign off. RACI Description R Responsible This individual is responsible for the completion of the deliverable in accordance with the agreed timeframes, budgets and quality standards. The Responsible Person will confirm that the deliverable meets expected quality standards before it is submitted to the Accountable person for final approval. A Accountable This individual, or group, has responsibility for the final approval of the deliverable. Approval is the formal confirmation that a product is complete and meets its agreed requirements. The Accountable Person is the only approval point for each of the deliverables. A2 Delegated Authority Where accountability for approval of the deliverable sits with a governance group, SRO or CIR, the authority will be given to the DC Transformation to sign the sign-off memo for audit purposes. C Consult These stakeholders are consulted on the deliverable either because their input will add value, or because their buy-in is essential for ultimate implementation. I Inform These stakeholders will be informed of the deliverable and receive a copy of the deliverable for information purposes. 21.4.1 Amendments to RACI On some occasions, it may be necessary to update the RACI for a specific deliverable. Amendments to the RACI require an administrative change request to be approved. Deliverables that have not completed consultation in accordance with the RACI will not meet the mandatory acceptance criteria and will not receive final approval. Page 74 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 21.5 Document Standards All documentation will be developed in accordance with programme standards. These standards reflect broader IR requirements, such as the IR Style Guide. All documentation will include an appropriate section for the Deliverable sign-off and approval. T he purpose of this being for the Responsible Owner to confirm their acceptance of the deliverable, including that the deliverable meets the quality standards and has been consulted on in accordance with the agreed RACI. A Quality Checklist will also be included to provide guidance to workstreams prior to submission of a deliverable for approval. 21.6 Acceptance Criteria for Deliverables The programme’s acceptance criteria form a prioritised list of measurable requirements that need to be met for a deliverable to be accepted by the Accountable Person. These acceptance criteria dictate that the deliverable: • is fit for purpose and meets the agreed quality standards included in the deliverables list. • is consistent with other related programme deliverables. • is fully compliant with the BTM. • has been through the specified consultation and approval process as outlined in the RACI. • supports the achievement of and is traceable to the PGC objectives and benefits. • does not specify requirements that are impossible or impractical to achieve given environmental constraints. Each deliverable may also have a small number of specific acceptance and/or quality criteria. These criteria will be agreed and recorded for each deliverable before work commences. # Criticality Definition C1 Must have completed – critical to be 100% complete for Release Deliverables that must be completed and approved at or by the due date and if not will directly impact the Release critical path. C2 Should have completed – Targeted to be 100% complete for Release Deliverables that must be progressed to an acceptable level and standard of completion at or by the due date and if not will have an impact on activities on the release critical path. C3 Could have completed – Targeted to be 100% complete for Phase/Release Deliverables that are required but will not impact the critical path or other activities on the critical path if not completed by the due date. Completion and approval is however required to achieve Release exit. C4 Not related to current Release Deliverables that are not related to the specific Release and therefore if not completed by a specific Release milestone or checkpoint will have no impact on the solution or schedule. All third-party deliverables meet: • IR requirements and any other specifications, requirements and criteria (if any) for that Approval Item referred to in a Statement of Work; and • The programme’s acceptance criteria for deliverables, as set out in the current version of the Programme Management Plan. Page 75 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] • Any specific quality criteria that have been agreed with the Accountable Person. 21.7 Administering Deliverables The PMO oversees and administers the programme’s deliverables process. This includes: • quality assuring deliverables • maintaining standards and processes • document management - all final deliverables are saved centrally in the PMO document repository in the BT Deliverables SharePoint site • manage all change via the Programme Change Request process 21.7.1 Deliverable Identification and Version Control • Each deliverable is given a unique ‘D’ number as an identifier • The programme’s deliverables are identified and logged in the Master Deliverable Register and tracked in the individual Workstream schedules. • The programme has agreed conventions for deliverable file names. All final, baselined deliverables are saved as version 1.00. Documents are then placed under version control and all subsequent versions are saved as version 1.01, 1.02 etc. 21.7.2 Deliverable Change Control • For a deliverable to be added or removed from scope, after the workstream schedule is baselined, a PCR is required. • Post PCR approval the PMO will update the Change Register in JIRA (refer BTPCR Board, the Integrated Programme Plan, Master Deliverables Register and re-baseline the workstream schedule. 21.8 Deliverables Process The full deliverables process can be found within the BT Deliverables SharePoint site. This site contains the deliverable registers, deliverable documents, templates and links to JIRA. 21.9 Information Classification and Handling Standard BT complies with IR’s Security Guideline: information security, whereby all IR-held information requires appropriate protection in order to preserve its integrity, availability and confidentiality. All information created, stored, received within IR or transferred from IR must be classified. The security classification specifies how the information and equipment must be protected and handled. For more information on IR’s security guidelines and policies please refer to the Corporate Security site. Page 76 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 22 Lessons Learned At the end of each Release, lessons learned are captured following a • Must do (high priority), • Should do (medium priority), • Could do (low priority) categorisation approach. The aim is to identify, document, analyse, store and retrieve lessons in an open and engaging environment, facilitating continuous improvement, through agreed, actionable and achievable lessons. The key outcome being that these are actionable. Workshops are facilitated to identify, document, analyse and theme lessons, grouped into “keep”, “stop” and “start” lessons and finally, stored and retrieved using JIRA, which facilitates collaboration, action and ownership. The programme has defined a process to standardise the identification and collection of lessons learned. • A lesson learned workshop should be held by all workstreams, projects and releases as soon after deployment (go-live) as possible or after a key milestone/event • A how to guide is available via the BT Lessons Learned SharePoint site, including document libraries for storing relevant documentation • Resulting lessons should be consolidated, prioritised and presented • Ensuing actions and follow-up tasks should be captured in JIRA through the JIRA Lessons Learned Project • Through this process, lessons and/or actions can be assigned to those acting and tracked by action owners, • All lessons learned at priority level “1- High” will have PGC and/or PLT visibility. • Lessons learned are recorded even if the action has already been implemented. • The full BT Lessons Learned Process can be found on the BT Lessons Learned SharePoint site, including useful summaries, prior lessons learned, etc. Page 77 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 23 Closure and Handover Management BT’s approach to formally close programme initiatives provides assurance that activities are wrapped up in a consistent manner and that there are no loose ends.

Thoughts and learnings on programme management
==============================================

Simplify your Vision to the size of an elevator pitch
-----------------------------------------------------

*   Drive for clarity of purpose - ‘Simple, Open, Certain’ ‘Making tax simpler, more open and certain for New Zealanders to pay their taxes and receive their entitlements’. Inland Revenue's core proposition supports the reason for the transformation and will remain relevant for the lifetime of the organisation.
*   Complexity leads to Vision dilution - The higher the complexity of the vision, the higher the dilution and divergence as it permeates through the organisation.

Think through the strategic consequences of your strategy, both intended and unintended
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   Think about the long-term consequences of your strategy. For example, expanding your digital border shifts development costs, and places customer interaction at arm’s length so you can drive your own operational costs down. It also creates a long-term dependency on partners for speed of change. Is that what you really want?
*   Your thinking may not be wrong, just ensure that strategy is fully considered, and unintended consequences mitigated as part of the strategy.
*   Once it is clear, then commit.

Strong, adaptive leadership is not a ‘nice to have’ for transformation, it is an essential
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   A strong, committed executive leadership team is critical for successful transformation. Strong leaders provide direction and are willing to take difficult decisions.
*   They may not always be right, but it is easier to change the direction of a moving ship than it is to restart a ship which has stopped. Have significant courage in their convictions.

Big ideas often start as a whisper
----------------------------------

*   As a leader, listen to those around you, multiple voices will allow you to calibrate. Make time for contemplation, be curious and follow the trail. Do not shut things down too early when at first blush it does not seem possible or useful.

We did not 'do Agile' we 'were Agile' or more correctly - we were adaptive
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   Select methods which are fit for purpose. It's ok to have multiple methods in play at any one time, it's not often one size fits all. We used pure Agile to implement START Integrity and Discovery Managers and the Data and Intelligence Platform (DIP) used an iterative methodology for core product development.

Be constantly curious
---------------------

*   Leaders are learners. Be open to new ideas, always seek to grow and develop new skills.
*   Roll your sleeves up and get into the detail not only when needed, but routinely. It will create an expectation with the team that the details could be examined at any point.

Too big to fail is a myth
-------------------------

*   Budget is not a target. Drive value and cost control ruthlessly.
*   Budget liberally (give yourself headroom) but execute and control cost ruthlessly. Better to release funds as risks recede, than keep asking for more as issues arise.
*   Protect your contingency, and use it wisely.

Celebrate intellectual and personality diversity
------------------------------------------------

*   Understand your team’s strengths and weaknesses.
*   Work as a team drawing on your distribution of strengths
*   We don't all think the same. For example:
    *   process oriented versus big picture
    *   cup half full versus half empty
    *   exceptional memories versus creative problem-solving skills.
*   If you find yourself in the ‘valley of despair’ look around, there are likely to be others feeling the same. Open up and help each other out.
*   Pick the right people, those with the essential qualities of good judgment, uncompromising commitment to transparency, integrity and with the right attitude.

Speculate and suffer
--------------------

*   Facts matter. Be fact based, do not speculate.
*   Ask your customers and stakeholders for their view - do not assume you know what they are thinking.
*   Drive hard for as much fact-based data as you can in the time you have to make the decision.
*   But don't analyse forever or you will either miss the opportunity or create other problems through inaction.

No-one gets left behind
-----------------------

*   Across the life of the transformation, there will be periods of highs and also lows, impacting individuals and the wider team.
*   Make time for people to recharge.
*   Celebrate achievements, periods of great progress and milestones.

Convergence is key
------------------

*   All activities need to converge to a point of outcome. Structure teams to drive for convergence not divergence.
*   Set your overarching framework and methodology to drive convergence.
*   With such a broad and large team, create opportunities along the way to converge and test thinking is still aligned - bookends, touch points, design review workshops and so on.

Progressing Government environmental policies
=============================================

Inland Revenue is committed to minimising our environmental footprint by managing the impact of our day-to-day work. We have a plan to reduce our carbon emissions.

We're one of 120 organisations taking part in the Carbon Neutral Government Programme (CNGP), which was established in November 2020 to combat climate change and achieve carbon neutrality by 2025.

Our efforts are currently focused on the requirements of the CNGP. These include:

*   measuring and seeking external audit verification of our carbon emissions and developing an emissions reduction plan and reduction targets
*   purchasing electric vehicles (EVs) and reducing and optimising our vehicle fleet
*   seeking building energy efficiency assessments for the larger sites we occupy.

Measuring Inland Revenue's carbon emissions

This year, we've been sourcing information to measure our carbon emissions and set a target for reductions. We set our emissions base year as 2018–19 as it was the most recent full year of Inland Revenue operating without COVID-19 impacts.

![Inland Revenue's carbon emissions (tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent) decreased from 5,474 in 2018-19 to 2,076 in 2021-22.](/-/media/project/ir/home/graphics/about-us/publications/annual-corporate-reports/annual-report-2022/carbon-emissions-1.jpg?modified=20220912042523)

Our data and calculations have been independently verified against ISO#14064-1:2018 by Toitū Envirocare (Enviro-Mark Solutions Limited), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Manaaki Whenua Landcare Research.

In 2021–22, we emitted 2,076 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e), a 14% reduction on our previous year, and 62% lower than our 2018–19 base year).

The bulk of our 2021–22 emissions were generated by the freight associated with our mail, particularly international mail, followed by electricity used in our 28 offices (including temporary sites) and air travel.

International mail makes up just under 5% of all paper-based mail and accounts for 69% of mail freight emissions.

We expect air travel to continue to be much lower due to the office technology we now have in place, which enables our people to work remotely and virtually. However, travel remains essential for activities such as tax audits, partner and intermediary engagement, court attendances, attending specialist conferences and for our people leaders to connect with their remote teams.

The breakdown of our emissions by source across the 4 years is shown in the following graph.

![Inland Revenue's air travel carbon emissions reduced significantly between 2018 and 2022 due to travel restrictions. All other sources of emissions also decreased due to lockdowns and staff working from home.](/-/media/project/ir/home/graphics/about-us/publications/annual-corporate-reports/annual-report-2022/carbon-emissions-2.jpg?modified=20220912042809)

COVID-19 restrictions and lockdowns have led to a significant reduction in all travel-related emissions from the fourth quarter of 2019–20. Also, we have reduced our property footprint through consolidating office accommodation in some locations and releasing floors in other sites. This has contributed to a downward trend in energy emissions.

The ongoing effects of the pandemic and the winter flu season have led to a further reduction from 2020–21 in all forms of domestic travel. Electricity has reduced because our people are working from home on some days and because of our reducing property footprint. However, some of the benefits of exiting buildings have been offset by our need to find temporary office space from July 2021. This is when we vacated our largest site, Asteron Centre in Te Whanganui a Tara Wellington, because it needs a seismic upgrade.

Our carbon emission reduction targets

Under the Carbon Neutral Government Programme (CNGP), Inland Revenue must reduce gross emissions in line with the Paris Agreement to limit the global average temperate increases to no more than 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels. This means reducing our gross emissions by 21% by 2025 and 42% by 2030 from our 2018–19 base year.

We're aiming to better this - we're committed to emissions reductions of 43% by 2025 and 50% by 2030 from our base year. 

Our plan for reducing emissions

We've identified 7 key initiatives to achieve our emission reduction targets.

*   **Transition to a fully electric vehicle (EV) fleet -** we will replace the rest of our petrol-based fleet vehicles with EVs by 30 June 2024 and install EV chargers for all vehicles.
*   **Reduce the vehicle fleet size and explore other optimisation options -** we will 'right size' our vehicle fleet and explore options to share vehicles with other agencies and use car/ride share services.
*   **Enhance the energy efficiency of buildings -** we will carry out energy efficiency assessments at all of our sites over 2,000m2. We'll work with landlords to upgrade air-conditioning systems and lighting as required while also exploring the benefits and costs of converting to LED lighting in all sites.
*   **Minimise office waste -** we're reviewing and enhancing waste management practices at all sites and we will implement better signage and consistent recycling and waste bins in kitchen and utility areas.
*   **Reduce postal freight emissions -** we will explore options for reducing postal volumes further and ways of delivering mail overseas that produce lower emissions.
*   **Reduce taxi and rental car emissions -** we will explore options to switch to electric taxis and electric and low-emission rental cars.
*   **Minimise the post COVID-19 growth in air travel -** we will explore ways to minimise travel now that internal COVID-related restrictions have been removed.

What we've done this year

In terms of our progress on initiatives in our emission reductions plan, our fleet has reduced by 63 vehicles since 2018, and 35% of our fleet is now electric.

We have been assessing the energy efficiency of 11 of our 21 sites where we occupy over 2,000m2. We're using the National Australian Built Environment Ratings System New Zealand (NABERSNZ) assessment programme to identify areas where our sites could be more energy efficient. To date, 9 of our properties have been rated and all are at the minimum 4 stars out of 6 or above. We're working with our landlords to upgrade the lighting and air conditioning systems at some sites where assessments highlighted a need.

We're also considering a range of options to minimise waste going to landfill.

Moving forward

Inland Revenue's current reporting accounts for the emissions of our core business activities. We will look at emissions that come from the cloud-based data centres we use and from staff commuting. If material, we will add them to our reporting next year.

We're also beginning work with our key suppliers to increase the quality of their emissions source information and consider ways to jointly reduce our environmental footprints.

Progressing Government environmental priorities (2023)
======================================================

Te Tari Taake Inland Revenue is committed to minimising our environmental footprint by managing the impacts of our day-to-day work. We are part of the Carbon Neutral Government Programme’s (CNGP) efforts to combat climate change and achieve carbon neutrality by 2025.

We are in the initial group of government organisations taking part in the CNGP. In December 2022, we reported our results to Manatū Mō Te Taiao, the Ministry for the Environment (MfE) for the first time.

Our efforts focus on delivering the requirements of the CNGP. We’re measuring carbon emissions and progressing an emissions reduction plan.

Measuring our emissions

Last year, we set our emissions base year as 2018–19. At the time, it was the most recent full year of Te Tari Taake Inland Revenue operating without the impacts of COVID-19. This year, our emissions have been re-stated for each year from 2018–19 to reflect revised emissions factors published by MfE in July 2023.

Our results for 2022–23 are provisional and unverified. The verification audit is nearing completion with no material adverse findings.

In 2022–23, we emitted 2,848 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e), which is 27% higher than 2021–22, but 55% lower than the 2018–19 base year.

Air travel generated 41% of 2022-23 emissions, followed by freight associated with our mail (35%) and the electricity used in our permanent and temporary sites (11%).

Inland Revenue's Carbon Emissions by Year

| **Year** | 2018/19 | 2019/20 | 2020/21 | 2021/22 | 2022/23 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Tonnes CO2e** | 6,389 | 5,620 | 2,851 | 2,235 | 2,848 |

As expected, lifting COVID-19 travel restrictions has led to an increase in all related emissions (air travel, accommodation, use of our vehicle fleet, rental and private vehicles and taxis).

Our office technology enables our people to work remotely and virtually. However, domestic travel remains essential for some activities such as tax audits and our leaders connecting with remote teams.

International travel to specialist meetings and conferences with overseas authorities and other tax jurisdictions remains important - it made up 48% of air travel emissions in 2022–23.

Mail freight emissions fell 21% from 2021–22. International mail continues to make up just under 5% of our paper-based mail volumes but accounts for 59% of mail freight emissions.

The table below shows a breakdown of emissions by source across 5 years. Please note that 1 source (waste composting) is too small to feature.

Some of the energy benefits gained from exiting older, less efficient buildings have been offset by our need for temporary office space over the past 2 years. Reasons for this include concerns over the seismic robustness of some offices and seismic upgrades at 3 permanent sites.

While electricity use increased at our permanent sites this year, the associated emissions have reduced under the revised MfE emissions factors.

Reduction targets

Under the CNGP, we must reduce gross emissions in line with the Paris Agreement. The Agreement is to limit global average temperature increases to no more than 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels. This requires us to reduce gross emissions by 21% by 2025 and 42% by 2030 from the 2018–19 base year.

We’re aiming higher with a commitment to reductions of 43% by 2025 and 50% by 2030. These targets are not affected by the restatement of emissions for past years.

Based on our latest projections, which take property changes and reduction efforts into account, we estimate a small rise in emissions in 2023–24 followed by a drop in 2024–25. Current modelling indicates we will achieve a 58% reduction by 2025 and 64% by 2030.

The CNGP has defined a minimum mandatory set of emissions that agencies are to measure. At the end of 2024–25, we will need to offset all remaining mandatory emissions to achieve carbon neutrality. Over 99% of our emissions in 2022–23 are mandatory as defined by the CNGP.

Our plan

Te Tari Taake Inland Revenue is working on 8 key initiatives to achieve our emission reduction targets:

*   Transition to a fully electric vehicle (EV) fleet.
*   Reduce the fleet size and explore other optimisation options.
*   Enhance the energy efficiency of buildings—energy efficiency is being assessed at all sites over 2,000m2. As leases near expiry or renewal dates, we’re working with landlords to upgrade air-conditioning systems and lighting.
*   Minimise office waste—we’re reviewing and enhancing waste management practices.
*   Reduce postal freight emissions—we are analysing postal volumes and will explore:

*   options to reduce them further, and
*   alternative lower emission ways to deliver mail to overseas customers.

*   Reduce taxi and rental car emissions—we will consider options to switch to electric taxis and electric and low-emission rental cars.
*   Minimise the post COVID-19 growth in air travel—we continue to explore how to minimise travel.
*   Minimise employee commuting emissions—we will look at workplace barriers that prevent our people choosing to walk, run, scoot or bike to work. 

Progress on our reductions plan

This year, chargers for EVs were installed in 11 sites and we are looking at 3 further locations. Installation at our other sites will be completed as changes to our property portfolio are confirmed.

With the arrival of 20 new EVs in August 2023, nearly 60% of our fleet is electric. To promote greater use of vehicles for travel between our sites, we’re installing visitor chargers where carparks are available.

LED lighting is being installed in our sites.

A pilot at one of our sites has been testing ways to minimise waste sent to landfill. We’re considering how to apply what we have learned at other locations.

Te Tari Taake Inland Revenue has also developed a dashboard to give more visibility to travel emissions. Our travel policy is being refreshed to prompt staff to consider the environment when making travel decisions.

Moving forward

This current reporting accounts for emissions from our core business activities. Inland Revenue is also looking at emissions from the cloud-based data centres we use and staff commuting. We expect these emissions to be material and that we will add them to reporting next year.

We are also working on ways to enhance data quality and automate gathering of the activity information used to calculate emissions. As part of this, we’re developing dashboards to better monitor and report on emissions from quarter to quarter.

Properties excluded from the interest limitation rules
======================================================

You can still claim interest for certain properties if you satisfy the other requirements for claiming interest deductions.

Schedule 15 exclusions
----------------------

Properties listed in Schedule 15 of the Income Tax Act 2007 do not come under the interest limitation rules.

*   Main home – the interest limitation rules do not apply to interest related to any income-earning use of an owner-occupier’s main home, such as flatmates, boarders, bed and breakfast where the owner lives on the property
*   Properties used as business premises (except for an accommodation business), like offices and shops. This includes residential properties to the extent they are used as business premises (for example, a house converted into a doctor’s surgery).
*   Farmland
*   Certain Māori land, papakāinga and kaumātua housing, and land transferred as part of a settlement under Te Tiriti o Waitangi/Treaty of Waitangi
*   Commercial accommodation such as hotels, motels, and hostels (but not short-stay accommodation provided in a residential dwelling)
*   Boarding establishment
*   Care facilities: hospitals, nursing homes, hospices, and convalescent homes
*   Retirement villages and rest homes
*   Employee accommodation
*   Student accommodation
*   Build-to-rent land.

Show all

Main home

You generally can’t claim interest deductions for private use, but if you use your main home to earn income (such as from a flatmate or boarder), you are able to deduct some interest against that income.

For interest to be deductible, it must satisfy the general deductibility rules.

In a flatmate situation, apportion expenses between: 

*   shared areas 
*   areas exclusively used by the flatmate
*   areas exclusively used by the homeowner. 

Collectively-owned Maori land and housing

This means the following:

*   Māori customary land, Māori freehold land, Crown land reserved for Māori, and land set aside as a Māori reservation.
*   Housing on land owned directly or indirectly by a Māori authority (or an entity which is eligible to be a Māori authority) that is provided as a residence to its shareholders or beneficiaries (for example, papakāinga or kaumātua housing).
*   Land owned directly or indirectly by a Māori authority (or entity eligible to be one) under a te Tiriti o Waitangi/Treaty of Waitangi settlement or a post-Treaty settlement mechanism (for example, through a right of first refusal). This includes where land is transferred to an entity owned by the claimant, or where a ground lease is held by an entity owned by the claimant.

Boarding establishment

A boarding establishment is a property with:

*   a minimum of 10 boarding rooms that are not self-contained
*   communal living facilities, including shared kitchens and living areas available to all residents
*   servicing and management taken care of by the business.

Employee accommodation

Employee accommodation is property a person provides to their employees or other workers for accommodation in connection with their employment or service. It also includes property provided by a company in the same wholly-owned group as the person to the person’s employees or other workers. However, it does not include accommodation provided to employees or other workers who are associated with the person, unless it is necessary for the person to provide the accommodation because of the nature or remoteness of their business.

Student Accommodation

This means the following:

*   a boarding establishment used for the accommodation of students enrolled at a registered school or premises described in section 5B of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986, and
*   premises described in section 5B of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 even if they are used mainly, and not exclusively, for the accommodation of students.

This does not include a landlord who leases their residential rental property to students privately.

Build-to-rent land

Your development must be approved as build-to-rent land by Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga ‒ Ministry of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).

To qualify, build-to-rent land must meet all these requirements.

*   There are 20 or more dwellings in a single development on a single block or adjacent blocks, held in one or more titles.
*   Owned by the same person (a person includes a legal entity like a company).
*   Each dwelling must be being prepared for use, available, or occupied under a residential tenancy.
*   Every residential tenancy must have the option of a 10-year term, with the ability for the tenant to give 56 days’ notice of termination.
*   Every tenancy agreement includes a personalisation policy.

Where to apply for the exclusion
--------------------------------

If your development meets the requirements, you can apply for a build-to-rent exclusion on the HUD website.

[Build-to-rent - Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga - Ministry of Housing and Urban Development (hud.govt.nz)](https://www.hud.govt.nz/our-work/build-to-rent/)

Once approved, HUD will record your land on a register of build-to-rent assets and will share this information with us. You will need to notify HUD of any changes to your approved build-to-rent land, for example units or dwellings that no longer meet the requirements.

When your exclusion comes to an end
-----------------------------------

Individual units or dwellings that become ineligible can never qualify for the exclusion again in the future. If this results in your development no longer meeting the requirements for build-to-rent land, the development will no longer qualify for an exclusion from the interest limitation rules.

Even if your development meets the requirements in the future, it can never qualify for the exclusion again.

Once your exclusion comes to an end, you must stop claiming interest as an expense in your income tax return unless another exclusion or exemption applies.

Emergency, transitional and social housing
------------------------------------------

You can still claim interest deductions if your property’s sole purpose is for emergency, transitional or social housing and is leased or contracted directly or indirectly to 1 of the following:

*   government department (for example, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development or Kāinga Ora)
*   registered community housing provider.

This also covers connected or related services provided in the same building or in a different building on the same land. The whole property needs to be leased to the housing provider to qualify, (for example, 1 bedroom in a 5-bedroom house would not qualify for this exemption).

A full list of eligible government departments can be found in schedule 2, part 1 of the Public Service Act 2020.

[legislation.govt.nz: Public Service Act 2020](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2020/0040/latest/LMS207451.html)

The Community Housing Regulatory Authority maintains a register of community housing providers registered under the Public and Community Housing Management Act 1992.

[chra.hud.govt.nz: The register](https://chra.hud.govt.nz/about-chra/the-register/)

Council housing
---------------

You can still claim interest deductions for property used by a local authority or a council-controlled organisation (CCO) if its only purpose is to house people assessed by a local authority as eligible for housing at less than market rent.

This still applies if connected or wraparound services are provided on site either in the same building or in a different building on the same land (for example, rehabilitation). The whole property must be leased to the local authority or CCO to qualify (for example, 1-bedroom in a 5-bedroom house would not qualify for this exemption).

Interest on a property does come under interest limitation if it is not used for council housing, for example, if the CCO provides rental housing at market rates.

What if part of my property is affected and part is excluded?
-------------------------------------------------------------

If you own a piece of land that has both a residential property and excluded property on the same legal title such as a 2-storey building with a shop on the ground floor and a flat on the top floor, you can deduct interest for the portion of the property that is excluded. You’ll need to apportion your interest expenses between the different parts of the land using the standard tax apportionment principles.

####   

Tāmati owns a 2-storey building with dual purpose

Tāmati owns a 2-storey building with mixed residential and commercial use. The ground floor is a clothing store, and the upper storey is rented out as long-term residential accommodation. The whole building is on a single legal title. 

Tāmati has 1 loan for the whole property. The upper-storey apartment is a residential property, but the clothing store on the ground floor is excluded. Following standard principles for apportionment, Tāmati calculates that the clothing store on the ground floor accounts for 55%, and the upper storey for 45%, of the interest paid on his loan.

So, Tāmati can claim a deduction in full for 55% of his interest expense as it relates to excluded property. The remaining 45% of his interest expense comes under the interest limitation rules as it relates to affected property.

Property compliance at Inland Revenue
=====================================

**19 June 2017**

Property remains the principle investment choice for many New Zealanders, with trade in residential property averaging over $40 billion a year. For this reason, Inland Revenue has an increased focus on this area to improve compliance. In 2008 a team was established to address any compliance risks with property development and speculation and associated tax obligations.

In 2015 the Government introduced new legislation and provided additional funding for Inland Revenue to put further focus on residential property speculation of $6.65 million each year for 5 years.

This amounted to an effective doubling of resources reviewing property compliance. We now have around 95 staff focusing on risks in the residential property market to make sure customers meet their obligations in relation to returning any applicable tax on property gains.

As a result, Inland Revenue has assessed additional tax owed in property transactions at over $70 million for the 2016 financial year, and for the 2017 financial year we have surpassed $100 million.

![](/-/media/project/ir/home/media-releases/2017/property-compliance-at-inland-revenue/property-compliance-graph.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20210303221245&hash=9A5D0A0C41F83236E687400073A5EC6C)

**Targeting property speculators**

Resources are predominantly focused on residential property speculation in the high risk markets, particularly Auckland. Speculative behaviour is often found in cases of “flipping,” where a house is bought and sold within a short timeframe for a profit as well as in off-plan sales where titles can change hands without a property even being built.

Our investigations team also monitors regions and suburbs with high property turnover so that levels of compliance risk can be identified and acted on if necessary.

Inland Revenue has a reputation in the industry for keeping a close eye on transactions and many sellers are receiving reminders about their tax obligations soon after the transaction settles.

An Auckland accountant recently commented publicly on how quickly Inland Revenue is acting to remind property purchasers of their tax obligations. He said his clients were surprised to hear from an IR staff member before they had even lodged the tax return which would have included the disclosure of their property sale.

This is because Inland Revenue has access to a list of all property transactions completed through Land Information New Zealand (LINZ). Where IR identifies a potential risk, we may contact the seller to remind them of the next steps they must take.

**LINZ Data**

New legislation, called the bright-line test, was introduced in 2015. This ensures any gains made on properties bought and sold within a two year period are subject to tax where applicable. A few exemptions apply.

Part of this legislation includes the requirement for all property buyers and sellers to complete a tax information statement with their New Zealand IRD number, or a tax identification number from their home country.  This information is then forwarded to Inland Revenue.  IR has been using property transaction data from LINZ for the past several years. This new requirement has seen a huge improvement in the data collection since October 2015.

**Risk profiling**

Key to the team’s success is its risk profiling approach which utilises a mix of data analysis, automated alerts and manual interventions.

Data we receive relating to property transactions and taxpayers is matched and profiled to identify any high risk transactions.

We also screen alerts based on GST returns and apply analytical rules to highlight any high risk returns. A manual intervention by staff is then undertaken: a review is carried out of the high risk transactions to decide whether closer monitoring or an audit is needed.

To date the property team identified  around 22,000 property transactions where there could be  speculative activity. This has resulted in more than 1,200 selected for audits and future monitoring.

**Right from the start**

Inland Revenue’s property compliance programme is also being supported by improved customer education. Marketing campaigns remind taxpayers of their property tax obligations and media coverage of property speculation including stories of people “flipping” houses for significant profit have helped raise awareness of tax obligations.

![](/-/media/project/ir/home/media-releases/2017/property-compliance-at-inland-revenue/propertybanner2.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20210303221246&hash=E1C5D9ECB80860CC938A1733A8292DC6)

[A property tax decision tree on the Inland Revenue website](https://www.ird.govt.nz/property/property-terms-and-tools/property-decision-tree/ "Link to property tax decision tree")
 helps customers to easily work out their tax obligations.

In addition, teams around the country are actively working with property developers with outstanding returns to help them improve their current and future tax compliance. This reinforces the proactive approach based on intelligence that’s the hallmark of all compliance activity at Inland Revenue.

Property interest limitation rules
==================================

From 1 October 2021, the interest limitation rules have limited the ability to claim interest as a deduction for residential property in New Zealand.

Unless an exclusion or exemption applies:

*   Interest cannot be claimed for residential property acquired on or after 27 March 2021. 
*   A percentage of the interest incurred can be claimed as an expense for properties acquired before 27 March 2021. 

| Date interest incurred | Percentage of interest that can be claimed |
| --- | --- |
| 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021 | 100% |
| 1 April 2021 to 30 September 2021 | 100% |
| 1 October 2021 to 31 March 2022 | 75% |
| 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023 | 75% |
| 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024 | 50% |

Interest deductions for any new loans drawn down on or after 27 March 2021 are not allowed from 1 October 2021 onwards.

If your rental property is financed by a loan in foreign currency, any interest is non-deductible from 1 October 2021 unless it is refinanced with a New Zealand dollar loan.

Use the tool at the bottom of this page to find out if the interest limitation rules apply to your property.

Changes are coming
------------------

From 1 April 2024 claiming interest as an expense for residential property will be phased back in.

Acquired date for tax purposes
------------------------------

For tax purposes, a property is acquired on the date a binding sale and purchase agreement is entered into (even if some conditions still need to be met).

A property purchased on or after 27 March 2021 can qualify for phased-out interest deductions only if it was purchased as a result of an offer made on or before 23 March 2021, and that offer was not able to be revoked or withdrawn before 27 March 2021 (for example, by tender).

Property types the rules apply to
---------------------------------

The interest limitation rules apply to residential property in New Zealand. The rules do not apply to overseas property.

Any property with a dwelling on it (such as a house or apartment) is subject to these rules, as is bare land that could be used for residential property.

It does not matter whether the property is rented out long or short-term, used for short-stay accommodation some or all of the time, or left vacant.

IS 23/04 has full information on how the interest limitation rules apply to interest incurred for property used to provide short-stay accommodation.

[IS 23/04 – The interest limitation rules and short-stay accommodation](https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/interpretation-statements/2023/is-23-04)

Property types excluded from the rules
--------------------------------------

Main homes are generally not affected. You cannot claim interest deductions for private use. 

If the interest relates to income you earn in your main home, for example, from having flatmates or boarders, you can deduct some interest against this income.

Other properties also excluded from the interest limitation rules are listed in Schedule 15 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

Exclusions for certain entities
-------------------------------

The interest limitation rules do not apply to most companies where their core business does not involve residential land. These are companies where residential property (including new builds) makes up less than half their total assets.

Companies where 5 or fewer individuals or trustees own 50% or more of the company (referred to as close companies) will have to apply the rules even if their core business does not involve residential land.

There are exceptions for close companies that are Māori authorities or wholly owned by a Māori authority.

Kāinga Ora and its wholly-owned subsidiaries are excluded because they provide emergency, transitional and social housing.

Exemptions from the rules
-------------------------

If the interest limitation rules apply to your property, you may still be able to claim interest if you qualify for one of the following exemptions:

*   land business
*   property development
*   new build land.

For interest to be deductible, it must not be private in nature and the general deductibility rule must be met.

Renting out your holiday home
-----------------------------

The interest limitation rules apply to interest relating to residential property that is rented out some of the time and used privately some of the time.

This is the case with many holiday homes. Interest expenses for these properties are non-deductible from 1 October 2021 unless a percentage of the interest incurred can be claimed.

----------------------------------

Property rental activities a business and not a passive investment
==================================================================

2013 case note – carrying on a business meaning re-calculation of Working for Families Tax Credits.

Case

TRA 16/12

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 2004

### Summary

The taxpayer and her husband were found to be carrying on a small, residential property rental business. The scale and volume of the operation, and the commitment of time, effort and finance involved were found to have been considerable and not merely passive investments as the taxpayer maintained. This finding resulted in a consequential re-calculation of their Working for Families Tax Credits ("WfFTC") entitlements.

### Impact of decision

The Taxation Review Authority ("TRA"), in determining whether or not the taxpayer was engaged in business, applied the two-limb test in _Grieve v The Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[1984\] 1 NZLR 101 ("_Grieve_"). Accordingly, the TRA confirmed that _Grieve_ is still the leading case on whether or not a taxpayer is involved in a business.

In that regard, the TRA confirmed that the letting of residential properties will not be merely passive investments if the scale and volume of the operation, and the commitment of time, effort and finance involved are considerable.

### Facts

This case involves a challenge by the taxpayer to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue's ("the Commissioner") amended WfFTC and income tax assessment for the tax year ended 31 March 2008.

The taxpayer and her husband have two children. The taxpayer was in receipt of WfFTC based on her "family income" being the combined income of the taxpayer and her husband. The taxpayer also claimed WfFTC in the 2009, 2010 and 2011 years on the same basis as the 2008 year.

In early 2007 the taxpayer and her husband attended a seminar organised by X Ltd relating to the purchase of rental properties for investment purposes. Following this, they became clients of J Ltd, a firm involved in conducting seminars relating to the taxation of rental properties. The firm was listed as their tax agent from 15 May 2007.

In August 2007 they registered for WfFTC. Both the taxpayer and her husband were in full-time employment and had not received WfFTC in prior years as their combined family income exceeded $100,000, making them ineligible to claim.

On 27 September 2007 their accountant sent a fax to the Commissioner stating that the taxpayer and her husband's total 2008 family income was estimated to be $73,936. This calculation included salary/wages of $143,000 less rental losses from residential rental properties of $69,064.

#### Rental properties

In 2004 the taxpayer and her husband purchased a rental property that was sold on 27 March 2007. Rental losses of $6,022.58 from this property were used in claiming WfFTC for the 2008 year.

In August 2004 the taxpayer and her husband purchased a property that is the family residence but is also occupied by the taxpayer's parents-in-law who lease a portion of the home. No written rental agreement existed, but they pay $250 rental in cash per week.

The taxpayer and her husband also purchased two properties, following the property investment seminar, which are both leased to Housing New Zealand.

The rental losses for the 2008 tax year for each of these four properties were used by the taxpayer and her husband in claiming WfFTC. The gross income claimed for this income year was $42,550.65. The total expenses claimed were $130,897.27.

The Commissioner amended the taxpayer's returns on the basis that the taxpayer and her husband were carrying on a rental property business in the 2008 tax year. The rental losses were added back in the specified "family income" when calculating WfFTC entitlements pursuant to section KD 1(1)(f) of the Income Tax Act 2004.

### Decision

In determining whether the taxpayer was in business, the TRA referred to the leading case of _Grieve_. In that case, Richardson J held that the decision whether or not a taxpayer is in business involved a two-fold enquiry as to the nature of the activities and the intention of the taxpayer in engaging in such activities. His Honour set out the factors to be taken into consideration in determining the nature of the activities carried out as being the: period over which they are engaged in; the scale of operations and the volume of transactions; the commitments of time, money and effort; the pattern of activity; and the financial results.

The TRA found that the second limb of the _Grieve_ test was met as the taxpayer and her husband had a clear intention of making a pecuniary profit. She noted that it does not matter that a taxpayer may have a number of different intentions; as long as one of those intentions is to make a pecuniary profit that is sufficient.

Her Honour considered the principal issue in the case related to the first limb of the _Grieve_ test: namely the nature of the activities carried on, and in particular, whether they are sufficient to constitute a business.

Her Honour noted that the taxpayer was involved in residential property letting, which it is well established can amount to a business.

The taxpayer's position was that the rental properties owned by her and her husband were merely passive investments and that there was insufficient activity to constitute a business.

The Commissioner contended that there was sufficient activity to constitute a business. After referring to the rental operation, the taxpayer's administrative and maintenance responsibilities in relation to the rental properties, and the nature and extent of the activities carried out by the taxpayer, illustrated by the expense claims made by the taxpayer and her husband, the TRA stated at \[30\]:

*   As well as this personal commitment of time and effort, the financial commitment involved for the disputant and her husband was very considerable.

Accordingly, the TRA did not consider on the evidence that the investments were "passive". Her Honour stated at \[32\]:

*   The activities in which the disputant and her husband were engaged (and the associated time investment) were typical of a small rental property business.

Having concluded that the taxpayer was engaged in a rental property business in the 2008 tax year, the TRA found that the taxpayer's rental losses for the 2008 tax year were business losses and should therefore be excluded for the purposes of calculating the disputant's entitlement to WfFTC.

Property sold before 1 July 2024
================================

The bright-line test works differently for property sold before 1 July 2024. The date you acquired the property decides which bright-line period to use (5 or 10 years) and which main home exclusion criteria to use.

When a property is acquired
---------------------------

For tax purposes, a property is generally acquired on the date a binding sale and purchase agreement is entered into (even if some standard conditions like getting finance or a building report still need to be met).

Bright-line periods
-------------------

The bright-line test looks at whether the property was acquired:

*   on or after 27 March 2021 and sold within 5 years for qualifying new builds or within 10 years for all other properties
*   between 29 March 2018 and 26 March 2021 and sold within 5 years.

The changes to the bright-line test starting on 1 July 2024 means you no longer have to separate out new builds from all other properties. Your property sale will only come under the bright-line test if you acquired the property on or after 29 March 2018 and you are selling it within 5 years or before 1 July 2024 (whichever comes first).

Bright-line start and end dates
-------------------------------

For a standard purchase of property, the bright-line period starts from the date the property’s title is transferred to you, generally the settlement date.

For a standard sale, the bright-line period ends when you enter into a binding sale and purchase agreement to sell the property.

Whether full rollover relief, no tax to pay, or partial rollover relief, some tax to pay, applies depends on whether payment is made for the transfer and if so, how much.

Different rules apply for other types of purchase, for example off the plan, and for other types of sale or disposal, for example when property is gifted.

Main home exclusion
-------------------

The bright-line test does not tax the sale of a property that has been your main home.

Different criteria apply to your main home depending if you acquired it before, or on or after 27 March 2021.

Ownership transfers and rollover relief
---------------------------------------

From 1 April 2022 until 30 June 2024, the following changes in legal ownership qualify for rollover relief:

*   transfers to or from look-through companies and partnerships
*   certain transfers to or from qualifying family trusts
*   transfers within tax consolidated groups of wholly-owned companies.

Whether full rollover relief, no tax to pay, or partial rollover relief, some tax to pay, applies depends on whether payment is made for the transfer and if so, how much.

### Transfers of Māori residential land to or from trusts

From 1 April 2022, rollover relief applies to certain transfers of land subject to Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993 and transfers as part of settling Te Tiriti o Waitangi - Treaty of Waitangi claims.

[Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993 rollover relief - transfers of Māori residential land to or from trusts](/property/buying-and-selling/when-you-need-to-pay/the-brightline-test/ownership-transfers-and-rollover-relief/te-ture-whenua-maori-act-1993-rollover-relief)

### No relief for transfers from parents to children

Rollover relief does not extend to parents helping their children own their first home. If parents are co-owners and later sell their share to their children, the bright-line test applies.

Example: Gifting a property to a child

James and Sam bought a home for their daughter Emma and her partner Frankie using the equity in their own home. Emma and Frankie were responsible for all outgoings and maintenance and planned to buy it themselves eventually.

A separate bank account was set up for the mortgage repayments.  Emma and Frankie paid the mortgage.  Any equity gained in the property was for Emma and Frankie. 

James and Sam gifted the property to Emma and Frankie after 18 months and within the 2 year bright-line period. James and Sam were the legal owners of the property. Because they were not living in the home they cannot claim the main home exclusion. 

The transfer of ownership is at market value and because the bright-line test applies, any profit on sale is taxable.

Property Speculation Tax Act 1973
=================================

Archived legislative commentary on the Property Speculation Tax Act 1973 from PIB vol 75 Nov 1973.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 75, November 1973

[More information about _Public Information Bulletins_.](/about/about-our-publications)

The Property Speculation Tax Act 1973 became law in August 1973. The tax relates to all "dispositions" of "land" taking place on or after 15 June 1973.

Under the Act, a profit on the "disposition" of "land" by any "person" is liable for the tax when -

*   There is a period of 2 years or less between "date of acquisition" and "date of disposition", and
*   The profit is not exempt from the tax (see below under Exemptions).

The terms in quotes are defined in the Act.

**Land,** of course, includes an interest in land and buildings or other improvements.

**A disposition of land** includes the sale of an interest in land and the sale of an option. It can also include the sale of shares in a land-owning company.

The **dates of acquisition and disposition** are generally the dates on which possession is given and taken.

**A person** includes a company, local, public or Maori authority and an unincorporated group of individuals.

### Exemptions

### Sales or other Dispositions After Two Years

When the land has been held for more than 2 years by the vendor, there is no liability for Property Speculation Tax.

Exemption applies to land acquired and disposed of within 2 years in the following circumstances:

#### Binding contract before 15 June 1973

If -

*   The "date of disposition" (generally the date on which possession is given and taken) is on or after 15 June 1973, BUT
*   A binding contract was entered into before 15 June 1973

\-the transaction is exempt.

A contract is regarded as binding on a vendor even though subject to conditions, provided the conditions are outside the control of the vendor e.g. subject to the purchaser raising finance.

#### Sale of Own Residence

Generally exempt if -

*   Bought as a residence with no intention of resale at a profit, and
*   The reason for resale developed after purchase and was not principally to realise a profit.

For sales within the two year period the vendor should advise the tax office of the reasons prompting the sale. This can be done in the "exemption" panel on the back of the Property Speculation Tax Certificate (IR21A).

Obvious examples of acceptable reasons for an early sale would be transfer to another town, change in family circumstances, or unsatisfactory features in relation to present residence. Clearly, if a pattern of such transactions emerged, the reasons advanced would require closer scrutiny.

The same tests will in general apply to -

*   A person who acquired a section intending to build a residence but for some reason found it necessary to sell the section before proceeding to build.
*   A property bought as a residence but never occupied because of unforeseen circumstances.

#### Sales of Business Premises

In general terms, the tests for exemption of disposition of business premises are similar to those for the home owner disposing of his home.

Exemption on these grounds is generally not available to businesses which consist principally of -

*   Buying and selling land.
*   Developing land and buildings for sale.
*   Erecting buildings on land for sale.
*   Investing in real estate.

#### Sales After Substantial Improvements Effected

**Renovation of Existing Buildings -** Exempt if all the following conditions are met -

*   the value of existing improvements at date of acquisition is at least half of the purchase price, and
*   the cost of renovations is at least 20%\* of total costs prior to disposition, and
*   \- the owner has made the renovations as part of his business as a builder or renovator. (The Act requires him to be "wholly or principally engaged in a business of renovating buildings or in a business of erecting buildings, the activities of which include the renovating of buildings".)

_Here is an example:_

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Purchase price (Existing improvements are worth more than half the total value, so the first test above is met) | $16,000 |
| Costs of renovations(including own labour) | $ 4,000\* |
| Total Costs | $20,000 |

As the improvements amount to not less than 20% of the total costs such a sale within 2 years would be exempt.

\*_A simple test to determine the minimum amount of improvements required is to take one-quarter of the purchase price._

**Building or Development -** Exempt if improvements added between acquisition and disposition are at least 40%\*\* of total costs prior to disposition.

_Here is an example:_

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Cost of land | $6,000 |
| Improvements - subdivisional costs, or cost of building | $ 4,000\*\* |
| Total Costs | $10,000 |

As the improvements amount to not less than 40% of the total costs such a sale within 2 years would be exempt.

\*\*_A simple test to determine the minimum amount of improvements required is to take two-thirds of the purchase price._

A self-employed builder or renovator may have a fair valuation of his own labour taken into account in deciding whether the 40% or 20% improvement requirement has been met, but cannot deduct the value of his own labour in arriving at his profit. The value of labour should be agreed with the tax office where necessary.

**A Will or Intestacy -** Exemption applies to the transfer of properties coming to the executor or administrator of an estate or to a beneficiary under a will or intestacy. These may also be disposed of by the trustee or beneficiary without being subject to the tax.

**Compulsory sales to the Crown or a local authority are generally exempt.**

### Certificates, Returns And Payments

*   In respect of all dispositions of land a special certificate (Form IR21A) is required irrespective of whether or not Property Speculation Tax is payable. These forms are available from all tax offices.
*   This certificate should accompany the instrument which is presented to the tax office for Stamp Duty purposes.
*   A simpler procedure for dispositions clearly outside the 2 year period is being examined.
*   If there is a liability for property Speculation Tax a Return Form (IR21) should be sent to the tax office by the vendor. This return is required within 2 months from the "date of disposition" and payment must be made at the same time.

### Calculation Of Profit

In general terms, the "assessable profit" will be the difference between the sale price and the cost price of the property plus and minus any intervening receipts and expenditure not taken into account for income tax purposes.

The point about income and expenditure for income tax purposes is that income, such as rents, and expenditure, such as repairs and maintenance, will be properly returnable for income tax purposes in the normal way.

### Rates Of Property Speculation Tax

| Where the period Between Date of Acquisition and Date of Disposition is - | The Rate of Tax Applicable to Profit will be - |
| --- | --- |
| 6 months or less | 90% of assessable profit |
| Exceeding 6 and not exceeding 9 months | 85% of assessable profit |
| Exceeding 9 and not exceeding 12 months | 80% of assessable profit |
| Exceeding 12 and not exceeding 15 months | 75% of assessable profit |
| Exceeding 15 and not exceeding 18 months | 70% of assessable profit |
| Exceeding 18 and not exceeding 21 months | 65% of assessable profit |
| Exceeding 21 and not exceeding 24 months | 60% of assessable profit |

If a transaction is liable to Property Speculation Tax it is not also liable to income tax. For land held more than 2 years, there could still be a liability for income tax under the provisions of the general tax law, but this will depend on the particular circumstances of each case.

### Other Matters

The Property Speculation Tax Act should be referred to for particulars of matters not covered by this item.

**Examples are -** 

*   Where land is gifted (or there is some element of gift), the values and dates to be taken into account for donor and donee.
*   Allowable losses.
*   Company share transactions treated as land dispositions.
*   Leases with optional or compulsory purchase provisions.
*   Penal tax and publication of names for evasion.
*   Anti-avoidance provisions to combat attempts to "get around" the Act.

Te tātai utunga ina kāore koe e noho ana i te whare rēti, engari he wā anō ka whakamahia tūmataititia Working out expenses when you do not live in the property but sometimes use it privately
==============================================================================================================================================================================================

You do not deduct all your [shared rental expenses](/api/glossary/item?id={9A548C14-508C-4A7C-AE44-4F85BA8EFC6D})
 when there are rooms in your rental property tenants cannot use, or you have a holiday home you sometimes use (that is not under the mixed-asset rules). You split them using the floor area of the property tenants can use. We call this apportionment.

Make sure you use this method for your rental property type:

[Tax by rental property type](/property/renting-out-residential-property/tax-by-rental-property-type)

Work out the fully deductible expenses
--------------------------------------

This is what you've spent only to earn rental income, such as advertising.

[Rental expense deductions](/property/renting-out-residential-property/residential-rental-income-and-paying-tax-on-it/rental-expense-deductions)

Work out shared expenses
------------------------

These are your total [shared rental expenses](/api/glossary/item?id={9A548C14-508C-4A7C-AE44-4F85BA8EFC6D})
 for the year.  

Work out the total floor area of your property
----------------------------------------------

You'll need to do this in square metres. For example, 140m2.

Work out the area of your property that cannot be used
------------------------------------------------------

This is the area of the room or rooms your tenants or guests cannot use.

For example, one room is 20m2. You use it to store private items and it's not available to guests.

Divide area available to guests or tenants by total property area
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This is your shared use apportionment.

In our example, the area only guests can use is 120m2. This is total property area (140m2) minus the area guests cannot use (20m2).  

You then work out the percentage you can deduct in the following way:

Divide the area guests can use by the total property area (120 divided by 140). Convert the amount to a percentage. In this example you can deduct 86% of the property's expenses.

Multiply the shared expenses by the shared use expense apportionment
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Multiply your total shared expenses by the shared use apportionment. This is your shared rental expense total you can deduct.

Add your shared expenses to your fully deductible rental expenses
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Add the fully deductible expenses to your total shared expenses.

This is your total rental expenses. 

Add up the days your property was rented out or available to rent
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This is your total income-earning use days. For example, your property is rented or available to rent 300 days in the year.

You’ll need to keep records for your property for us to see it's available for rent.

[Rental expense records](/property/renting-out-residential-property/residential-rental-income-and-paying-tax-on-it/rental-expense-records)

Divide your income-earning use days by days in the year
-------------------------------------------------------

For example, 300 divided by 365. Make the result a percentage. In our example divided usage is 82%.

Multiply your divided usage by total rental expenses.
-----------------------------------------------------

For example 82% multiplied by total rental expenses.

These are your allowable rental expenses. You can deduct them from your property's gross rental income.

After the deduction, the amount left over is what you'll pay income tax on.

What happens next
-----------------

Once you've worked out your allowable rental expenses, check this pay tax on your rental income page to see what to do next:

Determination PROV 22: Provisional depreciation rate for Dairy Plant Dry Store Buildings
========================================================================================

Determination PROV22 (2012) sets a provisional depreciation rate for 'Dairy Plant Dry Store Buildings'.

The Commissioner has determined the estimated useful life and depreciation rate applicable to dry store buildings used in the "Dairy Plant" industry. A dry store building typically has a reinforced concrete floor, with steel framing and galvanised steel wall and roof cladding. It is used for the safe storage of processed dairy products, which are particularly susceptible to contamination.

This depreciation determination applies to dry store buildings that are built adjacent to and are closely inter-related to the milk powder dryer building. The "Dairy Plant" industry category provides a diminishing value depreciation rate of 13% for "Powder dryer buildings", based on an estimated useful life of 15.5 years. Within the dairy industry, the second time that a powder dryer building is demolished and replaced, the adjacent dry store building would also be required to be replaced.

In the case of those dry store buildings that are located adjacent to the powder dryer building, the Commissioner considers there are a number of factors that would mean that the useful life of a dry store building would have a useful life that is closely aligned to the useful life of the powder dryer building. These are:

*   The degree to which the dry store is integral to the production of the powder dryer plant. As production increases, storage capacity must also increase, so the dry store building that supports the powder dryer buildings must increase at a similar pace.

*   In the course of producing milk powder corrosive material which has an effect on the physical life of the dry store building is expelled from the powder dryers when the plant is purged between production runs.

*   The Commissioner takes a total life approach to determine the useful life of an asset, which requires the consideration of possible uses of the asset including possible secondary uses for the asset by the current owner. The useful life of an on-site dry store building is closely linked to the cycle of replacing the powder dryer building and unlike those dry store buildings which are not situated within the dairy company's premises (which are a part of the dairy industries distribution network) there would be no secondary use of an on-site dry store building.

The above factors would not, on their own, be sufficient to influence the useful life of a dry store building. However, when considered accumulatively, the Commissioner is satisfied that the useful life of an on-site dry store building, built adjacent to, and integral to, a powder dryer building is 33.3 years.
