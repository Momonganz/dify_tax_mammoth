Look-through companies (LTC) complete an IR7 income tax return each year they're an LTC. For more information about LTCs refer to our Look-through companies - IR879 guide. If yours is an Australian company or part of an imputation group, see page 7. Non-active companies A non-active company is a company that has: –not received any gross income –no deductions –not disposed of any assets, and –not been party to any transactions during the tax year that: (i) gave rise to income for any person (ii) gave rise to fringe benefits to any employee or any former employee, or (iii) gave rise to a debit in the company's ICA (imputation credit account). These companies may be excused from completing tax returns if they complete a Non-active company declaration - IR433 form. Return due date If the company has a 31 March balance date, you have until 7 July 2021 to complete the return, unless you have been granted an extension of time. If you have a balance date other than 31 March, this date may be different. Contact us if you are not sure of the filing date. If the company has a tax agent, you may have until 31 March 2022 to complete the return. If this applies, contact your agent. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE6 Late filing penalties If you have to complete a return and you do not send us one, you may be charged a late filing penalty. You should apply for an extension of time if you are unable to complete your return on time. The penalty for filing your IR4 late depends on the company's net income. If your income is: –below $100,000, the penalty is $50 –between $100,000 and $1 million (both figures inclusive), the penalty is $250, or –above $1 million, the penalty is $500. If you need an extension to your tax return filing date, tell us your reasons before your return is due. If you get a late filing penalty before applying for an extension, the penalty will stand. If you use a tax agent who has an extension of time arrangement with us and the extension is withdrawn, we will notify you that you must now complete your return. Tax sparing Any company that has claimed a foreign tax credit for a tax sparing arrangement under a double tax agreement, must also complete a Tax sparing disclosure return - IR486 and send it to: International Revenue Strategy Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 Group investment funds If the company's income is solely from Category A income, you must complete an IR4. If the income is solely from Category B income, you must complete an IR6. If the income is a combination of both Category A and Category B income, you must complete an IR4 and IR44E. Read the notes in the IR44E for more information. Research and development (R&D) tax losses You may be able to cash out any R&D losses if your company is a loss-making company that is a resident in New Zealand and your expenditure on R&D salary and wages is 20% or more of your total salary and wage expenditure. For more information go to ird.govt.nz/research-development ird.govt.nz7 Superannuation schemes A superannuation scheme, not registered with the Financial Markets Authority (FMA), which lets beneficiaries contribute, will be treated as a company for tax purposes and must complete IR4 returns. Trans-Tasman imputation and imputation groups Australian companies can elect to maintain a New Zealand imputation account from the 2003-04 tax year. A form of grouping (for imputation purposes only) has also been introduced, which Australian companies may join. Return filing for trans-Tasman imputation Australian companies that make a trans-Tasman imputation election are required to complete an Annual imputation return - IR4J by 31 July, after the end of the tax year. A Companies income tax return - IR4 is not required, unless the company has a permanent establishment (for example, maintains an office) in New Zealand. Return filing for imputation groups Companies income tax return - IR4 Company returns must be completed by: –all New Zealand companies that elect to be a member of an imputation group, and –Australian companies with New Zealand-sourced income. Annual imputation return - IR4J The imputation return for an imputation group should be completed by the group representative on a separate IR4J return. Imputation group members should not include any imputation details on page 7 of the IR4. An exception applies for nominated companies of a resident imputation group where there is an ICA debit balance. Foreign dividend payments - FDP The FDP rules have been fully repealed from 1 April 2017. This means FDP can no longer be included in your annual income tax return. Please do not include FDP credits in Box 14A. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE8 Imputation return Most New Zealand resident companies, unit trusts, producer boards and cooperatives must complete an imputation return each year. If you're an Australian company or part of an imputation group, please read page 7. The following bodies do not have to complete imputation returns: –non-resident companies –look-through companies –trustee companies (but not group investment funds with Category A income) –any company with a constitution that prevents it distributing all its income or property to any proprietor, member or shareholder –companies whose income is completely exempt from tax –local authorities –Crown research institutes –non-active companies –Māori authorities. Note If you need to complete the company's imputation return before the income tax return is due, to allow a refund to be released, complete an Annual imputation return - IR4J. Questions 1 to 8 Company details Fill in Questions 1 to 8 only if the correct information is not printed on the return. Question 2 - Company name If the company has changed its name since the last time a return was completed, please attach a copy of the new certificate of incorporation with the name change details or contact us so we can update our records. Question 4 - Postal address If you have a new postal address, write the details at Question 4. If your new address is a PO Box number, show your box lobby if you have one. If you are unsure of your box lobby please contact New Zealand Post. Leave this address panel blank if the company uses its tax preparer's postal address. The tax preparer will let us know if they change their address. ird.govt.nz9 Question 6 - Business industry classification (BIC) code If you're involved in a business or a trading activity, please write the BIC code only in Box 6. You do not need to give a description. We're required to supply the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) with a code for your business or trading activity, for levy classification and calculation. To work out your main business or trading activity and its code, go to businessdescription.co.nz or call ACC on 0508 426 837. It's important that you choose the code which most accurately reflects your main business or trading activity. Question 7 - Phone number We ask for your daytime phone number so we can contact you if we have any questions about your return. Question 8 - Bank account number The fastest and safest way to get any refund is to have it direct credited to your New Zealand bank account or other deposit account, for example, a building society account. If your bank account number is not preprinted on the return form, include it at Question 8. If your suffix has only 2 digits, enter them in the first 2 squares of the suffix box. Question 9 Non-resident A company is a tax resident of New Zealand if: –it's incorporated in New Zealand –its head office or centre of management is in New Zealand, or –its directors control the company in New Zealand. Otherwise, it's a non-resident for tax purposes. Questions 10 and 10A Imputation Page 7 of the IR4 return is the annual imputation return. If you have made any monetary entries in the annual imputation return, tick "Yes" at Question 10A. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE10 Note If you have completed, or will complete, a separate Annual imputation return - IR4J, tick "No" at Question 10. Question 11 Has the company ceased? If this is a final return, include a set of accounts up to the date the company ceased trading and include details of any distribution of assets and liabilities. If the company is registered for GST or as an employer, you will need to complete a Business cessation - IR315 form to finalise your records. Depending on the company's circumstances, a number of other issues may need to be finalised, for example: –outstanding returns –arrears –FBT or ACC –imputation account balances (for qualifying companies) –specified superannuation contributions –RWT on dividends, and –10-year bonus issues. Find out how to finalise the company's tax accounts or deregister for GST at ird.govt.nz Note A company is still a legal entity until it is taken off the Companies Register. A company can stop trading (become non-active) but still have tax obligations such as completing returns. Non-active companies can be excused from completing returns - see page 5. ird.govt.nz11 Company tax return Question 12 Income from schedular payments If the company has received any schedular payments, we will send you a summary of income. Add up the total tax withheld and all the gross payments shown on the summary of income and write the totals in Boxes 12A and 12B. The summary of income form may not contain all the company's earnings information. If any details are missing, please include them at Question 12. If the company received a payment with no tax deducted, include the gross amount in Box 12B. Mineral mining tax credit Include in Box 12A the amount of refundable tax credit being claimed where a tax loss is incurred on disposal of land or by claiming rehabilitation expenditure. Transferring tax deductions Tax deducted from schedular payments made to close companies can be transferred directly to the company's shareholder-employee(s) in some circumstances. You'll need to reduce the amount claimed in Box 12A by the amount of tax deducted from schedular payments which has been transferred direct to a shareholder-employee of the company. You will still need to include the total schedular payments made to the company in Box 12B. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE12 Example LLC received schedular payments of $10,000 with total tax deducted of $2,000 during the year. The $10,000 is attributable to the company's shareholder- employee through the attribution rule. LLC can transfer up to $2,000 of the tax deducted from the schedular payments it received to the company's shareholder-employee(s). LLC transfers the full $2,000 of tax to the company's sole shareholder-employee. As the full amount of tax has been transferred from LLC the amount in Box 12A should be $0. If the company is transferring tax deducted to shareholder- employee(s) it should attach details of the transfer to the return. The amount of tax transferred from the company to its shareholder-employee(s) will also need to be recorded as a debit entry in the company's imputation credit account - see Question 45C on page 49. Question 13 New Zealand interest Interest from all New Zealand sources must be shown in the return. Write the total of all RWT deducted in Box 13A. If the company has had NRWT deducted from New Zealand interest, include this in Box 13A. Add up all the gross interest amounts (before the deduction of any tax) and write the total in Box 13B. Interest on broken term deposits If you have broken a term deposit during the year, you may have to account for "negative interest". This is interest repaid on the term deposit and may reduce the amount of interest to declare on the tax return. If the term deposit was broken in full, or it was business- related, deduct the negative interest from the gross interest amount shown on the RWT withholding certificate. Deduct the allowable negative interest part, using the worksheet below, before entering the gross amount at Question 13 of the tax return. In all other cases, the negative interest is deductible in a later tax return when the term deposit matures. ird.govt.nz13 Worksheet Copy your gross interest from your RWT withholding certificate to Box 1. 1 Print any negative interest you have paid in Box 2. 2 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1 and print the answer in Box 3. Copy this amount to Box 13B of your tax return. 3 Interest paid or charged by Inland Revenue If we paid you interest, include it in Box 13B for the income year the company received the interest. If the company paid us interest, include it as a deduction in the return for the income year the interest is paid. Note If expenses are deductible against the interest income, claim them at Box 20B. Do not send us interest statements with the return. Keep these in case we ask for them later. Income from financial arrangements If the company was a party to a financial arrangement, such as government stock, local authority stock, mortgage bonds, futures contracts or deferred property settlements, the income or expenditure from the financial arrangement may have to be calculated using a spreading method, rather than on a cash basis. If the financial arrangement matures or is sold, remitted or transferred, a "wash-up" calculation known as a base price adjustment must be made. Any RWT will be deducted on a cash basis. Show the RWT deducted and any income from the financial arrangement in Boxes 13A and 13B. Question 14 New Zealand dividends Generally, dividends are taxable. However, there is an exemption for dividends paid between members of a wholly owned group. To work out the total gross dividends, add up all net dividends received, any imputation credits, and any RWT deductions. Write the total of all dividends in Box 14B. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE14 Note The FDP rules have been fully repealed from 1 April 2017. Do not include any FDP credits in Box 14A. Dividend tax credits The total tax credits for dividends (for example imputation credits) you can claim is limited to the income tax payable (28%) on each dividend the company receives. This is to ensure that surplus tax credits are not used to shelter tax on other income. Work out whether you need to apply this limitation to the dividend tax credits you will claim. Copy your total gross dividends (calculated for each dividend that had an imputation credit) from Box 14B to Box 1. 1 Multiply Box 1 by 0.28 (28%), and write the result in Box 2. 2 Write your total dividend tax credits (calculated for that dividend) in Box 3. 3 For each dividend, claim a dividend tax credit for the lower amount shown in Box 2 or Box 3. Write the total dividend imputation credits you are allowed to claim in Box 14. In Box 14A write the sum of your total dividend RWT credits you are allowed to claim. Note If expenses are deductible against the dividend income, claim them at Box 20B. Unit trusts Distributions from unit trusts will generally be taxable. The statement you receive from the unit trust should show the amounts to include in the return. For unit trusts that are also portfolio investment entities (PIEs) see page 19. ird.govt.nz15 Transfer of deductible expenses between member and master funds From the 2002-03 income year a member fund may, in certain circumstances, elect to transfer deductible expenses to a master fund. The master fund must invest, in whole or in part, in the member fund. The master fund can then deduct the transferred expenses. A member fund can include a group investment fund that derives Category A income, a public unit trust or a superannuation fund. A master fund can include a group investment fund that derives Category A income or a public unit trust. A public unit trust includes: –retail unit trusts, whose units are offered to the public and which have 100 or more unit holders –wholesale unit trusts, whose units are held by widely held investment vehicles such as other unit trusts or superannuation funds. Member or master funds wanting to take advantage of this provision should include details of the adjustment in a tax reconciliation statement accompanying the return. The information should accompany the returns of both funds involved in the transfer. For more information see our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 13, No 11 (November 2001). Qualifying companies Generally, if a qualifying company is a shareholder in a company that is not a qualifying company, all dividends the qualifying company derives from the other company are taxable. Dividends derived by a company (that has been a qualifying company at any time before deriving the dividends) are taxable. If a qualifying company is a shareholder in another qualifying company, only dividends with imputation credits attached and a return of a 10-year bonus issue before the 10-year period expires, are taxable. Dividends with no imputation credits attached, or a return of a 10-year bonus issue 10 years from the payment date, are exempt income. A distribution of a 10-year bonus issue before the 10-year period has expired, made when the company winds up, is not taxable. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE16 If you need more help, read our guide Qualifying companies - IR435. Do not send us dividend statements with the return, keep them in case we ask for them later. Question 15 Ma ̄ori authority distributions Māori authorities can make various types of distributions. Fill in Question 15 if you received any taxable Māori authority distributions between 1 April 2020 and 31 March 2021. The Māori authority that paid you the distribution will send you a Māori authority distribution statement. Credits attached to distributions The Māori authority may attach a credit to the distribution it makes to members. This credit will be classified as a Māori authority credit and is part of the tax the Māori authority has already paid on its profits, so the distributions are not taxed twice. What to show in your return Your Māori authority distribution statement shows the amount of: –the distribution made to you, including the taxable portion and the non-taxable portion, and –Māori authority credit. These amounts, not including any non-taxable distribution, will need to be transferred to the relevant boxes at Question 15. Example A Māori authority makes a pre-tax profit of $10,000. It pays tax on this profit of $1,750 (Māori authority tax rate of 17.5%) and distributes the entire profit to its 10 members. Each member will receive $825 as a cash distribution and $175 of Māori authority credits. Each member of the authority liable to file an IR4 return would show the following information at Question 15: – Box 15B - $1,000 (made up of $825 + $175) – Box 15A - $175 ird.govt.nz17 Question 16 Partnership, estate or trust income If the company received any income from a partnership, estate or trust, write any tax credits in Box 16A and the income totals in Box 16B. Do not include any: –overseas income - show this at Question 18 along with any credits attached, or –dividend imputation credits attached to dividends (include these in Box 14, RWT withheld in Box 14A and the gross dividend in Box 14B). Add up any other tax credits from partnerships, estates or trusts and write the total in Box 16A. Add up all the other income from partnerships, estates or trusts and write the total in Box 16B. Losses from limited partnerships If the company is claiming a loss from a limited partnership and you need help working out the amount you can claim, go to ird.govt.nz Estate or trust income If you received a taxable distribution from a non-complying trust, please attach a note with your return giving details of the amount and any associated tax credits. We separate taxable distributions from a non-complying trust because they are taxed at a different rate. We need these details to work out your tax liability correctly. Question 18 Overseas income If your company received income from or while based overseas, between 1 April 2020 and 31 March 2021, show it in New Zealand dollars at Box 18B. If the company is a New Zealand resident for tax purposes, you must include any foreign contract or service income in Box 18B. Foreign investment fund (FIF) If the company held rights, such as shares, units or an entitlement to benefit in any foreign company, unit trust, superannuation scheme or life insurance policy, at any time during the 2021 income year, you may be required to calculate FIF income or loss. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE18 If the company has an interest in a controlled foreign company (CFC), they must calculate any attributed income or loss from that interest. Generally, the company will use the fair dividend rate to calculate FIF income. The main exclusions from an interest in an FIF are: –investments in certain Australian resident companies listed on approved indices on the Australian stock exchange, that maintain franking accounts –interest in certain Australian unit trusts –limited exemptions for interests in certain venture capital interests that move offshore (for 10 income years from the income year in which the company migrates from New Zealand), and –a 10% or greater interest in a CFC. CFC income and losses New rules were introduced in 2009 for calculating income or losses from a CFC. If the company has an interest in a CFC, they must calculate any attributed income or loss from that interest. Losses from a CFC cannot be used to offset domestic income or be included in domestic losses carried forward to the next tax year. Generally, these losses can only offset income or future income from CFCs resident in the same country as the CFC that incurred the loss. When CFC income or losses are calculated under the new rules, transitional rules apply to the use of carried forward losses incurred under the old rules. You can find more information on the rules at ird.govt.nz and in our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 21, No 8 (October/ November 2009). What to show in your return You can convert all overseas income and tax credits to New Zealand dollars by:  using the rates table available from ird.govt.nz/tools-calculators  contacting the overseas section of a trading bank and asking for the exchange rate for the day you received your overseas income. ird.govt.nz19 If the income was received from a financial arrangement, refer to Determination G9A or G9C under section 90 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Write the total of the allowable overseas tax paid in Box 18A. Include in Box 18B income before the deduction of any tax. Credit for tax paid overseas will be limited to the amount of New Zealand tax payable on that income. Please note that Australian franking credits or tax credits on dividends from the United Kingdom cannot be claimed. Staple proof of tax paid overseas to the top of page 3 of the return. Foreign tax credits attached to dividends that are not required to be returned under the FIF rules can be claimed up to the amount of New Zealand tax payable on the FIF interest. Some foreign dividends have New Zealand imputation credits attached or New Zealand RWT deducted. These credits are not subject to the foreign tax credit limitation rule. Investments in portfolio investment entities (PIEs) Certain PIEs attribute their net income/loss and tax credits to the investors. Companies that are investors include the attributed income or loss in their tax return. Each year, the PIE is required to provide an investor statement setting out the details of the income/loss attributed to the investor for the year. The statement also shows the various types of tax credits associated with the income that has been attributed. These tax credits are subject to the tax credit limits calculated in relation to the tax on the attributed PIE income. The attributed PIE income/loss is included in the company's return for the period that includes the end of the PIE's income year. Generally, PIEs have a 31 March balance date. The amount of income the company derives as a distribution by a PIE is excluded income unless it is fully imputed dividends from a listed PIE. Dividends from these PIEs are not liable for RWT. For more information, go to ird.govt.nz or read our guides, Information for companies that invest in PIEs - IR857 and Portfolio investment entity: a guide for PIEs - IR860. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE20 Question 19 Income and expenditure from residential property This question applies to close companies that own residential property, including overseas property that come within the residential property deduction rules in subpart EL of the Income Tax Act 2007. The residential property deduction rules, and Question 19, do not apply to residential land that is owned by companies other than close companies. Close company - generally a company with 5 or fewer natural persons whose total voting interests are more than 50%. Associated persons are treated as 1 person. Most residential rental properties are subject to the residential property deduction rules (also known as the ring-fencing rules). The rules generally limit the amount of residential deductions you can claim in the year to the total amount of residential income earned in that year. If the residential property makes a loss it must be carried forward to the next year in which residential income, including income from properties held on revenue account, is earned. There are 2 levels of exclusions from the residential rules. Any rental income or loss and net income or loss from a taxable disposal is fully excluded from the new rules if the property is:  property subject to the mixed-use asset rules (for example, a holiday home rented out part-time and not used for at least 62 days in the income year, or 62 working days in the income year if it's usually only used on working days)  property owned by companies other than close companies  property owned by government enterprises, or  certain employee accommodation. For these types of property, the existing rules apply with the rental income or loss shown at Box 20 and net income or net loss from a taxable disposal shown in Box 21. Any rental net loss and net loss from a taxable disposal is partially excluded from the new rules if it is for:  property that will always be taxed on sale, being revenue account property of a person in the business of building, developing or dealing in land, or  other revenue account property the person has notified us they want the exclusion to apply to. ird.govt.nz21 For these types of property any rental net loss is shown at Box 20 and taxable disposal net loss is shown at Box 21. Net rental income and net income from a taxable disposal plus any depreciation recovered is shown as residential income at Box 19A. Refer to the Rental income – IR264 guide for information on when the rules apply, how to calculate your income, the amount of deductions you can claim for this year, and the amount of any excess deductions that must be carried forward. The residential property deduction rules also apply to any company who has borrowed money to acquire an interest in certain entities with significant rental property holdings - a residential land-rich entity - and has interest expenditure on the borrowed money. Residential land-rich entity - a close company, partnership or look-through company that holds more than 50% of its assets by value in residential land directly or indirectly. They come under the interposed entities rules as part of the residential property deduction rules. For more information about the interposed entity rules, see page 60 of the Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No.8 September 2019. Completing Question 19 in your return Tick the method you used to calculate your residential property income and deductions. You can use 1 of the following:  Portfolio basis – combine the income and deductions for all rental properties in a portfolio.  Individual, property-by-property basis – income and deductions of individual property calculated separately to other property. You need to maintain separate records for each property to choose this option.  Combination of the property-by-property basis and portfolio basis – choose to apply different methods to different property. The Residential property deductions worksheets – IR1226 can be used to calculate the information required to be shown in your return. Calculate and identify the amounts for Boxes 19A to 19F using your chosen method/s. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE22 Write the total residential income in Box 19A. This is the total of: a. all residential rental income from a portfolio and/or individual property b. all depreciation recovery income for assets disposed of from a portfolio and/or individual property c. net income from the taxable sale/disposal of a property in a portfolio and/or individual property, and d. all net residential rental income, depreciation recovery income and net income from the taxable disposal of property from residential property excluded because it is held on revenue account. Only include the net income from a disposal once. Do not include in Question 19 rental losses from properties that are not covered by the residential property deduction rules, as outlined on page 20. Enter those amounts in Question 20 instead. Write any net tax losses from disposals of rental properties that are excluded in Box 21B. If you are a partner in a partnership or owner of a look-through company and have been attributed residential income shown in Box 26G on the IR7P or IR7L include that here. Write the total residential rental deductions for residential rental properties in Box 19B. This is the total deductions for the current year – Box 14 on the Rental income – IR3R if completed. If you are a partner in a partnership or owner of a look- through company and have been attributed residential rental deductions shown in Box 26M on the IR7P or IR7L include that in Box 19B. If the company has breached the continuity rules, or the company is transferring excess deductions to a wholly owned group member, you'll need to reduce the current year deductions in Box 19B to reflect the adjustment. If the company is receiving excess deductions from a wholly owned group member, you'll need to increase the current year deductions in Box 19B. The transfer of excess deductions is not a loss offset nor a subvention payment. ird.govt.nz23 The brought forward and carry forward boxes are calculated by our system when your return is processed. If the deductions are too low, you'll need to contact us so we can change it when we process your return. Keep good records for the adjustment and include a note with your return. See Question 27 for details on the continuity rules. Include the amount of any interest paid on an investment in a residential land rich entity that relates to the rental activity in Box 19B. Include the amount of interest paid that does not relate to the rental property in Box 20. Write the total excess residential rental deductions brought forward from last year in Box 19C. Add Boxes 19B and 19C for total rental deductions. Calculate the amount of allowable deductions you can claim this year adjusting for excess deductions. Write the total Residential rental deductions claimed this year in Box 19D. This should equal Box 19B plus Box 19C less the amount of excess deductions for each property and/or property portfolio shown in Box 19F. The amount cannot exceed total residential income at Box 19A, unless there was a taxable sale/disposal of a rental property. Combine the net income results (after adjusting for any excess deductions) for all properties and write the total in Box 19E. Your total Net residential income in Box 19E cannot be a loss, unless there has been either a taxable disposal of a property held on the property-by-property basis, or a taxable disposal of all properties or the last property held in a portfolio. Any losses are counted as zero unless the loss is the result of either:  excess deductions released from either a taxable disposal of a property held on the property-by-property basis, or a taxable disposal of all properties or the last property held in a portfolio, or  claimable interest paid on your investment in a residential land-rich entity. Refer to the Rental income – IR264 guide. Write the total excess deductions for the year to be carried forward to next year in Box 19F. This is calculated as Residential rental deductions Box 19B minus Residential rental deductions claimed this year Box 19D. This includes the amount of any excess deductions to be carried forward for interest paid on an investment in a land rich entity in Box 19F. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE24 NOTES Note 1 If you sell/dispose of an individual property and the sale is not taxable; or you sell/dispose of the last property in a portfolio and at least 1 of the sales in the portfolio was not taxable, any excess deductions will transfer to another property or portfolio and carried forward to a future year in which you earn income from a residential rental property (including properties on revenue account). Note 2 If you sell/dispose of an individual property and the sale is taxable, or you sell/dispose of the last rental property in a portfolio, and the sale of all your rental properties in a portfolio were taxable, any remaining loss/excess deductions are released and can be offset against other income. However, this does not include any excess deductions transferred to the portfolio/property. Note 3 If you want to claim that a property is held on revenue account where the sale may be taxable, you need to tell us the property details of the property. You will be stating the sale will be a taxable sale when the property is disposed of. You must be able to separately identify the deductions relating to the property. For more information read the Rental income – IR264 guide. ird.govt.nz25 Question 20 Business or other rental income Write the net profit or loss in Box 20B. This is the amount of income or loss after the deduction of all allowable business expenditure, including shareholders' salaries paid or credited. Only include net residential rental income or losses not included at Question 19 and rents from a commercial property in Box 20B. Do not include any income already shown at Questions 12 to 16 and 19, losses from CFCs (see the notes to Question 37 on page 41) or claim donations here (see the notes to Question 25 on page 31). Note If expenses are deductible against income declared in Questions 12 to 14, claim them here. Attach either: –a fully completed Financial statements summary - IR10 form, or –the company's financial accounts. The IR10 is a statistics form that sets out a general summary of information from the financial accounts. If you complete an IR10 you do not need to send the financial accounts as well. You still need to complete them (unless the company is very small) and keep them in case we ask for them. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE26 Very small companies are not required to prepare financial accounts if these conditions apply during the income year. The company:  is not part of a group  has not derived income over $30,000, or  has not incurred expenditure over $30,000. Companies that do not prepare financial accounts must fill in an IR10 using information from their trial balance or financial records. For more information about who has to prepare financial accounts and minimum financial reporting requirements, go to our website at ird.govt.nz/records The attribution rule Under the attribution rule, anyone whose actions cause an "associated person" (company, trust or partnership) to earn income, can be personally liable for tax on that income. If this rule applies to persons associated to your organisation, it will affect the amount of taxable income in this return. To find out how to apply this rule, refer to our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB), Vol 12, No 12 (December 2000) and Vol 13, No 11 (November 2001). ird.govt.nz27 Question 21 Income from taxable property sales/disposals Include all income from land sales that are excluded from the residential property deduction rules. Tax losses (except bright-line losses) from disposals of residential property are also included under this question. Net income from a bright-line sale is generally included under Residential income at Question 19. Profits are taxable if the company bought a property for the purpose of reselling it, or if the company is in the business of buying and selling land and/or buildings. The profits may also be taxable if the company:  Is a builder and improved a property before selling it,  developed or subdivided land and sold sections, or  had a change of zoning on the company property and sold it within ten years of buying it. If the company purchased a residential property on or after 1 October 2015 and sold/disposed of it within a certain period, any profit will be taxable, whether the intention at the time of purchase was for resale or not. This is called the bright-line test. The bright-line test applies to:  properties purchased/acquired on or after 1 October 2015 through to 28 March 2018 inclusive and sold/disposed of within 2 years, and  properties purchased/acquired on or after 29 March 2018 and sold within 5 years. The bright-line test needs to be considered when none of the other land sale rules apply to the disposal of the property. Income and losses for property captured by the bright-line test are treated differently in the tax return:  After a bright line sale, when net income (a profit) is made, the profit is included in the residential rental income Box (19A). Unless the property is included in a portfolio expenses from other properties cannot be offset against the net income from the disposal,  After a bright-line sale, when a net loss is made, any excess deductions must be carried forward to a later income year when they can be used to offset net income from the land sale provisions, or future disposals captured by the bright-line rules. A bright-line loss is not recorded in the tax return. Please keep your own record of any bright-line losses you have made. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE28 If the company is a New Zealand tax resident it will need to pay tax on its worldwide income under the New Zealand tax law. This includes any property sales worldwide whether caught under the bright-line test or other property rules. For more information on property sales see our guide Buying and selling residential property - IR313. Complete a Bright-line property sale information - IR833 form for each property sold/disposed of and include it with your return. The form explains how to calculate and correctly return the resulting profit or loss. You can download the form at ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Complete the form even if the details have been included in a Financial statements summary - IR10 or set of accounts, unless the income will be included in the company return as part of the business income as a property speculator, property dealer, developer or builder. Write the income or loss (other than a bright-line income or loss) at Box 21B. Question 21A Residential land withholding tax (RLWT) credit If the company is an "offshore RLWT person" and has sold or transferred residential property located in New Zealand, RLWT may have been deducted from the sale price. The company should have received a statement on the completion of the sale process showing the amount of RLWT deducted. The company can claim a credit for any RLWT deducted. Show the amount of RLWT deducted, less any RLWT paid back to the company and/or transferred to outstanding amounts during the income year. If there was more than 1 amount of RLWT deducted, show the combined amount, less any RLWT paid back to the company and/or transferred to outstanding amounts during the income year. Question 22 Insurance premiums paid to an overseas insurer Special rules apply to any company paying a premium, including a reinsurance premium, to a non-resident insurer. If you're paying a premium to a non-resident insurer you need to get a separate IRD number to account for the tax on the premium income. This is because you're considered to be the insurer's agent. ird.govt.nz29 You will need to complete an IR4 return under this separate IRD number and declare premiums paid as the only income received. Only 10% of the total gross premiums paid to overseas insurers is subject to the company tax rate of 28%. This equals 2.8% of the total premiums paid. Any premiums paid to insurers in Switzerland are not subject to tax in New Zealand and should be deducted from the total gross premiums paid. Agency obligations also extend to other New Zealand residents, for example, brokers, who may initially collect premiums for payment to the non-resident insurer. If there is any default, the insured person is responsible for the tax. Print the gross amount of premiums paid to a non-resident insurer in Box 22. Print the gross amount of premiums paid to Switzerland in Box 22A. Deduct the figure in Box 22A from Box 22 and multiply the net amount by 0.1 (10%). Print your answer in Box 22B and copy this amount to Box 30. No other income should be returned as an agent for an overseas insurer. The company still needs to declare other income under its original IRD number. If you have any enquiries, contact: Large Enterprises Services Investigations and Advice Private Bag 39984 Wellington Mail Centre Lower Hutt 5045 Phone 0800 443 773 Question 23 Other income Show any other income received by the company at Question 23. For example, the sale of: –shares or other property –securities –income from an undertaking or scheme. Income from sale of non-FIF shares or other property Profits from the sale of shares and other property are taxable if the company: –buys and sells shares or other property as a business, or –buys shares or other property for the purpose of resale. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE30 This does not apply if shares are FIFs. List the details of income and expenses from these sales on a sheet of paper and staple it to the top of page 3 of the return. Include the total profit in Box 23B. Losses from shares or other property that are not a foreign investment fund (FIF) If the company has made a loss from the sale of an asset that was not a FIF and you can show that any profit made would have been taxable, you may be able to claim the loss as a deduction. Financial arrangements A company must account for income from financial arrangements on an accrual basis. Financial arrangements include government stock, futures contracts and deferred property settlements, excluding short-term agreements for sale and purchase of property. Changes to the rules for the treatment of financial arrangements have split the rules into 2 sets. Generally, the first set applies to financial arrangements entered into before 20 May 1999 and the second applies to financial arrangements entered into on or after that date. Both sets of rules require the income or expenditure to be spread over the term of the financial arrangement. This applies in every case - the company does not have to be in the business of buying or selling financial arrangements, or be intending to sell, as it would with shares. The company may, in certain cases, deduct any losses. Sale or maturity of financial arrangements When a financial arrangement matures or is sold, remitted or transferred, a "wash-up" calculation, known as a base price adjustment, must be made. The calculation ensures that the total gains or losses from the financial arrangement are accounted for. If you need any information on when losses can be deducted or how to calculate a base price adjustment, please contact us. Income from an undertaking or scheme Profits from any undertaking or scheme entered into for the purpose of making a profit are taxable. Describe the undertaking or scheme and list the details of income and expenses from them. Staple this information to the top of page 3 of the return and include the total profit in Box 23B. ird.govt.nz31 Question 25 Donations A company (including an unlisted company with 5 or fewer shareholders) can claim a deduction for donations it makes to any society, institution, association, organisation, trust or fund that has donee organisation status. You can view the list of these organisation at ird.govt.nz/donee Note State-funded tertiary education institutions, state schools and state-integrated schools do not have to be approved to have donee organisation status. The deduction for donations cannot be more than the company's net income after expenses (before the donation deduction is taken into account). Use the following steps to calculate the company's donation deduction.  If the amount in Box 24 is a loss, print nil in Box 25B.  If the donations made by the company exceed the amount in Box 24, copy the amount in Box 24 to Box 25B.  If the donations made by the company do not exceed the amount in Box 24, print the amount of the donations in Box 25B. Question 27 Net losses brought forward Losses from CFCs are not included in Question 27 - see Question 39 on page 42. Before a company is allowed to carry forward net losses it must satisfy one of two tests. 1. Shareholder continuity 49% continuity of minimum voting interest or market value interest must be maintained by a group of persons at all times, from the beginning of the year of net loss to the end of the year of carrying it forward (the continuity period). To check whether the shareholder continuity requirements have been met, use the lowest percentage of economic interest held by each shareholder during the continuity period. To calculate the total lowest economic interest see Question 41 on page 43. 2. Business continuity test This is a business continuity test which allows losses to be carried forward after a change in ownership so long as the underlying business continues i.e. there is no "major change" in the business for 5 years after a change in ownership. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE32 "Major change" refers to the extent the same assets, activities and operations are used to generate income for the company. Only losses incurred in the 2013-14 and later income years can be carried forward under this test. Further information is available at taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz There are 2 types of net losses - specified activity net losses and other net losses. Specified activity net losses These are net losses from specified activities incurred before the 1991 income year. Any loss balance in relation to a specified activity that remained at the end of the 2020 income year must be offset against net income for the 2021 income year before taking into account other losses. The amount of this offset cannot exceed the net income. If the loss balance from specified activities incurred before the 1991 income year exceeds the net income for the 2021 income year, that excess amount is added to the tax loss for the year. The tax loss may be grouped with another company, subject to satisfying the commonality and continuity rules (see Question 29 on page 33). Other net losses Other net losses are all those incurred from the 1991 income year onwards, including any net loss arising from excess imputation credits, and any net losses that were not limited before 1991. Write the total of all specified activity net losses and other net losses the company can bring forward to 2021 in Box 27A, and the amount the company has offset against 2021 income in Box 27B. If the company cannot offset any net losses in the 2021 income year write "0.00" in Box 27B. Note You should be able to find the amount of net loss the company has to bring forward on the loss notice sent to you with the company's 2020 income tax assessment. If you do not have a loss notice, enter the details from your own records. Question 28 Total income after net losses brought forward Subtract Box 27B from Box 26. Print your answer in Box 28. ird.govt.nz33 Question 29 Net losses and subvention payments To offset net losses there must be a common shareholding of at least 66%, and 66% continuity of minimum voting interest must also be maintained (or 66% market value interest if a market value circumstance exists). To calculate voting or market value interest see Question 41 on page 43. To offset a net loss incurred during a current income year, the loss company and the profit company must be members of the same group at all times for that income year. To offset a net loss brought forward, the loss company and the profit company must be members of the same group of companies for the entire period, beginning with the income year the net loss is incurred in and ending with the year of offset. The amount of loss offset cannot exceed the taxable income of the profit company and neither may the amount of loss to be offset exceed the net loss of the loss company. Record individual details of the losses claimed or transferred and subvention payments received or made at Questions 42F or 42G. The total of these must equal Boxes 29 or 29A respectively. Part-year grouping The general part-year grouping rule is that only the part of the net loss incurred in the same period as the profit is derived may be offset, if, during the period: –the loss company maintains continuity of shareholding, and –commonality of shareholding between loss and profit companies has been maintained. Net loss and profit amounts allowed to be offset are based on periods where continuity and commonality requirements are met for all companies taking part in a part-year grouping arrangement. If the company received net losses from another company or made a subvention payment to another company, put a minus sign in the relevant last box. Attach a schedule setting out the names and IRD numbers of the companies and the amount of the payment or loss. If the company is transferring excess residential rental deductions to a wholly owned group member, the transfer is recorded as a reduction of the current year residential rental deductions in Box 19B. Similarly, if the company is receiving excess residential rental deductions from a wholly owned group COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE34 member, the transfer is recorded as an increase of the current year residential rental deductions in Box 19B. Do not record these amounts in Question 29. Refer to Question 19 for details. Qualifying companies Net losses are restricted for grouping and subvention payment purposes. A qualifying company loss can be offset against any group company profit (including non-qualifying company profits). Question 31 Loss carry back Enter the amount of any 2021 loss to carry back to 2020 in Box 31. You will need to amend your 2020 income tax return to include the amount of loss you carry back if you have not already. In your myIR income tax account, select the 2020 income tax period. Go to I want to...> File or amend return. Choose the amendment reason 'Loss carry back'. Select the income type 'You are claiming net loss brought forward' and enter the amount in 'Net losses claimed this year'. Question 32E Foreign investor tax credit The foreign investor tax credit rules reduce the combined income tax and NRWT imposed on foreign investors with interests in a New Zealand company. See Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 20, No 3 (April 2008) for details about the change of company tax rate. A company is entitled to a foreign investor tax credit when it pays a supplementary dividend of the same amount to its non-resident shareholders. The foreign investor tax credit can then be offset against the company's income tax liability. The foreign investor tax credit arises in the income year the supplementary dividend is paid and is to be offset in the following order: 1. Against the company's income tax payable for the year the supplementary dividend is paid. Enter this amount in Box 32E. 2. At the company's election, either: - against the company's income tax liability for any of the previous four income years, or - against the income tax liability for another company in the same wholly owned group of companies for the year the supplementary dividend is paid in or any of the previous four income years. ird.govt.nz35 3. Carried forward to subsequent years for offset against the tax liability of the company or another company in the same wholly owned group of companies. If the company has a foreign investor tax credit that cannot be fully offset against its own income tax liability in the income year the supplementary dividend is paid, attach a note to the front of the return giving details of how to treat any excess credit. Question 32G Imputation credits If the company has imputation credits, it may have a net loss to carry forward. This will happen if the company's total imputation credits are greater than the tax payable at Box 32F. To calculate the net loss to carry forward, subtract the amount at Box 32F from the total imputation credits (Box 32G) and divide the answer by 0.28 (28%). If the deemed net loss is to be offset to other companies within the same group (rather than carried forward), reduce the amount of net loss shown at Box 29 by the amount offset. Question 33 Refunds and/or transfers If you want your refund transferred to another account or to arrears being paid off by an instalment arrangement, tell us the date you would like this done. The date you can choose depends on what tax has been overpaid and whose account you want the credit transferred to. Note If the transfer is to arrears being paid off by an instalment arrangement, you'll need to include a note with your return authorising the transfer and giving the following information: –that the transfer is to arrears currently under an instalment arrangement –the name and IRD number of the taxpayer the transfer should be made to –whether the taxpayer is an "associated taxpayer" –the tax type and period, and –the date you want the transfer to take place. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE36 Question 33B Associated taxpayers For companies, the following persons are associated taxpayers for the purposes of transferring overpaid tax: –another company in the same group of companies –a shareholder-employee of the company –a partner in the same partnership. If you want your refund transferred to another person, you will need to show if they are an associated taxpayer. Transfer date You can ask for your credit to be transferred at any date as long as it is not before the relevant dates set out as follows. For credit transferred: to your account/an associated taxpayer's account If the credit is from excess tax deducted (for example RWT deducted on interest) it's the day after your balance date (or 1 April if your balance date is before 31 March). If the credit is from overpaid provisional tax it's the day you overpaid it. Please note that special rules apply if tax pooling funds have been transferred in. to a non-associated taxpayer's account It's the later of the day you requested the transfer, or the day after you file your return. Future transfer dates If you want your credit transferred at a future date, attach a note to the front of your return with the details of the amount you want transferred, the account you want it transferred to (if it's to another person and they are associated) and the date you want it transferred. If you do not tell us the date you want your credit transferred, we will transfer it at a date we think gives you the greatest advantage. If you want the credit transferred at a different date, you can ask us to change it (even if we have transferred your credit to cover a debt). Requesting transfers on your return You can ask us to transfer a refund to another account by filling out page 4 of the return. If you ask us to, we will transfer the refund to: ird.govt.nz37  the company's own account or an account of someone associated to the company on the later of: –the day after the balance date (or 1 April if your balance date is before 31 March) –the due date in the destination account.  an account of someone not associated to the company on the day after the return was completed. If you want the company's refund transferred at a different date from those listed earlier, you can attach a note to the return, including the details of the account you want the refund transferred to and the transfer date you want. If the transfer is going to another person, tell us if they are associated to the company. Question 34 Initial provisional tax liability A company has an initial provisional tax liability if it: –starts to derive income from a taxable activity in the tax year –had not derived gross income from a taxable activity within the preceding four years, and –has residual income tax (RIT) of $60,000 or more in the current year. New businesses do not pay provisional tax in their first year of operation because there is no RIT from the previous year to base the calculation on. However, companies that have an initial provisional tax liability may be charged interest from the first, second or third instalment date. The instalment date interest applies from is determined by the business start date. Some new businesses make voluntary payments to reduce liability for interest. More information about the dates interest applies from is available in our guide Provisional tax - IR289. There are special rules about how interest is calculated when a company has an initial provisional tax liability and has changed its balance date. For further information, see our Provisional tax - IR289 guide. Print the date the company started to derive income from the taxable activity in Box 34. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE38 Question 35 2022 provisional tax 2022 provisional tax is charged for income the company will earn in the 2022 income year. It is payable in 2, 3 or 6 instalments. There are 3 options for calculating your provisional tax - standard, estimation and ratio. If the company's 2021 RIT is: –$5,000 or less it does not have to pay provisional tax, but it can make voluntary payments –more than $5,000 but expected to be $5,000 or less for 2022 it may estimate 2022 provisional tax at nil –more than $5,000 and expected to be more than $5,000 for 2022 it must pay 2022 provisional tax using 1 of the payment options. Standard option (S) Under this option, your 2022 provisional tax is your 2021 RIT (where it is more than $5,000) plus 5%. Note If you think your income for 2022 will be more than your 2021 income, you can make voluntary payments over and above the amount you have to pay under the standard option. Estimation option (E) Companies can estimate their 2022 provisional tax. They can re-estimate any number of times up to and including their final instalment due date. If the company's 2022 RIT is expected to be less than its 2021 RIT, estimating may prevent the company from paying more than it has to. Note An estimate must be fair and reasonable at each instalment it applies to. If you use the estimation option, see "Not taking reasonable care penalty" and "Interest" on page 39. If the company estimates its provisional tax, write E in Box 35A and the amount of 2022 provisional tax in Box 35B. If you estimate your provisional tax your instalments should be one-third of your estimation. If you're using the ratio option and select E at Box 35A this will mean you are electing to stop using the ratio option. ird.govt.nz39 Ratio option (R) If you're GST registered, you may qualify to use the ratio option to calculate your provisional tax. Only enter R at Box 35A if you have already elected to use the ratio option. Your application to use the ratio option must be made by phone or in writing before the beginning of the income year you want to use it. If you've already elected to use the ratio option and want to continue using it, enter R at Box 35A. There is more information about the ratio option in our guide Provisional tax - IR289. Not taking reasonable care penalty When you estimate the company's 2022 provisional tax, your estimate must be fair and reasonable. If the 2022 RIT is greater than the provisional tax paid, you may be liable for a not taking reasonable care penalty of 20% of the underpaid provisional tax. Interest If the company has paid too much provisional tax, we may pay interest. If it has not paid enough provisional tax, we may charge interest. Interest the company pays is tax deductible, while interest we pay is taxable income. Election to be a provisional tax payer A company is a provisional tax payer for the 2021 year if its RIT for that year is more than $5,000. If the 2021 RIT is $5,000 or less but the company paid provisional tax for the year, the company may elect to be a provisional tax payer for that year. This may affect the interest the company may be entitled to for that year. To elect to be a provisional tax payer for the 2021 year, attach a note to the front of the 2021 return. Change in balance date There are special rules about when provisional tax is due and how interest is calculated if there has been a change in the balance date. For more information, read our guides Penalties and interest - IR240 and Provisional tax - IR289. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE40 Tax pooling Tax pooling allows taxpayers to pool provisional tax payments, offsetting underpayments by overpayments within the same pool. This reduces their possible exposure to late payment penalties and interest. For more information about tax pooling, including a list of intermediaries, go to ird.govt.nz/tax-pooling Payment dates 2022 provisional tax Generally, a company with a 31 March balance date pays provisional tax by the following due dates: First instalment 28 August 2021 Second instalment 15 January 2022 Third instalment 7 May 2022 A company with a balance date other than 31 March generally pays provisional tax on the 28th day of the 5th, 9th and 13th months after the balance date. There are 2 exceptions:  If it would be due on 28 December it is due on 15 January, and  If it would be due on 28 April it is due on 7 May. These dates will alter if the company is registered for GST and:  the GST filing frequency is six-monthly, or  provisional tax is paid through the ratio option. If either of these situations apply to you, read our guide Provisional tax - IR289. 2021 end-of-year income tax Companies that have an agent and an extension of time may have until 7 April 2022 to pay their tax. If you think this applies to your company, contact your agent. A company with a balance date between 1 March and 30 September must pay its end-of-year income tax (Box 32L) and any interest by 7 February 2022. A company with a balance date between 1 October and 28 February must pay its end-of-year income tax by the 7th day of the month before the following year's balance date. ird.govt.nz41 How to make payments You can make payments by:  direct debit in myIR  credit or debit card at ird.govt.nz/pay  internet banking - most New Zealand banks have a pay tax option. When making a payment, include:  your IRD number  the account type you are paying, and  the period the payment relates to. Find all the details of our payment options at ird.govt.nz/pay Late payment If you do not pay a bill on time, you may have to pay penalties and interest. Contact us if you are not able to pay on time. We'll look at your payment options, which may include an instalment arrangement. Find out more at ird.govt.nz/penalties Question 37 Foreign rights If you calculated CFC or FIF income at Question 18 you may be required to complete an additional disclosure form for that investment. For all interests of 10% or more in a foreign company, the additional disclosure is required. For other investments, the requirement for an additional disclosure depends on the company you are preparing the Companies income tax return - IR4 for.  If the company is not widely held or a PIE, additional disclosure is not required if the investments are in countries New Zealand holds a double tax agreement with (as at 31 March 2021) and the fair dividend rate or comparative value has been used.  If the company is widely held or a PIE you are required to file an additional disclosure. The disclosure forms are available at ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Contact us if you need help to find the appropriate disclosure form. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE42 For information on foreign exchange rates, go to ird.govt.nz/tools-calculators Find out more about the base erosion profit shifting (BEPS) hybrid mismatch rules at ird.govt.nz/beps Question 38 Share repurchases When amounts distributed to shareholders on cancellation or repurchase of shares fall below specified thresholds, the amounts are taxable in full to shareholders as dividends. When distributions on repurchases exceed those thresholds, or occur through the stock exchange, the distributions will be deducted from available subscribed capital of the company and will be tax-free to the shareholders. However, this is only to the extent that the distributions are not in lieu of dividends. If the subscribed capital of the company has been depleted, the distributions will be taxable. Specific rules also govern the repurchase and subsequent sale of Treasury stock. The total value entered on the return should be the aggregate value of all distributions made by the company during the year for company shares repurchased, redeemed, cancelled or purchased as Treasury stock. Question 39 Foreign-sourced dividends Generally, funds would use the default FIF income calculation method (the fair dividend rate) which does not tax dividends separately. However, the foreign tax deducted from the dividend can be claimed as a credit against the tax payable on the calculated FIF income. A credit for any tax paid by the foreign company (on its earnings) may be allowed in calculating the amount payable by the New Zealand company. Any NRWT deducted from the foreign dividend paid to the New Zealand company may also be allowed as a credit. Information about exempt foreign dividends Although most foreign dividends received by companies are exempt from tax, you should still answer ''Yes'' to this question if the company receives an exempt foreign dividend. ird.govt.nz43 Foreign dividends from some investments are taxable. These should be included in the tax return as income from overseas. Dividends on foreign investments are taxable in 3 situations:  When the investment gives the company a direct income interest of less than 10% in a foreign company, but the investment is 1 of certain investments that are excluded from the normal FIF rules (see Question 18 on page 17 for the most common exclusions).  When the dividend relates to an investment in fixed-rate shares ("fixed-rate foreign equity").  When the dividend paid is tax-deductible in a foreign country by a foreign company (a "deductible foreign equity distribution"). Question 40 Company controlled or owned by non-residents We need to know whether the company is owned or controlled by non-residents because we may need to apply subpart FE or sections CH 9, GC 6-14 and GB 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Question 41 Total lowest economic interest of shareholders Calculating the economic interest is necessary for a number of reasons, such as making sure you can carry any net loss forward, the grouping provisions and the imputation credit carry forward provisions. Where there were no changes in shareholdings (including voting rights) throughout the entire year then the lowest economic interest will be 100%. Enter 100.00 at Box 41. Where there has been a change in shareholding including a change to voting rights or market value interests then you will need to calculate the total lowest economic interest. A shareholder's economic interest in a company will generally be measured by referring to the percentage of voting power they hold in that company, to vote on: 1. the dividends or other distributions to be made by the company 2. the constitution of the company 3. any variation in the capital of the company, and 4. the appointment or election of directors. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE44 Example A company has two shareholders, Barbara and Maria. The company has two classes of shares:  Class A shares carry a right to vote on (2) the constitution and (3) variations in capital  Class B shares carry unrestricted voting rights, (1), (2), (3) and (4) on the previous page. Barbara holds all 100 of the A shares in the company while Maria holds all 100 of the B shares. Their percentage of voting interest in the company is measured as follows: DistributionsConstitution Variation in capital DirectorsLowest Barbara 0+50+50+0=100 =25% 100+100+100+100=400 Maria 100+50+50+100=300 =75% 100+100+100+100=400 Enter this total at Box 41 in the Return100.00 If Barbara and Maria hold these proportions of shares for the entire income year, the "total lowest economic interest of shareholders" or the minimum continuity is 100%. The following example shows a shareholding or voting interest change occurring during the year. Example On 1 September 2020 Barbara and Maria swapped shares and held these proportions to 31 March 2021, the company's balance date. 1 April 2020 1 Sep 2020 31 Mar 2021 Lowest Barbara 25% 75% 75% 25% Maria 75% 25% 25% 25% The lowest percentage of rights held by each shareholder during the income year is 25%. So, the total lowest economic interest of shareholders, or the minimum continuity, is 50%. Enter this total at Box 41 in the Return as 50.00. In certain circumstances the shareholders' economic interests in a company will also be determined by the market value interests in the company. This is where the voting interests do not reflect the true economic interests held in a company. ird.govt.nz45 A shareholder's market value interest is their share as a percentage of the total market value of shares (and options) in the company. Specific factors that require a market value interest to be calculated are: –the company has issued debentures to which sections FA 2 or FA 2B of the Income Tax Act 2007 apply –the company has issued shares where payment of dividends is guaranteed by a third party –there's an option to acquire shares in the company, and –an arrangement exists for the purpose of defeating provisions that depends on measurement of voting and market value interests. You will need to add together the lowest economic interest of each shareholder and print the total in Box 41. Write percentages in the following format, for example, show 50% as 50.00, and 100% as 100.00. Effect on the imputation credit account (ICA) If you keep an ICA and have had a change of shareholding of more than 34% you may need to make an adjustment on your annual imputation return at Box 45C ("Other debits") - see page 49. Question 42 Shareholder details - see also the IR4S Complete Question 42 if shareholders, directors and relatives of shareholders received remuneration or a loan. Remuneration is liable for ACC levies. Shareholders' salaries Write all remuneration with no PAYE deducted that the company paid to that person in Box 42B. For the company to claim a deduction for shareholder remuneration it must be paid either: –during the income year, or –within the time allowed for the company to complete its return. If the remuneration is not paid in time, the deduction cannot be claimed until the following year. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE46 Over-payments of AIM provisional tax that relate to shareholder employee salary accruals are allowed to be used to meet the shareholder's tax liability on that salary at the end of the income year. Record details of any AIM tax credits transferred to each shareholder at Box 42C. Loss offsets and subvention payments Record details of any losses claimed or transferred from or to each group member at Box 42F. Record details of any subvention payments claimed or transferred from or to each group member at Box 42G. The total of Boxes 42F must be recorded at Box 29. The total of Boxes 42G must be recorded at Box 29A. Current account balance If the shareholder's current account balance has been overdrawn, (that is, the shareholder owes the company money) then it is a debit balance. ird.govt.nz47 Annual imputation return The annual imputation return must be completed for the period 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021, regardless of your accounting year. If you're a member of an imputation group, see page 7. For more information read our guide Imputation - IR274. Question 43 Opening balance This is the same as the closing balance at 31 March 2020. Tick either "Credit" or "Debit" below Box 43. New companies will not have a closing balance to bring forward. Write "0.00" in Box 43. Question 44 Credits Question 44A Income tax paid Include in Box 44A all payments of income tax and provisional tax made from 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021 for 1989 and subsequent income years. Do not include any FBT, ESCT, interest on tax, late payment penalties, imputation penalty tax or RWT. Question 44B RWT on interest received If the company received interest with RWT deducted between 1 April 2020 and 31 March 2021, print the total RWT in Box 44B. Question 44C Imputation credits attached to dividends received If the company received dividends with imputation credits attached between 1 April 2020 and 31 March 2021, print the total credits in Box 44C. Note This is the total imputation credits attached to dividends received. This amount is not limited to the tax payable on your dividends and is not necessarily the same amount as the imputation credits being claimed in Box 14. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE48 Question 44D Other credits List any other credits made to the ICA from 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021. Use a separate sheet of paper if necessary. Attach it to the top of page 3 and print the total in Box 44D. Other types of credits include: –RWT on dividends received –provisional tax allocated to the company by a company in the same wholly owned group that has overpaid its provisional tax –residential land withholding tax (RLWT) credit deducted from the sale or transfer of residential land located in New Zealand during the income year, less any RLWT paid back to the company and/or transferred to outstanding amounts during the income year. Supplementary available subscribed capital account (SASCA) If you're a public unit trust or a group investment fund that maintains a SASCA and you're eligible to transfer credits from that account to the ICA, record the credits being transferred to the ICA in Box 44D (other credits). All public unit trusts or group investment funds maintaining a SASCA should, by the due date for completing the 2021 IR4 or IR4J, send a copy of that memorandum account together with any written queries to: Investment Desk Large Enterprises Inland Revenue PO Box 2871 Christchurch 8140 For more information on negative dividends and the SASCA rules, see our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 14, No 11 (November 2002). Qualifying company election tax (QCET) payments Include any QCET payments made after 17 May 2007 as a credit in the ICA when working out the balance. Use the account balance in the formula, when calculating the imputation credit to be attached to a dividend paid by the qualifying company. See our Tax Information Bulletins (TIBs) Vol 11, No 5 (May/June 1999) and Vol 20, No 3, page 127 (April 2008). ird.govt.nz49 Question 45 Debits Question 45A Income tax refunded Print in Box 45A the company's total income tax refunds received from 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021 for 1989 and subsequent income years. Do not include any interest on tax received or income tax refunded for any year before 1989. Question 45B Imputation credits attached to dividends paid If the company paid dividends from 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021 with imputation credits attached, print the total credits in Box 45B. Question 45C Other debits List any other debits in the ICA and print the total in Box 45C. Examples of other types of debits are: –any provisional tax allocated by the company to a company in the same wholly owned group that has underpaid its provisional tax –an adjustment for a change of shareholding of more than 34% during the period 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021, regardless of your accounting year –an adjustment for a change in an imputation ratio, or –tax payable by a company on any part of a distribution not sourced from the subscribed capital of the company, where that company repurchases a share on-market. Qualifying companies The 66% continuity of shareholding requirement does not apply to qualifying companies. There is no need to make an adjustment where there has been a change of shareholding, except in the year the company ceases to be a qualifying company. Question 46A Adjustments to debit balance If a qualifying company received an income tax refund after 1 April 1995 that created a debit balance in the ICA, no further income tax is required to the extent of any refunds received. If the qualifying company has a debit balance as a result of income tax refunded from 1 April 2020, please subtract the amount refunded at Box 46A. If the closing balance is a credit, there is no tax to pay. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE50 If the closing balance at Box 46B is a debit, it must be paid by 20 June 2021. Note There are 2 types of relief from payment of debit ICA balances. These are: –the offsetting income tax payments –same debit ICA balances reflected in successive years. For more information see our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 16, No 1 (February 2004). Question 47 Imputation penalty tax Imputation penalty tax of 10% of the debit closing balance is also payable by 20 June 2021. Work out the 10% penalty in Box 47. If the total in Box 47A exceeds $100 and is not paid by the due date, late payment penalties and interest will apply - see page 41. Limitations on tax refunds We may hold all or part of a refund if: –the company is expecting an income tax refund, and –the credit balance in the ICA at 31 March 2021 is less than the refund. If there have been additional credits to the ICA since 31 March 2021, the company may complete an interim 2022 IR4J return in anticipation of an IR4 annual return being completed at a later date. We may then be able to release the refund. We can apply non-refundable overpaid income tax to a company's previous years' income tax liabilities, where these debits exist, rather than transferring the credit forward to the next year's provisional tax. This avoids further payments having to be made to meet back- year debts. ird.govt.nz51 Self-assessment by taxpayers Taxpayers have to assess their own liability as part of their return filing obligations. We may amend your assessment if a correction is required. If you dispute our assessment please go to ird.govt.nz/ disputes for more information. The 4-month period for you to issue a notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA) to your self- assessment will start on the date Inland Revenue receives your return. Accident Compensation Act 2001 Under the Accident Compensation Act 2001, Inland Revenue is required to provide the earnings information at Box 42B from this return to the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC). The information is used by ACC to invoice all ACC levies. ACC invoicing for close companies (including earners' levy for shareholder-employee earnings with no PAYE deducted) starts from September each year. Maximum earnings from multiple companies The maximum amount of earners' levy that can be collected from a shareholder-employee is $1,819.66. A shareholder- employee may be due for a refund from ACC if the shareholder-employee's combined total remuneration from two or more companies is over $130,911. Please call ACC on 0800 222 776 to find out about the refund process. ACC earners' levy Shareholder-employees' salaries or directors' fees without PAYE deducted are liable for ACC earners' levy. The company will be invoiced by ACC for this levy. For more information about refunds or levies, please go to acc.co.nz or call ACC on 0800 222 776.

Look-through companies (LTC) complete an IR7 income tax return each year they're an LTC. For more information about LTCs refer to our Look-through companies - IR879 guide. If yours is an Australian company or part of an imputation group, see page 7. Non-active companies A non-active company is a company that has: –not received any gross income –no deductions –not disposed of any assets, and –not been party to any transactions during the tax year that: (i) gave rise to income for any person (ii) gave rise to fringe benefits to any employee or any former employee, or (iii) gave rise to a debit in the company's ICA (imputation credit account). These companies may be excused from completing tax returns if they complete a Non-active company declaration - IR433 form. Return due date If the company has a 31 March balance date, you have until 7 July 2022 to complete the return, unless you have been granted an extension of time. If you have a balance date other than 31 March, this date may be different. Contact us if you are not sure of the filing date. If the company has a tax agent, you may have until 31 March 2023 to complete the return. If this applies, contact your agent. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE6 Late filing penalties If you have to complete a return and you do not send us one, you may be charged a late filing penalty. You should apply for an extension of time if you are unable to complete your return on time. The penalty for filing your IR4 late depends on the company's net income. If your income is: –below $100,000, the penalty is $50 –between $100,000 and $1 million (both figures inclusive), the penalty is $250, or –above $1 million, the penalty is $500. If you need an extension to your tax return filing date, tell us your reasons before your return is due. If you get a late filing penalty before applying for an extension, the penalty will stand. If you use a tax agent who has an extension of time arrangement with us and the extension is withdrawn, we will notify you that you must now complete your return. Tax sparing Any company that has claimed a foreign tax credit for a tax sparing arrangement under a double tax agreement, must also complete a Tax sparing disclosure return - IR486 and send it to: International Revenue Strategy Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 Group investment funds If the company's income is solely from Category A income, you must complete an IR4. If the income is solely from Category B income, you must complete an IR6. If the income is a combination of both Category A and Category B income, you must complete an IR4 and IR44E. Read the notes in the IR44E for more information. Research and development (R&D) tax losses You may be able to cash out any R&D losses if your company is a loss-making company that is a resident in New Zealand and your expenditure on R&D salary and wages is 20% or more of your total salary and wage expenditure. For more information go to ird.govt.nz/research-development ird.govt.nz7 Superannuation schemes A superannuation scheme, not registered with the Financial Markets Authority (FMA), which lets beneficiaries contribute, will be treated as a company for tax purposes and must complete IR4 returns. Trans-Tasman imputation and imputation groups Australian companies can elect to maintain a New Zealand imputation account from the 2003-04 tax year. A form of grouping (for imputation purposes only) has also been introduced, which Australian companies may join. Return filing for trans-Tasman imputation Australian companies that make a trans-Tasman imputation election are required to complete an Annual imputation return - IR4J by 31 July, after the end of the tax year. A Companies income tax return - IR4 is not required, unless the company has a permanent establishment (for example, maintains an office) in New Zealand. Return filing for imputation groups Companies income tax return - IR4 Company returns must be completed by: –all New Zealand companies that elect to be a member of an imputation group, and –Australian companies with New Zealand-sourced income. Annual imputation return - IR4J The imputation return for an imputation group should be completed by the group representative on a separate IR4J return. Imputation group members should not include any imputation details on page 7 of the IR4. An exception applies for nominated companies of a resident imputation group where there is an ICA debit balance. Foreign dividend payments - FDP The FDP rules have been fully repealed from 1 April 2017. This means FDP can no longer be included in your annual income tax return. Please do not include FDP credits in Box 14A. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE8 Imputation return Most New Zealand resident companies, unit trusts, producer boards and cooperatives must complete an imputation return each year. If you're an Australian company or part of an imputation group, please read page 7. The following bodies do not have to complete imputation returns: –non-resident companies –look-through companies –trustee companies (but not group investment funds with Category A income) –any company with a constitution that prevents it distributing all its income or property to any proprietor, member or shareholder –companies whose income is completely exempt from tax –local authorities –Crown research institutes –non-active companies –Māori authorities. Note If you need to complete the company's imputation return before the income tax return is due, to allow a refund to be released, complete an Annual imputation return - IR4J. Questions 1 to 8 Company details Fill in Questions 1 to 8 only if the correct information is not printed on the return. Question 2 - Company name If the company has changed its name since the last time a return was completed, please attach a copy of the new certificate of incorporation with the name change details or contact us so we can update our records. Question 4 - Postal address If you have a new postal address, write the details at Question 4. If your new address is a PO Box number, show your box lobby if you have one. If you are unsure of your box lobby please contact New Zealand Post. Leave this address panel blank if the company uses its tax preparer's postal address. The tax preparer will let us know if they change their address. ird.govt.nz9 Question 6 - Business industry classification (BIC) code If you're involved in a business or a trading activity, please write the BIC code only in Box 6. You do not need to give a description. We're required to supply the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) with a code for your business or trading activity, for levy classification and calculation. To work out your main business or trading activity and its code, go to businessdescription.co.nz or call ACC on 0508 426 837. It's important that you choose the code which most accurately reflects your main business or trading activity. Question 7 - Phone number We ask for your daytime phone number so we can contact you if we have any questions about your return. Question 8 - Bank account number The fastest and safest way to get any refund is to have it direct credited to your New Zealand bank account or other deposit account, for example, a building society account. If your bank account number is not preprinted on the return form, include it at Question 8. If your suffix has only 2 digits, enter them in the first 2 squares of the suffix box. Question 9 Non-resident A company is a tax resident of New Zealand if: –it's incorporated in New Zealand –its head office or centre of management is in New Zealand, or –its directors control the company in New Zealand. Otherwise, it's a non-resident for tax purposes. Questions 10 and 10A Imputation Page 7 of the IR4 return is the annual imputation return. If you have made any monetary entries in the annual imputation return, tick "Yes" at Question 10A. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE10 Note If you have completed, or will complete, a separate Annual imputation return - IR4J, tick "No" at Question 10. Question 11 Has the company ceased? If this is a final return, include a set of accounts up to the date the company ceased trading and include details of any distribution of assets and liabilities. If the company is registered for GST or as an employer, you will need to complete a Business cessation - IR315 form to finalise your records. Depending on the company's circumstances, a number of other issues may need to be finalised, for example: –outstanding returns –arrears –FBT or ACC –imputation account balances (for qualifying companies) –specified superannuation contributions –RWT on dividends, and –10-year bonus issues. Find out how to finalise the company's tax accounts or deregister for GST at ird.govt.nz Note A company is still a legal entity until it is taken off the Companies Register. A company can stop trading (become non-active) but still have tax obligations such as completing returns. Non-active companies can be excused from completing returns - see page 5. ird.govt.nz11 Company tax return Question 12 Income from schedular payments If the company has received any schedular payments, we will send you a summary of income. Add up the total tax withheld and all the gross payments shown on the summary of income and write the totals in Boxes 12A and 12B. The summary of income form may not contain all the company's earnings information. If any details are missing, please include them at Question 12. If the company received a payment with no tax deducted, include the gross amount in Box 12B. Mineral mining tax credit Include in Box 12A the amount of refundable tax credit being claimed where a tax loss is incurred on disposal of land or by claiming rehabilitation expenditure. Transferring tax deductions Tax deducted from schedular payments made to close companies can be transferred directly to the company's shareholder-employee(s) in some circumstances. You'll need to reduce the amount claimed in Box 12A by the amount of tax deducted from schedular payments which has been transferred direct to a shareholder-employee of the company. You will still need to include the total schedular payments made to the company in Box 12B. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE12 Example LLC received schedular payments of $10,000 with total tax deducted of $2,000 during the year. The $10,000 is attributable to the company's shareholder- employee through the attribution rule. LLC can transfer up to $2,000 of the tax deducted from the schedular payments it received to the company's shareholder-employee(s). LLC transfers the full $2,000 of tax to the company's sole shareholder-employee. As the full amount of tax has been transferred from LLC the amount in Box 12A should be $0. If the company is transferring tax deducted to shareholder- employee(s) it should attach details of the transfer to the return. The amount of tax transferred from the company to its shareholder-employee(s) will also need to be recorded as a debit entry in the company's imputation credit account - see Question 45C on page 54. Question 13 New Zealand interest Interest from all New Zealand sources must be shown in the return. Write the total of all RWT deducted in Box 13A. If the company has had NRWT deducted from New Zealand interest, include this in Box 13A. Add up all the gross interest amounts (before the deduction of any tax) and write the total in Box 13B. Interest on broken term deposits If you have broken a term deposit during the year, you may have to account for "negative interest". This is interest repaid on the term deposit and may reduce the amount of interest to declare on the tax return. If the term deposit was broken in full, or it was business- related, deduct the negative interest from the gross interest amount shown on the RWT withholding certificate. Deduct the allowable negative interest part, using the worksheet below, before entering the gross amount at Question 13 of the tax return. In all other cases, the negative interest is deductible in a later tax return when the term deposit matures. ird.govt.nz13 Worksheet Copy your gross interest from your RWT withholding certificate to Box 1. 1 Print any negative interest you have paid in Box 2. 2 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1 and print the answer in Box 3. Copy this amount to Box 13B of your tax return. 3 Interest paid or charged by Inland Revenue If we paid you interest, include it in Box 13B for the income year the company received the interest. If the company paid us interest, include it as a deduction in the return for the income year the interest is paid. Note If expenses are deductible against the interest income, claim them at Box 20B. Do not send us interest statements with the return. Keep these in case we ask for them later. Income from financial arrangements If the company was a party to a financial arrangement, such as government stock, local authority stock, mortgage bonds, futures contracts or deferred property settlements, the income or expenditure from the financial arrangement may have to be calculated using a spreading method, rather than on a cash basis. If the financial arrangement matures or is sold, remitted or transferred, a "wash-up" calculation known as a base price adjustment must be made. Any RWT will be deducted on a cash basis. Show the RWT deducted and any income from the financial arrangement in Boxes 13A and 13B. Question 14 New Zealand dividends Generally, dividends are taxable. However, there is an exemption for dividends paid between members of a wholly owned group. To work out the total gross dividends, add up all net dividends received, any imputation credits, and any RWT deductions. Write the total of all dividends in Box 14B. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE14 Note The FDP rules have been fully repealed from 1 April 2017. Do not include any FDP credits in Box 14A. Dividend tax credits The total tax credits for dividends (for example imputation credits) you can claim is limited to the income tax payable (28%) on each dividend the company receives. This is to ensure that surplus tax credits are not used to shelter tax on other income. Work out whether you need to apply this limitation to the dividend tax credits you will claim. Copy your total gross dividends (calculated for each dividend that had an imputation credit) from Box 14B to Box 1. 1 Multiply Box 1 by 0.28 (28%), and write the result in Box 2. 2 Write your total dividend tax credits (calculated for that dividend) in Box 3. 3 For each dividend, claim a dividend tax credit for the lower amount shown in Box 2 or Box 3. Write the total dividend imputation credits you are allowed to claim in Box 14. In Box 14A write the sum of your total dividend RWT credits you are allowed to claim. Note If expenses are deductible against the dividend income, claim them at Box 20B. Unit trusts Distributions from unit trusts will generally be taxable. The statement you receive from the unit trust should show the amounts to include in the return. For unit trusts that are also portfolio investment entities (PIEs) see page 19. ird.govt.nz15 Transfer of deductible expenses between member and master funds From the 2002-03 income year a member fund may, in certain circumstances, elect to transfer deductible expenses to a master fund. The master fund must invest, in whole or in part, in the member fund. The master fund can then deduct the transferred expenses. A member fund can include a group investment fund that derives Category A income, a public unit trust or a superannuation fund. A master fund can include a group investment fund that derives Category A income or a public unit trust. A public unit trust includes: –retail unit trusts, whose units are offered to the public and which have 100 or more unit holders –wholesale unit trusts, whose units are held by widely held investment vehicles such as other unit trusts or superannuation funds. Member or master funds wanting to take advantage of this provision should include details of the adjustment in a tax reconciliation statement accompanying the return. The information should accompany the returns of both funds involved in the transfer. For more information see our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 13, No 11 (November 2001). Qualifying companies Generally, if a qualifying company is a shareholder in a company that is not a qualifying company, all dividends the qualifying company derives from the other company are taxable. Dividends derived by a company (that has been a qualifying company at any time before deriving the dividends) are taxable. If a qualifying company is a shareholder in another qualifying company, only dividends with imputation credits attached and a return of a 10-year bonus issue before the 10-year period expires, are taxable. Dividends with no imputation credits attached, or a return of a 10-year bonus issue 10 years from the payment date, are exempt income. A distribution of a 10-year bonus issue before the 10-year period has expired, made when the company winds up, is not taxable. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE16 If you need more help, read our guide Qualifying companies - IR435. Do not send us dividend statements with the return, keep them in case we ask for them later. Question 15 Ma ̄ori authority distributions Māori authorities can make various types of distributions. Fill in Question 15 if you received any taxable Māori authority distributions between 1 April 2021 and 31 March 2022. The Māori authority that paid you the distribution will send you a Māori authority distribution statement. Credits attached to distributions The Māori authority may attach a credit to the distribution it makes to members. This credit will be classified as a Māori authority credit and is part of the tax the Māori authority has already paid on its profits, so the distributions are not taxed twice. What to show in your return Your Māori authority distribution statement shows the amount of: –the distribution made to you, including the taxable portion and the non-taxable portion, and –Māori authority credit. These amounts, not including any non-taxable distribution, will need to be transferred to the relevant boxes at Question 15. Example A Māori authority makes a pre-tax profit of $10,000. It pays tax on this profit of $1,750 (Māori authority tax rate of 17.5%) and distributes the entire profit to its 10 members. Each member will receive $825 as a cash distribution and $175 of Māori authority credits. Each member of the authority liable to file an IR4 return would show the following information at Question 15: – Box 15B - $1,000 (made up of $825 + $175) – Box 15A - $175 ird.govt.nz17 Question 16 Partnership, estate or trust income If the company received any income from a partnership, estate or trust, write any tax credits in Box 16A and the income totals in Box 16B. Do not include any: –overseas income - show this at Question 18 along with any credits attached, or –dividend imputation credits attached to dividends (include these in Box 14, RWT withheld in Box 14A and the gross dividend in Box 14B). Add up any other tax credits from partnerships, estates or trusts and write the total in Box 16A. Add up all the other income from partnerships, estates or trusts and write the total in Box 16B. Losses from limited partnerships If the company is claiming a loss from a limited partnership and you need help working out the amount you can claim, go to ird.govt.nz Estate or trust income If you received a taxable distribution from a non-complying trust, please attach a note with your return giving details of the amount and any associated tax credits. We separate taxable distributions from a non-complying trust because they are taxed at a different rate. We need these details to work out your tax liability correctly. Question 18 Overseas income If your company received income from or while based overseas, between 1 April 2021 and 31 March 2022, show it in New Zealand dollars at Box 18B. If the company is a New Zealand resident for tax purposes, you must include any foreign contract or service income in Box 18B. Foreign investment fund (FIF) If the company held rights, such as shares, units or an entitlement to benefit in any foreign company, unit trust, superannuation scheme or life insurance policy, at any time during the 2022 income year, you may be required to calculate FIF income or loss. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE18 If the company has an interest in a controlled foreign company (CFC), they must calculate any attributed income or loss from that interest. Generally, the company will use the fair dividend rate to calculate FIF income. The main exclusions from an interest in an FIF are: –investments in certain Australian resident companies listed on approved indices on the Australian stock exchange, that maintain franking accounts –interest in certain Australian unit trusts –limited exemptions for interests in certain venture capital interests that move offshore (for 10 income years from the income year in which the company migrates from New Zealand), and –a 10% or greater interest in a CFC. CFC income and losses New rules were introduced in 2009 for calculating income or losses from a CFC. If the company has an interest in a CFC, they must calculate any attributed income or loss from that interest. Losses from a CFC cannot be used to offset domestic income or be included in domestic losses carried forward to the next tax year. Generally, these losses can only offset income or future income from CFCs resident in the same country as the CFC that incurred the loss. When CFC income or losses are calculated under the new rules, transitional rules apply to the use of carried forward losses incurred under the old rules. You can find more information on the rules at ird.govt.nz and in our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 21, No 8 (October/ November 2009). What to show in your return You can convert all overseas income and tax credits to New Zealand dollars by:  using the rates table available from ird.govt.nz/tools-calculators  contacting the overseas section of a trading bank and asking for the exchange rate for the day you received your overseas income. ird.govt.nz19 If the income was received from a financial arrangement, refer to Determination G9A or G9C under section 90 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Write the total of the allowable overseas tax paid in Box 18A. Include in Box 18B income before the deduction of any tax. Credit for tax paid overseas will be limited to the amount of New Zealand tax payable on that income. Please note that Australian franking credits or tax credits on dividends from the United Kingdom cannot be claimed. Staple proof of tax paid overseas to the top of page 3 of the return. Foreign tax credits attached to dividends that are not required to be returned under the FIF rules can be claimed up to the amount of New Zealand tax payable on the FIF interest. Some foreign dividends have New Zealand imputation credits attached or New Zealand RWT deducted. These credits are not subject to the foreign tax credit limitation rule. Investments in portfolio investment entities (PIEs) Certain PIEs attribute their net income/loss and tax credits to the investors. Companies that are investors include the attributed income or loss in their tax return. Each year, the PIE is required to provide an investor statement setting out the details of the income/loss attributed to the investor for the year. The statement also shows the various types of tax credits associated with the income that has been attributed. These tax credits are subject to the tax credit limits calculated in relation to the tax on the attributed PIE income. The attributed PIE income/loss is included in the company's return for the period that includes the end of the PIE's income year. Generally, PIEs have a 31 March balance date. The amount of income the company derives as a distribution by a PIE is excluded income unless it is fully imputed dividends from a listed PIE. Dividends from these PIEs are not liable for RWT. For more information, go to ird.govt.nz or read our guides, Information for companies that invest in PIEs - IR857 and Portfolio investment entity: a guide for PIEs - IR860. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE20 Question 19 Income and expenditure from residential property This question applies to close companies that own residential property, including overseas property, that gives rise to net income from a bright-line sale, and property subject to the residential property deduction rules. The residential property deduction rules, and Question 19, do not apply to residential land that is owned by companies other than close companies. Close company - generally a company with 5 or fewer natural persons whose total voting interests are more than 50%. Associated persons are treated as 1 person. Bright-line property rule for residential property The bright-line property rule needs to be considered when none of the other land sale rules at Question 22 apply to the disposal of the property. This rule for residential property looks at the length of time a property is owned. If you sell or dispose of a residential property within a certain timeframe and no exclusion applies, then your profit on the sale will be taxable. This applies no matter what your reason was for buying the property or what kind of buyer you are. The bright-line property rule applies if you sell or dispose of a residential property you have owned for less than:  5 years for properties acquired between 29 March 2018 and 26 March 2021.  5 years for properties acquired as a result of an offer made on or before 23 March 2021 and that offer was not able to be revoked or withdrawn before 27 March 2021.  5 years for properties acquired on or after 27 March 2021 that qualify as a ‘new build’.  10 years for all other properties acquired on or after 27 March 2021. For tax purposes, a property is generally acquired on the date a binding sale and purchase agreement is entered into (even if some standard conditions like getting finance or a building report still need to be met). This date will determine which bright-line period (5 or 10 years) applies for your property. For more information on when a property is acquired, see our Question we’ve been asked (QB) 17/02: Date of acquisition of land, and start date for 2-year bright-line test at taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz ird.govt.nz21 There are other dates that are relevant for figuring out whether your property sale is taxable under the bright-line property rule. Generally, your bright-line period starts when the legal title is transferred to you and ends when you enter into a binding sale and purchase agreement to sell the property. There are some different rules if you purchase “off the plan” in a new development, for example. You can use the property tax decision tool on our website to work out if you need to pay tax on the sale of your property. For more information go to ird.govt.nz/brightline Income and losses for property subject to the bright-line property rule are treated differently in the tax return. After a taxable bright-line sale:  if you have net income from the sale of the property (a profit), the net income is included in Box 19A. Unless the property is part of a portfolio, expenses from other properties cannot be offset against the net income from the disposal.  if you have made a net loss when the property is sold, the loss must be carried forward to a later income year when it can be used to offset net income from the land sale provisions, including from future disposals subject to the bright-line rule. A bright-line loss is not recorded in the tax return. Please keep your own record of any bright-line losses you have made. Complete a Bright-line residential property sale information - IR833 form for each bright-line property sold or disposed of and include it with your return. The form explains how to calculate the resulting profit or loss. Complete the form even if the details have been included in a Financial statements summary - IR10 or set of accounts, unless the income will be included in your return as part of your business income as a property speculator, property dealer, developer or builder. If you sell/dispose of a residential property and the sale is taxable under the bright-line property rule, the amount of the previously denied interest under the interest limitation rules is treated as if it were part of the cost of the property in the year of disposal. If this results in a net loss, the deduction for the net loss is limited under the current rule that applies to losses from the disposal of bright-line property. If the disposal is not taxable, the interest previously denied a deduction remains non-deductible. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE22 If you are a New Zealand tax resident you’ll need to pay tax on your worldwide income under New Zealand tax law. This includes any property sales both in New Zealand and overseas subject to the bright-line property rule or the other land sale rules. For more information on the land sale rules, go to ird.govt.nz/buying-selling or read our guide Bright-line property tax - IR1227. You can find our forms and guides at ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Residential property deduction rules Most residential rental properties are subject to the residential property deduction rules (also known as the ring-fencing rules). The rules generally limit the amount of residential deductions you can claim in the year to the total amount of residential income earned in that year. If the residential property makes a loss it must be carried forward to the next year in which residential income, including income from properties held on revenue account, is earned. There are 2 levels of exclusions from the residential rules. Any rental income or loss and net income or loss from a taxable disposal is fully excluded from the new rules if the property is:  property subject to the mixed-use asset rules (for example, a holiday home rented out part-time and not used for at least 62 days in the income year, or 62 working days in the income year if it's usually only used on working days)  property owned by companies other than close companies  property owned by government enterprises, or  certain employee accommodation. For these types of property, the existing rules apply with the rental income or loss shown at Box 21 and net income or net loss from a taxable disposal shown in Box 22. Any rental net loss and net loss from a taxable disposal is partially excluded from the new rules if it is for:  property that will always be taxed on sale, being revenue account property of a person in the business of building, developing or dealing in land, or  other revenue account property the person has notified us they want the exclusion to apply to. ird.govt.nz23 For these types of property any rental net loss is shown at Box 21 and taxable disposal net loss is shown at Box 22. Net rental income and net income from a taxable disposal plus any depreciation recovered is shown as residential income at Box 19A. Refer to the Rental income – IR264 guide for information on when the rules apply, how to calculate your income, the amount of deductions you can claim for this year, and the amount of any excess deductions that must be carried forward. The residential property deduction rules also apply to any company who has borrowed money to acquire an interest in certain entities with significant rental property holdings - a residential land-rich entity - and has interest expenditure on the borrowed money. Residential land-rich entity - a close company, partnership or look-through company that holds more than 50% of its assets by value in residential land directly or indirectly. They come under the interposed entities rules as part of the residential property deduction rules. For more information about the interposed entity rules, see page 60 of the Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No.8 September 2019. Completing Question 19 in your return Tick the method you used to calculate your residential property income and deductions. You can use 1 of the following:  Portfolio basis – combine the income and deductions for all rental properties in a portfolio.  Individual, property-by-property basis – income and deductions of individual property calculated separately to other property. You need to maintain separate records for each property to choose this option.  Combination of the property-by-property basis and portfolio basis – choose to apply different methods to different property. The Residential property deductions worksheets – IR1226 can be used to calculate the information required to be shown in your return. Calculate and identify the amounts for Boxes 19A to 19F using your chosen method/s. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE24 Write the total residential income in Box 19A. This is the total of: a. all residential rental income from a portfolio and/or individual property b. all depreciation recovery income for assets disposed of from a portfolio and/or individual property c. net income from the taxable sale/disposal of a property in a portfolio and/or individual property, and d. all net residential rental income, depreciation recovery income and net income from the taxable disposal of property from residential property excluded because it is held on revenue account. Only include the net income from a disposal once. Do not include in Question 19 rental losses from properties that are not covered by the residential property deduction rules, as outlined on page 22. Enter those amounts in Question 21 instead. Write any net tax losses from disposals of rental properties that are excluded in Box 22B. If you are a partner in a partnership or owner of a look-through company and have been attributed residential income shown in Box 26G on the IR7P or IR7L include that here. Write the total residential rental deductions for residential rental properties in Box 19B. This is the total deductions for the current year – Box 14 on the Rental income – IR3R if completed. If you are a partner in a partnership or owner of a look- through company and have been attributed residential rental deductions shown in Box 26M on the IR7P or IR7L include that in Box 19B. If the company has breached the continuity rules, or the company is transferring excess deductions to a wholly owned group member, you'll need to reduce the current year deductions in Box 19B to reflect the adjustment. If the company is receiving excess deductions from a wholly owned group member, you'll need to increase the current year deductions in Box 19B. The transfer of excess deductions is not a loss offset nor a subvention payment. ird.govt.nz25 The brought forward and carry forward boxes are calculated by our system when your return is processed. If the deductions are too low, you'll need to contact us so we can change it when we process your return. Keep good records for the adjustment and include a note with your return. See Question 28 for details on the continuity rules. Include the amount of any interest paid on an investment in a residential land rich entity that relates to the rental activity in Box 19B. Include the amount of interest paid that does not relate to the rental property in Box 21B. Write the total excess residential rental deductions brought forward from last year in Box 19C. Add Boxes 19B and 19C for total rental deductions. Calculate the amount of allowable deductions you can claim this year adjusting for excess deductions. Write the total Residential rental deductions claimed this year in Box 19D. This should equal Box 19B plus Box 19C less the amount of excess deductions for each property and/or property portfolio shown in Box 19F. The amount cannot exceed total residential income at Box 19A, unless there was a taxable sale/disposal of a rental property. Combine the net income results (after adjusting for any excess deductions) for all properties and write the total in Box 19E. Your total Net residential income in Box 19E cannot be a loss, unless there has been either a taxable disposal of a property held on the property-by-property basis, or a taxable disposal of all properties or the last property held in a portfolio. Any losses are counted as zero unless the loss is the result of either:  excess deductions released from either a taxable disposal of a property held on the property-by-property basis, or a taxable disposal of all properties or the last property held in a portfolio, or  claimable interest paid on your investment in a residential land-rich entity. Refer to the Rental income – IR264 guide. Write the total excess deductions for the year to be carried forward to next year in Box 19F. This is calculated as Residential rental deductions Box 19B minus Residential rental deductions claimed this year Box 19D. This includes the amount of any excess deductions to be carried forward for interest paid on an investment in a land rich entity in Box 19F. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE26 NOTES Note 1 If you sell/dispose of an individual property and the sale is not taxable; or you sell/dispose of the last property in a portfolio and at least 1 of the sales in the portfolio was not taxable, any excess deductions will transfer to another property or portfolio and carried forward to a future year in which you earn income from a residential rental property (including properties on revenue account). Note 2 If you sell/dispose of an individual property and the sale is taxable, or you sell/dispose of the last rental property in a portfolio, and the sale of all your rental properties in a portfolio were taxable, any remaining loss/excess deductions are released and can be offset against other income. However, this does not include any excess deductions transferred to the portfolio/property. Note 3 If you want to claim that a property is held on revenue account where the sale may be taxable, you need to tell us the property details of the property. You will be stating the sale will be a taxable sale when the property is disposed of. You must be able to separately identify the deductions relating to the property. For more information read the Rental income – IR264 guide. ird.govt.nz27 Question 20 Interest incurred from residential property This question applies to owners of residential property subject to the interest limitation rules. You do not need to complete this question for the following types of property:  Farmland  Hospitals, hospices, convalescent homes, nursing homes  Rest homes and retirement villages  Hotels, motels, inns, camping grounds, hostels. For interest to be deductible, the general deductibility rules must be met. The interest will also not be deductible to the extent to which it is of a private or domestic nature. From 1 October 2021, interest is not deductible for residential property in New Zealand acquired on or after 27 March 2021, unless an exclusion or exemption applies (see below). For properties acquired before 27 March 2021, the ability to deduct interest on existing loans is being phased out between 1 October 2021 and 31 March 2025. For the 2022 tax year, you can claim:  100% of the interest incurred from 1 April 2021 to 30 September 2021  75% of the interest incurred from 1 October 2021 to 31 March 2022. Interest on any new loans drawn down on or after 27 March 2021 is not deductible. Special rules also apply for refinanced loans and for interest on revolving credit and overdraft facilities. Any interest on borrowings above the closing balance on 26 March 2021 is not deductible. For more information, go to ird.govt.nz/property/renting-out-residential-property Some companies do not have to apply the interest limitation rules. If your company is a close company where five or fewer individuals or trustees own more than 50% of the company, you will usually have to apply the rules. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE28 If your company meets one of the following:  it is not a close company; or  it is a close company that is a Māori authority or eligible to be a Māori authority; or  it is a close company that is wholly-owned by a Māori authority or by an entity eligible to be a Māori authority; your company will not have to apply the interest limitation rules if less than 50% of its total assets consist of residential property (excluding development property but including shares in other companies that exceed this 50% test) at all times during the income year. If your company is part of a wholly-owned group, the 50% test is applied on a consolidated basis at the group level. There are interposed entity rules to deny interest deductions for a customer who borrows to indirectly fund residential property through an interposed entity. If you sell/dispose of a residential property and the sale is taxable under the bright-line property rule, the amount of the previously denied interest under the interest limitation rules is treated as if it were part of the cost of the property in the year of disposal. If this results in a net loss, the deduction for the net loss is limited under the current rule that applies to losses from the disposal of bright-line property. If the disposal is not taxable, the interest previously denied a deduction remains non-deductible. Completing Question 23 in your return Complete this question for any interest expense you are claiming in this income tax return at Boxes 19B and 21 in relation to a house, apartment, flat or other structure that could be used for residential accommodation, either short- term or long-term. This includes if you have an arrangement to build such a structure, and bare land that could be used to build such a structure under the relevant district plan. Write the total interest on residential property in Box 20A. This is the total interest incurred on your borrowings for all your residential properties for this year. If you are using an IR3R form to prepare a summary for each rental property, this is the total of all the 7A Boxes. Write the amount of interest expense claimed in Box 20B. If you are using an IR3R form to prepare a summary for each rental property, this is the total of all the 7B Boxes. ird.govt.nz29 Note If you are a partner in a partnership or owner of a look- through company that has incurred interest on residential property at Question 19 in the IR7, include your share of that here in proportion to your share in the partnership or effective look-through interest in the LTC. If you have claimed an interest expense in Box 20B, at Box 20C tick the reason(s) for the interest expense claimed:  A Māori exempt company or not a residential land company – The interest limitation rules do not apply to non-close companies or groups if less than 50% of its total assets consist of residential property (excluding development property but including shares in other companies that exceed this 50% test) at all times during the income year. A close company that is a Māori authority, eligible to be a Māori authority, or wholly-owned by an entity that is a Māori authority or eligible to be one is an exempt Māori company if it passes this 50% test.  Certain schedule 15 exclusions or property not in NZ - The interest limitation rules apply to land in New Zealand only. Schedule 15 of the Income Tax Act 2007 also allows you to claim interest for the following:  main home – if a portion is used to earn income such as a flatting situation  business premises (for example, a villa now used as a dental clinic) except if the business premises is used for providing accommodation and it’s not a person’s main home  certain Māori land, papakāinga and kaumātua housing, and land transferred as part of settlement under Te Tiriti o Waitangi/Treaty of Waitangi  employee accommodation  student accommodation.  Loans drawn down prior to 27 March 2021 or interest incurred before 1 October 2021 - Interest incurred from 1 April 2021 to 30 September 2021 is fully deductible. From 1 October 2021, the ability to claim interest is being phased out for the following situations:  loans drawn down prior to 27 March 2021  property acquired before 27 March 2021 but the loan for the settlement of the property was not drawn down until on or after 27 March 2021 COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE30  loans that relate to the purchase of a property acquired as a result of an offer made on or before 23 March 2021 and that offer was not able to be revoked or withdrawn before 27 March 2021. In other situations where the property is acquired on or after 27 March 2021, interest cannot be claimed from 1 October 2021 onwards.  Emergency, transitional, social or council housing - You can claim interest for loans if your property is used for emergency, transitional or social housing when leased to the Crown (for example, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development or Kāinga Ora) or to a registered community housing provider.  New build exemption - the exemption generally applies to new build residential properties for 20 years from the date a new build’s Code Compliance Certificate (CCC) is issued under the Building Act 2004. A ‘new build’ includes a self contained dwelling:  that received a CCC on or after 27 March 2020. The dwelling can be made from new or existing materials and can be constructed onsite or relocated onto the land  acquired off the plans that received a CCC on or after 27 March 2020  created by converting an existing dwelling into 2 or more dwellings, that received a CCC on or after 27 March 2020  converted from commercial premises that received a CCC on or after 27 March 2020  converted from a hotel or motel and building consent authority records show that the conversion was completed on or after 27 March 2020  that has been removed from the earthquake prone buildings register on or after 27 March 2020, provided there is proof the remediation has been completed (either in the form of a CCC being issued, or local or building consent authority records showing the work has been completed and verified by a suitably qualified engineer)  that was remediated because of weathertightness issues, provided more than 75% of the dwelling has been re-clad and a CCC was issued on or after 27 March 2020. ird.govt.nz31  Development or land business exemption - The land business exemption applies to land held as part of a developing, subdividing, or land-dealing business, or a business of erecting buildings on land. The development exemption does not require you to have a ‘land business’ and applies to land that you develop, subdivide, or build on to create a new build. The development may be a one-off. For more information about the interest limitation rules and how to calculate the amount of interest you can claim, go to ird.govt.nz/property/renting-out-residential-property or read our guide Rental income - IR264. You can find our forms and guides at ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Question 21 Business or other rental income Write the net profit or loss in Box 21B. This is the amount of income or loss after the deduction of all allowable business expenditure, including shareholders' salaries paid or credited. Only include net residential rental income or losses not included at Question 19 and rents from a commercial property in Box 21B. Do not include any income already shown at Questions 12 to 16 and 19, losses from CFCs (see the notes to Question 37 on page 46) or claim donations here (see the notes to Question 26 on page 36). Note If expenses are deductible against income declared in Questions 12 to 14, claim them here. Attach either: –a fully completed Financial statements summary - IR10 form, or –the company's financial accounts. The IR10 is a statistics form that sets out a general summary of information from the financial accounts. If you complete an IR10 you do not need to send the financial accounts as well. You still need to complete them (unless the company is very small) and keep them in case we ask for them. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE32 Very small companies are not required to prepare financial accounts if these conditions apply during the income year. The company:  is not part of a group  has not derived income over $30,000, or  has not incurred expenditure over $30,000. Companies that do not prepare financial accounts must fill in an IR10 using information from their trial balance or financial records. For more information about who has to prepare financial accounts and minimum financial reporting requirements, go to our website at ird.govt.nz/records The attribution rule Under the attribution rule, anyone whose actions cause an "associated person" (company, trust or partnership) to earn income, can be personally liable for tax on that income. If this rule applies to persons associated to your organisation, it will affect the amount of taxable income in this return. To find out how to apply this rule, refer to our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB), Vol 12, No 12 (December 2000) and Vol 13, No 11 (November 2001). Question 22 Income from taxable property sales/disposals Include the total net income or loss from land. Do not include net income or loss from a bright-line sale at Box 22B. Bright-line sales are included under residential income at Question 19. Profits from land sales are taxable if you bought a property for the purpose of reselling it or are in the business of buying and selling land and/or buildings. The profits may also be taxable if you:  are a builder and improved a property before selling it  developed or subdivided land and sold sections, or  had a change of zoning on your property and sold it within ten years of buying it. Show the total profit or loss from other property in Box 22B. If you are a New Zealand tax resident you’ll need to pay tax on your worldwide income under New Zealand tax law. This ird.govt.nz33 includes any property sales worldwide subject to the bright- line property rule for residential land, or the other land sale rules. For more information on the land sale rules, go to ird.govt.nz/buying-selling or read our guide Tax and your property transactions - IR361. You can find our forms and guides at ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Question 22A Residential land withholding tax (RLWT) credit If the company is an "offshore RLWT person" and has sold or transferred residential property located in New Zealand, RLWT may have been deducted from the sale price. The company should have received a statement on the completion of the sale process showing the amount of RLWT deducted. The company can claim a credit for any RLWT deducted. Show the amount of RLWT deducted, less any RLWT paid back to the company and/or transferred to outstanding amounts during the income year. If there was more than 1 amount of RLWT deducted, show the combined amount, less any RLWT paid back to the company and/or transferred to outstanding amounts during the income year. Question 23 Insurance premiums paid to an overseas insurer Special rules apply to any company paying a premium, including a reinsurance premium, to a non-resident insurer. If you're paying a premium to a non-resident insurer you need to get a separate IRD number to account for the tax on the premium income. This is because you're considered to be the insurer's agent. You will need to complete an IR4 return under this separate IRD number and declare premiums paid as the only income received. Only 10% of the total gross premiums paid to overseas insurers is subject to the company tax rate of 28%. This equals 2.8% of the total premiums paid. Any premiums paid to insurers in Switzerland are not subject to tax in New Zealand and should be deducted from the total gross premiums paid. Agency obligations also extend to other New Zealand residents, for example, brokers, who may initially collect COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE34 premiums for payment to the non-resident insurer. If there is any default, the insured person is responsible for the tax. Print the gross amount of premiums paid to a non-resident insurer in Box 23. Print the gross amount of premiums paid to Switzerland in Box 23A. Deduct the figure in Box 23A from Box 23 and multiply the net amount by 0.1 (10%). Print your answer in Box 23B and copy this amount to Box 31. No other income should be returned as an agent for an overseas insurer. The company still needs to declare other income under its original IRD number. If you have any enquiries, contact: Team Lead Significant Enterprises Inland Revenue PO Box 39090 Wellington Mail Centre Lower Hutt 5045 Phone 0800 443 773 Question 24 Other income Show any other income received by the company at Question 24. For example, the sale of: –shares or other property –securities –income from an undertaking or scheme. Income from sale of non-FIF shares or other property Profits from the sale of shares and other property are taxable if the company: –buys and sells shares or other property as a business, or –buys shares or other property for the purpose of resale. This does not apply if shares are FIFs. List the details of income and expenses from these sales on a sheet of paper and staple it to the top of page 3 of the return. Include the total profit in Box 24B. Losses from shares or other property that are not a foreign investment fund (FIF) If the company has made a loss from the sale of an asset that was not a FIF and you can show that any profit made would have been taxable, you may be able to claim the loss as a deduction. ird.govt.nz35 Financial arrangements A company must account for income from financial arrangements on an accrual basis. Financial arrangements include government stock, futures contracts and deferred property settlements, excluding short-term agreements for sale and purchase of property. Changes to the rules for the treatment of financial arrangements have split the rules into 2 sets. Generally, the first set applies to financial arrangements entered into before 20 May 1999 and the second applies to financial arrangements entered into on or after that date. Both sets of rules require the income or expenditure to be spread over the term of the financial arrangement. This applies in every case - the company does not have to be in the business of buying or selling financial arrangements, or be intending to sell, as it would with shares. The company may, in certain cases, deduct any losses. Sale or maturity of financial arrangements When a financial arrangement matures or is sold, remitted or transferred, a "wash-up" calculation, known as a base price adjustment, must be made. The calculation ensures that the total gains or losses from the financial arrangement are accounted for. If you need any information on when losses can be deducted or how to calculate a base price adjustment, please contact us. Income from an undertaking or scheme Profits from any undertaking or scheme entered into for the purpose of making a profit are taxable. Describe the undertaking or scheme and list the details of income and expenses from them. Staple this information to the top of page 3 of the return and include the total profit in Box 24B. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE36 Question 26 Donations A company (including an unlisted company with 5 or fewer shareholders) can claim a deduction for donations it makes to any society, institution, association, organisation, trust or fund that has donee organisation status. You can view the list of these organisation at ird.govt.nz/donee Note State-funded tertiary education institutions, state schools and state-integrated schools do not have to be approved to have donee organisation status. The deduction for donations cannot be more than the company's net income after expenses (before the donation deduction is taken into account). Use the following steps to calculate the company's donation deduction.  If the amount in Box 25 is a loss, print nil in Box 26B.  If the donations made by the company exceed the amount in Box 25, copy the amount in Box 25 to Box 26B.  If the donations made by the company do not exceed the amount in Box 25, print the amount of the donations in Box 26B. Question 28 Net losses brought forward Losses from CFCs are not included in Question 28 - see Question 39 on page 47. Before a company is allowed to carry forward net losses it must satisfy one of two tests. 1. Shareholder continuity 49% continuity of minimum voting interest or market value interest must be maintained by a group of persons at all times, from the beginning of the year of net loss to the end of the year of carrying it forward (the continuity period). To check whether the shareholder continuity requirements have been met, use the lowest percentage of economic interest held by each shareholder during the continuity period. To calculate the total lowest economic interest see Question 41 on page 48. 2. Business continuity test The business continuity test allows losses to be carried forward despite a breach in shareholder continuity if certain requirements are satisfied. The main requirement is that the underlying business continues i.e. there is no “major change”, except permitted changes, in the business for 5 years after a change in ownership. ird.govt.nz37 “Major change” refers to the nature of the business activities and the extent the same or similar assets are used to generate income for the company. Only losses incurred in the 2013-14 and later income years can be carried forward under this test. For more information see our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 33, No 6 (July 2021). Write the net losses the company can bring forward to 2022 in Box 28A, and the amount the company has offset against 2022 income in Box 28B. If the company cannot offset any net losses in the 2022 income year write “0.00” in Box 28B. Show whether or not the company is carrying forward losses under the business continuity test at Box 28C. Note You should be able to find the amount of net loss the company has to bring forward on the loss notice sent to you with the company's 2021 income tax assessment. If you do not have a loss notice, enter the details from your own records. Question 29 Total income after net losses brought forward Subtract Box 28B from Box 27. Print your answer in Box 29. Question 30 Net losses and subvention payments To offset net losses there must be a common shareholding of at least 66%, and 66% continuity of minimum voting interest must also be maintained (or 66% market value interest if a market value circumstance exists). To calculate voting or market value interest see Question 41 on page 48. To offset a net loss incurred during a current income year, the loss company and the profit company must be members of the same group at all times for that income year. To offset a net loss brought forward, the loss company and the profit company must be members of the same group of companies for the entire period, beginning with the income year the net loss is incurred in and ending with the year of offset. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE38 The amount of loss offset cannot exceed the taxable income of the profit company and neither may the amount of loss to be offset exceed the net loss of the loss company. Record individual details of the losses claimed or transferred and subvention payments received or made at Questions 42F or 42G. The total of these must equal Boxes 30 or 30A respectively. Part-year grouping The general part-year grouping rule is that only the part of the net loss incurred in the same period as the profit is derived may be offset, if, during the period: –the loss company maintains continuity of shareholding, and –commonality of shareholding between loss and profit companies has been maintained. Net loss and profit amounts allowed to be offset are based on periods where continuity and commonality requirements are met for all companies taking part in a part-year grouping arrangement. If the company received net losses from another company or made a subvention payment to another company, put a minus sign in the relevant last box. Attach a schedule setting out the names and IRD numbers of the companies and the amount of the payment or loss. If the company is transferring excess residential rental deductions to a wholly owned group member, the transfer is recorded as a reduction of the current year residential rental deductions in Box 19B. Similarly, if the company is receiving excess residential rental deductions from a wholly owned group member, the transfer is recorded as an increase of the current year residential rental deductions in Box 19B. Do not record these amounts in Question 30. Refer to Question 19 for details. Qualifying companies Net losses are restricted for grouping and subvention payment purposes. A qualifying company loss can be offset against any group company profit (including non-qualifying company profits). ird.govt.nz39 Question 32E Foreign investor tax credit The foreign investor tax credit rules reduce the combined income tax and NRWT imposed on foreign investors with interests in a New Zealand company. See Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 20, No 3 (April 2008) for details about the change of company tax rate. A company is entitled to a foreign investor tax credit when it pays a supplementary dividend of the same amount to its non-resident shareholders. The foreign investor tax credit can then be offset against the company's income tax liability. The foreign investor tax credit arises in the income year the supplementary dividend is paid and is to be offset in the following order: 1. Against the company's income tax payable for the year the supplementary dividend is paid. Enter this amount in Box 32E. 2. At the company's election, either: - against the company's income tax liability for any of the previous four income years, or - against the income tax liability for another company in the same wholly owned group of companies for the year the supplementary dividend is paid in or any of the previous four income years. 3. Carried forward to subsequent years for offset against the tax liability of the company or another company in the same wholly owned group of companies. If the company has a foreign investor tax credit that cannot be fully offset against its own income tax liability in the income year the supplementary dividend is paid, attach a note to the front of the return giving details of how to treat any excess credit. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE40 Question 32G Imputation credits If the company has imputation credits, it may have a net loss to carry forward. This will happen if the company's total imputation credits are greater than the tax payable at Box 32F. To calculate the net loss to carry forward, subtract the amount at Box 32F from the total imputation credits (Box 32G) and divide the answer by 0.28 (28%). If the deemed net loss is to be offset to other companies within the same group (rather than carried forward), reduce the amount of net loss shown at Box 29 by the amount offset. Question 33 Refunds and/or transfers If you want your refund transferred to another account or to arrears being paid off by an instalment arrangement, tell us the date you would like this done. The date you can choose depends on what tax has been overpaid and whose account you want the credit transferred to. Note If the transfer is to arrears being paid off by an instalment arrangement, you'll need to include a note with your return authorising the transfer and giving the following information: –that the transfer is to arrears currently under an instalment arrangement –the name and IRD number of the taxpayer the transfer should be made to –whether the taxpayer is an "associated taxpayer" –the tax type and period, and –the date you want the transfer to take place. ird.govt.nz41 Question 33B Associated taxpayers For companies, the following persons are associated taxpayers for the purposes of transferring overpaid tax: –another company in the same group of companies –a shareholder-employee of the company –a partner in the same partnership. If you want your refund transferred to another person, you will need to show if they are an associated taxpayer. Transfer date You can ask for your credit to be transferred at any date as long as it is not before the relevant dates set out as follows. For credit transferred: to your account/an associated taxpayer's account If the credit is from excess tax deducted (for example RWT deducted on interest) it's the day after your balance date (or 1 April if your balance date is before 31 March). If the credit is from overpaid provisional tax it's the day you overpaid it. Please note that special rules apply if tax pooling funds have been transferred in. to a non-associated taxpayer's account It's the later of the day you requested the transfer, or the day after you file your return. Future transfer dates If you want your credit transferred at a future date, attach a note to the front of your return with the details of the amount you want transferred, the account you want it transferred to (if it's to another person and they are associated) and the date you want it transferred. If you do not tell us the date you want your credit transferred, we will transfer it at a date we think gives you the greatest advantage. If you want the credit transferred at a different date, you can ask us to change it (even if we have transferred your credit to cover a debt). Requesting transfers on your return You can ask us to transfer a refund to another account by filling out pages 4 and 5 of the return. If you ask us to, we will transfer the refund to: COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE42  the company's own account or an account of someone associated to the company on the later of: –the day after the balance date (or 1 April if your balance date is before 31 March) –the due date in the destination account.  an account of someone not associated to the company on the day after the return was completed. If you want the company's refund transferred at a different date from those listed earlier, you can attach a note to the return, including the details of the account you want the refund transferred to and the transfer date you want. If the transfer is going to another person, tell us if they are associated to the company. Question 34 Initial provisional tax liability A company has an initial provisional tax liability if it: –starts to derive income from a taxable activity in the tax year –had not derived gross income from a taxable activity within the preceding four years, and –has residual income tax (RIT) of $60,000 or more in the current year. New businesses do not pay provisional tax in their first year of operation because there is no RIT from the previous year to base the calculation on. However, companies that have an initial provisional tax liability may be charged interest from the first, second or third instalment date. The instalment date interest applies from is determined by the business start date. Some new businesses make voluntary payments to reduce liability for interest. More information about the dates interest applies from is available in our guide Provisional tax - IR289. There are special rules about how interest is calculated when a company has an initial provisional tax liability and has changed its balance date. For further information, see our Provisional tax - IR289 guide. Print the date the company started to derive income from the taxable activity in Box 34. ird.govt.nz43 Question 35 2023 provisional tax 2023 provisional tax is charged for income the company will earn in the 2023 income year. It is payable in 2, 3 or 6 instalments. There are 3 options for calculating your provisional tax - standard, estimation and ratio. If the company's 2022 RIT is: –$5,000 or less it does not have to pay provisional tax, but it can make voluntary payments –more than $5,000 but expected to be $5,000 or less for 2023 it may estimate 2023 provisional tax at nil –more than $5,000 and expected to be more than $5,000 for 2023 it must pay 2023 provisional tax using 1 of the payment options. Standard option (S) Under this option, your 2023 provisional tax is your 2022 RIT (where it is more than $5,000) plus 5%. Note If you think your income for 2023 will be more than your 2022 income, you can make voluntary payments over and above the amount you have to pay under the standard option. Estimation option (E) Companies can estimate their 2023 provisional tax. They can re-estimate any number of times up to and including their final instalment due date. If the company's 2023 RIT is expected to be less than its 2022 RIT, estimating may prevent the company from paying more than it has to. Note An estimate must be fair and reasonable at each instalment it applies to. If you use the estimation option, see "Not taking reasonable care penalty" and "Interest" on page 44. If the company estimates its provisional tax, write E in Box 35A and the amount of 2023 provisional tax in Box 35B. If you estimate your provisional tax your instalments should be one-third of your estimation. If you're using the ratio option and select E at Box 35A this will mean you are electing to stop using the ratio option. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE44 Ratio option (R) If you're GST registered, you may qualify to use the ratio option to calculate your provisional tax. Only enter R at Box 35A if you have already elected to use the ratio option. Your application to use the ratio option must be made by phone or in writing before the beginning of the income year you want to use it. If you've already elected to use the ratio option and want to continue using it, enter R at Box 35A. There is more information about the ratio option in our guide Provisional tax - IR289. Not taking reasonable care penalty When you estimate the company's 2023 provisional tax, your estimate must be fair and reasonable. If the 2023 RIT is greater than the provisional tax paid, you may be liable for a not taking reasonable care penalty of 20% of the underpaid provisional tax. Interest If the company has paid too much provisional tax, we may pay interest. If it has not paid enough provisional tax, we may charge interest. Interest the company pays is tax deductible, while interest we pay is taxable income. Election to be a provisional tax payer A company is a provisional tax payer for the 2022 year if its RIT for that year is more than $5,000. If the 2022 RIT is $5,000 or less but the company paid provisional tax for the year, the company may elect to be a provisional tax payer for that year. This may affect the interest the company may be entitled to for that year. To elect to be a provisional tax payer for the 2022 year, attach a note to the front of the 2022 return. Change in balance date There are special rules about when provisional tax is due and how interest is calculated if there has been a change in the balance date. For more information, read our guides Penalties and interest - IR240 and Provisional tax - IR289. ird.govt.nz45 Tax pooling Tax pooling allows taxpayers to pool provisional tax payments, offsetting underpayments by overpayments within the same pool. This reduces their possible exposure to late payment penalties and interest. For more information about tax pooling, including a list of intermediaries, go to ird.govt.nz/tax-pooling Payment dates 2023 provisional tax Generally, a company with a 31 March balance date pays provisional tax by the following due dates: First instalment 28 August 2022 Second instalment 15 January 2023 Third instalment 7 May 2023 A company with a balance date other than 31 March generally pays provisional tax on the 28th day of the 5th, 9th and 13th months after the balance date. There are 2 exceptions:  If it would be due on 28 December it is due on 15 January, and  If it would be due on 28 April it is due on 7 May. These dates will alter if the company is registered for GST and:  the GST filing frequency is six-monthly, or  provisional tax is paid through the ratio option. If either of these situations apply to you, read our guide Provisional tax - IR289. 2022 end-of-year income tax Companies that have an agent and an extension of time may have until 7 April 2023 to pay their tax. If you think this applies to your company, contact your agent. A company with a balance date between 1 March and 30 September must pay its end-of-year income tax (Box 32L) and any interest by 7 February 2023. A company with a balance date between 1 October and 28 February must pay its end-of-year income tax by the 7th day of the month before the following year's balance date. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE46 How to make payments You can make payments by:  direct debit in myIR  credit or debit card at ird.govt.nz/pay  internet banking - most New Zealand banks have a pay tax option. When making a payment, include:  your IRD number  the account type you are paying, and  the period the payment relates to. Find all the details of our payment options at ird.govt.nz/pay Late payment If you do not pay a bill on time, you may have to pay penalties and interest. Contact us if you are not able to pay on time. We'll look at your payment options, which may include an instalment arrangement. Find out more at ird.govt.nz/penalties Question 37 Foreign rights If you calculated CFC or FIF income at Question 18 you may be required to complete an additional disclosure form for that investment. For all interests of 10% or more in a foreign company, the additional disclosure is required. For other investments, the requirement for an additional disclosure depends on the company you are preparing the Companies income tax return - IR4 for.  If the company is not widely held or a PIE, additional disclosure is not required if the investments are in countries New Zealand holds a double tax agreement with (as at 31 March 2022) and the fair dividend rate or comparative value has been used.  If the company is widely held or a PIE you are required to file an additional disclosure. The disclosure forms are available at ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Contact us if you need help to find the appropriate disclosure form. ird.govt.nz47 For information on foreign exchange rates, go to ird.govt.nz/tools-calculators Find out more about the base erosion profit shifting (BEPS) hybrid mismatch rules at ird.govt.nz/beps Question 38 Share repurchases When amounts distributed to shareholders on cancellation or repurchase of shares fall below specified thresholds, the amounts are taxable in full to shareholders as dividends. When distributions on repurchases exceed those thresholds, or occur through the stock exchange, the distributions will be deducted from available subscribed capital of the company and will be tax-free to the shareholders. However, this is only to the extent that the distributions are not in lieu of dividends. If the subscribed capital of the company has been depleted, the distributions will be taxable. Specific rules also govern the repurchase and subsequent sale of Treasury stock. The total value entered on the return should be the aggregate value of all distributions made by the company during the year for company shares repurchased, redeemed, cancelled or purchased as Treasury stock. Question 39 Foreign-sourced dividends Generally, funds would use the default FIF income calculation method (the fair dividend rate) which does not tax dividends separately. However, the foreign tax deducted from the dividend can be claimed as a credit against the tax payable on the calculated FIF income. A credit for any tax paid by the foreign company (on its earnings) may be allowed in calculating the amount payable by the New Zealand company. Any NRWT deducted from the foreign dividend paid to the New Zealand company may also be allowed as a credit. Information about exempt foreign dividends Although most foreign dividends received by companies are exempt from tax, you should still answer ''Yes'' to this question if the company receives an exempt foreign dividend. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE48 Foreign dividends from some investments are taxable. These should be included in the tax return as income from overseas. Dividends on foreign investments are taxable in 3 situations:  When the investment gives the company a direct income interest of less than 10% in a foreign company, but the investment is 1 of certain investments that are excluded from the normal FIF rules (see Question 18 on page 17 for the most common exclusions).  When the dividend relates to an investment in fixed-rate shares ("fixed-rate foreign equity").  When the dividend paid is tax-deductible in a foreign country by a foreign company (a "deductible foreign equity distribution"). Question 40 Company controlled or owned by non-residents We need to know whether the company is owned or controlled by non-residents because we may need to apply subpart FE or sections CH 9, GC 6-14 and GB 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Question 41 Total lowest economic interest of shareholders Calculating the economic interest is necessary for a number of reasons, such as making sure you can carry any net loss forward, the grouping provisions and the imputation credit carry forward provisions. Where there were no changes in shareholdings (including voting rights) throughout the entire year then the lowest economic interest will be 100%. Enter 100.00 at Box 41. Where there has been a change in shareholding including a change to voting rights or market value interests then you will need to calculate the total lowest economic interest. A shareholder's economic interest in a company will generally be measured by referring to the percentage of voting power they hold in that company, to vote on: 1. the dividends or other distributions to be made by the company 2. the constitution of the company 3. any variation in the capital of the company, and 4. the appointment or election of directors. ird.govt.nz49 Example A company has two shareholders, Barbara and Maria. The company has two classes of shares:  Class A shares carry a right to vote on (2) the constitution and (3) variations in capital  Class B shares carry unrestricted voting rights, (1), (2), (3) and (4) on the previous page. Barbara holds all 100 of the A shares in the company while Maria holds all 100 of the B shares. Their percentage of voting interest in the company is measured as follows: DistributionsConstitution Variation in capital DirectorsLowest Barbara 0+50+50+0=100 =25% 100+100+100+100=400 Maria 100+50+50+100=300 =75% 100+100+100+100=400 Enter this total at Box 41 in the Return100.00 If Barbara and Maria hold these proportions of shares for the entire income year, the "total lowest economic interest of shareholders" or the minimum continuity is 100%. The following example shows a shareholding or voting interest change occurring during the year. Example On 1 September 2021 Barbara and Maria swapped shares and held these proportions to 31 March 2022, the company's balance date. 1 April 2021 1 Sep 2021 31 Mar 2022 Lowest Barbara 25% 75% 75% 25% Maria 75% 25% 25% 25% The lowest percentage of rights held by each shareholder during the income year is 25%. So, the total lowest economic interest of shareholders, or the minimum continuity, is 50%. Enter this total at Box 41 in the Return as 50.00. In certain circumstances the shareholders' economic interests in a company will also be determined by the market value interests in the company. This is where the voting interests do not reflect the true economic interests held in a company. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE50 A shareholder's market value interest is their share as a percentage of the total market value of shares (and options) in the company. Specific factors that require a market value interest to be calculated are: –the company has issued debentures to which sections FA 2 or FA 2B of the Income Tax Act 2007 apply –the company has issued shares where payment of dividends is guaranteed by a third party –there's an option to acquire shares in the company, and –an arrangement exists for the purpose of defeating provisions that depends on measurement of voting and market value interests. You will need to add together the lowest economic interest of each shareholder and print the total in Box 41. Write percentages in the following format, for example, show 50% as 50.00, and 100% as 100.00. Effect on the imputation credit account (ICA) If you keep an ICA and have had a change of shareholding of more than 34% you may need to make an adjustment on your annual imputation return at Box 45C ("Other debits") - see page 54. Question 42 Shareholder details - see also the IR4S Complete Question 42 if shareholders, directors and relatives of shareholders received remuneration or a loan. Remuneration is liable for ACC levies. Shareholders' salaries Write all remuneration with no PAYE deducted that the company paid to that person in Box 42B. For the company to claim a deduction for shareholder remuneration it must be paid either: –during the income year, or –within the time allowed for the company to complete its return. If the remuneration is not paid in time, the deduction cannot be claimed until the following year. ird.govt.nz51 Over-payments of AIM provisional tax that relate to shareholder employee salary accruals are allowed to be used to meet the shareholder's tax liability on that salary at the end of the income year. Record details of any AIM tax credits transferred to each shareholder at Box 42C. Loss offsets and subvention payments Record details of any losses claimed or transferred from or to each group member at Box 42F. Record details of any subvention payments claimed or transferred from or to each group member at Box 42G. The total of Boxes 42F must be recorded at Box 29. The total of Boxes 42G must be recorded at Box 29A. Current account balance If the shareholder's current account balance has been overdrawn, (that is, the shareholder owes the company money) then it is a debit balance. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE52 Annual imputation return The annual imputation return must be completed for the period 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2022, regardless of your accounting year.

Question 44C Imputation credits attached to dividends received If the company received dividends with imputation credits attached between 1 April 2021 and 31 March 2022, print the total credits in Box 44C. Note This is the total imputation credits attached to dividends received. This amount is not limited to the tax payable on your dividends and is not necessarily the same amount as the imputation credits being claimed in Box 14. ird.govt.nz53 Question 44D Other credits List any other credits made to the ICA from 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2022. Use a separate sheet of paper if necessary. Attach it to the top of page 3 and print the total in Box 44D.

Supplementary available subscribed capital account (SASCA) If you're a public unit trust or a group investment fund that maintains a SASCA and you're eligible to transfer credits from that account to the ICA, record the credits being transferred to the ICA in Box 44D (other credits). All public unit trusts or group investment funds maintaining a SASCA should, by the due date for completing the 2022 IR4 or IR4J, send a copy of that memorandum account together with any written queries to: Investment Desk Large Enterprises Inland Revenue PO Box 2871 Christchurch 8140 For more information on negative dividends and the SASCA rules, see our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 14, No 11 (November 2002). Qualifying company election tax (QCET) payments Include any QCET payments made after 17 May 2007 as a credit in the ICA when working out the balance. Use the account balance in the formula, when calculating the imputation credit to be attached to a dividend paid by the qualifying company. See our Tax Information Bulletins (TIBs) Vol 11, No 5 (May/June 1999) and Vol 20, No 3, page 127 (April 2008). COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE54 Question 45 Debits Question 45A Income tax refunded Print in Box 45A the company's total income tax refunds received from 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2022 for 1989 and subsequent income years. Do not include any interest on tax received or income tax refunded for any year before 1989. Question 45B Imputation credits attached to dividends paid If the company paid dividends from 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2022 with imputation credits attached, print the total credits in Box 45B. Question 45C Other debits List any other debits in the ICA and print the total in Box 45C. Examples of other types of debits are: –any provisional tax allocated by the company to a company in the same wholly owned group that has underpaid its provisional tax –an adjustment for a change of shareholding of more than 34% during the period 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2022, regardless of your accounting year –an adjustment for a change in an imputation ratio, or –tax payable by a company on any part of a distribution not sourced from the subscribed capital of the company, where that company repurchases a share on-market. Qualifying companies The 66% continuity of shareholding requirement does not apply to qualifying companies. There is no need to make an adjustment where there has been a change of shareholding, except in the year the company ceases to be a qualifying company. Question 46A Adjustments to debit balance If a qualifying company received an income tax refund after 1 April 1995 that created a debit balance in the ICA, no further income tax is required to the extent of any refunds received. If the qualifying company has a debit balance as a result of income tax refunded from 1 April 2021, please subtract the amount refunded at Box 46A. If the closing balance is a credit, there is no tax to pay. ird.govt.nz55 If the closing balance at Box 46B is a debit, it must be paid by 20 June 2022. Note There are 2 types of relief from payment of debit ICA balances. These are: –the offsetting income tax payments –same debit ICA balances reflected in successive years. For more information see our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 16, No 1 (February 2004). Question 47 Imputation penalty tax Imputation penalty tax of 10% of the debit closing balance is also payable by 20 June 2022. Work out the 10% penalty in Box 47. If the total in Box 47A exceeds $100 and is not paid by the due date, late payment penalties and interest will apply - see page 46. Limitations on tax refunds We may hold all or part of a refund if: –the company is expecting an income tax refund, and –the credit balance in the ICA at 31 March 2022 is less than the refund. If there have been additional credits to the ICA since 31 March 2022, the company may complete an interim 2023 IR4J return in anticipation of an IR4 annual return being completed at a later date. We may then be able to release the refund. We can apply non-refundable overpaid income tax to a company's previous years' income tax liabilities, where these debits exist, rather than transferring the credit forward to the next year's provisional tax. This avoids further payments having to be made to meet back- year debts. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE56 Self-assessment by taxpayers Taxpayers have to assess their own liability as part of their return filing obligations. We may amend your assessment if a correction is required. If you dispute our assessment please go to ird.govt.nz/ disputes for more information.

Look-through companies (LTC) complete an IR7 income tax return each year they're an LTC. For more information about LTCs refer to our Look-through companies - IR879 guide. If yours is an Australian company or part of an imputation group, see page 7. Non-active companies A non-active company is a company that has: –not received any gross income –no deductions –not disposed of any assets, and –not been party to any transactions during the tax year that: (i) gave rise to income for any person (ii) gave rise to fringe benefits to any employee or any former employee, or (iii) gave rise to a debit in the company's ICA (imputation credit account). These companies may be excused from completing tax returns if they complete a Non-active company declaration - IR433 form. Return due date If the company has a 31 March balance date, you have until 7 July 2023 to complete the return, unless you have been granted an extension of time. If you have a balance date other than 31 March, this date may be different. Contact us if you are not sure of the filing date. If the company has a tax agent, you may have until 31 March 2024 to complete the return. If this applies, contact your agent. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE6 Late filing penalties If you have to complete a return and you do not send us one, you may be charged a late filing penalty. You should apply for an extension of time if you are unable to complete your return on time. The penalty for filing your IR4 late depends on the company's net income. If your income is: –below $100,000, the penalty is $50 –between $100,000 and $1 million (both figures inclusive), the penalty is $250, or –above $1 million, the penalty is $500. If you need an extension to your tax return filing date, tell us your reasons before your return is due. If you get a late filing penalty before applying for an extension, the penalty will stand. If you use a tax agent who has an extension of time arrangement with us and the extension is withdrawn, we will notify you that you must now complete your return. Tax sparing Any company that has claimed a foreign tax credit for a tax sparing arrangement under a double tax agreement, must also complete a Tax sparing disclosure return - IR486 and send it to: International Revenue Strategy Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 Group investment funds If the company's income is solely from Category A income, you must complete an IR4. If the income is solely from Category B income, you must complete an IR6. If the income is a combination of both Category A and Category B income, you must complete an IR4 and IR44E. Read the notes in the IR44E for more information. Research and development (R&D) tax losses You may be able to cash out any R&D losses if your company is a loss-making company that is a resident in New Zealand and your expenditure on R&D salary and wages is 20% or more of your total salary and wage expenditure. For more information go to ird.govt.nz/research-development ird.govt.nz7 Superannuation schemes A superannuation scheme, not registered with the Financial Markets Authority (FMA), which lets beneficiaries contribute, will be treated as a company for tax purposes and must complete IR4 returns. Trans-Tasman imputation and imputation groups Australian companies can elect to maintain a New Zealand imputation account from the 2003-04 tax year. A form of grouping (for imputation purposes only) has also been introduced, which Australian companies may join. Return filing for trans-Tasman imputation Australian companies that make a trans-Tasman imputation election are required to complete an Annual imputation return - IR4J by 31 July, after the end of the tax year. A Companies income tax return - IR4 is not required, unless the company has a permanent establishment (for example, maintains an office) in New Zealand. Return filing for imputation groups Companies income tax return - IR4 Company returns must be completed by: –all New Zealand companies that elect to be a member of an imputation group, and –Australian companies with New Zealand-sourced income. Annual imputation return - IR4J The imputation return for an imputation group should be completed by the group representative on a separate IR4J return. Imputation group members should not include any imputation details on page 7 of the IR4. An exception applies for nominated companies of a resident imputation group where there is an ICA debit balance. Foreign dividend payments - FDP The FDP rules have been fully repealed from 1 April 2017. This means FDP can no longer be included in your annual income tax return. Please do not include FDP credits in Box 14A. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE8 Imputation return Most New Zealand resident companies, unit trusts, producer boards and cooperatives must complete an imputation return each year. If you're an Australian company or part of an imputation group, please read page 7. The following bodies do not have to complete imputation returns: –non-resident companies –look-through companies –trustee companies (but not group investment funds with Category A income) –any company with a constitution that prevents it distributing all its income or property to any proprietor, member or shareholder –companies whose income is completely exempt from tax –local authorities –Crown research institutes –non-active companies –Māori authorities. Note If you need to complete the company's imputation return before the income tax return is due, to allow a refund to be released, complete an Annual imputation return - IR4J. Questions 1 to 8 Company details Fill in Questions 1 to 8 only if the correct information is not printed on the return. Question 2 - Company name If the company has changed its name since the last time a return was completed, please attach a copy of the new certificate of incorporation with the name change details or contact us so we can update our records. Question 4 - Postal address If you have a new postal address, write the details at Question 4. If your new address is a PO Box number, show your box lobby if you have one. If you are unsure of your box lobby please contact New Zealand Post. Leave this address panel blank if the company uses its tax preparer's postal address. The tax preparer will let us know if they change their address. ird.govt.nz9 Question 6 - Business industry classification (BIC) code If you're involved in a business or a trading activity, please write the BIC code only in Box 6. You do not need to give a description. We're required to supply the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) with a code for your business or trading activity, for levy classification and calculation. To work out your main business or trading activity and its code, go to businessdescription.co.nz or call ACC on 0508 426 837. It's important that you choose the code which most accurately reflects your main business or trading activity. Question 7 - Phone number We ask for your daytime phone number so we can contact you if we have any questions about your return. Question 8 - Bank account number The fastest and safest way to get any refund is to have it direct credited to your New Zealand bank account or other deposit account, for example, a building society account. If your bank account number is not preprinted on the return form, include it at Question 8. If your suffix has only 2 digits, enter them in the first 2 squares of the suffix box. Question 9 Non-resident A company is a tax resident of New Zealand if: –it's incorporated in New Zealand –its head office or centre of management is in New Zealand, or –its directors control the company in New Zealand. Otherwise, it's a non-resident for tax purposes. Questions 10 and 10A Imputation Page 7 of the IR4 return is the annual imputation return. If you have made any monetary entries in the annual imputation return, tick "Yes" at Question 10A. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE10 Note If you have completed, or will complete, a separate Annual imputation return - IR4J, tick "No" at Question 10. Question 11 Has the company ceased? If this is a final return, include a set of accounts up to the date the company ceased trading and include details of any distribution of assets and liabilities. If the company is registered for GST or as an employer, you will need to complete a Business cessation - IR315 form to finalise your records. Depending on the company's circumstances, a number of other issues may need to be finalised, for example: –outstanding returns –arrears –FBT or ACC –imputation account balances (for qualifying companies) –specified superannuation contributions –RWT on dividends, and –10-year bonus issues. Find out how to finalise the company's tax accounts or deregister for GST at ird.govt.nz Note A company is still a legal entity until it is taken off the Companies Register. A company can stop trading (become non-active) but still have tax obligations such as completing returns. Non-active companies can be excused from completing returns - see page 5. ird.govt.nz11 Company tax return Question 12 Income from schedular payments If the company has received any schedular payments, we will send you a summary of income. Add up the total tax withheld and all the gross payments shown on the summary of income and write the totals in Boxes 12A and 12B. The summary of income form may not contain all the company's earnings information. If any details are missing, please include them at Question 12. If the company received a payment with no tax deducted, include the gross amount in Box 12B. Mineral mining tax credit Include in Box 12A the amount of refundable tax credit being claimed where a tax loss is incurred on disposal of land or by claiming rehabilitation expenditure. Transferring tax deductions Tax deducted from schedular payments made to close companies can be transferred directly to the company's shareholder-employee(s) in some circumstances. You'll need to reduce the amount claimed in Box 12A by the amount of tax deducted from schedular payments which has been transferred direct to a shareholder-employee of the company. You will still need to include the total schedular payments made to the company in Box 12B. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE12 Example LLC received schedular payments of $10,000 with total tax deducted of $2,000 during the year. The $10,000 is attributable to the company's shareholder- employee through the attribution rule. LLC can transfer up to $2,000 of the tax deducted from the schedular payments it received to the company's shareholder-employee(s). LLC transfers the full $2,000 of tax to the company's sole shareholder-employee. As the full amount of tax has been transferred from LLC the amount in Box 12A should be $0. If the company is transferring tax deducted to shareholder- employee(s) it should attach details of the transfer to the return. The amount of tax transferred from the company to its shareholder-employee(s) will also need to be recorded as a debit entry in the company's imputation credit account - see Question 45C on page 54. Question 13 New Zealand interest Interest from all New Zealand sources must be shown in the return. Write the total of all RWT deducted in Box 13A. If the company has had NRWT deducted from New Zealand interest, include this in Box 13A. Add up all the gross interest amounts (before the deduction of any tax) and write the total in Box 13B. Interest on broken term deposits If you have broken a term deposit during the year, you may have to account for "negative interest". This is interest repaid on the term deposit and may reduce the amount of interest to declare on the tax return. If the term deposit was broken in full, or it was business- related, deduct the negative interest from the gross interest amount shown on the RWT withholding certificate. Deduct the allowable negative interest part, using the worksheet below, before entering the gross amount at Question 13 of the tax return. In all other cases, the negative interest is deductible in a later tax return when the term deposit matures. ird.govt.nz13 Worksheet Copy your gross interest from your RWT withholding certificate to Box 1. 1 Print any negative interest you have paid in Box 2. 2 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1 and print the answer in Box 3. Copy this amount to Box 13B of your tax return. 3 Interest paid or charged by Inland Revenue If we paid you interest, include it in Box 13B for the income year the company received the interest. If the company paid us interest, include it as a deduction in the return for the income year the interest is paid. Note If expenses are deductible against the interest income, claim them at Box 20B. Do not send us interest statements with the return. Keep these in case we ask for them later. Income from financial arrangements If the company was a party to a financial arrangement, such as government stock, local authority stock, mortgage bonds, futures contracts or deferred property settlements, the income or expenditure from the financial arrangement may have to be calculated using a spreading method, rather than on a cash basis. If the financial arrangement matures or is sold, remitted or transferred, a "wash-up" calculation known as a base price adjustment must be made. Any RWT will be deducted on a cash basis. Show the RWT deducted and any income from the financial arrangement in Boxes 13A and 13B. Question 14 New Zealand dividends Generally, dividends are taxable. However, there is an exemption for dividends paid between members of a wholly owned group. To work out the total gross dividends, add up all net dividends received, any imputation credits, and any RWT deductions. Write the total of all dividends in Box 14B. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE14 Note The FDP rules have been fully repealed from 1 April 2017. Do not include any FDP credits in Box 14A. Dividend tax credits The total tax credits for dividends (for example imputation credits) you can claim is limited to the income tax payable (28%) on each dividend the company receives. This is to ensure that surplus tax credits are not used to shelter tax on other income. Work out whether you need to apply this limitation to the dividend tax credits you will claim. Copy your total gross dividends (calculated for each dividend that had an imputation credit) from Box 14B to Box 1. 1 Multiply Box 1 by 0.28 (28%), and write the result in Box 2. 2 Write your total dividend tax credits (calculated for that dividend) in Box 3. 3 For each dividend, claim a dividend tax credit for the lower amount shown in Box 2 or Box 3. Write the total dividend imputation credits you are allowed to claim in Box 14. In Box 14A write the sum of your total dividend RWT credits you are allowed to claim. Note If expenses are deductible against the dividend income, claim them at Box 20B. Unit trusts Distributions from unit trusts will generally be taxable. The statement you receive from the unit trust should show the amounts to include in the return. For unit trusts that are also portfolio investment entities (PIEs) see page 19. ird.govt.nz15 Transfer of deductible expenses between member and master funds From the 2002-03 income year a member fund may, in certain circumstances, elect to transfer deductible expenses to a master fund. The master fund must invest, in whole or in part, in the member fund. The master fund can then deduct the transferred expenses. A member fund can include a group investment fund that derives Category A income, a public unit trust or a superannuation fund. A master fund can include a group investment fund that derives Category A income or a public unit trust. A public unit trust includes: –retail unit trusts, whose units are offered to the public and which have 100 or more unit holders –wholesale unit trusts, whose units are held by widely held investment vehicles such as other unit trusts or superannuation funds. Member or master funds wanting to take advantage of this provision should include details of the adjustment in a tax reconciliation statement accompanying the return. The information should accompany the returns of both funds involved in the transfer. For more information see our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 13, No 11 (November 2001). Qualifying companies Generally, if a qualifying company is a shareholder in a company that is not a qualifying company, all dividends the qualifying company derives from the other company are taxable. Dividends derived by a company (that has been a qualifying company at any time before deriving the dividends) are taxable. If a qualifying company is a shareholder in another qualifying company, only dividends with imputation credits attached and a return of a 10-year bonus issue before the 10-year period expires, are taxable. Dividends with no imputation credits attached, or a return of a 10-year bonus issue 10 years from the payment date, are exempt income. A distribution of a 10-year bonus issue before the 10-year period has expired, made when the company winds up, is not taxable. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE16 If you need more help, read our guide Qualifying companies - IR435. Do not send us dividend statements with the return, keep them in case we ask for them later. Question 15 Ma ̄ori authority distributions Māori authorities can make various types of distributions. Fill in Question 15 if you received any taxable Māori authority distributions between 1 April 2022 and 31 March 2023. The Māori authority that paid you the distribution will send you a Māori authority distribution statement. Credits attached to distributions The Māori authority may attach a credit to the distribution it makes to members. This credit will be classified as a Māori authority credit and is part of the tax the Māori authority has already paid on its profits, so the distributions are not taxed twice. What to show in your return Your Māori authority distribution statement shows the amount of: –the distribution made to you, including the taxable portion and the non-taxable portion, and –Māori authority credit. These amounts, not including any non-taxable distribution, will need to be transferred to the relevant boxes at Question 15. Example A Māori authority makes a pre-tax profit of $10,000. It pays tax on this profit of $1,750 (Māori authority tax rate of 17.5%) and distributes the entire profit to its 10 members. Each member will receive $825 as a cash distribution and $175 of Māori authority credits. Each member of the authority liable to file an IR4 return would show the following information at Question 15: – Box 15B - $1,000 (made up of $825 + $175) – Box 15A - $175 ird.govt.nz17 Question 16 Partnership, estate or trust income If the company received any income from a partnership, estate or trust, write any tax credits in Box 16A and the income totals in Box 16B. Do not include any: –overseas income - show this at Question 18 along with any credits attached, or –dividend imputation credits attached to dividends (include these in Box 14, RWT withheld in Box 14A and the gross dividend in Box 14B), or –income and expenses from residential property including rental income and net bright-line profit – show these at Question 19. Add up any other tax credits from partnerships, estates or trusts and write the total in Box 16A. Add up all the other income from partnerships, estates or trusts and write the total in Box 16B. Losses from limited partnerships If the company is claiming a loss from a limited partnership and you need help working out the amount you can claim, go to ird.govt.nz Estate or trust income If you received a taxable distribution from a non-complying trust, please attach a note with your return giving details of the amount and any associated tax credits. We separate taxable distributions from a non-complying trust because they are taxed at a different rate. We need these details to work out your tax liability correctly. Question 18 Overseas income If your company received income from or while based overseas, between 1 April 2022 and 31 March 2023, show it in New Zealand dollars at Box 18B. If the company is a New Zealand resident for tax purposes, you must include any foreign contract or service income in Box 18B. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE18 Foreign investment fund (FIF) If the company held rights, such as shares, units or an entitlement to benefit in any foreign company, unit trust, superannuation scheme or life insurance policy, at any time during the 2023 income year, you may be required to calculate FIF income or loss. If the company has an interest in a controlled foreign company (CFC), they must calculate any attributed income or loss from that interest. Generally, the company will use the fair dividend rate to calculate FIF income. The main exclusions from an interest in an FIF are: –investments in certain Australian resident companies listed on approved indices on the Australian stock exchange, that maintain franking accounts –interest in certain Australian unit trusts –limited exemptions for interests in certain venture capital interests that move offshore (for 10 income years from the income year in which the company migrates from New Zealand), and –a 10% or greater interest in a CFC. CFC income and losses New rules were introduced in 2009 for calculating income or losses from a CFC. If the company has an interest in a CFC, they must calculate any attributed income or loss from that interest. Losses from a CFC cannot be used to offset domestic income or be included in domestic losses carried forward to the next tax year. Generally, these losses can only offset income or future income from CFCs resident in the same country as the CFC that incurred the loss. When CFC income or losses are calculated under the new rules, transitional rules apply to the use of carried forward losses incurred under the old rules. You can find more information on the rules at ird.govt.nz and in our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 21, No 8 (October/ November 2009). What to show in your return You can convert all overseas income and tax credits to New Zealand dollars by:  using the rates table available from ird.govt.nz19 ird.govt.nz/tools-calculators  contacting the overseas section of a trading bank and asking for the exchange rate for the day you received your overseas income. If the income was received from a financial arrangement, refer to Determination G9A or G9C under section 90 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Write the total of the allowable overseas tax paid in Box 18A. Include in Box 18B income before the deduction of any tax. Credit for tax paid overseas will be limited to the amount of New Zealand tax payable on that income. Please note that Australian franking credits or tax credits on dividends from the United Kingdom cannot be claimed. Staple proof of tax paid overseas to the top of page 3 of the return. Foreign tax credits attached to dividends that are not required to be returned under the FIF rules can be claimed up to the amount of New Zealand tax payable on the FIF interest. Some foreign dividends have New Zealand imputation credits attached or New Zealand RWT deducted. These credits are not subject to the foreign tax credit limitation rule. Investments in portfolio investment entities (PIEs) Certain PIEs attribute their net income/loss and tax credits to the investors. Companies that are investors include the attributed income or loss in their tax return. Each year, the PIE is required to provide an investor statement setting out the details of the income/loss attributed to the investor for the year. The statement also shows the various types of tax credits associated with the income that has been attributed. These tax credits are subject to the tax credit limits calculated in relation to the tax on the attributed PIE income. The attributed PIE income/loss is included in the company's return for the period that includes the end of the PIE's income year. Generally, PIEs have a 31 March balance date. The amount of income the company derives as a distribution by a PIE is excluded income unless it is fully imputed dividends from a listed PIE. Dividends from these PIEs are not liable for RWT. For more information, go to ird.govt.nz or read our guides, Information for companies that invest in PIEs - IR857 and Portfolio investment entity: a guide for PIEs - IR860. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE20 Question 19 Income and expenses from residential property This question applies to close companies that own residential property, including overseas property, that have:  income subject to the residential property deduction rules  net income from a bright-line sale  income in relation to a loan in a foreign currency  depreciation recovery income from disposed assets  net income from the taxable disposal of a residential property outside the residential property deduction rules because it is held on revenue account. The residential property deduction rules, and Question 19, do not apply to residential land that is owned by companies other than close companies. Close company - generally a company with 5 or fewer natural persons whose total voting interests are more than 50%. Associated persons are treated as 1 person. Residential property deduction rules Most residential rental properties are subject to the residential property deduction rules (also known as the ring-fencing rules). The rules generally limit the amount of residential deductions you can claim in the year to the total amount of residential income earned in that year. If the deductions are more than your income, the difference must be carried forward to the next year income is earned from the residential property, including income from properties held on revenue account. Any rental income or loss and net income or loss from a taxable disposal is fully excluded from the rules if the property is:  subject to the mixed-use asset rules (for example, a holiday home rented out part-time and not used for at least 62 days in the income year, or 62 working days in the income year if it’s usually only used on working days)  owned by companies other than close companies  owned by government enterprises, or  certain employee accommodation. For these types of property, any rental income or loss is shown at Box 21 and net income or net loss from a taxable disposal shown in Box 22. ird.govt.nz21 Any rental net loss and net loss from a taxable disposal is partially excluded from the rules if it is for:  property that will always be taxed on sale, being revenue account property of a person in the business of building, developing or dealing in land, or  other revenue account property the person has notified us they want the exclusion to apply to. For these types of property any rental net loss is shown at Box 21 and taxable disposal net loss shown at Box 22. The residential property deduction rules also apply to any company who has borrowed money to acquire an interest in certain entities with significant rental property holdings - a residential land-rich entity - and has interest expenditure on the borrowed money. Residential land-rich entity - a close company, partnership or look-through company that holds more than 50% of its assets by value in residential land, directly or indirectly. These entities come under the interposed entities rules as part of the residential property deduction rules. For more information about the interposed entity rules, see page 60 of the Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No.8 September 2019. Read our Rental income - IR264 guide for more information on:  when the rules apply  how to calculate your income  the amount of deductions you can claim this year, and  the amount of any excess deductions that must be carried forward. Completing your return Tick the method you have used to calculate your residential property income and deductions. You can use 1 of the following methods:  Portfolio basis - combine income and deductions for all rental properties in the portfolio.  Individual, property-by-property basis - income and deductions of individual property calculated separately to other property. You need to maintain separate records for each property to choose this option.  Combination of the individual basis and portfolio basis - choose to apply different methods to different property. Some properties are held in a portfolio and others are held on an individual basis. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE22 You need to calculate and identify the amounts for Boxes 19A to 19I using the method you have chosen for your rental properties. For the portfolio basis, the allowable deductions from all of the properties in your portfolio can be offset against income you earn from all of the properties in the portfolio. You can then enter these figures in the Residential property deductions worksheets - IR1226 to help calculate the figures required to be entered in your return. You can print a copy off our website ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Write the gross residential rental income from the portfolio and/or individual property in Box 19A. Do not include rental income or losses from properties excluded from the residential property deduction rules. Enter those amounts in Question 21 instead. Box 19B Net bright-line profit The bright-line property rule needs to be considered when none of the other land sale rules at Question 22 apply to the disposal of the property. This rule for residential property looks at the length of time a property (including overseas property) is owned. If you sell or dispose of a residential property within a certain timeframe and no exclusion applies, then your profit on the sale will be taxable. This applies no matter what your reason was for buying or selling the property or what kind of buyer you are. The bright-line property rule applies if you sell or dispose of a residential property you have owned for less than:  5 years for properties acquired between 29 March 2018 and 26 March 2021.  5 years for properties acquired as a result of an offer made on or before 23 March 2021 and that offer was not able to be revoked or withdrawn before 27 March 2021.  5 years for properties acquired on or after 27 March 2021 that qualify as a ‘new build’.  10 years for all other properties acquired on or after 27 March 2021. For tax purposes, a property is generally acquired on the date a binding sale and purchase agreement is entered into (even if some standard conditions like getting finance or a building report still need to be met). This date will determine which bright-line period (5 or 10 years) applies for your property. ird.govt.nz23 For more information on when a property is acquired, see our Question we’ve been asked (QB) 17/02: Date of acquisition of land, and start date for 2-year bright-line test at taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz There are other dates that are relevant for figuring out whether your property sale is taxable under the bright-line property rule. Generally, your bright-line period starts when the legal title is transferred to you and ends when you enter into a binding sale and purchase agreement to sell the property. Where land is acquired or disposed of in a way that does not follow the standard land sale process, for example if you purchase “off the plan”, there are some different rules that apply to the bright-line period start and end dates. The bright-line property rule does not tax any profit made in specific situations. Relief is also available for certain ownership transfers. For more information on exclusions to the bright-line property rule, ownership transfers and rollover relief go to ird. govt.nz/brightline or our guide Bright-line property tax - IR1227. You can also use the property tax decision tool on our website to work out if you need to pay tax on the sale of your property. Go to ird.govt.nz/brightline If you sell or dispose of a residential property and the sale is taxable under the bright-line property rule, the amount of the previously denied interest under the interest limitation rules is treated as if it were part of the cost of the property in the year of disposal. If this results in a net loss, the deduction for the net loss is limited under the current rule that applies to losses from the disposal of bright-line property. If the disposal is not taxable, the interest previously denied a deduction remains non-deductible. For more information about the bright-line property rule, go to ird.govt.nz/brightline or our guide Bright-line property tax - IR1227. You can find our forms and guides at ird.govt.nz/ forms-guides Completing your return Income and losses for property subject to the bright-line property rule are treated differently in the tax return. After a taxable bright-line sale:  if you have net income from the sale of the property (a profit), the net income is included in Box 19B. Unless the property is part of a portfolio, expenses from other properties cannot be offset against the net income from the disposal. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE24  if you have made a net loss when the property is sold, the loss must be carried forward to a later income year when it can be used to offset net income from the land sale provisions, including from future disposals subject to the bright-line rule. A bright-line loss is not recorded in the tax return. Please keep your own record of any bright-line losses you have made. Complete a Bright-line residential property sale information - IR833 form for each bright-line property sold or disposed of and include it with your return. The form explains how to calculate the resulting profit or loss. Complete the form even if the details have been included in a Financial statements summary - IR10 or set of accounts, unless the income will be included in your return as part of your business income as a property speculator, property dealer, developer or builder. Box 19C Other residential income Write the total other residential income in Box 19C. This includes the total from the following amounts:  income in relation to a loan denominated in a foreign currency from the portfolio and/or individual property  all depreciation recovery income from assets disposed of from the portfolio and/or individual property  net income from the taxable disposal of a residential property outside the residential property deduction rules because it is held on revenue account. Write any net tax losses from disposals of rental properties that are excluded from the residential property deduction rules in Box 22B. ird.govt.nz25 Box 19D Total combined residential income The amount in Box 19D is the total amount of Box 19A, Box 19B and Box 19C. Note If you are a partner in a partnership or owner of a look- through company and have been attributed residential income at Box 27G on the IR7P or IR7L, include your share of that in proportion to your share in the partnership or effective look-through interest in the LTC in the following relevant boxes:  Gross residential rental income Box 19A  Net bright-line profit (excluding losses) Box 19B  Other residential income Box 19C. The amount in Box 19D will then include the total of your attributed residential income at Box 27G on the IR7P or IR7L. Boxes 19E to 19I in your return Write the total eligible deductions for the year for all ring- fenced residential rental properties in Residential rental deductions Box 19E. If you are a partner in a partnership or owner of a look-through company and have been attributed residential rental deductions shown at Box 27M on the IR7P or IR7L, include that here at Box 19E. Note Do not include the amount of interest expense denied under the interest limitation rules in Box 19E. If the company has breached the continuity rules, or the company is transferring excess deductions to a wholly owned group member, you’ll need to reduce the current year deductions in Box 19E to reflect the adjustment. If the company is receiving excess deductions from a wholly owned group member, you’ll need to increase the current year deductions in Box 19E. The transfer of excess deductions is not a loss offset nor a subvention payment. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE26 The brought forward and carry forward boxes are calculated by our system when your return is processed. If the deductions are too low, you’ll need to contact us so we can change it when we process your return. Keep good records for the adjustment and include a note with your return. See Question 28 for details on the continuity rules. Include the amount of any interest incurred on an investment in a land rich entity that relates to the rental activity in Box 19E. Include the amount of interest you can claim on an investment in a land rich entity that relates to the rental activity in Box 19G. Include the amount of interest paid that does not relate to the rental property in Box 21B. Write the total excess deductions brought forward from last year in Box 19F. Write the total residential rental deductions claimed this year in Box 19G. This amount cannot exceed the lesser of the following:  Total combined residential income Box 19D  Residential rental deduction Box 19E plus Excess residential rental deductions brought forward Box 19F. The amount cannot exceed the above unless you have sold an individual property or the last property in a residential portfolio and the sale was taxable. The amount in Box 19H should equal Total combined residential income Box 19D minus Residential rental deductions claimed this year Box 19G. Any losses are counted as zero unless the loss is the result of either:  excess deductions released from either a taxable disposal of a property held on the individual property basis, or a taxable disposal of all properties or the last property held in a portfolio, or  claimable interest paid on your investment in a residential land-rich entity. Refer to the Rental income - IR264 guide. Write the amount of all excess deductions for the year to be carried forward to next year in Box 19I. ird.govt.nz27 Notes Note 1 If you sell or dispose of an individual property and the sale is not taxable, or you sell or dispose of the last property in a portfolio and at least 1 of the sales in the portfolio was not taxable, any excess deductions will transfer to another property or portfolio and carried forward to a future year in which you earn income from a residential rental property (including properties on revenue account). Note 2 If you sell or dispose of an individual property and the sale is taxable, or you sell or dispose of the last rental property in a portfolio and the sale of all your rental properties in a portfolio were taxable, any remaining loss/ excess deductions are released and can be offset against other income. However, this does not include any excess deductions transferred to the portfolio/property. Note 3 If you want to claim that a property is held on revenue account where the sale may be taxable, you need to notify us of the details of the property. You will be stating the sale will be a taxable sale when the property is disposed of. You must be able to separately identify the deductions relating to the property. For more information read the Rental income - IR264 guide. Residential land-rich entities If the company has an investment in a land rich entity, include:  interest relating to the residential rental activity that is deductible under the interest limitation rules in Box 19E  interest relating to the residential rental activity you can claim this year under the residential property deduction rules in Box 19G and any remaining amount carried forward in Box 21B  a note attached to your income tax return advising the above amounts relate to an investment in a land rich entity, to ensure quick processing of your return  the amount of interest paid that does not relate to the residential rental property in Box 24. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE28 Question 20 Interest incurred from residential property This question applies to owners of residential property subject to the interest limitation rules. You do not need to complete this question for the following types of property:  farmland  hospitals, hospices, convalescent homes, nursing homes  rest homes and retirement villages  hotels, motels, inns, camping grounds, hostels. For interest to be deductible, the general deductibility rules must be met. The interest will also not be deductible to the extent to which it is of a private or domestic nature. Since 1 October 2021, interest is not deductible for residential property in New Zealand acquired on or after 27 March 2021, unless an exclusion or exemption applies (see below). For properties acquired before 27 March 2021, the ability to deduct interest on existing loans is being phased out between 1 October 2021 and 31 March 2025. For the 2023 tax year, you can claim 75% of the interest incurred from 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023. Interest on any new loans drawn down on or after 27 March 2021 is not deductible. Special rules also apply for refinanced loans and for interest on revolving credit and overdraft facilities. Any interest on borrowings above the closing balance on 26 March 2021 is not deductible. For more information, go to ird.govt.nz/property/renting-out-residential-property Some companies do not have to apply the interest limitation rules. If your company is a close company where five or fewer individuals or trustees own more than 50% of the company, you will usually have to apply the rules. If your company meets one of the following:  it is not a close company; or  it is a close company that is a Māori authority or eligible to be a Māori authority; or  it is a close company that is wholly-owned by a Māori authority or by an entity eligible to be a Māori authority; ird.govt.nz29 your company will not have to apply the interest limitation rules if less than 50% of its total assets consist of residential property (excluding development property but including shares in other companies that exceed this 50% test) at all times during the income year. If your company is part of a wholly-owned group, the 50% test is applied on a consolidated basis at the group level. There are interposed entity rules to deny interest deductions for a customer who borrows to indirectly fund residential property through an interposed entity. Completing your return Complete question 20 for any interest expense you are claiming at Boxes 19E and 21B in relation to a house, apartment, flat or other structure that could be used for residential accommodation, either short-term or long-term. This includes if you have an arrangement to build such a structure, and bare land that could be used to build such a structure under the relevant district plan. Write the total interest on residential property in Box 20A. This is the total interest incurred on your borrowings for all your residential properties for this year. Write the amount of interest expense claimed in Box 20B. Note If you are a partner in a partnership or owner of a look- through company that has incurred interest on residential property at Question 19 in the IR7, include your share of that here in proportion to your share in the partnership or effective look-through interest in the LTC. If you have claimed an interest expense in Box 20B, at Box 20C tick the reason(s) for the interest expense claimed:  A Māori exempt company or not a residential land company - The interest limitation rules do not apply to non-close companies or groups if less than 50% of its total assets consist of residential property (excluding development property but including shares in other companies that exceed this 50% test) at all times during the income year. A close company that is a Māori authority, eligible to be a Māori authority, or wholly-owned by an entity that is a Māori authority or eligible to be one is an exempt Māori company if it passes this 50% test. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE30  Certain schedule 15 exclusions or property not in NZ - The interest limitation rules apply to land in New Zealand only. Schedule 15 of the Income Tax Act 2007 also allows you to claim interest for the following:  main home – if a portion is used to earn income such as a flatting situation  business premises (for example, a villa now used as a dental clinic) except if the business premises is used for providing accommodation and it’s not a person’s main home  certain Māori land, papakāinga and kaumātua housing, and land transferred as part of settlement under Te Tiriti o Waitangi/Treaty of Waitangi  employee accommodation  student accommodation.  Loans drawn down prior to 27 March 2021 - From 1 October 2021, the ability to claim interest is being phased out for the following situations:  loans drawn down prior to 27 March 2021  property acquired before 27 March 2021 but the loan for the settlement of the property was not drawn down until on or after 27 March 2021  loans that relate to the purchase of a property acquired as a result of an offer made on or before 23 March 2021 and that offer was not able to be revoked or withdrawn before 27 March 2021. In other situations where the property is acquired on or after 27 March 2021, interest cannot be claimed from 1 October 2021 onwards.  Emergency, transitional, social or council housing - You can claim interest for loans if your property is used for emergency, transitional or social housing when leased to the Crown, for example to Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga - Ministry of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) or Kāinga Ora, or to a registered community housing provider.  New build exemption - A ‘new build’ is a self-contained residence that is issued a Code Compliance Certificate (CCC) under the Building Act 2004, confirming the residence was added to the land on or after 27 March 2020. The exemption generally applies for 20 years. For more information about what qualifies as a new build go to ird.govt.nz/property/renting-out-residential-property or our guide Rental income - IR264. ird.govt.nz31  Development or land business exemption - The development exemption does not require you to have a ‘land business’ and applies to land that you develop, subdivide, or build on to create a new build. The development may be a one-off. The land business exemption applies to land held as part of a developing, subdividing, or land-dealing business, or a business of erecting buildings on land.  Approved build-to-rent exclusion - This applies to land that meets the criteria of build-to-rent land and is approved by Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga - Ministry of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). You can claim interest for loans if your property is recorded on the build-to-rent asset register maintained by HUD. Existing build-to-rent land has until 1 July 2023 to meet the requirements and to apply. For more information about the interest limitation rules and how to calculate the amount of interest you can claim, go to ird.govt.nz/property/renting-out-residential-property or our guide Rental income - IR264. You can find our forms and guides at ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Question 21 Business or other rental income Include net residential rental income or losses not included at Question 19 and rents from a commercial property in Box 21B. Do not include any income already shown at Questions 12 to 16 and 19, losses from CFCs (see the notes to Question 37 on page 46) or claim donations here (see the notes to Question 26 on page 35). Write the net profit or loss in Box 21B. This is the amount of income or loss after the deduction of all allowable business expenditure, including shareholders' salaries paid or credited. Note If expenses are deductible against income declared in Questions 12 to 14, claim them here. Attach either: –a fully completed Financial statements summary - IR10 form, or –the company's financial accounts. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE32 The IR10 is a statistics form that sets out a general summary of information from the financial accounts. If you complete an IR10 you do not need to send the financial accounts as well. You still need to complete them (unless the company is very small) and keep them in case we ask for them. Very small companies are not required to prepare financial accounts if these conditions apply during the income year. The company:  is not part of a group  has not derived income over $30,000, or  has not incurred expenditure over $30,000. Companies that do not prepare financial accounts must fill in an IR10 using information from their trial balance or financial records. For more information about who has to prepare financial accounts and minimum financial reporting requirements, go to our website at ird.govt.nz/records The attribution rule Under the attribution rule, anyone whose actions cause an "associated person" (company, trust or partnership) to earn income, can be personally liable for tax on that income. If this rule applies to persons associated to your organisation, it will affect the amount of taxable income in this return. To find out how to apply this rule, refer to our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB), Vol 12, No 12 (December 2000) and Vol 13, No 11 (November 2001). Question 22 Income from taxable property sales or disposals Include all income and tax losses from land sales or disposals of other property not included at Question 19. Profits from land sales are taxable if you bought a property (including an overseas property) for the purpose of reselling it or are in the business of buying and selling land and/or buildings. The profits may also be taxable if the company:  is a builder and improved a property before selling it  developed or subdivided land and sold sections, or  had a change of zoning on the property and sold it within ten years of buying it. ird.govt.nz33 Write the total profit or loss from the sale or disposal of other property in Box 22B. Net profit from a bright-line sale is generally included in Box 19B. Only include in Box 22B the net profit from a bright-line sale excluded at Question 19, for example the bright-line sale of a mixed-use asset. Do not include any net loss from a bright- line sale. For more information on the land sale rules, go to ird.govt. nz/buying-selling or our guide Tax and your property transactions - IR361. You can find our forms and guides at ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Box 22A Residential land withholding tax (RLWT) credit If the company is an "offshore RLWT person" and has sold or transferred residential property located in New Zealand, RLWT may have been deducted from the sale price. The company should have received a statement on the completion of the sale process showing the amount of RLWT deducted. The company can claim a credit for any RLWT deducted. Show the amount of RLWT deducted, less any RLWT paid back to the company and/or transferred to outstanding amounts during the income year. If there was more than 1 amount of RLWT deducted, show the combined amount, less any RLWT paid back to the company and/or transferred to outstanding amounts during the income year. Question 23 Insurance premiums paid to an overseas insurer Special rules apply to any company paying a premium, including a reinsurance premium, to a non-resident insurer. If you're paying a premium to a non-resident insurer you need to get a separate IRD number to account for the tax on the premium income. This is because you're considered to be the insurer's agent. You will need to complete an IR4 return under this separate IRD number and declare premiums paid as the only income received. Only 10% of the total gross premiums paid to overseas insurers is subject to the company tax rate of 28%. This equals 2.8% of the total premiums paid. Any premiums paid to insurers in Switzerland are not subject to tax in New Zealand and should be deducted from the total gross premiums paid. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE34 Agency obligations also extend to other New Zealand residents, for example, brokers, who may initially collect premiums for payment to the non-resident insurer. If there is any default, the insured person is responsible for the tax. Print the gross amount of premiums paid to a non-resident insurer in Box 23. Print the gross amount of premiums paid to Switzerland in Box 23A. Deduct the figure in Box 23A from Box 23 and multiply the net amount by 0.1 (10%). Print your answer in Box 23B and copy this amount to Box 31. No other income should be returned as an agent for an overseas insurer. The company still needs to declare other income under its original IRD number. If you have any enquiries, contact: Team Lead Significant Enterprises Inland Revenue PO Box 39090 Wellington Mail Centre Lower Hutt 5045 Phone 0800 443 773 Question 24 Other income Show any other income received by the company at Question 24. For example, the sale of: –shares or other property –securities –income from an undertaking or scheme. Income from sale of non-FIF shares or other property Profits from the sale of shares and other property are taxable if the company: –buys and sells shares or other property as a business, or –buys shares or other property for the purpose of resale. This does not apply if shares are FIFs. List the details of income and expenses from these sales on a sheet of paper and staple it to the top of page 3 of the return. Include the total profit in Box 24B. ird.govt.nz35 Losses from shares or other property that are not a foreign investment fund (FIF) If the company has made a loss from the sale of an asset that was not a FIF and you can show that any profit made would have been taxable, you may be able to claim the loss as a deduction. Financial arrangements A company must account for income from financial arrangements on an accrual basis. Financial arrangements include government stock, futures contracts and deferred property settlements, excluding short-term agreements for sale and purchase of property. Changes to the rules for the treatment of financial arrangements have split the rules into 2 sets. Generally, the first set applies to financial arrangements entered into before 20 May 1999 and the second applies to financial arrangements entered into on or after that date. Both sets of rules require the income or expenditure to be spread over the term of the financial arrangement. This applies in every case - the company does not have to be in the business of buying or selling financial arrangements, or be intending to sell, as it would with shares. The company may, in certain cases, deduct any losses. Sale or maturity of financial arrangements When a financial arrangement matures or is sold, remitted or transferred, a "wash-up" calculation, known as a base price adjustment, must be made. The calculation ensures that the total gains or losses from the financial arrangement are accounted for. If you need any information on when losses can be deducted or how to calculate a base price adjustment, please contact us. Income from an undertaking or scheme Profits from any undertaking or scheme entered into for the purpose of making a profit are taxable. Describe the undertaking or scheme and list the details of income and expenses from them. Staple this information to the top of page 3 of the return and include the total profit in Box 24B. Question 26 Donations A company (including an unlisted company with 5 or fewer shareholders) can claim a deduction for donations it makes to any society, institution, association, organisation, trust or fund that has donee organisation status. You can view the list of these organisation at ird.govt.nz/donee COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE36 Note State-funded tertiary education institutions, state schools and state-integrated schools do not have to be approved to have donee organisation status. The deduction for donations cannot be more than the company's net income after expenses (before the donation deduction is taken into account). Use the following steps to calculate the company's donation deduction.  If the amount in Box 25 is a loss, print nil in Box 26B.  If the donations made by the company exceed the amount in Box 25, copy the amount in Box 25 to Box 26B.  If the donations made by the company do not exceed the amount in Box 25, print the amount of the donations in Box 26B. Question 28 Net losses brought forward Losses from CFCs are not included in Question 28 - see Question 39 on page 47. Before a company is allowed to carry forward net losses it must satisfy one of two tests. 1. Shareholder continuity 49% continuity of minimum voting interest or market value interest must be maintained by a group of persons at all times, from the beginning of the year of net loss to the end of the year of carrying it forward (the continuity period). To check whether the shareholder continuity requirements have been met, use the lowest percentage of economic interest held by each shareholder during the continuity period. To calculate the total lowest economic interest see Question 41 on page 48. 2. Business continuity test The business continuity test allows losses to be carried forward despite a breach in shareholder continuity if certain requirements are satisfied. The main requirement is that the underlying business continues i.e. there is no “major change”, except permitted changes, in the business for 5 years after a change in ownership. “Major change” refers to the nature of the business activities and the extent the same or similar assets are used to generate income for the company. Only losses incurred in the 2013-14 and later income years can be carried forward under this test. ird.govt.nz37 For more information see our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 33, No 6 (July 2021). Write the net losses the company can bring forward to 2023 in Box 28A, and the amount the company has offset against 2023 income in Box 28B. If the company cannot offset any net losses in the 2023 income year write “0.00” in Box 28B. Show whether or not the company is carrying forward losses under the business continuity test at Box 28C. Note You should be able to find the loss balance from the previous year on the loss notice sent to you with the company's 2022 income tax assessment. If you do not have a loss notice, enter the details from your own records. Question 29 Total income after net losses brought forward Subtract Box 28B from Box 27. Print your answer in Box 29. Question 30 Net losses and subvention payments To offset net losses there must be a common shareholding of at least 66%, and 49% continuity of minimum voting interest must also be maintained (or 49% market value interest if a market value circumstance exists). To calculate voting or market value interest see Question 41 on page 48. To offset a net loss incurred during a current income year, the loss company and the profit company must be members of the same group at all times for that income year. To offset a net loss brought forward, the loss company and the profit company must be members of the same group of companies for the entire period, beginning with the income year the net loss is incurred in and ending with the year of offset. The amount of loss offset cannot exceed the taxable income of the profit company and neither may the amount of loss to be offset exceed the net loss of the loss company. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE38 Record individual details of the losses claimed or transferred and subvention payments received or made at Questions 42F or 42G. The total of these must equal Boxes 30 or 30A respectively. Part-year grouping The general part-year grouping rule is that only the part of the net loss incurred in the same period as the profit is derived may be offset, if, during the period: –the loss company maintains continuity of shareholding, and –commonality of shareholding between loss and profit companies has been maintained. Net loss and profit amounts allowed to be offset are based on periods where continuity and commonality requirements are met for all companies taking part in a part-year grouping arrangement. If the company received net losses from another company or made a subvention payment to another company, put a minus sign in the relevant last box. Attach a schedule setting out the names and IRD numbers of the companies and the amount of the payment or loss. If the company is transferring excess residential rental deductions to a wholly owned group member, the transfer is recorded as a reduction of the current year residential rental deductions in Box 19E. Similarly, if the company is receiving excess residential rental deductions from a wholly owned group member, the transfer is recorded as an increase of the current year residential rental deductions in Box 19E. Do not record these amounts in Question 30. Refer to Question 19 for details. Qualifying companies Net losses are restricted for grouping and subvention payment purposes. A qualifying company loss can be offset against any group company profit (including non-qualifying company profits). ird.govt.nz39 Question 32 Tax calculation Box 32E Foreign investor tax credit The foreign investor tax credit rules reduce the combined income tax and NRWT imposed on foreign investors with interests in a New Zealand company. See Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 20, No 3 (April 2008) for details about the change of company tax rate. A company is entitled to a foreign investor tax credit when it pays a supplementary dividend of the same amount to its non-resident shareholders. The foreign investor tax credit can then be offset against the company's income tax liability. The foreign investor tax credit arises in the income year the supplementary dividend is paid and is to be offset in the following order: 1. Against the company's income tax payable for the year the supplementary dividend is paid. Enter this amount in Box 32E. 2. At the company's election, either: - against the company's income tax liability for any of the previous four income years, or - against the income tax liability for another company in the same wholly owned group of companies for the year the supplementary dividend is paid in or any of the previous four income years. 3. Carried forward to subsequent years for offset against the tax liability of the company or another company in the same wholly owned group of companies. If the company has a foreign investor tax credit that cannot be fully offset against its own income tax liability in the income year the supplementary dividend is paid, attach a note to the front of the return giving details of how to treat any excess credit. Box 32G Imputation credits If the company has imputation credits, it may have a net loss to carry forward. This will happen if the company's total imputation credits are greater than the tax payable at Box 32F. To calculate the net loss to carry forward, subtract the amount at Box 32F from the total imputation credits (Box 32G) and divide the answer by 0.28 (28%). COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE40 If the deemed net loss is to be offset to other companies within the same group (rather than carried forward), reduce the amount of net loss shown at Box 29 by the amount offset. Question 33 Refunds and/or transfers If you want your refund transferred to another account or to arrears being paid off by an instalment arrangement, tell us the date you would like this done. The date you can choose depends on what tax has been overpaid and whose account you want the credit transferred to. Note If the transfer is to arrears being paid off by an instalment arrangement, you'll need to include a note with your return authorising the transfer and giving the following information: –that the transfer is to arrears currently under an instalment arrangement –the name and IRD number of the taxpayer the transfer should be made to –whether the taxpayer is an "associated taxpayer" –the tax type and period, and –the date you want the transfer to take place. Question 33B Associated taxpayers For companies, the following persons are associated taxpayers for the purposes of transferring overpaid tax: –another company in the same group of companies –a shareholder-employee of the company –a partner in the same partnership. If you want your refund transferred to another person, you will need to show if they are an associated taxpayer. Transfer date You can ask for your credit to be transferred at any date as long as it is not before the relevant dates set out as follows. ird.govt.nz41 For credit transferred: to your account/an associated taxpayer's account If the credit is from excess tax deducted (for example RWT deducted on interest) it's the day after your balance date (or 1 April if your balance date is before 31 March). If the credit is from overpaid provisional tax it's the day you overpaid it. Please note that special rules apply if tax pooling funds have been transferred in. to a non-associated taxpayer's account It's the later of the day you requested the transfer, or the day after you file your return. Future transfer dates If you want your credit transferred at a future date, attach a note to the front of your return with the details of the amount you want transferred, the account you want it transferred to (if it's to another person and they are associated) and the date you want it transferred. If you do not tell us the date you want your credit transferred, we will transfer it at a date we think gives you the greatest advantage. If you want the credit transferred at a different date, you can ask us to change it (even if we have transferred your credit to cover a debt). Requesting transfers on your return You can ask us to transfer a refund to another account by filling out pages 4 and 5 of the return. If you ask us to, we will transfer the refund to:  the company's own account or an account of someone associated to the company on the later of: –the day after the balance date (or 1 April if your balance date is before 31 March) –the due date in the destination account.  an account of someone not associated to the company on the day after the return was completed. If you want the company's refund transferred at a different date from those listed earlier, you can attach a note to the return, including the details of the account you want the refund transferred to and the transfer date you want. If the transfer is going to another person, tell us if they are associated to the company. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE42 Question 34 Initial provisional tax liability A company has an initial provisional tax liability if it: –starts to derive income from a taxable activity in the tax year –had not derived gross income from a taxable activity within the preceding four years, and –has residual income tax (RIT) of $60,000 or more in the current year. New businesses do not pay provisional tax in their first year of operation because there is no RIT from the previous year to base the calculation on. However, companies that have an initial provisional tax liability may be charged interest from the first, second or third instalment date. The instalment date interest applies from is determined by the business start date. Some new businesses make voluntary payments to reduce liability for interest. More information about the dates interest applies from is available in our guide Provisional tax - IR289. There are special rules about how interest is calculated when a company has an initial provisional tax liability and has changed its balance date. For further information, see our Provisional tax - IR289 guide. Print the date the company started to derive income from the taxable activity in Box 34. Question 35 2024 provisional tax 2024 provisional tax is charged for income the company will earn in the 2024 income year. It is payable in 2, 3 or 6 instalments. There are 3 options for calculating your provisional tax - standard, estimation and ratio. If the company's 2023 RIT is: –$5,000 or less it does not have to pay provisional tax, but it can make voluntary payments –more than $5,000 but expected to be $5,000 or less for 2024 it may estimate 2024 provisional tax at nil –more than $5,000 and expected to be more than $5,000 for 2024 it must pay 2024 provisional tax using 1 of the payment options. ird.govt.nz43 Standard option (S) Under this option, your 2024 provisional tax is your 2023 RIT (where it is more than $5,000) plus 5%. Note If you think your income for 2024 will be more than your 2023 income, you can make voluntary payments over and above the amount you have to pay under the standard option. Estimation option (E) Companies can estimate their 2024 provisional tax. They can re-estimate any number of times up to and including their final instalment due date. If the company's 2024 RIT is expected to be less than its 2023 RIT, estimating may prevent the company from paying more than it has to. Note An estimate must be fair and reasonable at each instalment it applies to. If you use the estimation option, see "Not taking reasonable care penalty" and "Interest" on page 44. If the company estimates its provisional tax, write E in Box 35A and the amount of 2024 provisional tax in Box 35B. If you estimate your provisional tax your instalments should be one-third of your estimation. If you're using the ratio option and select E at Box 35A this will mean you are electing to stop using the ratio option. Ratio option (R) If you're GST registered, you may qualify to use the ratio option to calculate your provisional tax. Only enter R at Box 35A if you have already elected to use the ratio option. Your application to use the ratio option must be made by phone or in writing before the beginning of the income year you want to use it. If you've already elected to use the ratio option and want to continue using it, enter R at Box 35A. There is more information about the ratio option in our guide Provisional tax - IR289. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE44 Not taking reasonable care penalty When you estimate the company's 2024 provisional tax, your estimate must be fair and reasonable. If the 2024 RIT is greater than the provisional tax paid, you may be liable for a not taking reasonable care penalty of 20% of the underpaid provisional tax. Interest If the company has paid too much provisional tax, we may pay interest. If it has not paid enough provisional tax, we may charge interest. Interest the company pays is tax deductible, while interest we pay is taxable income. Election to be a provisional tax payer A company is a provisional tax payer for the 2023 year if its RIT for that year is more than $5,000. If the 2023 RIT is $5,000 or less but the company paid provisional tax for the year, the company may elect to be a provisional tax payer for that year. This may affect the interest the company may be entitled to for that year. To elect to be a provisional tax payer for the 2023 year, attach a note to the front of the 2023 return. Change in balance date There are special rules about when provisional tax is due and how interest is calculated if there has been a change in the balance date. For more information, read our guides Penalties and interest - IR240 and Provisional tax - IR289. Tax pooling Tax pooling allows taxpayers to pool provisional tax payments, offsetting underpayments by overpayments within the same pool. This reduces their possible exposure to late payment penalties and interest. For more information about tax pooling, including a list of intermediaries, go to ird.govt.nz/tax-pooling ird.govt.nz45 Payment dates 2024 provisional tax Generally, a company with a 31 March balance date pays provisional tax by the following due dates: First instalment 28 August 2023 Second instalment 15 January 2024 Third instalment 7 May 2024 A company with a balance date other than 31 March generally pays provisional tax on the 28th day of the 5th, 9th and 13th months after the balance date. There are 2 exceptions:  If it would be due on 28 December it is due on 15 January, and  If it would be due on 28 April it is due on 7 May. These dates will alter if the company is registered for GST and:  the GST filing frequency is six-monthly, or  provisional tax is paid through the ratio option. If either of these situations apply to you, read our guide Provisional tax - IR289. 2023 end-of-year income tax Companies that have an agent and an extension of time may have until 7 April 2024 to pay their tax. If you think this applies to your company, contact your agent. A company with a balance date between 1 March and 30 September must pay its end-of-year income tax (Box 32L) and any interest by 7 February 2024. A company with a balance date between 1 October and 28 February must pay its end-of-year income tax by the 7th day of the month before the following year's balance date. How to make payments You can make payments by:  direct debit in myIR  credit or debit card at ird.govt.nz/pay  internet banking - most New Zealand banks have a pay tax option. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE46 When making a payment, include:  your IRD number  the account type you are paying, and  the period the payment relates to. Find all the details of our payment options at ird.govt.nz/pay Late payment If you do not pay a bill on time, you may have to pay penalties and interest. Contact us if you are not able to pay on time. We'll look at your payment options, which may include an instalment arrangement. Find out more at ird.govt.nz/penalties Question 37 Foreign rights If you calculated CFC or FIF income at Question 18 you may be required to complete an additional disclosure form for that investment. For all interests of 10% or more in a foreign company, the additional disclosure is required. For other investments, the requirement for an additional disclosure depends on the company you are preparing the Companies income tax return - IR4 for.  If the company is not widely held or a PIE, additional disclosure is not required if the investments are in countries New Zealand holds a double tax agreement with (as at 31 March 2023) and the fair dividend rate or comparative value has been used.  If the company is widely held or a PIE you are required to file an additional disclosure. The disclosure forms are available at ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Contact us if you need help to find the appropriate disclosure form. For information on foreign exchange rates, go to ird.govt.nz/tools-calculators Find out more about the base erosion profit shifting (BEPS) hybrid mismatch rules at ird.govt.nz/beps ird.govt.nz47 Question 38 Share repurchases When amounts distributed to shareholders on cancellation or repurchase of shares fall below specified thresholds, the amounts are taxable in full to shareholders as dividends. When distributions on repurchases exceed those thresholds, or occur through the stock exchange, the distributions will be deducted from available subscribed capital of the company and will be tax-free to the shareholders. However, this is only to the extent that the distributions are not in lieu of dividends. If the subscribed capital of the company has been depleted, the distributions will be taxable. Specific rules also govern the repurchase and subsequent sale of Treasury stock. The total value entered on the return should be the aggregate value of all distributions made by the company during the year for company shares repurchased, redeemed, cancelled or purchased as Treasury stock. Question 39 Foreign-sourced dividends Generally, funds would use the default FIF income calculation method (the fair dividend rate) which does not tax dividends separately. However, the foreign tax deducted from the dividend can be claimed as a credit against the tax payable on the calculated FIF income. A credit for any tax paid by the foreign company (on its earnings) may be allowed in calculating the amount payable by the New Zealand company. Any NRWT deducted from the foreign dividend paid to the New Zealand company may also be allowed as a credit. Information about exempt foreign dividends Although most foreign dividends received by companies are exempt from tax, you should still answer ''Yes'' to this question if the company receives an exempt foreign dividend. Foreign dividends from some investments are taxable. These should be included in the tax return as income from overseas. Dividends on foreign investments are taxable in 3 situations:  When the investment gives the company a direct income interest of less than 10% in a foreign company, but the investment is 1 of certain investments that are excluded from the normal FIF rules (see Question 18 on page 17 for the most common exclusions).  When the dividend relates to an investment in fixed-rate shares ("fixed-rate foreign equity"). COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE48  When the dividend paid is tax-deductible in a foreign country by a foreign company (a "deductible foreign equity distribution"). Question 40 Company controlled or owned by non-residents We need to know whether the company is owned or controlled by non-residents because we may need to apply subpart FE or sections CH 9, GC 6-14 and GB 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Question 41 Total lowest economic interest of shareholders Calculating the economic interest is necessary for a number of reasons, such as making sure you can carry any net loss forward, the grouping provisions and the imputation credit carry forward provisions. Where there were no changes in shareholdings (including voting rights) throughout the entire year then the lowest economic interest will be 100%. Enter 100.00 at Box 41. Where there has been a change in shareholding including a change to voting rights or market value interests then you will need to calculate the total lowest economic interest. A shareholder's economic interest in a company will generally be measured by referring to the percentage of voting power they hold in that company, to vote on: 1. the dividends or other distributions to be made by the company 2. the constitution of the company 3. any variation in the capital of the company, and 4. the appointment or election of directors. ird.govt.nz49 Example A company has two shareholders, Barbara and Maria. The company has two classes of shares:  Class A shares carry a right to vote on (2) the constitution and (3) variations in capital  Class B shares carry unrestricted voting rights, (1), (2), (3) and (4) on the previous page. Barbara holds all 100 of the A shares in the company while Maria holds all 100 of the B shares. Their percentage of voting interest in the company is measured as follows: DistributionsConstitution Variation in capital DirectorsLowest Barbara 0+50+50+0=100 =25% 100+100+100+100=400 Maria 100+50+50+100=300 =75% 100+100+100+100=400 Enter this total at Box 41 in the Return100.00 If Barbara and Maria hold these proportions of shares for the entire income year, the "total lowest economic interest of shareholders" or the minimum continuity is 100%. The following example shows a shareholding or voting interest change occurring during the year. Example On 1 September 2022 Barbara and Maria swapped shares and held these proportions to 31 March 2023, the company's balance date. 1 April 2022 1 Sep 2022 31 Mar 2023 Lowest Barbara 25% 75% 75% 25% Maria 75% 25% 25% 25% The lowest percentage of rights held by each shareholder during the income year is 25%. So, the total lowest economic interest of shareholders, or the minimum continuity, is 50%. Enter this total at Box 41 in the Return as 50.00. In certain circumstances the shareholders' economic interests in a company will also be determined by the market value interests in the company. This is where the voting interests do not reflect the true economic interests held in a company. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE50 A shareholder's market value interest is their share as a percentage of the total market value of shares (and options) in the company. Specific factors that require a market value interest to be calculated are: –the company has issued debentures to which sections FA 2 or FA 2B of the Income Tax Act 2007 apply –the company has issued shares where payment of dividends is guaranteed by a third party –there's an option to acquire shares in the company, and –an arrangement exists for the purpose of defeating provisions that depends on measurement of voting and market value interests. You will need to add together the lowest economic interest of each shareholder and print the total in Box 41. Write percentages in the following format, for example, show 50% as 50.00, and 100% as 100.00. Effect on the imputation credit account (ICA) If you keep an ICA and have had a change of shareholding of more than 34% you may need to make an adjustment on your annual imputation return at Box 45C ("Other debits") - see page 54. Question 42 Shareholder details - see also the IR4S Complete Question 42 if shareholders, directors and relatives of shareholders received remuneration or a loan. Remuneration is liable for ACC levies. Shareholders' salaries Write all remuneration with no PAYE deducted that the company paid to that person in Box 42B. For the company to claim a deduction for shareholder remuneration it must be paid either: –during the income year, or –within the time allowed for the company to complete its return. If the remuneration is not paid in time, the deduction cannot be claimed until the following year. Over-payments of AIM provisional tax that relate to shareholder employee salary accruals are allowed to be used to meet the shareholder's tax liability on that salary at the ird.govt.nz51 end of the income year. Record details of any AIM tax credits transferred to each shareholder at Box 42C. Loss offsets and subvention payments Record details of any losses claimed or transferred from or to each group member at Box 42F. Record details of any subvention payments claimed or transferred from or to each group member at Box 42G. The total of Boxes 42F must be recorded at Box 30. The total of Boxes 42G must be recorded at Box 30A. Current account balance If the shareholder's current account balance has been overdrawn, (that is, the shareholder owes the company money) then it is a debit balance. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE52 Annual imputation return The annual imputation return must be completed for the period 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023, regardless of your accounting year. If you're a member of an imputation group, see page 7. For more information read our guide Imputation - IR274. Question 43 Opening balance This is the same as the closing balance at 31 March 2022. Tick either "Credit" or "Debit" below Box 43. New companies will not have a closing balance to bring forward. Write "0.00" in Box 43. Question 44 Credits Question 44A Income tax paid Include in Box 44A all payments of income tax and provisional tax made from 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023 for 1989 and subsequent income years. Do not include any FBT, ESCT, interest on tax, late payment penalties, imputation penalty tax or RWT. Question 44B RWT on interest received If the company received interest with RWT deducted between 1 April 2022 and 31 March 2023, print the total RWT in Box 44B. Question 44C Imputation credits attached to dividends received If the company received dividends with imputation credits attached between 1 April 2022 and 31 March 2023, print the total credits in Box 44C. Note This is the total imputation credits attached to dividends received. This amount is not limited to the tax payable on your dividends and is not necessarily the same amount as the imputation credits being claimed in Box 14. ird.govt.nz53 Question 44D Other credits List any other credits made to the ICA from 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023. Use a separate sheet of paper if necessary. Attach it to the top of page 3 and print the total in Box 44D. Other types of credits include: –RWT on dividends received –provisional tax allocated to the company by a company in the same wholly owned group that has overpaid its provisional tax –residential land withholding tax (RLWT) credit deducted from the sale or transfer of residential land located in New Zealand during the income year, less any RLWT paid back to the company and/or transferred to outstanding amounts during the income year. Supplementary available subscribed capital account (SASCA) If you're a public unit trust or a group investment fund that maintains a SASCA and you're eligible to transfer credits from that account to the ICA, record the credits being transferred to the ICA in Box 44D (other credits). All public unit trusts or group investment funds maintaining a SASCA should, by the due date for completing the 2023 IR4 or IR4J, send a copy of that memorandum account together with any written queries to: Investment Desk Large Enterprises Inland Revenue PO Box 2871 Christchurch 8140 For more information on negative dividends and the SASCA rules, see our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 14, No 11 (November 2002). Qualifying company election tax (QCET) payments Include any QCET payments made after 17 May 2007 as a credit in the ICA when working out the balance. Use the account balance in the formula, when calculating the imputation credit to be attached to a dividend paid by the qualifying company. See our Tax Information Bulletins (TIBs) Vol 11, No 5 (May/June 1999) and Vol 20, No 3, page 127 (April 2008). COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE54 Question 45 Debits Question 45A Income tax refunded Print in Box 45A the company's total income tax refunds received from 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023 for 1989 and subsequent income years. Do not include any interest on tax received or income tax refunded for any year before 1989. Question 45B Imputation credits attached to dividends paid If the company paid dividends from 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023 with imputation credits attached, print the total credits in Box 45B. Question 45C Other debits List any other debits in the ICA and print the total in Box 45C. Examples of other types of debits are: –any provisional tax allocated by the company to a company in the same wholly owned group that has underpaid its provisional tax –an adjustment for a change of shareholding of more than 34% during the period 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023, regardless of your accounting year –an adjustment for a change in an imputation ratio, or –tax payable by a company on any part of a distribution not sourced from the subscribed capital of the company, where that company repurchases a share on-market. Qualifying companies The 66% continuity of shareholding requirement does not apply to qualifying companies. There is no need to make an adjustment where there has been a change of shareholding, except in the year the company ceases to be a qualifying company. Question 46A Adjustments to debit balance If a qualifying company received an income tax refund after 1 April 1995 that created a debit balance in the ICA, no further income tax is required to the extent of any refunds received. If the qualifying company has a debit balance as a result of income tax refunded from 1 April 2022, please subtract the amount refunded at Box 46A. If the closing balance is a credit, there is no tax to pay. ird.govt.nz55 If the closing balance at Box 46B is a debit, it must be paid by 20 June 2023. Note There are 2 types of relief from payment of debit ICA balances. These are: –the offsetting income tax payments –same debit ICA balances reflected in successive years. For more information see our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 16, No 1 (February 2004). Question 47 Imputation penalty tax Imputation penalty tax of 10% of the debit closing balance is also payable by 20 June 2023. Work out the 10% penalty in Box 47. If the total in Box 47A exceeds $100 and is not paid by the due date, late payment penalties and interest will apply - see page 46. Limitations on tax refunds We may hold all or part of a refund if: –the company is expecting an income tax refund, and –the credit balance in the ICA at 31 March 2023 is less than the refund. If there have been additional credits to the ICA since 31 March 2023, the company may complete an interim 2024 IR4J return in anticipation of an IR4 annual return being completed at a later date. We may then be able to release the refund. We can apply non-refundable overpaid income tax to a company's previous years' income tax liabilities, where these debits exist, rather than transferring the credit forward to the next year's provisional tax. This avoids further payments having to be made to meet back- year debts. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE56 Self-assessment by taxpayers Taxpayers have to assess their own liability as part of their return filing obligations. We may amend your assessment if a correction is required. If you dispute our assessment please go to ird.govt.nz/ disputes for more information. The 4-month period for you to issue a notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA) to your self- assessment will start on the date Inland Revenue receives your return. Accident Compensation Act 2001 Under the Accident Compensation Act 2001, Inland Revenue is required to provide the earnings information at Box 42B from this return to the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC). The information is used by ACC to invoice all ACC levies. ACC invoicing for close companies (including earners' levy for shareholder-employee earnings with no PAYE deducted) starts from September each year. Maximum earnings from multiple companies The maximum amount of earners' levy that can be collected from a shareholder-employee is $1,819.66. A shareholder- employee may be due for a refund from ACC if the shareholder-employee's combined total remuneration from two or more companies is over $130,911. Please call ACC on 0800 222 776 to find out about the refund process. ACC earners' levy Shareholder-employees' salaries or directors' fees without PAYE deducted are liable for ACC earners' levy. The company will be invoiced by ACC for this levy.

Look-through companies (LTC) complete an IR7 income tax return each year they're an LTC. For more information about LTCs refer to our Look-through companies - IR879 guide. If yours is an Australian company or part of an imputation group, see page 7. Non-active companies A non-active company is a company that has: –not received any gross income –no deductions –not disposed of any assets, and –not been party to any transactions during the tax year that: (i) gave rise to income for any person (ii) gave rise to fringe benefits to any employee or any former employee, or (iii) gave rise to a debit in the company's ICA (imputation credit account). These companies may be excused from completing tax returns if they complete a Non-active company declaration - IR433 form. Return due date If the company has a 31 March balance date, you have until 7 July 2024 to complete the return, unless you have been granted an extension of time. If you have a balance date other than 31 March, this date may be different. Contact us if you are not sure of the filing date. If the company has a tax agent, you may have until 31 March 2025 to complete the return. If this applies, contact your agent. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE6 Late filing penalties If you have to complete a return and you do not send us one, you may be charged a late filing penalty. You should apply for an extension of time if you are unable to complete your return on time. The penalty for filing your IR4 late depends on the company's net income. If your income is: –below $100,000, the penalty is $50 –between $100,000 and $1 million (both figures inclusive), the penalty is $250, or –above $1 million, the penalty is $500. If you need an extension to your tax return filing date, tell us your reasons before your return is due. If you get a late filing penalty before applying for an extension, the penalty will stand. If you use a tax agent who has an extension of time arrangement with us and the extension is withdrawn, we will notify you that you must now complete your return. Tax sparing Any company that has claimed a foreign tax credit for a tax sparing arrangement under a double tax agreement, must also complete a Tax sparing disclosure return - IR486 and send it to: International Revenue Strategy Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 Group investment funds If the company's income is solely from Category A income, you must complete an IR4. If the income is solely from Category B income, you must complete an IR6. If the income is a combination of both Category A and Category B income, you must complete an IR4 and IR44E. Read the notes in the IR44E for more information. Research and development (R&D) tax losses You may be able to cash out any R&D losses if your company is a loss-making company that is a resident in New Zealand and your expenditure on R&D salary and wages is 20% or more of your total salary and wage expenditure. For more information go to ird.govt.nz/research-development ird.govt.nz7 Superannuation schemes A superannuation scheme, not registered with the Financial Markets Authority (FMA), which lets beneficiaries contribute, will be treated as a company for tax purposes and must complete IR4 returns. Trans-Tasman imputation and imputation groups Australian companies can elect to maintain a New Zealand imputation account from the 2003-04 tax year. A form of grouping (for imputation purposes only) has also been introduced, which Australian companies may join. Return filing for trans-Tasman imputation Australian companies that make a trans-Tasman imputation election are required to complete an Annual imputation return - IR4J by 31 July, after the end of the tax year. A Companies income tax return - IR4 is not required, unless the company has a permanent establishment (for example, maintains an office) in New Zealand. Return filing for imputation groups Companies income tax return - IR4 Company returns must be completed by: –all New Zealand companies that elect to be a member of an imputation group, and –Australian companies with New Zealand-sourced income. Annual imputation return - IR4J The imputation return for an imputation group should be completed by the group representative on a separate IR4J return. Imputation group members should not include any imputation details on page 7 of the IR4. An exception applies for nominated companies of a resident imputation group where there is an ICA debit balance. Foreign dividend payments - FDP The FDP rules have been fully repealed from 1 April 2017. This means FDP can no longer be included in your annual income tax return. Please do not include FDP credits in Box 14A. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE8 Imputation return Most New Zealand resident companies, unit trusts, producer boards and cooperatives must complete an imputation return each year. If you're an Australian company or part of an imputation group, please read page 7. The following bodies do not have to complete imputation returns: –non-resident companies –look-through companies –trustee companies (but not group investment funds with Category A income) –any company with a constitution that prevents it distributing all its income or property to any proprietor, member or shareholder –companies whose income is completely exempt from tax –local authorities –Crown research institutes –non-active companies –Māori authorities. Note If you need to complete the company's imputation return before the income tax return is due, to allow a refund to be released, complete an Annual imputation return - IR4J. Questions 1 to 8 Company details Fill in Questions 1 to 8 only if the correct information is not printed on the return. Question 2 - Company name If the company has changed its name since the last time a return was completed, please attach a copy of the new certificate of incorporation with the name change details or contact us so we can update our records. Question 4 - Postal address If you have a new postal address, write the details at Question 4. If your new address is a PO Box number, show your box lobby if you have one. If you are unsure of your box lobby please contact New Zealand Post. Leave this address panel blank if the company uses its tax preparer's postal address. The tax preparer will let us know if they change their address. ird.govt.nz9 Question 6 - Business industry classification (BIC) code If you're involved in a business or a trading activity, please write the BIC code only in Box 6. You do not need to give a description. We're required to supply the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) with a code for your business or trading activity, for levy classification and calculation. To work out your main business or trading activity and its code, go to businessdescription.co.nz or call ACC on 0508 426 837. It's important that you choose the code which most accurately reflects your main business or trading activity. Question 7 - Phone number We ask for your daytime phone number so we can contact you if we have any questions about your return. Question 8 - Bank account number The fastest and safest way to get any refund is to have it direct credited to your New Zealand bank account or other deposit account, for example, a building society account. If your bank account number is not preprinted on the return form, include it at Question 8. If your suffix has only 2 digits, enter them in the first 2 squares of the suffix box. Question 9 Non-resident A company is a tax resident of New Zealand if: –it's incorporated in New Zealand –its head office or centre of management is in New Zealand, or –its directors control the company in New Zealand. Otherwise, it's a non-resident for tax purposes. Questions 10 and 10A Imputation Page 7 of the IR4 return is the annual imputation return. If you have made any monetary entries in the annual imputation return, tick "Yes" at Question 10A. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE10 Note If you have completed, or will complete, a separate Annual imputation return - IR4J, tick "No" at Question 10. Question 11 Has the company ceased? If this is a final return, include a set of accounts up to the date the company ceased trading and include details of any distribution of assets and liabilities. If the company is registered for GST or as an employer, you will need to complete a Business cessation - IR315 form to finalise your records. Depending on the company's circumstances, a number of other issues may need to be finalised, for example: –outstanding returns –arrears –FBT or ACC –imputation account balances (for qualifying companies) –specified superannuation contributions –RWT on dividends, and –10-year bonus issues. Find out how to finalise the company's tax accounts or deregister for GST at ird.govt.nz Note A company is still a legal entity until it is taken off the Companies Register. A company can stop trading (become non-active) but still have tax obligations such as completing returns. Non-active companies can be excused from completing returns - see page 5. ird.govt.nz11 Company tax return Question 12 Income from schedular payments If the company has received any schedular payments, we will send you a summary of income. Add up the total tax withheld and all the gross payments shown on the summary of income and write the totals in Boxes 12A and 12B. The summary of income form may not contain all the company's earnings information. If any details are missing, please include them at Question 12. If the company received a payment with no tax deducted, include the gross amount in Box 12B. Mineral mining tax credit Include in Box 12A the amount of refundable tax credit being claimed where a tax loss is incurred on disposal of land or by claiming rehabilitation expenditure. Transferring tax deductions Tax deducted from schedular payments made to close companies can be transferred directly to the company's shareholder-employee(s) in some circumstances. You'll need to reduce the amount claimed in Box 12A by the amount of tax deducted from schedular payments which has been transferred direct to a shareholder-employee of the company. You will still need to include the total schedular payments made to the company in Box 12B. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE12 Example LLC received schedular payments of $10,000 with total tax deducted of $2,000 during the year. The $10,000 is attributable to the company's shareholder- employee through the attribution rule. LLC can transfer up to $2,000 of the tax deducted from the schedular payments it received to the company's shareholder-employee(s). LLC transfers the full $2,000 of tax to the company's sole shareholder-employee. As the full amount of tax has been transferred from LLC the amount in Box 12A should be $0. If the company is transferring tax deducted to shareholder- employee(s) it should attach details of the transfer to the return. The amount of tax transferred from the company to its shareholder-employee(s) will also need to be recorded as a debit entry in the company's imputation credit account - see Question 45C on page 54. Question 13 New Zealand interest Interest from all New Zealand sources must be shown in the return. Write the total of all RWT deducted in Box 13A. If the company has had NRWT deducted from New Zealand interest, include this in Box 13A. Add up all the gross interest amounts (before the deduction of any tax) and write the total in Box 13B. Interest on broken term deposits If you have broken a term deposit during the year, you may have to account for "negative interest". This is interest repaid on the term deposit and may reduce the amount of interest to declare on the tax return. If the term deposit was broken in full, or it was business- related, deduct the negative interest from the gross interest amount shown on the RWT withholding certificate. Deduct the allowable negative interest part, using the worksheet below, before entering the gross amount at Question 13 of the tax return. In all other cases, the negative interest is deductible in a later tax return when the term deposit matures. ird.govt.nz13 Worksheet Copy your gross interest from your RWT withholding certificate to Box 1. 1 Print any negative interest you have paid in Box 2. 2 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1 and print the answer in Box 3. Copy this amount to Box 13B of your tax return. 3 Interest paid or charged by Inland Revenue If we paid you interest, include it in Box 13B for the income year the company received the interest. If the company paid us interest, include it as a deduction in the return for the income year the interest is paid. Note If expenses are deductible against the interest income, claim them at Box 20B. Do not send us interest statements with the return. Keep these in case we ask for them later. Income from financial arrangements If the company was a party to a financial arrangement, such as government stock, local authority stock, mortgage bonds, futures contracts or deferred property settlements, the income or expenditure from the financial arrangement may have to be calculated using a spreading method, rather than on a cash basis. If the financial arrangement matures or is sold, remitted or transferred, a "wash-up" calculation known as a base price adjustment must be made. Any RWT will be deducted on a cash basis. Show the RWT deducted and any income from the financial arrangement in Boxes 13A and 13B. Question 14 New Zealand dividends Generally, dividends are taxable. However, there is an exemption for dividends paid between members of a wholly owned group. To work out the total gross dividends, add up all net dividends received, any imputation credits, and any RWT deductions. Write the total of all dividends in Box 14B. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE14 Note The FDP rules have been fully repealed from 1 April 2017. Do not include any FDP credits in Box 14A. Dividend tax credits The total tax credits for dividends (for example imputation credits) you can claim is limited to the income tax payable (28%) on each dividend the company receives. This is to ensure that surplus tax credits are not used to shelter tax on other income. Work out whether you need to apply this limitation to the dividend tax credits you will claim. Copy your total gross dividends (calculated for each dividend that had an imputation credit) from Box 14B to Box 1. 1 Multiply Box 1 by 0.28 (28%), and write the result in Box 2. 2 Write your total dividend tax credits (calculated for that dividend) in Box 3. 3 For each dividend, claim a dividend tax credit for the lower amount shown in Box 2 or Box 3. Write the total dividend imputation credits you are allowed to claim in Box 14. In Box 14A write the sum of your total dividend RWT credits you are allowed to claim. Note If expenses are deductible against the dividend income, claim them at Box 20B. Unit trusts Distributions from unit trusts will generally be taxable. The statement you receive from the unit trust should show the amounts to include in the return. For unit trusts that are also portfolio investment entities (PIEs) see page 19. ird.govt.nz15 Transfer of deductible expenses between member and master funds From the 2002-03 income year a member fund may, in certain circumstances, elect to transfer deductible expenses to a master fund. The master fund must invest, in whole or in part, in the member fund. The master fund can then deduct the transferred expenses. A member fund can include a group investment fund that derives Category A income, a public unit trust or a superannuation fund. A master fund can include a group investment fund that derives Category A income or a public unit trust. A public unit trust includes: –retail unit trusts, whose units are offered to the public and which have 100 or more unit holders –wholesale unit trusts, whose units are held by widely held investment vehicles such as other unit trusts or superannuation funds. Member or master funds wanting to take advantage of this provision should include details of the adjustment in a tax reconciliation statement accompanying the return. The information should accompany the returns of both funds involved in the transfer. For more information see our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 13, No 11 (November 2001). Qualifying companies Generally, if a qualifying company is a shareholder in a company that is not a qualifying company, all dividends the qualifying company derives from the other company are taxable. Dividends derived by a company (that has been a qualifying company at any time before deriving the dividends) are taxable. If a qualifying company is a shareholder in another qualifying company, only dividends with imputation credits attached and a return of a 10-year bonus issue before the 10-year period expires, are taxable. Dividends with no imputation credits attached, or a return of a 10-year bonus issue 10 years from the payment date, are exempt income. A distribution of a 10-year bonus issue before the 10-year period has expired, made when the company winds up, is not taxable. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE16 If you need more help, read our guide Qualifying companies - IR435. Do not send us dividend statements with the return, keep them in case we ask for them later. Question 15 Ma ̄ori authority distributions Māori authorities can make various types of distributions. Fill in Question 15 if you received any taxable Māori authority distributions between 1 April 2023 and 31 March 2024. The Māori authority that paid you the distribution will send you a Māori authority distribution statement. Credits attached to distributions The Māori authority may attach a credit to the distribution it makes to members. This credit will be classified as a Māori authority credit and is part of the tax the Māori authority has already paid on its profits, so the distributions are not taxed twice. What to show in your return Your Māori authority distribution statement shows the amount of: –the distribution made to you, including the taxable portion and the non-taxable portion, and –Māori authority credit. These amounts, not including any non-taxable distribution, will need to be transferred to the relevant boxes at Question 15. Example A Māori authority makes a pre-tax profit of $10,000. It pays tax on this profit of $1,750 (Māori authority tax rate of 17.5%) and distributes the entire profit to its 10 members. Each member will receive $825 as a cash distribution and $175 of Māori authority credits. Each member of the authority liable to file an IR4 return would show the following information at Question 15: – Box 15B - $1,000 (made up of $825 + $175) – Box 15A - $175 ird.govt.nz17 Question 16 Partnership, estate or trust income If the company received any income from a partnership, estate or trust, write any tax credits in Box 16A and the income totals in Box 16B. Do not include any: –overseas income - show this at Question 18 along with any credits attached, or –dividend imputation credits attached to dividends (include these in Box 14, RWT withheld in Box 14A and the gross dividend in Box 14B), or –income and expenses from residential property including rental income and net bright-line profit – show these at Question 19. Add up any other tax credits from partnerships, estates or trusts and write the total in Box 16A. Add up all the other income from partnerships, estates or trusts and write the total in Box 16B. Losses from limited partnerships If the company is claiming a loss from a limited partnership and you need help working out the amount you can claim, go to ird.govt.nz Estate or trust income If you received a taxable distribution from a non-complying trust, please attach a note with your return giving details of the amount and any associated tax credits. We separate taxable distributions from a non-complying trust because they are taxed at a different rate. We need these details to work out your tax liability correctly. Question 18 Overseas income If your company received income from or while based overseas, between 1 April 2023 and 31 March 2024, show it in New Zealand dollars at Box 18B. If the company is a New Zealand resident for tax purposes, you must include any foreign contract or service income in Box 18B. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE18 Foreign investment fund (FIF) If the company held rights, such as shares, units or an entitlement to benefit in any foreign company, unit trust, superannuation scheme or life insurance policy, at any time during the 2024 income year, you may be required to calculate FIF income or loss. If the company has an interest in a controlled foreign company (CFC), they must calculate any attributed income or loss from that interest. Generally, the company will use the fair dividend rate to calculate FIF income. The main exclusions from an interest in an FIF are: –investments in certain Australian resident companies listed on approved indices on the Australian stock exchange, that maintain franking accounts –interest in certain Australian unit trusts –limited exemptions for interests in certain venture capital interests that move offshore (for 10 income years from the income year in which the company migrates from New Zealand), and –a 10% or greater interest in a CFC. CFC income and losses New rules were introduced in 2009 for calculating income or losses from a CFC. If the company has an interest in a CFC, they must calculate any attributed income or loss from that interest. Losses from a CFC cannot be used to offset domestic income or be included in domestic losses carried forward to the next tax year. Generally, these losses can only offset income or future income from CFCs resident in the same country as the CFC that incurred the loss. When CFC income or losses are calculated under the new rules, transitional rules apply to the use of carried forward losses incurred under the old rules. You can find more information on the rules at ird.govt.nz and in our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 21, No 8 (October/ November 2009). What to show in your return You can convert all overseas income and tax credits to New Zealand dollars by:  using the rates table available from ird.govt.nz19 ird.govt.nz/tools-calculators  contacting the overseas section of a trading bank and asking for the exchange rate for the day you received your overseas income. If the income was received from a financial arrangement, refer to Determination G9A or G9C under section 90 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Write the total of the allowable overseas tax paid in Box 18A. Include in Box 18B income before the deduction of any tax. Credit for tax paid overseas will be limited to the amount of New Zealand tax payable on that income. Please note that Australian franking credits or tax credits on dividends from the United Kingdom cannot be claimed. Staple proof of tax paid overseas to the top of page 3 of the return. Foreign tax credits attached to dividends that are not required to be returned under the FIF rules can be claimed up to the amount of New Zealand tax payable on the FIF interest. Some foreign dividends have New Zealand imputation credits attached or New Zealand RWT deducted. These credits are not subject to the foreign tax credit limitation rule. Investments in portfolio investment entities (PIEs) Certain PIEs attribute their net income/loss and tax credits to the investors. Companies that are investors include the attributed income or loss in their tax return. Each year, the PIE is required to provide an investor statement setting out the details of the income/loss attributed to the investor for the year. The statement also shows the various types of tax credits associated with the income that has been attributed. These tax credits are subject to the tax credit limits calculated in relation to the tax on the attributed PIE income. The attributed PIE income/loss is included in the company's return for the period that includes the end of the PIE's income year. Generally, PIEs have a 31 March balance date. The amount of income the company derives as a distribution by a PIE is excluded income unless it is fully imputed dividends from a listed PIE. Dividends from these PIEs are not liable for RWT. For more information, go to ird.govt.nz or read our guides, Information for companies that invest in PIEs - IR857 and Portfolio investment entity: a guide for PIEs - IR860. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE20 Question 19 Income and expenses from residential property This question applies to close companies that own residential property, including overseas property, that have:  income subject to the residential property deduction rules  net income from a bright-line sale  income in relation to a loan in a foreign currency  depreciation recovery income from disposed assets  net income from the taxable disposal of a residential property outside the residential property deduction rules because it is held on revenue account. The residential property deduction rules, and Question 19, do not apply to residential land that is owned by companies other than close companies. Close company - generally a company with 5 or fewer natural persons whose total voting interests are more than 50%. Associated persons are treated as 1 person. Residential property deduction rules Most residential rental properties are subject to the residential property deduction rules (also known as the ring-fencing rules). The rules generally limit the amount of residential deductions you can claim in the year to the total amount of residential income earned in that year. If the deductions are more than your income, the difference must be carried forward to the next year income is earned from the residential property, including income from properties held on revenue account. Any rental income or loss and net income or loss from a taxable disposal is fully excluded from the rules if the property is:  subject to the mixed-use asset rules (for example, a holiday home rented out part-time and not used for at least 62 days in the income year, or 62 working days in the income year if it’s usually only used on working days)  owned by companies other than close companies  owned by government enterprises, or  certain employee accommodation. For these types of property, any rental income or loss is shown at Box 21 and net income or net loss from a taxable disposal shown in Box 22. ird.govt.nz21 Any rental net loss and net loss from a taxable disposal is partially excluded from the rules if it is for:  property that will always be taxed on sale, being revenue account property of a person in the business of building, developing or dealing in land, or  other revenue account property the person has notified us they want the exclusion to apply to. For these types of property any rental net loss is shown at Box 21 and taxable disposal net loss shown at Box 22. The residential property deduction rules also apply to any company who has borrowed money to acquire an interest in certain entities with significant rental property holdings - a residential land-rich entity - and has interest expenditure on the borrowed money. Residential land-rich entity - a close company, partnership or look-through company that holds more than 50% of its assets by value in residential land, directly or indirectly. These entities come under the interposed entities rules as part of the residential property deduction rules. For more information about the interposed entity rules, see page 60 of the Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No.8 September 2019. Read our Rental income - IR264 guide for more information on:  when the rules apply  how to calculate your income  the amount of deductions you can claim this year, and  the amount of any excess deductions that must be carried forward. Completing your return Tick the method you have used to calculate your residential property income and deductions. You can use 1 of the following methods:  Portfolio basis - combine income and deductions for all rental properties in the portfolio.  Individual, property-by-property basis - income and deductions of individual property calculated separately to other property. You need to maintain separate records for each property to choose this option.  Combination of the individual basis and portfolio basis - choose to apply different methods to different property. Some properties are held in a portfolio and others are held on an individual basis. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE22 You need to calculate and identify the amounts for Boxes 19A to 19I using the method you have chosen for your rental properties. For the portfolio basis, the allowable deductions from all of the properties in your portfolio can be offset against income you earn from all of the properties in the portfolio. You can then enter these figures in the Residential property deductions worksheets - IR1226 to help calculate the figures required to be entered in your return. You can print a copy off our website ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Write the gross residential rental income from the portfolio and/or individual property in Box 19A. Do not include rental income or losses from properties excluded from the residential property deduction rules. Enter those amounts in Question 21 instead. Box 19B Net bright-line profit The bright-line property rule needs to be considered when none of the other land sale rules at Question 22 apply to the disposal of the property. This rule for residential property looks at the length of time a property (including overseas property) is owned. If you sell or dispose of a residential property within a certain timeframe and no exclusion applies, then your profit on the sale will be taxable. This applies no matter what your reason was for buying or selling the property or what kind of buyer you are. The bright-line property rule applies if you sell or dispose of a residential property you have owned for less than:  5 years for properties acquired between 29 March 2018 and 26 March 2021.  5 years for properties acquired as a result of an offer made on or before 23 March 2021 and that offer was not able to be revoked or withdrawn before 27 March 2021.  5 years for properties acquired on or after 27 March 2021 that qualify as a ‘new build’.  10 years for all other properties acquired on or after 27 March 2021. For tax purposes, a property is generally acquired on the date a binding sale and purchase agreement is entered into (even if some standard conditions like getting finance or a building report still need to be met). This date will determine which bright-line period (5 or 10 years) applies for your property. ird.govt.nz23 For more information on when a property is acquired, see our Question we’ve been asked (QB) 17/02: Date of acquisition of land, and start date for 2-year bright-line test at taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz There are other dates that are relevant for figuring out whether your property sale is taxable under the bright-line property rule. Generally, your bright-line period starts when the legal title is transferred to you and ends when you enter into a binding sale and purchase agreement to sell the property. Where land is acquired or disposed of in a way that does not follow the standard land sale process, for example if you purchase “off the plan”, there are some different rules that apply to the bright-line period start and end dates. The bright-line property rule does not tax any profit made in specific situations. Relief is also available for certain ownership transfers. For more information on exclusions to the bright-line property rule, ownership transfers and rollover relief go to ird. govt.nz/brightline or our guide Bright-line property tax - IR1227. You can also use the property tax decision tool on our website to work out if you need to pay tax on the sale of your property. Go to ird.govt.nz/brightline If you sell or dispose of a residential property and the sale is taxable under the bright-line property rule, the amount of the previously denied interest under the interest limitation rules is treated as if it were part of the cost of the property in the year of disposal. If this results in a net loss, the deduction for the net loss is limited under the current rule that applies to losses from the disposal of bright-line property. If the disposal is not taxable, the interest previously denied a deduction remains non-deductible. For more information about the bright-line property rule, go to ird.govt.nz/brightline or our guide Bright-line property tax - IR1227. You can find our forms and guides at ird.govt.nz/ forms-guides Completing your return Income and losses for property subject to the bright-line property rule are treated differently in the tax return. After a taxable bright-line sale:  if you have net income from the sale of the property (a profit), the net income is included in Box 19B. Unless the property is part of a portfolio, expenses from other properties cannot be offset against the net income from the disposal. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE24  if you have made a net loss when the property is sold, the loss must be carried forward to a later income year when it can be used to offset net income from the land sale provisions, including from future disposals subject to the bright-line rule. A bright-line loss is not recorded in the tax return. Please keep your own record of any bright-line losses you have made. Complete a Bright-line residential property sale information - IR833 form for each bright-line property sold or disposed of and include it with your return. The form explains how to calculate the resulting profit or loss. Complete the form even if the details have been included in a Financial statements summary - IR10 or set of accounts, unless the income will be included in your return as part of your business income as a property speculator, property dealer, developer or builder. Box 19C Other residential income Write the total other residential income in Box 19C. This includes the total from the following amounts:  income in relation to a loan denominated in a foreign currency from the portfolio and/or individual property  all depreciation recovery income from assets disposed of from the portfolio and/or individual property  net income from the taxable disposal of a residential property outside the residential property deduction rules because it is held on revenue account. Write any net tax losses from disposals of rental properties that are excluded from the residential property deduction rules in Box 22B. ird.govt.nz25 Box 19D Total combined residential income The amount in Box 19D is the total amount of Box 19A, Box 19B and Box 19C. Note If you are a partner in a partnership or owner of a look- through company and have been attributed residential income at Box 27G on the IR7P or IR7L, include your share of that in proportion to your share in the partnership or effective look-through interest in the LTC in the following relevant boxes:  Gross residential rental income Box 19A  Net bright-line profit (excluding losses) Box 19B  Other residential income Box 19C. The amount in Box 19D will then include the total of your attributed residential income at Box 27G on the IR7P or IR7L. Boxes 19E to 19I in your return Write the total eligible deductions for the year for all ring- fenced residential rental properties in Residential rental deductions Box 19E. If you are a partner in a partnership or owner of a look-through company and have been attributed residential rental deductions shown at Box 27M on the IR7P or IR7L, include that here at Box 19E. Note Do not include the amount of interest expense denied under the interest limitation rules in Box 19E. If the company has breached the continuity rules, or the company is transferring excess deductions to a wholly owned group member, you’ll need to reduce the current year deductions in Box 19E to reflect the adjustment. If the company is receiving excess deductions from a wholly owned group member, you’ll need to increase the current year deductions in Box 19E. The transfer of excess deductions is not a loss offset nor a subvention payment. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE26 The brought forward and carry forward boxes are calculated by our system when your return is processed. If the deductions are too low, you’ll need to contact us so we can change it when we process your return. Keep good records for the adjustment and include a note with your return. See Question 28 for details on the continuity rules. Include the amount of any interest incurred on an investment in a land rich entity that relates to the rental activity in Box 19E. Include the amount of interest you can claim on an investment in a land rich entity that relates to the rental activity in Box 19G. Include the amount of interest paid that does not relate to the rental property in Box 21B. Write the total excess deductions brought forward from last year in Box 19F. Write the total residential rental deductions claimed this year in Box 19G. This amount cannot exceed the lesser of the following:  Total combined residential income Box 19D  Residential rental deduction Box 19E plus Excess residential rental deductions brought forward Box 19F. The amount cannot exceed the above unless you have sold an individual property or the last property in a residential portfolio and the sale was taxable. The amount in Box 19H should equal Total combined residential income Box 19D minus Residential rental deductions claimed this year Box 19G. Any losses are counted as zero unless the loss is the result of either:  excess deductions released from either a taxable disposal of a property held on the individual property basis, or a taxable disposal of all properties or the last property held in a portfolio, or  claimable interest paid on your investment in a residential land-rich entity. Refer to the Rental income - IR264 guide. Write the amount of all excess deductions for the year to be carried forward to next year in Box 19I. ird.govt.nz27 Notes Note 1 If you sell or dispose of an individual property and the sale is not taxable, or you sell or dispose of the last property in a portfolio and at least 1 of the sales in the portfolio was not taxable, any excess deductions will transfer to another property or portfolio and carried forward to a future year in which you earn income from a residential rental property (including properties on revenue account). Note 2 If you sell or dispose of an individual property and the sale is taxable, or you sell or dispose of the last rental property in a portfolio and the sale of all your rental properties in a portfolio were taxable, any remaining loss/ excess deductions are released and can be offset against other income. However, this does not include any excess deductions transferred to the portfolio/property. Note 3 If you want to claim that a property is held on revenue account where the sale may be taxable, you need to notify us of the details of the property. You will be stating the sale will be a taxable sale when the property is disposed of. You must be able to separately identify the deductions relating to the property. For more information read the Rental income - IR264 guide. Residential land-rich entities If the company has an investment in a land rich entity, include:  interest relating to the residential rental activity that is deductible under the interest limitation rules in Box 19E  interest relating to the residential rental activity you can claim this year under the residential property deduction rules in Box 19G and any remaining amount carried forward in Box 21B  a note attached to your income tax return advising the above amounts relate to an investment in a land rich entity, to ensure quick processing of your return  the amount of interest paid that does not relate to the residential rental property in Box 24. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE28 Question 20 Interest incurred from residential property This question applies to owners of residential property subject to the interest limitation rules. You do not need to complete this question for the following types of property:  farmland  hospitals, hospices, convalescent homes, nursing homes  rest homes and retirement villages  hotels, motels, inns, camping grounds, hostels. For interest to be deductible, the general deductibility rules must be met. The interest will also not be deductible to the extent it is of a private or domestic nature. Since 1 October 2021, interest is not deductible for residential property in New Zealand acquired on or after 27 March 2021, unless an exclusion or exemption applies (see below). For property acquired before 27 March 2021, the ability to deduct interest on existing loans is limited to a percentage of the interest incurred. For the 2024 tax year, you can claim 50% of the interest incurred from 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024. Interest on any new loans drawn down on or after 27 March 2021 is not deductible. Special rules also apply for refinanced loans and for interest on revolving credit and overdraft facilities. Any interest on borrowings above the closing balance on 26 March 2021 is not deductible. For more information, go to ird.govt.nz/property-interest-rules Some companies do not have to apply the interest limitation rules. If your company is a close company where five or fewer individuals or trustees own more than 50% of the company, you will usually have to apply the rules. If your company meets one of the following:  it is not a close company; or  it is a close company that is a Māori authority or eligible to be a Māori authority; or  it is a close company that is wholly-owned by a Māori authority or by an entity eligible to be a Māori authority; ird.govt.nz29 your company will not have to apply the interest limitation rules if less than 50% of its total assets consist of residential property (excluding development property but including shares in other companies that exceed this 50% test) at all times during the income year. If your company is part of a wholly-owned group, the 50% test is applied on a consolidated basis at the group level. There are interposed entity rules to deny interest deductions for a customer who borrows to indirectly fund residential property through an interposed entity. Completing your return Complete question 20 for any interest expense you are claiming at Boxes 19E and 21B in relation to a house, apartment, flat or other structure that could be used for residential accommodation, either short stays or long term. This includes if you have an arrangement to build such a structure, and bare land that could be used to build such a structure under the relevant district plan. Write the total interest on residential property in Box 20A. This is the total interest incurred on your borrowings for all your residential properties for this year. Write the amount of interest expense claimed in Box 20B. Note If you are a partner in a partnership or owner of a look- through company that has incurred interest on residential property at Question 19 in the IR7, include your share of that here in proportion to your share in the partnership or effective look-through interest in the LTC. If you have claimed an interest expense in Box 20B, at Box 20C tick the reason(s) for the interest expense claimed:  A Māori exempt company or not a residential land company - The interest limitation rules do not apply to non-close companies or groups if less than 50% of its total assets consist of residential property (excluding development property but including shares in other companies that exceed this 50% test) at all times during the income year. A close company that is a Māori authority, eligible to be a Māori authority, or wholly-owned by an entity that is a Māori authority or eligible to be one is an exempt Māori company if it passes this 50% test. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE30  Certain schedule 15 exclusions or property not in NZ - The interest limitation rules apply to land in New Zealand only. Schedule 15 of the Income Tax Act 2007 also allows you to claim interest for the following:  main home – if a portion is used to earn income such as a flatting situation  business premises (for example, a villa now used as a dental clinic) except if the business premises is used for providing accommodation and it’s not a person’s main home  certain Māori land, papakāinga and kaumātua housing, and land transferred as part of settlement under Te Tiriti o Waitangi/Treaty of Waitangi  employee accommodation  student accommodation.  Loans drawn down prior to 27 March 2021 - When an exclusion or exemption does not apply, you can claim 50% of the interest incurred for the following situations:  loans drawn down prior to 27 March 2021  property acquired before 27 March 2021 but the loan for the settlement of the property was not drawn down until on or after 27 March 2021  loans that relate to the purchase of a property acquired as a result of an offer made on or before 23 March 2021 and that offer was not able to be revoked or withdrawn before 27 March 2021. In other situations where the property is acquired on or after 27 March 2021, interest cannot be claimed.  Emergency, transitional, social or council housing - You can claim interest for loans if your property is used for emergency, transitional or social housing when leased or contracted (directly or indirectly) to the Crown, for example to Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga - Ministry of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) or Kāinga Ora, or to a registered community housing provider.  New build exemption - A ‘new build’ is a self-contained residence that is issued a Code Compliance Certificate (CCC) under the Building Act 2004, confirming the residence was added to the land on or after 27 March 2020. The exemption generally applies for 20 years. For more information about what qualifies as a new build go to ird.govt.nz/property/renting-out-residential-property or our guide Rental income - IR264. ird.govt.nz31  Development or land business exemption - The development exemption does not require you to have a ‘land business’ and applies to land that you develop, subdivide, or build on to create a new build. The development may be a one-off. The land business exemption applies to land held as part of a developing, subdividing, or land-dealing business, or a business of erecting buildings on land.  Approved build-to-rent exclusion - This applies to land that meets the criteria of build-to-rent land and is approved by Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga - Ministry of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). You can claim interest for loans if your property is recorded on the build-to-rent asset register maintained by HUD. Existing build-to-rent land has until 1 July 2023 to meet the requirements and to apply. For more information about the interest limitation rules and how to calculate the amount of interest you can claim, go to ird.govt.nz/property-interest-rules or our guide Rental income - IR264. You can find our forms and guides at ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Question 21 Business or other rental income Include net residential rental income or losses not included at Question 19 and rents from a commercial property in Box 21B. Do not include any income already shown at Questions 12 to 16 and 19, losses from CFCs (see the notes to Question 37 on page 46) or claim donations here (see the notes to Question 26 on page 35). Write the net profit or loss in Box 21B. This is the amount of income or loss after the deduction of all allowable business expenditure, including shareholders' salaries paid or credited. Note If expenses are deductible against income declared in Questions 12 to 14, claim them here. Attach either: –a fully completed Financial statements summary - IR10 form, or –the company's financial accounts. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE32 The IR10 is a statistics form that sets out a general summary of information from the financial accounts. If you complete an IR10 you do not need to send the financial accounts as well. You still need to complete them (unless the company is very small) and keep them in case we ask for them. Very small companies are not required to prepare financial accounts if these conditions apply during the income year. The company:  is not part of a group  has not derived income over $30,000, or  has not incurred expenditure over $30,000. Companies that do not prepare financial accounts must fill in an IR10 using information from their trial balance or financial records. For more information about who has to prepare financial accounts and minimum financial reporting requirements, go to our website at ird.govt.nz/records The attribution rule Under the attribution rule, anyone whose actions cause an "associated person" (company, trust or partnership) to earn income, can be personally liable for tax on that income. If this rule applies to persons associated to your organisation, it will affect the amount of taxable income in this return. To find out how to apply this rule, refer to our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB), Vol 12, No 12 (December 2000) and Vol 13, No 11 (November 2001). Question 22 Income from taxable property sales or disposals Include all income and tax losses from land sales or disposals of other property not included at Question 19. Profits from land sales are taxable if you bought a property (including an overseas property) for the purpose of reselling it or are in the business of buying and selling land and/or buildings. The profits may also be taxable if the company:  is a builder and improved a property before selling it  developed or subdivided land and sold sections, or  had a change of zoning on the property and sold it within ten years of buying it. ird.govt.nz33 Write the total profit or loss from the sale or disposal of other property in Box 22B. Net profit from a bright-line sale is generally included in Box 19B. Only include in Box 22B the net profit from a bright-line sale excluded at Question 19, for example the bright-line sale of a mixed-use asset. Do not include any net loss from a bright- line sale. For more information on the land sale rules, go to ird.govt. nz/buying-selling or our guide Tax and your property transactions - IR361. You can find our forms and guides at ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Box 22A Residential land withholding tax (RLWT) credit If the company is an "offshore RLWT person" and has sold or transferred residential property located in New Zealand, RLWT may have been deducted from the sale price. The company should have received a statement on the completion of the sale process showing the amount of RLWT deducted. The company can claim a credit for any RLWT deducted. Show the amount of RLWT deducted, less any RLWT paid back to the company and/or transferred to outstanding amounts during the income year. If there was more than 1 amount of RLWT deducted, show the combined amount, less any RLWT paid back to the company and/or transferred to outstanding amounts during the income year. Question 23 Insurance premiums paid to an overseas insurer Special rules apply to any company paying a premium, including a reinsurance premium, to a non-resident insurer. If you're paying a premium to a non-resident insurer you need to get a separate IRD number to account for the tax on the premium income. This is because you're considered to be the insurer's agent. You will need to complete an IR4 return under this separate IRD number and declare premiums paid as the only income received. Only 10% of the total gross premiums paid to overseas insurers is subject to the company tax rate of 28%. This equals 2.8% of the total premiums paid. Any premiums paid to insurers in Switzerland are not subject to tax in New Zealand and should be deducted from the total gross premiums paid. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE34 Agency obligations also extend to other New Zealand residents, for example, brokers, who may initially collect premiums for payment to the non-resident insurer. If there is any default, the insured person is responsible for the tax. Print the gross amount of premiums paid to a non-resident insurer in Box 23. Print the gross amount of premiums paid to Switzerland in Box 23A. Deduct the figure in Box 23A from Box 23 and multiply the net amount by 0.1 (10%). Print your answer in Box 23B and copy this amount to Box 31. No other income should be returned as an agent for an overseas insurer. The company still needs to declare other income under its original IRD number. If you have any enquiries, contact: Team Lead Significant Enterprises Inland Revenue PO Box 39090 Wellington Mail Centre Lower Hutt 5045 Phone 0800 443 773 Question 24 Other income Show any other income received by the company at Question 24. For example, the sale of: –shares or other property –securities –income from an undertaking or scheme. Income from sale of non-FIF shares or other property Profits from the sale of shares and other property are taxable if the company: –buys and sells shares or other property as a business, or –buys shares or other property for the purpose of resale. This does not apply if shares are FIFs. List the details of income and expenses from these sales on a sheet of paper and staple it to the top of page 3 of the return. Include the total profit in Box 24B. ird.govt.nz35 Losses from shares or other property that are not a foreign investment fund (FIF) If the company has made a loss from the sale of an asset that was not a FIF and you can show that any profit made would have been taxable, you may be able to claim the loss as a deduction. Financial arrangements A company must account for income from financial arrangements on an accrual basis. Financial arrangements include government stock, futures contracts and deferred property settlements, excluding short-term agreements for sale and purchase of property. Changes to the rules for the treatment of financial arrangements have split the rules into 2 sets. Generally, the first set applies to financial arrangements entered into before 20 May 1999 and the second applies to financial arrangements entered into on or after that date. Both sets of rules require the income or expenditure to be spread over the term of the financial arrangement. This applies in every case - the company does not have to be in the business of buying or selling financial arrangements, or be intending to sell, as it would with shares. The company may, in certain cases, deduct any losses. Sale or maturity of financial arrangements When a financial arrangement matures or is sold, remitted or transferred, a "wash-up" calculation, known as a base price adjustment, must be made. The calculation ensures that the total gains or losses from the financial arrangement are accounted for. If you need any information on when losses can be deducted or how to calculate a base price adjustment, please contact us. Income from an undertaking or scheme Profits from any undertaking or scheme entered into for the purpose of making a profit are taxable. Describe the undertaking or scheme and list the details of income and expenses from them. Staple this information to the top of page 3 of the return and include the total profit in Box 24B. Question 26 Donations A company (including an unlisted company with 5 or fewer shareholders) can claim a deduction for donations it makes to any society, institution, association, organisation, trust or fund that has donee organisation status. You can view the list of these organisation at ird.govt.nz/donee COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE36 Note State-funded tertiary education institutions, state schools and state-integrated schools do not have to be approved to have donee organisation status. The deduction for donations cannot be more than the company's net income after expenses (before the donation deduction is taken into account). Use the following steps to calculate the company's donation deduction.  If the amount in Box 25 is a loss, print nil in Box 26B.  If the donations made by the company exceed the amount in Box 25, copy the amount in Box 25 to Box 26B.  If the donations made by the company do not exceed the amount in Box 25, print the amount of the donations in Box 26B. Question 28 Net losses brought forward Losses from CFCs are not included in Question 28 - see Question 39 on page 47. Before a company is allowed to carry forward net losses it must satisfy one of two tests. 1. Shareholder continuity 49% continuity of minimum voting interest or market value interest must be maintained by a group of persons at all times, from the beginning of the year of net loss to the end of the year of carrying it forward (the continuity period). To check whether the shareholder continuity requirements have been met, use the lowest percentage of economic interest held by each shareholder during the continuity period. To calculate the total lowest economic interest see Question 41 on page 48. 2. Business continuity test The business continuity test allows losses to be carried forward despite a breach in shareholder continuity if certain requirements are satisfied. The main requirement is that the underlying business continues i.e. there is no “major change”, except permitted changes, in the business for 5 years after a change in ownership. “Major change” refers to the nature of the business activities and the extent the same or similar assets are used to generate income for the company. Only losses incurred in the 2013-14 and later income years can be carried forward under this test. ird.govt.nz37 For more information see our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 33, No 6 (July 2021). Write the net losses the company can bring forward to 2024 in Box 28A, and the amount the company has offset against 2024 income in Box 28B. If the company cannot offset any net losses in the 2024 income year write “0.00” in Box 28B. Show whether or not the company is carrying forward losses under the business continuity test at Box 28C. Note You should be able to find the loss balance from the previous year on the loss notice sent to you with the company's 2023 income tax assessment. If you do not have a loss notice, enter the details from your own records. Question 29 Total income after net losses brought forward Subtract Box 28B from Box 27. Print your answer in Box 29. Question 30 Net losses and subvention payments To offset net losses there must be a common shareholding of at least 66%, and 49% continuity of minimum voting interest must also be maintained (or 49% market value interest if a market value circumstance exists). To calculate voting or market value interest see Question 41 on page 48. To offset a net loss incurred during a current income year, the loss company and the profit company must be members of the same group at all times for that income year. To offset a net loss brought forward, the loss company and the profit company must be members of the same group of companies for the entire period, beginning with the income year the net loss is incurred in and ending with the year of offset. The amount of loss offset cannot exceed the taxable income of the profit company and neither may the amount of loss to be offset exceed the net loss of the loss company. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE38 Record individual details of the losses claimed or transferred and subvention payments received or made at Questions 42F or 42G. The total of these must equal Boxes 30 or 30A respectively. Part-year grouping The general part-year grouping rule is that only the part of the net loss incurred in the same period as the profit is derived may be offset, if, during the period: –the loss company maintains continuity of shareholding, and –commonality of shareholding between loss and profit companies has been maintained. Net loss and profit amounts allowed to be offset are based on periods where continuity and commonality requirements are met for all companies taking part in a part-year grouping arrangement. If the company received net losses from another company or made a subvention payment to another company, put a minus sign in the relevant last box. Attach a schedule setting out the names and IRD numbers of the companies and the amount of the payment or loss. If the company is transferring excess residential rental deductions to a wholly owned group member, the transfer is recorded as a reduction of the current year residential rental deductions in Box 19E. Similarly, if the company is receiving excess residential rental deductions from a wholly owned group member, the transfer is recorded as an increase of the current year residential rental deductions in Box 19E. Do not record these amounts in Question 30. Refer to Question 19 for details. Qualifying companies Net losses are restricted for grouping and subvention payment purposes. A qualifying company loss can be offset against any group company profit (including non-qualifying company profits). ird.govt.nz39 Question 32 Tax calculation Box 32E Foreign investor tax credit The foreign investor tax credit rules reduce the combined income tax and NRWT imposed on foreign investors with interests in a New Zealand company. See Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 20, No 3 (April 2008) for details about the change of company tax rate. A company is entitled to a foreign investor tax credit when it pays a supplementary dividend of the same amount to its non-resident shareholders. The foreign investor tax credit can then be offset against the company's income tax liability. The foreign investor tax credit arises in the income year the supplementary dividend is paid and is to be offset in the following order: 1. Against the company's income tax payable for the year the supplementary dividend is paid. Enter this amount in Box 32E. 2. At the company's election, either: - against the company's income tax liability for any of the previous four income years, or - against the income tax liability for another company in the same wholly owned group of companies for the year the supplementary dividend is paid in or any of the previous four income years. 3. Carried forward to subsequent years for offset against the tax liability of the company or another company in the same wholly owned group of companies. If the company has a foreign investor tax credit that cannot be fully offset against its own income tax liability in the income year the supplementary dividend is paid, attach a note to the front of the return giving details of how to treat any excess credit. Box 32G Imputation credits If the company has imputation credits, it may have a net loss to carry forward. This will happen if the company's total imputation credits are greater than the tax payable at Box 32F. To calculate the net loss to carry forward, subtract the amount at Box 32F from the total imputation credits (Box 32G) and divide the answer by 0.28 (28%). COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE40 If the deemed net loss is to be offset to other companies within the same group (rather than carried forward), reduce the amount of net loss shown at Box 29 by the amount offset. Question 33 Refunds and/or transfers If you want your refund transferred to another account or to arrears being paid off by an instalment arrangement, tell us the date you would like this done. The date you can choose depends on what tax has been overpaid and whose account you want the credit transferred to. Note If the transfer is to arrears being paid off by an instalment arrangement, you'll need to include a note with your return authorising the transfer and giving the following information: –that the transfer is to arrears currently under an instalment arrangement –the name and IRD number of the taxpayer the transfer should be made to –whether the taxpayer is an "associated taxpayer" –the tax type and period, and –the date you want the transfer to take place. Question 33B Associated taxpayers For companies, the following persons are associated taxpayers for the purposes of transferring overpaid tax: –another company in the same group of companies –a shareholder-employee of the company –a partner in the same partnership. If you want your refund transferred to another person, you will need to show if they are an associated taxpayer. Transfer date You can ask for your credit to be transferred at any date as long as it is not before the relevant dates set out as follows. ird.govt.nz41 For credit transferred: to your account/an associated taxpayer's account If the credit is from excess tax deducted (for example RWT deducted on interest) it's the day after your balance date (or 1 April if your balance date is before 31 March). If the credit is from overpaid provisional tax it's the day you overpaid it. Please note that special rules apply if tax pooling funds have been transferred in. to a non-associated taxpayer's account It's the later of the day you requested the transfer, or the day after you file your return. Future transfer dates If you want your credit transferred at a future date, attach a note to the front of your return with the details of the amount you want transferred, the account you want it transferred to (if it's to another person and they are associated) and the date you want it transferred. If you do not tell us the date you want your credit transferred, we will transfer it at a date we think gives you the greatest advantage. If you want the credit transferred at a different date, you can ask us to change it (even if we have transferred your credit to cover a debt). Requesting transfers on your return You can ask us to transfer a refund to another account by filling out pages 4 and 5 of the return. If you ask us to, we will transfer the refund to:  the company's own account or an account of someone associated to the company on the later of: –the day after the balance date (or 1 April if your balance date is before 31 March) –the due date in the destination account.  an account of someone not associated to the company on the day after the return was completed. If you want the company's refund transferred at a different date from those listed earlier, you can attach a note to the return, including the details of the account you want the refund transferred to and the transfer date you want. If the transfer is going to another person, tell us if they are associated to the company. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE42 Question 34 Initial provisional tax liability A company has an initial provisional tax liability if it: –starts to derive income from a taxable activity in the tax year –had not derived gross income from a taxable activity within the preceding four years, and –has residual income tax (RIT) of $60,000 or more in the current year. New businesses do not pay provisional tax in their first year of operation because there is no RIT from the previous year to base the calculation on. However, companies that have an initial provisional tax liability may be charged interest from the first, second or third instalment date. The instalment date interest applies from is determined by the business start date. Some new businesses make voluntary payments to reduce liability for interest. More information about the dates interest applies from is available in our guide Provisional tax - IR289. There are special rules about how interest is calculated when a company has an initial provisional tax liability and has changed its balance date. For further information, see our Provisional tax - IR289 guide. Print the date the company started to derive income from the taxable activity in Box 34. Question 35 2025 provisional tax 2025 provisional tax is charged for income the company will earn in the 2025 income year. It is payable in 2, 3 or 6 instalments. There are 3 options for calculating your provisional tax - standard, estimation and ratio. If the company's 2024 RIT is: –$5,000 or less it does not have to pay provisional tax, but it can make voluntary payments –more than $5,000 but expected to be $5,000 or less for 2025 it may estimate 2025 provisional tax at nil –more than $5,000 and expected to be more than $5,000 for 2025 it must pay 2025 provisional tax using 1 of the payment options. ird.govt.nz43 Standard option (S) Under this option, your 2025 provisional tax is your 2024 RIT (where it is more than $5,000) plus 5%. Note If you think your income for 2025 will be more than your 2024 income, you can make voluntary payments over and above the amount you have to pay under the standard option. Estimation option (E) Companies can estimate their 2025 provisional tax. They can re-estimate any number of times up to and including their final instalment due date. If the company's 2025 RIT is expected to be less than its 2024 RIT, estimating may prevent the company from paying more than it has to. Note An estimate must be fair and reasonable at each instalment it applies to. If you use the estimation option, see "Not taking reasonable care penalty" and "Interest" on page 44. If the company estimates its provisional tax, write E in Box 35A and the amount of 2025 provisional tax in Box 35B. If you estimate your provisional tax your instalments should be one-third of your estimation. If you're using the ratio option and select E at Box 35A this will mean you are electing to stop using the ratio option. Ratio option (R) If you're GST registered, you may qualify to use the ratio option to calculate your provisional tax. Only enter R at Box 35A if you have already elected to use the ratio option. Your application to use the ratio option must be made by phone or in writing before the beginning of the income year you want to use it. If you've already elected to use the ratio option and want to continue using it, enter R at Box 35A. There is more information about the ratio option in our guide Provisional tax - IR289. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE44 Not taking reasonable care penalty When you estimate the company's 2025 provisional tax, your estimate must be fair and reasonable. If the 2025 RIT is greater than the provisional tax paid, you may be liable for a not taking reasonable care penalty of 20% of the underpaid provisional tax. Interest If the company has paid too much provisional tax, we may pay interest. If it has not paid enough provisional tax, we may charge interest. Interest the company pays is tax deductible, while interest we pay is taxable income. Election to be a provisional tax payer A company is a provisional tax payer for the 2024 year if its RIT for that year is more than $5,000. If the 2024 RIT is $5,000 or less but the company paid provisional tax for the year, the company may elect to be a provisional tax payer for that year. This may affect the interest the company may be entitled to for that year. To elect to be a provisional tax payer for the 2024 year, attach a note to the front of the 2024 return. Change in balance date There are special rules about when provisional tax is due and how interest is calculated if there has been a change in the balance date. For more information, read our guides Penalties and interest - IR240 and Provisional tax - IR289. Tax pooling Tax pooling allows taxpayers to pool provisional tax payments, offsetting underpayments by overpayments within the same pool. This reduces their possible exposure to late payment penalties and interest. For more information about tax pooling, including a list of intermediaries, go to ird.govt.nz/tax-pooling ird.govt.nz45 Payment dates 2025 provisional tax Generally, a company with a 31 March balance date pays provisional tax by the following due dates: First instalment 28 August 2024 Second instalment 15 January 2025 Third instalment 7 May 2025 A company with a balance date other than 31 March generally pays provisional tax on the 28th day of the 5th, 9th and 13th months after the balance date. There are 2 exceptions:  If it would be due on 28 December it is due on 15 January, and  If it would be due on 28 April it is due on 7 May. These dates will alter if the company is registered for GST and:  the GST filing frequency is six-monthly, or  provisional tax is paid through the ratio option. If either of these situations apply to you, read our guide Provisional tax - IR289. 2024 end-of-year income tax Companies that have an agent and an extension of time may have until 7 April 2025 to pay their tax. If you think this applies to your company, contact your agent. A company with a balance date between 1 March and 30 September must pay its end-of-year income tax (Box 32L) and any interest by 7 February 2025. A company with a balance date between 1 October and 28 February must pay its end-of-year income tax by the 7th day of the month before the following year's balance date. How to make payments You can make payments by:  direct debit in myIR  credit or debit card at ird.govt.nz/pay  internet banking - most New Zealand banks have a pay tax option. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE46 When making a payment, include:  your IRD number  the account type you are paying, and  the period the payment relates to. Find all the details of our payment options at ird.govt.nz/pay Late payment If you do not pay a bill on time, you may have to pay penalties and interest. Contact us if you are not able to pay on time. We'll look at your payment options, which may include an instalment arrangement. Find out more at ird.govt.nz/penalties Question 37 Foreign rights If you calculated CFC or FIF income at Question 18 you may be required to complete an additional disclosure form for that investment. For all interests of 10% or more in a foreign company, the additional disclosure is required. For other investments, the requirement for an additional disclosure depends on the company you are preparing the Companies income tax return - IR4 for.  If the company is not widely held or a PIE, additional disclosure is not required if the investments are in countries New Zealand holds a double tax agreement with (as at 31 March 2024) and the fair dividend rate or comparative value has been used.  If the company is widely held or a PIE you are required to file an additional disclosure. The disclosure forms are available at ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Contact us if you need help to find the appropriate disclosure form. For information on foreign exchange rates, go to ird.govt.nz/tools-calculators Find out more about the base erosion profit shifting (BEPS) hybrid mismatch rules at ird.govt.nz/beps ird.govt.nz47 Question 38 Share repurchases When amounts distributed to shareholders on cancellation or repurchase of shares fall below specified thresholds, the amounts are taxable in full to shareholders as dividends. When distributions on repurchases exceed those thresholds, or occur through the stock exchange, the distributions will be deducted from available subscribed capital of the company and will be tax-free to the shareholders. However, this is only to the extent that the distributions are not in lieu of dividends. If the subscribed capital of the company has been depleted, the distributions will be taxable. Specific rules also govern the repurchase and subsequent sale of Treasury stock. The total value entered on the return should be the aggregate value of all distributions made by the company during the year for company shares repurchased, redeemed, cancelled or purchased as Treasury stock. Question 39 Foreign-sourced dividends Generally, funds would use the default FIF income calculation method (the fair dividend rate) which does not tax dividends separately. However, the foreign tax deducted from the dividend can be claimed as a credit against the tax payable on the calculated FIF income. A credit for any tax paid by the foreign company (on its earnings) may be allowed in calculating the amount payable by the New Zealand company. Any NRWT deducted from the foreign dividend paid to the New Zealand company may also be allowed as a credit. Information about exempt foreign dividends Although most foreign dividends received by companies are exempt from tax, you should still answer ''Yes'' to this question if the company receives an exempt foreign dividend. Foreign dividends from some investments are taxable. These should be included in the tax return as income from overseas. Dividends on foreign investments are taxable in 3 situations:  When the investment gives the company a direct income interest of less than 10% in a foreign company, but the investment is 1 of certain investments that are excluded from the normal FIF rules (see Question 18 on page 17 for the most common exclusions).  When the dividend relates to an investment in fixed-rate shares ("fixed-rate foreign equity"). COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE48  When the dividend paid is tax-deductible in a foreign country by a foreign company (a "deductible foreign equity distribution"). Question 40 Company controlled or owned by non-residents We need to know whether the company is owned or controlled by non-residents because we may need to apply subpart FE or sections CH 9, GC 6-14 and GB 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Question 41 Total lowest economic interest of shareholders Calculating the economic interest is necessary for a number of reasons, such as making sure you can carry any net loss forward, the grouping provisions and the imputation credit carry forward provisions. Where there were no changes in shareholdings (including voting rights) throughout the entire year then the lowest economic interest will be 100%. Enter 100.00 at Box 41. Where there has been a change in shareholding including a change to voting rights or market value interests then you will need to calculate the total lowest economic interest. A shareholder's economic interest in a company will generally be measured by referring to the percentage of voting power they hold in that company, to vote on: 1. the dividends or other distributions to be made by the company 2. the constitution of the company 3. any variation in the capital of the company, and 4. the appointment or election of directors. ird.govt.nz49 Example A company has two shareholders, Barbara and Maria. The company has two classes of shares:  Class A shares carry a right to vote on (2) the constitution and (3) variations in capital  Class B shares carry unrestricted voting rights, (1), (2), (3) and (4) on the previous page. Barbara holds all 100 of the A shares in the company while Maria holds all 100 of the B shares. Their percentage of voting interest in the company is measured as follows: DistributionsConstitution Variation in capital DirectorsLowest Barbara 0+50+50+0=100 =25% 100+100+100+100=400 Maria 100+50+50+100=300 =75% 100+100+100+100=400 Enter this total at Box 41 in the Return100.00 If Barbara and Maria hold these proportions of shares for the entire income year, the "total lowest economic interest of shareholders" or the minimum continuity is 100%. The following example shows a shareholding or voting interest change occurring during the year. Example On 1 September 2023 Barbara and Maria swapped shares and held these proportions to 31 March 2024, the company's balance date. 1 April 2023 1 Sep 2023 31 Mar 2024 Lowest Barbara 25% 75% 75% 25% Maria 75% 25% 25% 25% The lowest percentage of rights held by each shareholder during the income year is 25%. So, the total lowest economic interest of shareholders, or the minimum continuity, is 50%. Enter this total at Box 41 in the Return as 50.00. In certain circumstances the shareholders' economic interests in a company will also be determined by the market value interests in the company. This is where the voting interests do not reflect the true economic interests held in a company. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE50 A shareholder's market value interest is their share as a percentage of the total market value of shares (and options) in the company. Specific factors that require a market value interest to be calculated are: –the company has issued debentures to which sections FA 2 or FA 2B of the Income Tax Act 2007 apply –the company has issued shares where payment of dividends is guaranteed by a third party –there's an option to acquire shares in the company, and –an arrangement exists for the purpose of defeating provisions that depends on measurement of voting and market value interests. You will need to add together the lowest economic interest of each shareholder and print the total in Box 41. Write percentages in the following format, for example, show 50% as 50.00, and 100% as 100.00. Effect on the imputation credit account (ICA) If you keep an ICA and have had a change of shareholding of more than 34% you may need to make an adjustment on your annual imputation return at Box 45C ("Other debits") - see page 54. Question 42 Shareholder details - see also the IR4S Complete Question 42 if shareholders, directors and relatives of shareholders received remuneration or a loan. Remuneration is liable for ACC levies. Shareholders' salaries Write all remuneration with no PAYE deducted that the company paid to that person in Box 42B. For the company to claim a deduction for shareholder remuneration it must be paid either: –during the income year, or –within the time allowed for the company to complete its return. If the remuneration is not paid in time, the deduction cannot be claimed until the following year. Over-payments of AIM provisional tax that relate to shareholder employee salary accruals are allowed to be used to meet the shareholder's tax liability on that salary at the ird.govt.nz51 end of the income year. Record details of any AIM tax credits transferred to each shareholder at Box 42C. Loss offsets and subvention payments Record details of any losses claimed or transferred from or to each group member at Box 42F. Record details of any subvention payments claimed or transferred from or to each group member at Box 42G. The total of Boxes 42F must be recorded at Box 30. The total of Boxes 42G must be recorded at Box 30A. Current account balance If the shareholder's current account balance has been overdrawn, (that is, the shareholder owes the company money) then it is a debit balance. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE52 Annual imputation return The annual imputation return must be completed for the period 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024, regardless of your accounting year. If you're a member of an imputation group, see page 7. For more information read our guide Imputation - IR274. Question 43 Opening balance This is the same as the closing balance at 31 March 2023. Tick either "Credit" or "Debit" below Box 43. New companies will not have a closing balance to bring forward. Write "0.00" in Box 43. Question 44 Credits Question 44A Income tax paid Include in Box 44A all payments of income tax and provisional tax made from 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024 for 1989 and subsequent income years. Do not include any FBT, ESCT, interest on tax, late payment penalties, imputation penalty tax or RWT. Question 44B RWT on interest received If the company received interest with RWT deducted between 1 April 2023 and 31 March 2024, print the total RWT in Box 44B. Question 44C Imputation credits attached to dividends received If the company received dividends with imputation credits attached between 1 April 2023 and 31 March 2024, print the total credits in Box 44C. Note This is the total imputation credits attached to dividends received. This amount is not limited to the tax payable on your dividends and is not necessarily the same amount as the imputation credits being claimed in Box 14. ird.govt.nz53 Question 44D Other credits List any other credits made to the ICA from 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024. Use a separate sheet of paper if necessary. Attach it to the top of page 3 and print the total in Box 44D. Other types of credits include: –RWT on dividends received –provisional tax allocated to the company by a company in the same wholly owned group that has overpaid its provisional tax –residential land withholding tax (RLWT) credit deducted from the sale or transfer of residential land located in New Zealand during the income year, less any RLWT paid back to the company and/or transferred to outstanding amounts during the income year. Supplementary available subscribed capital account (SASCA) If you're a public unit trust or a group investment fund that maintains a SASCA and you're eligible to transfer credits from that account to the ICA, record the credits being transferred to the ICA in Box 44D (other credits). All public unit trusts or group investment funds maintaining a SASCA should, by the due date for completing the 2024 IR4 or IR4J, send a copy of that memorandum account together with any written queries to: Investment Desk Large Enterprises Inland Revenue PO Box 2871 Christchurch 8140 For more information on negative dividends and the SASCA rules, see our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 14, No 11 (November 2002). Qualifying company election tax (QCET) payments Include any QCET payments made after 17 May 2007 as a credit in the ICA when working out the balance. Use the account balance in the formula, when calculating the imputation credit to be attached to a dividend paid by the qualifying company. See our Tax Information Bulletins (TIBs) Vol 11, No 5 (May/June 1999) and Vol 20, No 3, page 127 (April 2008). COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE54 Question 45 Debits Question 45A Income tax refunded Print in Box 45A the company's total income tax refunds received from 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024 for 1989 and subsequent income years. Do not include any interest on tax received or income tax refunded for any year before 1989. Question 45B Imputation credits attached to dividends paid If the company paid dividends from 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024 with imputation credits attached, print the total credits in Box 45B. Question 45C Other debits List any other debits in the ICA and print the total in Box 45C. Examples of other types of debits are: –any provisional tax allocated by the company to a company in the same wholly owned group that has underpaid its provisional tax –an adjustment for a change of shareholding of more than 34% during the period 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024, regardless of your accounting year –an adjustment for a change in an imputation ratio, or –tax payable by a company on any part of a distribution not sourced from the subscribed capital of the company, where that company repurchases a share on-market. Qualifying companies The 66% continuity of shareholding requirement does not apply to qualifying companies. There is no need to make an adjustment where there has been a change of shareholding, except in the year the company ceases to be a qualifying company. Question 46A Adjustments to debit balance If a qualifying company received an income tax refund after 1 April 1995 that created a debit balance in the ICA, no further income tax is required to the extent of any refunds received. If the qualifying company has a debit balance as a result of income tax refunded from 1 April 2023, please subtract the amount refunded at Box 46A. If the closing balance is a credit, there is no tax to pay. ird.govt.nz55 If the closing balance at Box 46B is a debit, it must be paid by 20 June 2024. Note There are 2 types of relief from payment of debit ICA balances. These are: –the offsetting income tax payments –same debit ICA balances reflected in successive years. For more information see our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 16, No 1 (February 2004). Question 47 Imputation penalty tax Imputation penalty tax of 10% of the debit closing balance is also payable by 20 June 2024. Work out the 10% penalty in Box 47. If the total in Box 47A exceeds $100 and is not paid by the due date, late payment penalties and interest will apply - see page 46. Limitations on tax refunds We may hold all or part of a refund if: –the company is expecting an income tax refund, and –the credit balance in the ICA at 31 March 2024 is less than the refund. If there have been additional credits to the ICA since 31 March 2024, the company may complete an interim 2025 IR4J return in anticipation of an IR4 annual return being completed at a later date. We may then be able to release the refund. We can apply non-refundable overpaid income tax to a company's previous years' income tax liabilities, where these debits exist, rather than transferring the credit forward to the next year's provisional tax. This avoids further payments having to be made to meet back- year debts. COMPANY TAX RETURN GUIDE56 Self-assessment by taxpayers Taxpayers have to assess their own liability as part of their return filing obligations. We may amend your assessment if a correction is required. If you dispute our assessment please go to ird.govt.nz/ disputes for more information. The 4-month period for you to issue a notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA) to your self- assessment will start on the date Inland Revenue receives your return. Accident Compensation Act 2001 Under the Accident Compensation Act 2001, Inland Revenue is required to provide the earnings information at Box 42B from this return to the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC). The information is used by ACC to invoice all ACC levies. ACC invoicing for close companies (including earners' levy for shareholder-employee earnings with no PAYE deducted) starts from September each year. Maximum earnings from multiple companies The maximum amount of earners' levy that can be collected from a shareholder-employee is $1,819.66. A shareholder- employee may be due for a refund from ACC if the shareholder-employee's combined total remuneration from two or more companies is over $130,911. Please call ACC on 0800 222 776 to find out about the refund process. ACC earners' levy Shareholder-employees' salaries or directors' fees without PAYE deducted are liable for ACC earners' levy. The company will be invoiced by ACC for this levy.

The following bodies do not have to complete imputation returns: – non-resident companies – look-through companies (LTCs) – trustee companies (but not group investment funds with Category A income) – any company with a constitution preventing it from distributing all its income or property to any proprietor, member or shareholder – companies whose income is completely exempt from tax – local authorities – Crown research institutes – non-active companies, or – Māori authorities. ANNUAL IMPUTATION RETURN GUIDE4 Trans-Tasman imputation and imputation groups Australian companies can elect to maintain a New Zealand imputation account from the 2003–04 tax year. An alternative form of grouping (for imputation purposes only) is available, which Australian companies may join. Note From 15 March 2017 where an ICA company tie breaks to Australia under the Australia/New Zealand Double Tax Agreement, no election is required, it will automatically become an Australian ICA company. You will still need to register using the Trans-Tasman imputation election - IR488 form. Returns for trans-Tasman imputation Australian companies, which elect under the trans-Tasman rules, are required to complete a 2024 Annual imputation return - IR4J by 31 July 2023. The return is completed for the New Zealand tax year (1 April to 31 March) regardless of your accounting year. Only fields 1 to 10A of this return need to be completed. Note A $250 penalty may be charged where returns are not completed on time. Returns for imputation groups The imputation group representative will complete an Annual imputation return - IR4J on behalf of the imputation group. Imputation group members will still complete an Annual imputation return - IR4J reporting their individual imputation credit account (ICA) balances up to the date of grouping, and any movement within the ICA account, such as a transfer of credit from themselves to the group. Where payment of any further income tax (a debit ICA balance) is made, attach a note of how the corresponding income tax credit should be allocated to group members. For more information go to ird.govt.nz/imputation ird.govt.nz5 Foreign dividend payments (FDP) The FDP rules have been fully repealed from 1 April 2017. This means FDP can no longer be included in your annual imputation return. Multi-rate PIE (MRP) An MRP is not required to maintain an ICA. Credits in the ICA on the date a company becomes an MRP are lost. Where there is a debit in the ICA on the date a company becomes an MRP, the company has until the end of the tax year to clear the debit. Listed PIEs will continue to pay tax and complete income tax returns as a company and must maintain an ICA. For more information read the Portfolio investment entity guide - IR860. Limitation on tax refunds We may hold all or part of a refund if: – the company is expecting an income tax refund, and – the credit balance in the ICA at 31 March 2024 is less than the refund. If there have been additional credits to the ICA since 31 March 2024, the company may complete an interim 2025 IR4J return in anticipation of an IR4 annual return being completed at a later date. We may then be able to release the refund. We can also apply non-refundable overpaid income tax to a company's previous years' income tax liabilities, if debits exist, instead of transferring the credit forward to the next year's provisional tax. This avoids further payments having to be made to satisfy back-year debts. ANNUAL IMPUTATION RETURN GUIDE6 Research and development (R&D) loss tax credit No credit balance due to provisional or income tax paid will arise in the imputation credit account of a company that has claimed the R&D loss tax credit until that company has repaid the cashed-out amounts. This is to maintain tax neutrality with companies who are not able to cash out losses. Repayment of the R&D loss tax credit can occur by paying sufficient: • future income tax (for example by trading into profit), or • R&D repayment tax following a loss recovery event (LRE). For more information on the impacts to imputations and examples on the R&D loss tax credit go to ird.govt.nz/research-development Completing the return The information on the first page of the return helps us make sure any correspondence we send goes to the right place. Questions 1 to 5 Please fill in Questions 1 to 5, if these details are not already shown. We ask for your daytime phone number at Question 5 so we can call you, if necessary, to ask questions about the return. Question 3 Postal address If you have a new postal address, write the details at Question 3. If your new address is a PO Box number, show your box lobby if you have one. If you are unsure of your box lobby, please contact New Zealand Post. Leave this address panel blank if the company uses its tax preparer's postal address. The tax preparer will let us know if they change their address. ird.govt.nz7 Annual imputation return The annual imputation return is completed for the period 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024 regardless of your accounting year. For more information read our guide Imputation - IR274. Question 6 Opening balance This is the same as the closing balance at 31 March 2023. Tick either Debit or Credit, below Box 6. Because new companies will not have a closing balance to bring forward, they should write "0.00" in Box 6. Question 7 Credits Australian companies which elect to maintain a New Zealand ICA should include credits in Question 7C and 7D only. Question 7A Income tax paid The imputation system started at the beginning of the 1989 income year. Include in Box 7A all payments of New Zealand income tax and provisional tax made from 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024 that were for 1989 and later income years. Do not include any FBT, ESCT, interest on tax, late payment penalties, imputation penalty tax or RWT. Question 7B RWT on interest received If the company received interest with RWT deducted between 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024, write the total RWT in Box 7B. ANNUAL IMPUTATION RETURN GUIDE8 Question 7C Imputation credits attached to dividends received If the company received dividends with imputation credits attached between 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024, write the total credits in Box 7C. Include the full amount of credits received here. Do not limit this to the amount of income tax due on the dividends received. The limitation only applies to the amount of imputation credits you can claim in your Company income tax return - IR4. Question 7D Other credits List any other credits made to the ICA from 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024. Use a separate sheet of paper if there is not enough room and attach it to the return. Write the total in Box 7D. Other types of credits include: – RWT on dividends received – provisional tax allocated to the company by a company in the same wholly owned group that has overpaid its provisional tax – specific credits for Australian companies which have elected to maintain a New Zealand ICA, and – Residential land withholding tax (RLWT) deducted from the sale or transfer of residential property in New Zealand, less any RLWT paid back to the company and/or transferred to outstanding amounts. Note Where an ICA company automatically becomes an Australian ICA company because its residence tie-breaks to Australia under the New Zealand/Australia Double Tax Agreement, any accumulated imputation credits up until the point of becoming an Australian ICA company are included in the trans-Tasman ICA. This is done by making a credit entry in the first trans- Tasman ICA return and equal debit entry in the final New Zealand ICA return. These entries are for administrative purposes only and do not change the imputation credit origination dates for shareholder continuity purposes. ird.govt.nz9 Supplementary available subscribed capital account (SASCA) If you are a public unit trust or a group investment fund that maintains a SASCA and are eligible to transfer credits from that account to the ICA, please record the credits being transferred in Box 7D (other credits). All public unit trusts or group investment funds maintaining a SASCA should, by the due date for completing the 2024 IR4 or IR4J, send a copy of that memorandum account, together with any written queries relating to the operation of the SASCA to: Investment Desk Large Enterprises Inland Revenue PO Box 2871 Christchurch 8140 For more information on negative dividends and the SASCA rules, see our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB), Vol 14, No 11 (November 2002). Qualifying company election tax (QCET) payments Include any QCET payments made after 17 May 2007 as a credit in the ICA when working out the account balance. Use the account balance in the formula when calculating the imputation credit to be attached to a dividend paid by the qualifying company. See our Tax Information Bulletins (TIBs), Vol 11, No 5 (May/June 1999) and Vol 20, No 3 (April 2008). ANNUAL IMPUTATION RETURN GUIDE10 Question 8 Debits Australian companies which elect to maintain a New Zealand ICA should include debits in Questions 8B and 8C only. Question 8A Income tax refunded Write in Box 8A the company's total income tax refunds received from 1 April 2023 and 31 March 2024 for 1989 and later income years. Do not include any interest on tax received or income tax refunded for any year before 1989. Question 8B Imputation credits attached to dividends paid If the company paid dividends from 1 April 2023 and 31 March 2024 with imputation credits attached, write the total credits in Box 8B. Note For a company that has claimed an R&D loss tax credit, no imputation credits will be available until that company has repaid the cashed-out amounts. For more information about the R&D loss tax credit go to ird.govt.nz/research-development Question 8C Other debits List any other debits in the ICA and write the total in Box 8C. Other types of debits include: – any provisional tax allocated by the company to a company in the same wholly owned group that has underpaid its provisional tax – an adjustment for a change of shareholding of more than 34% during the period 1 April 2023 and 31 March 2024 regardless of your accounting year – an adjustment for a change in an imputation ratio, and – tax payable by a company on any part of a distribution that is not sourced from the subscribed capital of the company, where that company repurchases a share on-market. ird.govt.nz11 Qualifying companies The 66% continuity of shareholding requirement does not apply to qualifying companies. There is no need to make an adjustment where there has been a change of shareholding, except in the year the company ceases to be a qualifying company. Question 9 Closing balance Where payment of a debit balance is made for an imputation group, attach details of how the income tax credit should be allocated to group members to the return. Question 9A Adjustments to debit balances If a qualifying company has received an income tax refund after 1 April 1995 that has created a debit balance in the ICA, no further income tax is paid on any refunds received. If the company has a debit balance as a result of income tax refunded after 1 April 2023, please subtract the amount refunded at Box 9A. If the closing balance is a credit, there is nothing to pay. If the closing balance at Box 9B is a debit, it must be paid by 20 June 2024. Note There are 2 types of relief from payment of debit ICA balances: – offsetting income tax payments, and – same debit ICA balances reflected in successive years. For more information see our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 16, No 1 (February 2004). ANNUAL IMPUTATION RETURN GUIDE12 Question 10 Imputation penalty tax Imputation penalty tax of 10% of the debit closing balance is also payable by 20 June 2024. Work out the 10% penalty in Box 10. We will charge you interest if you do not make your tax payment by the due date. We may also charge you a late payment penalty. If your tax remains unpaid, we'll charge an initial 1% late payment penalty on the day after the due date. We'll charge a further 4% penalty if there's still an amount of unpaid tax (including penalties) 7 days after the due date. Interest and late payment penalties are not charged on outstanding amounts of $100 or less. Arrangements If you're unable to pay your tax by the due date, please call us. We'll look at your options, which may include an instalment arrangement, depending on your circumstances. Arrangements can be agreed on, before or after the due date for payment.

If you are self-employed though you may need to pay tax on the payment – refer to ‘Grants and relief payments (for businesses)’ below.

If the payment is for lost trading stock (livestock, sales goods) or consumables (hay, raw materials) or for loss of income or profits, it is also taxable income for income tax purposes. If the payment is for depreciable capital assets (barns, sheds, manufacturing plant, kilns) the insurance amount is generally required to be accounted for by being offset against associated costs such as repairs and/or through adjustments to the tax book value of the property which may reduce future depreciation claims or give rise to depreciation recovery.

IR546 April 2021 GST plus Working out specific GST issues GST PLUS2 About this guide 3 Part 1 - Adjustments 4 Part 2 - Exempt supplies 5 Part 3 - Zero-rated supplies 7 Part 4 - Special supplies 11 Part 5 - GST and koha 15 Part 6 - Further GST rate change adjustments 16 How to contact Inland Revenue 17 Inland Revenue’s services 18 Contents 3 If you're reading this guide, you'll be familiar with: • accounting bases • filing frequencies • completing and filing GST returns • making adjustments • dealing with straightforward exemptions • winding up your business. This guide covers a number of infrequent and/or complex GST issues which will only apply to a limited number of registered persons, or will only occur under certain conditions. There may still be some situations we have not covered here. For more help: • go to our website ird.govt.nz/gst • read our GST Guide - IR375 • call us on 0800 377 776. About this guide GST PLUS4 Change of accounting basis You may want to change your GST accounting basis for a number of reasons. Make sure you are eligible to use the accounting basis you want to change to. • Log into myIR, and go to your GST account • Select “I want to’ ... more • Select ‘Update GST account details’ • Select the account type you want to change to. We’ll contact you within 15 working days to let you know the date the change comes into effect. You’ll need to make adjustments in your next GST return for any outstanding debtors and creditors: If you file your GST returns in myIR, fill in the debit adjustments and credit adjustments boxes. If you file by paper use the GST adjustments calculation sheet - IR372 to calculate your adjustments. Fill in the ‘Change of accounting basis’ boxes then copy the figures into boxes 9 and 13 of your GST return. Here's what to do if you're changing: • from payments to invoice When GST on debtors is more than GST on creditors, you must pay the difference. Include the amount in the total adjustments in Box 9 of your return. If GST on creditors is higher, you'll get a credit for the GST, so include the difference in the total credit adjustments in Box 13 of your return. Note: For an entity in receivership or liquidation, the liquidator, receiver or adminstrator can not change the accounting basis from payments to invoice. • from payments to hybrid Calculate the GST on outstanding debtors and include the amount in the total adjustments in Box 9 of your return. • from invoice to payments If GST on debtors is greater than GST on creditors, you'll get a credit for the difference. Include the amount in the total credit adjustments in Box 13 of your return. When the GST on creditors is higher, you must pay the difference. Include it in the total adjustments in Box 9 of your return. • from invoice to hybrid Calculate the GST on the amount owed to creditors and include it in the total adjustments in Box 9 of your return. Part 1 - Adjustments • from hybrid to payments Calculate the GST on outstanding debtors and include it in the total credit adjustments in Box 13 of your return. • from hybrid to invoice Calculate the GST on the amount owed to creditors and include it in the total credit adjustments in Box 13 of your return. Assets kept after you cease to be registered If you cancel your GST registration but keep assets from your taxable activity, you must include the value of those assets in your final GST return. The adjustment amount is 3 / 23 of the open (current) market value of the assets you've kept. For assets bought before 1 October 1986, the value will be the lesser of the cost price and the open market value. Show the value of the asset on your IR372 calculation sheet and include it in the total adjustments in Box 9 of your final GST return. You must return the GST on the value of the asset regardless of your accounting basis. You will not need to return the GST on the asset in the future. It does not matter what you do with the assets after you've filed your final return. Example Charlie is registered for GST and runs a taxi business. He retired on 30 November and kept his taxi for personal use. The value of the vehicle based on current market value is $17,250. In his final GST return he included 3 / 23 of $17,250 ($2,250) in the total adjustments in Box 9, having transferred this amount from his IR372 calculation sheet. Where you retain assets which were used mainly for business purposes and you made private use adjustments for them, you do not need to make an apportionment. You still calculate GST on the market value. If the retained assets were used principally for private purposes, and adjustments were made for the business use, you do not account for GST. Here, the value of the asset does not need to be included in your final return when you cease to be registered. 5 Exempt supplies are goods and services which are not subject to GST. You do not include these supplies in your GST return. Donated goods-services If a non-profit body has goods or services donated to it and later sells them, it can not charge GST on the sale. Example A car dealer gives a church a car. The church uses the car for two years before selling it. The sale of the car is exempt. A non-profit body can not claim a GST credit for expenses involved in supplying donated goods and services. For example, a charity that runs an opportunity shop selling only donated clothing can not claim GST credits on the shop expenses, such as rates, electricity or maintenance. If this was the charity’s only activity, it would not even register for GST. However, if it also sells purchased goods, a GST credit may be claimed on the expenses that directly relate to those goods. All other expenses must be apportioned between the exempt and taxable supply use. For more information read our Charitable and donee organisations - IR255 guide. Financial services These include: • paying or collecting any amount of interest • mortgages and other loans • bank fees • securities such as stocks and shares • providing credit under a credit contract • exchanging currency (eg, changing US$ into NZ$) • arranging or agreeing to do any of the above (eg, mortgage broking) • financial options • provision or transfer of ownership of a financial option • deliverable future contracts • non-deliverable future contracts. For more information see our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB), Vol 16, No 10 (November 2004). Financial planning fees cover The various types of fees charged by financial advisers for financial planning services they provide. Financial planning fees subject to GST Services relating to initial planning fees, monitoring fees, evaluation fees and replanning fees. Part 2 - Exempt supplies Financial planning fees not subject to GST Services relating to implementation fees, administration fees and switching fees exempt from GST. For more information see Tax Information Bulletin, Vol 13, No 7 (July 2001). Renting a residential dwelling GST cannot be charged on the rent for a residential dwelling. A landlord cannot claim any GST on dwelling expenses, such as maintenance, rates and insurance. If a residential dwelling is sold as part of a taxable activity, and it was rented for at least 5 years beforehand, the sale is an exempt supply. If a property developer acquires a property for the principal purpose of making a taxable supply and then subsequently rents the property out, a change-of-use adjustment may be required. Residential accommodation under a head lease A tenant, the head lessee, has overall responsibility as set out in the lease with the landlord. This type of lease would most likely exist for a large multi-tenanted building. The supply of residential property for lease under a head lease is an exempt supply, if the property is to be used for the principal purpose of residential accommodation, unless all the following apply: • the supplier and recipient agree the exemption does not apply • the supply was made under a lease entered into before 16 May 2000 • previous supplies were treated as taxable. Penalty interest Interest charged on overdue accounts is treated as an exempt supply. For example, if you sell goods to another supplier on a 30, 60 or 90 day account basis and that account becomes overdue, any penalty interest chargeable on the non-payment should not be included in your GST return. Fines and penalties imposed for an offence created by statute are not subject to GST. For example, parking penalties imposed by the court as fines or by local authorities as infringement fees are punishments for offences against the Transport Act 1962. These are not liable for GST. GST PLUS6 Supply of fine metals The sale of fine metal by a dealer, or anyone importing fine metal is an exempt supply. The exception is when newly-refined fine metal is supplied by a refiner to a dealer as an investment item, then it is a zero-rated supply. Fine metal is any form of: • gold with a fineness of not less than 99.5% • silver with a fineness of not less than 99.9% • platinum with a fineness of not less than 99%. 7 Zero-rated supplies are supplies that are not subject to GST in certain situations. A rate of 0% applies to these supplies. Copyrights and patents Services relating to copyrights, patents and similar property, which apply outside New Zealand are zero-rated. Example A New Zealand publishing company has the copyright on a New Zealand author's book. The company sells the overseas copyright to another New Zealand company. Because the other company will be publishing and selling the book overseas (performing a service), the fee for the right is zero-rated. Transport of household goods in NZ Transport of household goods in New Zealand is zero-rated if: • the services are supplied to a non-resident outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed • the goods are entered for home consumption under the Customs and Excise Act 1996 • the arrangement for the services were made before the goods are entered, and • the services are expected to be completed within 28 days of the entry of the goods. Duty-free goods Goods purchased from duty-free shops by international travellers are zero-rated when a retailer: • sells goods to a tourist and arranges to send the items overseas to them • arranges to send the items to an overseas customer • arranges to send goods to the airport for a traveller to pick up at the time of departure. Goods sold by duty-free shops that are licensed as export warehouses and that operate within the Customs processing area at international airports are also zero-rated, although GST may be payable to Customs upon entry to New Zealand. Exported vessels (boats and aircrafts) Vessels purchased that are capable of being exported from New Zealand under their own power can be zero-rated. This includes: • goods that are incorporated into or used up as part of servicing a boat or aircraft being exported • services provided directly in connection with an exported boat or aircraft. Part 3 - Zero-rated supplies Exported goods Exported goods are goods that you export, or are going to export in your name, qualify for zero-rating. Exported goods include: • items valued at less than $1,000 that do not need an export entry if you can prove you have exported them or will do so • stores supplied to aircraft and ships for use outside New Zealand. Timeframe for exporting If you have entered goods for export they must be exported within 28 days of the time of supply, unless we have agreed to an extension. Aircraft and boats exported from New Zealand under their own power can be zero-rated if exported within 60 days of the recipient taking possession and full documentation is provided to us. Goods that were to be exported but are destroyed, die or cease to exist owing to circumstances outside the control of both the supplier and recipient, will be zero-rated. First sale - refined metal When newly-refined fine metal (gold, silver, platinum) is supplied by a refiner to a dealer as an investment item, it is a zero-rated supply. Goods not in NZ at the time of supply Goods located outside New Zealand, which are not going to be imported into New Zealand, are zero-rated. Services performed outside New Zealand Services performed outside New Zealand are zero-rated. For example, if a NZ singer performs overseas, they will charge GST at 0%. Remote services supplied from outside New Zealand Non-resident businesses will not be required to charge and return GST on remote services, including online services, supplied to New Zealand GST-registered businesses, nor will they be required to provide tax invoices. However the non- resident business will be able to treat the supply as zero-rated, taxed at 0%. This may allow the non-resident business to claim back New Zealand GST on the costs incurred in making zero- rated supplies to GST-registered businesses. GST PLUS8 If you receive a zero-rated remote service from a non-resident business you may need to make an adjustment if you use the service for something other than your taxable activity. If you estimate when you acquire the service that you'll use it for less than 95% in your taxable activity, or discover at the end of a later adjustment period that your actual use of the service in your taxable activity has been less than 95%, you'll need to adjust for the GST component of the non-taxable use, as if you'd charged GST on the supply. Services relating to goods to be exported Services performed directly in connection with goods that are, or will be, entered for export are zero-rated. Example A New Zealand fruit grower exports 1,000 crates of fruit. The offshore recipient wants to ensure the quality of the fruit. He contracts a New Zealand horticultural firm to inspect the fruit independently and prepare a report. This service is zero-rated. Services relating to portable personal property Information services provided directly in connection with portable personal property are zero-rated. Example Electronic equipment is sent to New Zealand from Germany for testing. The test results are collected, analysed and sent back to Germany. These services are zero-rated. Services supplied to non-residents outside New Zealand Services are zero-rated when supplied to a non-resident who is outside New Zealand when the service is supplied. Example Legal advice given to a person living in Australia by a lawyer who is resident in New Zealand is zero-rated. Services zero-rated but carried out in New Zealand Land outside New Zealand Services connected directly with land or buildings located outside New Zealand, eg, architectural, real estate and legal services, are zero-rated. Example A New Zealand architect designs a building to be constructed on an overseas property for an overseas client. The charge for this service is zero-rated. Goods outside New Zealand Zero-rating applies to services carried out directly in connection with goods situated outside New Zealand. Example A New Zealand insurance company gives cover to a car located outside New Zealand. The premiums are zero-rated. Some financial services Supplies of financial intermediation services, for example, for deposit-taking intermediation and brokerage services may be zero-rated to recipients if: • they are registered for GST • 75% or more of their supplies in a 12-month period are taxable supplies. Supplies to recipients who do not meet these criteria must be treated as exempt supplies. To zero-rate these supplies you must make an election. Inland Revenue Significant Enterprises PO Box 2198 Wellington For more information about the zero-rating of financial services see GST guidelines for working with the zero-rating rules for financial services in our Tax Information Bulletin. Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 16, No 10 (November 2004) Some imported services Since 1 January 2005, it's been a requirement to charge and return GST on any services you import into New Zealand. These can include services you acquire while you're outside New Zealand. But, if these services can only take place outside New Zealand, they may be zero-rated, except for services which are intangible in nature. Specialised tools New Zealand manufacturers can zero-rate income from tools used to manufacture goods for export, if the tools are: • used in New Zealand solely for the exported good • supplied to a non-GST registered non-resident. Tools include jigs, patterns, templates, dies, punches and similar machine tools. The tools do not have to be exported with the goods to be zero- rated. Refer to the Zero-rating of tooling costs to non-residents - IR589. 9 Land transactions A land transaction must be zero-rated when made by a GST- registered person, if the supply wholly or partly includes land, and: • is made to another registered person • the recipient acquires the goods with the intention of using them for making taxable supplies • it is not intended to be used as a principal place of residence by the recipient or a relative of the recipient. All these conditions must be satisfied at the time of settlement of the transaction. If any of them are not satisfied at the time of settlement, the supply must be taxed at 15%. Leases for dwellings and most commercial leases are excluded from this definition. For more information about the zero-rating of land transactions see our Interpretation Statement 17/08. Land acquired by non-profit body Land that is acquired by a non-profit body in New Zealand may be zero-rated if it’s used for making taxable supplies. Sale of going concern A sale of a going concern by one registered person to another registered person is zero-rated. The sale is also zero-rated when only part of a taxable activity (able to operate separately) is sold as a going concern. To be a going concern, the sale must meet the following criteria: • It must be the supply of the whole or stand-alone part of a taxable activity, from one registered person to another. • It must be the supply of all the goods and services necessary for the continued operation of the activity. • Both parties must agree that there is a supply of a going concern, and record this agreement in a document. • Both parties must intend that the activity is capable of being carried on as a going concern by the purchaser. • The business must be a going concern at the time of supply and carried on up to the time of the transfer to the purcha s er. For example, Paul sells his dairy farm, including land, herd, all buildings and machinery to another GST-registered farmer. This sale is sale of a going concern. If he had sold the land and building but kept the machinery and the herd, it would not be a going concern. The sale of the land and buildings may still be zero-rated. Supplies to foreign-based pleasure craft Zero-rating applies to: • Goods supplied for use on a foreign-based pleasure craft that cause or enable the craft to sail, or goods that ensure the safety of passengers and crew. This applies to foreign- based pleasure craft that are in New Zealand under a temporary import entry issued by the New Zealand Customs Service (Customs) • The supply of consumable stores for use outside New Zealand on foreign-based pleasure craft departing New Zealand. The zero-rating applies to the final provisioning of consumable stores. Foreign-based pleasure craft are defined as those pleasure craft in New Zealand as temporary imports under Customs legislation. Consumable stores are goods that passengers and crew on board intend to consume, and those necessary to operate or maintain the pleasure craft, including fuel and lubricants but excluding spare parts and equipment. Before zero-rating, a supplier of maritime goods and consumable stores must be satisfied that the goods and stores are for a foreign-based pleasure craft, and that the craft is departing New Zealand. Goods and services - temporary imports The most common services are repairs and maintenance. If you use materials to repair a temporary import and those materials become an integral part of that import, those materials are zero-rated. Similarly, if the repair materials become worthless for anything else after the repair job, they are zero- rated. Anyone supplying goods or services to a temporary import must keep a copy of the Temporary Import Entry form issued by Customs. For example, a New Zealand-owned boat that normally operates in the Cook Islands is put into dry dock in New Zealand for repairs. Any services involved in the repair would be zero-rated if the boat is temporarily imported. GST PLUS10 Transport of goods to and from New Zealand Zero-rated services include the international journey, and any transport within New Zealand (including loading and unloading costs), as long as it's part of the international transport and is supplied by the same person or agent. These other services in relation to international transportation are also zero-rated: • insuring or arranging insurance • arranging the transport. Transport of people to and from NZ Zero-rating applies to the transport of passengers, including the international journey and any air travel within New Zealand if it is: • part of the international carriage • booked at the same time as the international journey • provided through the same agent or supplier. For example, Kate buys a single air ticket for flights from Napier to Auckland, then on to Perth. GST is not charged on either flight as the travel is a contract for international carriage. 11 Special supplies are supplies that are different from the normal business sales or purchases. Agents Special rules apply if a New Zealand agent who is registered for GST acts on behalf of a non-resident principal who is outside New Zealand, and not registered for GST. New Zealand agent buying supplies for a non- resident principal The agent may, in certain circumstances, claim GST incurred when importing or exporting goods to or from New Zealand or arranging transportation. Non-resident principal contracts services agent to sell and distribute their goods In some cases a non-resident, non-registered principal may wish to sell goods in New Zealand but does not want to have a place of business here. They may contract the services of an agent to sell and distribute their goods. If the New Zealand GST-registered agent and the principal agree, the agent will be responsible for returning GST on the sale of the goods rather than the non-resident. The agent will be able to claim GST incurred when importing the goods into New Zealand. Art gallery A non-resident art gallery decides to sell several pieces of art in New Zealand. The gallery arranges for a GST-registered agent in New Zealand to carry out the sale. The agent agrees to act as the supplier and importer of the artwork, rather than the art gallery. The agent may claim for any GST paid to import the goods and is responsible for charging GST on the sale of the artwork in New Zealand. Coin and token-operated machines These rules do not apply to gaming machines. Coin-operated machines If you supply goods or services through any coin-operated device or machine, eg, a video game, snack machine or parking meter, you must account for the total value of the coins removed from the machine. Include the amount in the return that covers the date you removed the coins. Token-operated machines If you supply goods or services through a token-operated device or machine, you account for GST on the tokens in the same way as other tokens, stamps or vouchers - as a supply when the customer buys them. If you receive business goods or services through a coin or token-operated machine, you may claim a GST credit in the period you paid the money. Part 4 - Special supplies Exported secondhand goods If you claim a GST input credit for secondhand goods you bought and those goods are going to be exported, the full amount of the goods can be zero-rated if you meet these two conditions before the goods are entered for export: • the goods must leave New Zealand within 28 days of the time of supply, and • the recipient must provide a declaration (eg, in the sale and purchase agreement or other sales document) at or before the time of supply that neither they nor an associated person will cause the goods to be re-imported to New Zealand in the same condition in which they were exported. If you do not meet both these conditions, you must account for the GST input credit you've claimed by adding this back in Box 9. It does not matter which accounting basis you use - you must include these details in your return: • the sale or invoiced amount of the sale in Box 5 • the same amount as zero-rated supplies in Box 6, as long as you hold evidence of export • 3 / 23 of the full purchase price of the exported secondhand goods in Box 9 if the two requirements listed above are not met. Example Secondhand dealer, Tran, buys antique pieces for $405 and $515 from a non-registered person and claims 3 / 23 of these amounts, totalling $120. He sells them to an Australian company for $2,200. The antiques leave New Zealand within 28 days of Tran purchasing them, and a declaration is signed by the Australian purchaser that neither they, nor an associated person will re-import the goods into New Zealand. As the supply is zero- rated, GST is charged at the rate of 0%. Tran shows the following in his return: • $2,200 in total sales in Box 5 $2,200 in zero-rated supplies in Box 6. Costs in raising capital funds You can claim for GST input tax incurred on supplies of financial services made to raise funds intended for expenditure in your taxable activity, to the extent that the capital funds your taxable activity. It does not apply to persons who principally make supplies of financial services. Example A building company sells shares to purchase a development property that will be 80% commercial and 20% residential incurs $6900 (including GST of $900) in expenses to sell the shares. The company claims an input tax deduction of $720 (80% GST for the commercial property). This is subject to further adjustment should the estimated use differ from the actual use. GST PLUS12 Summary table The following table sets out the different types of emissions units transactions and their GST treatment.

The supply of emissions units made under the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) or the Permanent Forest Sink Initiative (PFSI) is also zero-rated. Standard GST rules will still apply to the supply of units such as fuel costs created in the normal course of a business. Post-1989 forest land owners/permanent forest sink initiative (PFSI) participants If you receive allocations of emissions units under post-1989 forest ownership or a PFSI, you make a supply of carbon removal services as consideration for the units. Include these services as zero-rated supplies in your GST returns. If an unincorporated body receives an allocation of units or if multiple legal owners receive an allocation from one NZ Emissions Unit Register (NZEUR) holding account, the GST-registered body/group makes the supply to the Crown. Individuals in the allocation group do not make or receive a supply. 13 Foreign currency payments If you are paid for goods or services in a foreign currency, convert the amount to New Zealand dollars using the exchange rate for the date of the GST time of supply. To claim a GST credit you must hold a tax invoice in New Zealand currency. GST on imported services - reverse charge When you import services from a non-resident supplier you usually will not be charged GST if you let them know you're also GST registered. However, if you then use some or all of those services for something other than your taxable activity, you'll need to account for the GST on the non-taxable use. You add GST to the price of the services you've received, and include it as income in your GST return. This is called a "reverse charge". If you were charged GST at the rate of 0% ("zero-rated") you will need to make an adjustment if you use the services for non-taxable use. When you acquire the services, if you estimate your taxable use of the services will be less than 95% of total use, then you'll be treated as if you supplied the services yourself in the course of your taxable activity. You'll need to add GST to the cost of those services, and include them in your GST return. You'll also be able to claim as an expense in your GST return the GST-inclusive cost of the imported services, in proportion to your estimate of their taxable use. You'll also need to account for the GST reverse charge on imported services if you find at the end of an adjustment period that your taxable use of an imported service was less than 95%. This is also done by adding GST to the cost of the service and including it in the relevant GST return. You will also claim as an expense the GST-inclusive cost in proportion to your actual taxable use. Example Melissa is a GST-registered self-employed publicist. She purchases a graphics software package from a non-resident supplier for $400, and because she identifies herself as GST registered she is not charged GST on the purchase. She estimates she'll use the software 50% for her business and 50% for home use. Under the reverse charge rule, Melissa is treated as supplying the software package to herself for $460 ($400 plus $60 GST). She puts that amount as income on her GST return. However, she can also claim half of that amount as an expense, to reflect her business use of the software. She does this by putting $230 ($200 plus $30 GST) as an expense in the same GST return. For information about GST on supplies of remote services see Tax Information Bulletin Vol 28, No 6 (July 2016). Lotteries and other games of chance If you run raffles, lotteries, or other games of chance, you must account for the proceeds of the lottery (eg, total sales of tickets or cards) less the total amount of cash prizes. Example Total proceeds of a raffle were $1,070 (535 tickets at $2 each). Cash prizes were: 1st $ 500 2nd $ 200 3rd $ 100 Total $ 800 Total proceeds $ 1,070 Cash prizes $ 800 Difference $ 270 You must include $270 in Box 5 of the return for the taxable period covering the date the raffle was drawn. If one raffle has a number of draws, account for the GST in the return covering the date of the first draw. You can claim GST for the cost of non-cash prizes in the normal way. Non-resident businesses and GST The GST rules for non-residents depend on the circumstances of the business. Non-resident GST business claimants Non-resident businesses that do not carry out a taxable activity in New Zealand, but receive goods or services here, may be able to register for and claim GST. Non-resident businesses supplying remote services Non-resident businesses that supply remote services, including online services, from outside New Zealand to customers resident in New Zealand may be required to register for GST if they meet certain conditions. For full details go to ird.govt.nz/international-tax GST PLUS14 GST on assets sold by not for profits Generally, GST input credits can be claimed for the purchase of an asset or for expenses that include GST relating to that asset. Where input credits are claimed, the asset will be considered part of the GST activity. In these situations, GST output tax will be payable on the disposal of the asset or an equivalent event (eg an insurance pay-out in the event of a fire). From 1 April 2019 there will be a 24-month transition period that a not for profit can elect to remove an asset from their GST base where it is not part of the taxable activity. Any GST input credits claimed for the asset will need to be repaid. The election will need to provide details of the asset, calculation of input credits being repaid and period of election. Elections should be sent to Charities.queries@ird.govt.nz 15 Part 5 - GST and koha If your koha is an unconditional gift you do not have to pay GST on it. An unconditional gift is a voluntary payment to a non profit body that does not benefit the payer or giver in the form of goods or services. If the koha, such as payments, goods or services are not an unconditional gift they will be liable for GST. Deciding if your koha is liable for GST Using the unconditional gift rule will let you know whether your koha is liable for GST. To help you decide, we’ve added some examples below. They’re based on a non profit marae registered for GST. GST on marae member payments When a marae member gives money, goods or a service (koha) to their marae and expects nothing in return, then it is not subject to GST or liable for income tax. Types of payments not taxed are: • money given to bereaved family or committee at a tangihanga or hura kōhatu • money given to a married couple or committee at a mārena • koha given to a marae committee to assist in paying for a building house or church • visitors on a marae giving a collection to donate to the marae committee Types of payments that must be taxed are: • a government department giving payment on a marae • tourists given a tour on a marae for a fee • fund raising activities by marae committee • a marae building is made available for a function in exchange for koha. Koha given to the tangata whenua A group of people arrange to stay on your marae for a couple of nights at no charge by your marae. The group gives a koha to the tangata whenua at the pōwhiri. The koha is an unconditional gift and is not liable for GST. It’s unconditional because the payment was voluntary and not given for goods or services. Staff workshop on your marae A company holds a two-day staff workshop for thirty people on your marae. You charge a fee of $50 per person per day. You must charge GST, because the money is paid for the goods and services supplied by you. You can claim GST on all goods and services you purchase to host this workshop. Participants give a koha after staff workshop After the workshop (in the example above) some of the participants give a koha to you in appreciation of the hospitality shown. As this koha is not for goods and services you have supplied and gives no direct benefit to the payers/giver, it is an unconditional gift and not liable for GST. If your marae is not registered for GST, it cannot charge GST for any goods and services they supplied and cannot claim GST back on goods and services they pay for. GST PLUS16 Part 6 - Further GST rate change adjustments Adjustments for finance lease payments The supplier (lessor) of goods under a finance lease is able to elect for the GST rate on payments made after 1 October 2010 to remain at the rate of 12.5%, provided all these conditions are met: • The term of the finance lease began before 1 October 2010 and ends on or after 1 October 2010. • The term of the finance lease is less than or equal to five years. • The lessor advised the purchaser no later than 31 October 2010 that the GST rate on payments after 1 October 2010 would remain at 12.5%. If you make or receive payments for a finance lease after 1 October 2010 that have GST included at 12.5%, you need to account for these as an adjustment in the GST return for the period in which the payment is made or received. The GST component of the payment can be calculated by dividing the amount of the payment by 9. If you are making the payment, include this amount as an “other” adjustment in the bottom part of your GST adjustments calculation sheet - IR372. If you are receiving the payment, include this amount as an “other” adjustment in the top part of your GST adjustments calculation sheet - IR372. A finance lease eligible to have payments continue at the GST rate of 12.5% must have met the following criteria: • Periodic payments are made during the term of the agreement. • Part of the amount payable under the agreement is towards credit (interest) under a credit contract. • If the agreement were to end early, the final amount of GST calculated for the supply of goods would be calculated on the basis that the amount paid towards the credit (interest) had decreased with each periodic payment. Adjustments for qualifying supplies In your GST return that covered 30 September 2010 you may have made a GST rate change adjustment. The GST rate change adjustment was needed for any “qualifying supplies” that had GST charged at the 12.5% rate but wouldn’t be accounted for until after 1 October 2010. Your qualifying supplies depended on your accounting basis. Payments (or cash) basis Qualifying supplies were all goods and services: • bought and invoiced on or before 30 September 2010, where full payment was not made by 30 September 2010 • sold and invoiced on or before 30 September 2010, where full payment was not made by 30 September 2010. Invoice basis Qualifying supplies: • are any secondhand goods bought from a non-GST- registered person on or before 30 September 2010, where full payment wasn’t received by 30 September 2010 • didn’t include goods or services you’ve sold. Hybrid basis Qualifying supplies: • are all goods and services bought on or before 30 September 2010, where full payment wasn’t received by 30 September 2010 • didn’t include goods or services you’ve sold. The amount of each qualifying supply was the amount unpaid by 30 September 2010 and not written off as a bad debt by that date. Zero-rated or exempt supplies were not included in your qualifying supplies. If, after making a GST rate change adjustment, you either write off a qualifying supply as a bad debt, or a credit or debit note is issued in relation to a qualifying supply, a further adjustment will be required. Bad debts If you write off a qualifying supply that you included in your GST rate change adjustment, calculate your further GST rate change adjustment by dividing the amount written off as a bad debt by 51.75. The result is the amount of GST payable. Include this amount as an “other” adjustment in the top part of your GST adjustments calculation sheet - IR372. Debit/credit notes If you issue or receive a credit or debit note for a qualifying supply you’ve already included in your GST rate adjustment, calculate your further GST rate change adjustment like this: • Subtract from the GST-inclusive price on the original tax invoice the GST-inclusive price on the new debit or credit note. • Divide the result by 51.75. If the result is a positive amount, you have GST to pay. Include this amount as an “other” adjustment in the top part of your GST adjustments calculation sheet - IR372. If the result is a negative amount, you have a GST credit. Include this amount as an “other” adjustment in the bottom part of your GST adjustments calculation sheet - IR372. 17 How to contact Inland Revenue How to get our forms and guides You can get copies of our forms and guides at ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Need to speak with us?

The adjustment amount is 3 / 23 of the open (current) market value of the assets you've kept. For assets bought before 1 October 1986, the value will be the lesser of the cost price and the open market value. Show the value of the asset on your IR372 calculation sheet and include it in the total adjustments in Box 9 of your final GST return. You must return the GST on the value of the asset regardless of your accounting basis. You will not need to return the GST on the asset in the future. It does not matter what you do with the assets after you've filed your final return. Example Charlie is registered for GST and runs a taxi business. He retired on 30 November and kept his taxi for personal use. The value of the vehicle based on current market value is $17,250. In his final GST return he included 3 / 23 of $17,250 ($2,250) in the total adjustments in Box 9, having transferred this amount from his IR372 calculation sheet. Where you retain assets which were used mainly for business purposes and you made private use adjustments for them, you do not need to make an apportionment. You still calculate GST on the market value. If the retained assets were used principally for private purposes, and adjustments were made for the business use, you do not account for GST. Here, the value of the asset does not need to be included in your final return when you cease to be registered. 5 Exempt supplies are goods and services which are not subject to GST. You do not include these supplies in your GST return. Donated goods-services If a non-profit body has goods or services donated to it and later sells them, it can not charge GST on the sale. Example A car dealer gives a church a car. The church uses the car for two years before selling it. The sale of the car is exempt. A non-profit body can not claim a GST credit for expenses involved in supplying donated goods and services. For example, a charity that runs an opportunity shop selling only donated clothing can not claim GST credits on the shop expenses, such as rates, electricity or maintenance. If this was the charity’s only activity, it would not even register for GST. However, if it also sells purchased goods, a GST credit may be claimed on the expenses that directly relate to those goods. All other expenses must be apportioned between the exempt and taxable supply use. For more information read our Charitable and donee organisations - IR255 guide. Financial services These include: • paying or collecting any amount of interest • mortgages and other loans • bank fees • securities such as stocks and shares • providing credit under a credit contract • exchanging currency (eg, changing US$ into NZ$) • arranging or agreeing to do any of the above (eg, mortgage broking) • financial options • provision or transfer of ownership of a financial option • deliverable future contracts • non-deliverable future contracts. For more information see our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB), Vol 16, No 10 (November 2004). Financial planning fees cover The various types of fees charged by financial advisers for financial planning services they provide. Financial planning fees subject to GST Services relating to initial planning fees, monitoring fees, evaluation fees and replanning fees. Part 2 - Exempt supplies Financial planning fees not subject to GST Services relating to implementation fees, administration fees and switching fees exempt from GST. For more information see Tax Information Bulletin, Vol 13, No 7 (July 2001). Renting a residential dwelling GST cannot be charged on the rent for a residential dwelling. A landlord cannot claim any GST on dwelling expenses, such as maintenance, rates and insurance. If a residential dwelling is sold as part of a taxable activity, and it was rented for at least 5 years beforehand, the sale is an exempt supply. If a property developer acquires a property for the principal purpose of making a taxable supply and then subsequently rents the property out, a change-of-use adjustment may be required. Residential accommodation under a head lease A tenant, the head lessee, has overall responsibility as set out in the lease with the landlord. This type of lease would most likely exist for a large multi-tenanted building. The supply of residential property for lease under a head lease is an exempt supply, if the property is to be used for the principal purpose of residential accommodation, unless all the following apply: • the supplier and recipient agree the exemption does not apply • the supply was made under a lease entered into before 16 May 2000 • previous supplies were treated as taxable. Penalty interest Interest charged on overdue accounts is treated as an exempt supply. For example, if you sell goods to another supplier on a 30, 60 or 90 day account basis and that account becomes overdue, any penalty interest chargeable on the non-payment should not be included in your GST return. Fines and penalties imposed for an offence created by statute are not subject to GST. For example, parking penalties imposed by the court as fines or by local authorities as infringement fees are punishments for offences against the Transport Act 1962. These are not liable for GST. GST PLUS6 Supply of fine metals The sale of fine metal by a dealer, or anyone importing fine metal is an exempt supply. The exception is when newly-refined fine metal is supplied by a refiner to a dealer as an investment item, then it is a zero-rated supply. Fine metal is any form of: • gold with a fineness of not less than 99.5% • silver with a fineness of not less than 99.9% • platinum with a fineness of not less than 99%. 7 Zero-rated supplies are supplies that are not subject to GST in certain situations. A rate of 0% applies to these supplies. Copyrights and patents Services relating to copyrights, patents and similar property, which apply outside New Zealand are zero-rated. Example A New Zealand publishing company has the copyright on a New Zealand author's book. The company sells the overseas copyright to another New Zealand company. Because the other company will be publishing and selling the book overseas (performing a service), the fee for the right is zero-rated. Transport of household goods in NZ Transport of household goods in New Zealand is zero-rated if: • the services are supplied to a non-resident outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed • the goods are entered for home consumption under the Customs and Excise Act 1996 • the arrangement for the services were made before the goods are entered, and • the services are expected to be completed within 28 days of the entry of the goods. Duty-free goods Goods purchased from duty-free shops by international travellers are zero-rated when a retailer: • sells goods to a tourist and arranges to send the items overseas to them • arranges to send the items to an overseas customer • arranges to send goods to the airport for a traveller to pick up at the time of departure. Goods sold by duty-free shops that are licensed as export warehouses and that operate within the Customs processing area at international airports are also zero-rated, although GST may be payable to Customs upon entry to New Zealand. Exported vessels (boats and aircrafts) Vessels purchased that are capable of being exported from New Zealand under their own power can be zero-rated. This includes: • goods that are incorporated into or used up as part of servicing a boat or aircraft being exported • services provided directly in connection with an exported boat or aircraft. Part 3 - Zero-rated supplies Exported goods Exported goods are goods that you export, or are going to export in your name, qualify for zero-rating. Exported goods include: • items valued at less than $1,000 that do not need an export entry if you can prove you have exported them or will do so • stores supplied to aircraft and ships for use outside New Zealand. Timeframe for exporting If you have entered goods for export they must be exported within 28 days of the time of supply, unless we have agreed to an extension. Aircraft and boats exported from New Zealand under their own power can be zero-rated if exported within 60 days of the recipient taking possession and full documentation is provided to us. Goods that were to be exported but are destroyed, die or cease to exist owing to circumstances outside the control of both the supplier and recipient, will be zero-rated. First sale - refined metal When newly-refined fine metal (gold, silver, platinum) is supplied by a refiner to a dealer as an investment item, it is a zero-rated supply. Goods not in NZ at the time of supply Goods located outside New Zealand, which are not going to be imported into New Zealand, are zero-rated. Services performed outside New Zealand Services performed outside New Zealand are zero-rated. For example, if a NZ singer performs overseas, they will charge GST at 0%. Remote services supplied from outside New Zealand Non-resident businesses will not be required to charge and return GST on remote services, including online services, supplied to New Zealand GST-registered businesses, nor will they be required to provide tax invoices. However the non- resident business will be able to treat the supply as zero-rated, taxed at 0%. This may allow the non-resident business to claim back New Zealand GST on the costs incurred in making zero- rated supplies to GST-registered businesses. GST PLUS8 If you receive a zero-rated remote service from a non-resident business you may need to make an adjustment if you use the service for something other than your taxable activity. If you estimate when you acquire the service that you'll use it for less than 95% in your taxable activity, or discover at the end of a later adjustment period that your actual use of the service in your taxable activity has been less than 95%, you'll need to adjust for the GST component of the non-taxable use, as if you'd charged GST on the supply. Services relating to goods to be exported Services performed directly in connection with goods that are, or will be, entered for export are zero-rated. Example A New Zealand fruit grower exports 1,000 crates of fruit. The offshore recipient wants to ensure the quality of the fruit. He contracts a New Zealand horticultural firm to inspect the fruit independently and prepare a report. This service is zero-rated. Services relating to portable personal property Information services provided directly in connection with portable personal property are zero-rated. Example Electronic equipment is sent to New Zealand from Germany for testing. The test results are collected, analysed and sent back to Germany. These services are zero-rated. Services supplied to non-residents outside New Zealand Services are zero-rated when supplied to a non-resident who is outside New Zealand when the service is supplied. Example Legal advice given to a person living in Australia by a lawyer who is resident in New Zealand is zero-rated. Services zero-rated but carried out in New Zealand Land outside New Zealand Services connected directly with land or buildings located outside New Zealand, eg, architectural, real estate and legal services, are zero-rated. Example A New Zealand architect designs a building to be constructed on an overseas property for an overseas client. The charge for this service is zero-rated. Goods outside New Zealand Zero-rating applies to services carried out directly in connection with goods situated outside New Zealand. Example A New Zealand insurance company gives cover to a car located outside New Zealand. The premiums are zero-rated. Some financial services Supplies of financial intermediation services, for example, for deposit-taking intermediation and brokerage services may be zero-rated to recipients if: • they are registered for GST • 75% or more of their supplies in a 12-month period are taxable supplies. Supplies to recipients who do not meet these criteria must be treated as exempt supplies. To zero-rate these supplies you must make an election. Inland Revenue Significant Enterprises PO Box 2198 Wellington For more information about the zero-rating of financial services see GST guidelines for working with the zero-rating rules for financial services in our Tax Information Bulletin. Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 16, No 10 (November 2004) Some imported services Since 1 January 2005, it's been a requirement to charge and return GST on any services you import into New Zealand. These can include services you acquire while you're outside New Zealand. But, if these services can only take place outside New Zealand, they may be zero-rated, except for services which are intangible in nature. Specialised tools New Zealand manufacturers can zero-rate income from tools used to manufacture goods for export, if the tools are: • used in New Zealand solely for the exported good • supplied to a non-GST registered non-resident. Tools include jigs, patterns, templates, dies, punches and similar machine tools. The tools do not have to be exported with the goods to be zero- rated. Refer to the Zero-rating of tooling costs to non-residents - IR589. 9 Land transactions A land transaction must be zero-rated when made by a GST- registered person, if the supply wholly or partly includes land, and: • is made to another registered person • the recipient acquires the goods with the intention of using them for making taxable supplies • it is not intended to be used as a principal place of residence by the recipient or a relative of the recipient. All these conditions must be satisfied at the time of settlement of the transaction. If any of them are not satisfied at the time of settlement, the supply must be taxed at 15%. Leases for dwellings and most commercial leases are excluded from this definition. For more information about the zero-rating of land transactions see our Interpretation Statement 17/08. Land acquired by non-profit body Land that is acquired by a non-profit body in New Zealand may be zero-rated if it’s used for making taxable supplies. Sale of going concern A sale of a going concern by one registered person to another registered person is zero-rated. The sale is also zero-rated when only part of a taxable activity (able to operate separately) is sold as a going concern. To be a going concern, the sale must meet the following criteria: • It must be the supply of the whole or stand-alone part of a taxable activity, from one registered person to another. • It must be the supply of all the goods and services necessary for the continued operation of the activity. • Both parties must agree that there is a supply of a going concern, and record this agreement in a document. • Both parties must intend that the activity is capable of being carried on as a going concern by the purchaser. • The business must be a going concern at the time of supply and carried on up to the time of the transfer to the purcha s er. For example, Paul sells his dairy farm, including land, herd, all buildings and machinery to another GST-registered farmer. This sale is sale of a going concern. If he had sold the land and building but kept the machinery and the herd, it would not be a going concern. The sale of the land and buildings may still be zero-rated. Supplies to foreign-based pleasure craft Zero-rating applies to: • Goods supplied for use on a foreign-based pleasure craft that cause or enable the craft to sail, or goods that ensure the safety of passengers and crew. This applies to foreign- based pleasure craft that are in New Zealand under a temporary import entry issued by the New Zealand Customs Service (Customs) • The supply of consumable stores for use outside New Zealand on foreign-based pleasure craft departing New Zealand. The zero-rating applies to the final provisioning of consumable stores. Foreign-based pleasure craft are defined as those pleasure craft in New Zealand as temporary imports under Customs legislation. Consumable stores are goods that passengers and crew on board intend to consume, and those necessary to operate or maintain the pleasure craft, including fuel and lubricants but excluding spare parts and equipment. Before zero-rating, a supplier of maritime goods and consumable stores must be satisfied that the goods and stores are for a foreign-based pleasure craft, and that the craft is departing New Zealand. Goods and services - temporary imports The most common services are repairs and maintenance. If you use materials to repair a temporary import and those materials become an integral part of that import, those materials are zero-rated. Similarly, if the repair materials become worthless for anything else after the repair job, they are zero- rated. Anyone supplying goods or services to a temporary import must keep a copy of the Temporary Import Entry form issued by Customs. For example, a New Zealand-owned boat that normally operates in the Cook Islands is put into dry dock in New Zealand for repairs. Any services involved in the repair would be zero-rated if the boat is temporarily imported. GST PLUS10 Transport of goods to and from New Zealand Zero-rated services include the international journey, and any transport within New Zealand (including loading and unloading costs), as long as it's part of the international transport and is supplied by the same person or agent. These other services in relation to international transportation are also zero-rated: • insuring or arranging insurance • arranging the transport. Transport of people to and from NZ Zero-rating applies to the transport of passengers, including the international journey and any air travel within New Zealand if it is: • part of the international carriage • booked at the same time as the international journey • provided through the same agent or supplier. For example, Kate buys a single air ticket for flights from Napier to Auckland, then on to Perth. GST is not charged on either flight as the travel is a contract for international carriage. 11 Special supplies are supplies that are different from the normal business sales or purchases. Agents Special rules apply if a New Zealand agent who is registered for GST acts on behalf of a non-resident principal who is outside New Zealand, and not registered for GST. New Zealand agent buying supplies for a non- resident principal The agent may, in certain circumstances, claim GST incurred when importing or exporting goods to or from New Zealand or arranging transportation. Non-resident principal contracts services agent to sell and distribute their goods In some cases a non-resident, non-registered principal may wish to sell goods in New Zealand but does not want to have a place of business here. They may contract the services of an agent to sell and distribute their goods. If the New Zealand GST-registered agent and the principal agree, the agent will be responsible for returning GST on the sale of the goods rather than the non-resident. The agent will be able to claim GST incurred when importing the goods into New Zealand. Art gallery A non-resident art gallery decides to sell several pieces of art in New Zealand. The gallery arranges for a GST-registered agent in New Zealand to carry out the sale. The agent agrees to act as the supplier and importer of the artwork, rather than the art gallery. The agent may claim for any GST paid to import the goods and is responsible for charging GST on the sale of the artwork in New Zealand. Coin and token-operated machines These rules do not apply to gaming machines. Coin-operated machines If you supply goods or services through any coin-operated device or machine, eg, a video game, snack machine or parking meter, you must account for the total value of the coins removed from the machine. Include the amount in the return that covers the date you removed the coins. Token-operated machines If you supply goods or services through a token-operated device or machine, you account for GST on the tokens in the same way as other tokens, stamps or vouchers - as a supply when the customer buys them. If you receive business goods or services through a coin or token-operated machine, you may claim a GST credit in the period you paid the money. Part 4 - Special supplies Exported secondhand goods If you claim a GST input credit for secondhand goods you bought and those goods are going to be exported, the full amount of the goods can be zero-rated if you meet these two conditions before the goods are entered for export: • the goods must leave New Zealand within 28 days of the time of supply, and • the recipient must provide a declaration (eg, in the sale and purchase agreement or other sales document) at or before the time of supply that neither they nor an associated person will cause the goods to be re-imported to New Zealand in the same condition in which they were exported. If you do not meet both these conditions, you must account for the GST input credit you've claimed by adding this back in Box 9. It does not matter which accounting basis you use - you must include these details in your return: • the sale or invoiced amount of the sale in Box 5 • the same amount as zero-rated supplies in Box 6, as long as you hold evidence of export • 3 / 23 of the full purchase price of the exported secondhand goods in Box 9 if the two requirements listed above are not met. Example Secondhand dealer, Tran, buys antique pieces for $405 and $515 from a non-registered person and claims 3 / 23 of these amounts, totalling $120. He sells them to an Australian company for $2,200. The antiques leave New Zealand within 28 days of Tran purchasing them, and a declaration is signed by the Australian purchaser that neither they, nor an associated person will re-import the goods into New Zealand. As the supply is zero- rated, GST is charged at the rate of 0%. Tran shows the following in his return: • $2,200 in total sales in Box 5 $2,200 in zero-rated supplies in Box 6. Costs in raising capital funds You can claim for GST input tax incurred on supplies of financial services made to raise funds intended for expenditure in your taxable activity, to the extent that the capital funds your taxable activity. It does not apply to persons who principally make supplies of financial services. Example A building company sells shares to purchase a development property that will be 80% commercial and 20% residential incurs $6900 (including GST of $900) in expenses to sell the shares. The company claims an input tax deduction of $720 (80% GST for the commercial property). This is subject to further adjustment should the estimated use differ from the actual use. GST PLUS12 Summary table The following table sets out the different types of emissions units transactions and their GST treatment.

The supply of emissions units made under the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) or the Permanent Forest Sink Initiative (PFSI) is also zero-rated. Standard GST rules will still apply to the supply of units such as fuel costs created in the normal course of a business. Post-1989 forest land owners/permanent forest sink initiative (PFSI) participants If you receive allocations of emissions units under post-1989 forest ownership or a PFSI, you make a supply of carbon removal services as consideration for the units. Include these services as zero-rated supplies in your GST returns. If an unincorporated body receives an allocation of units or if multiple legal owners receive an allocation from one NZ Emissions Unit Register (NZEUR) holding account, the GST-registered body/group makes the supply to the Crown. Individuals in the allocation group do not make or receive a supply. 13 Foreign currency payments If you are paid for goods or services in a foreign currency, convert the amount to New Zealand dollars using the exchange rate for the date of the GST time of supply. To claim a GST credit you must hold a tax invoice in New Zealand currency. GST on imported services - reverse charge When you import services from a non-resident supplier you usually will not be charged GST if you let them know you're also GST registered. However, if you then use some or all of those services for something other than your taxable activity, you'll need to account for the GST on the non-taxable use. You add GST to the price of the services you've received, and include it as income in your GST return. This is called a "reverse charge". If you were charged GST at the rate of 0% ("zero-rated") you will need to make an adjustment if you use the services for non-taxable use. When you acquire the services, if you estimate your taxable use of the services will be less than 95% of total use, then you'll be treated as if you supplied the services yourself in the course of your taxable activity. You'll need to add GST to the cost of those services, and include them in your GST return. You'll also be able to claim as an expense in your GST return the GST-inclusive cost of the imported services, in proportion to your estimate of their taxable use. You'll also need to account for the GST reverse charge on imported services if you find at the end of an adjustment period that your taxable use of an imported service was less than 95%. This is also done by adding GST to the cost of the service and including it in the relevant GST return. You will also claim as an expense the GST-inclusive cost in proportion to your actual taxable use. Example Melissa is a GST-registered self-employed publicist. She purchases a graphics software package from a non-resident supplier for $400, and because she identifies herself as GST registered she is not charged GST on the purchase. She estimates she'll use the software 50% for her business and 50% for home use. Under the reverse charge rule, Melissa is treated as supplying the software package to herself for $460 ($400 plus $60 GST). She puts that amount as income on her GST return. However, she can also claim half of that amount as an expense, to reflect her business use of the software. She does this by putting $230 ($200 plus $30 GST) as an expense in the same GST return. For information about GST on supplies of remote services see Tax Information Bulletin Vol 28, No 6 (July 2016). Lotteries and other games of chance If you run raffles, lotteries, or other games of chance, you must account for the proceeds of the lottery (eg, total sales of tickets or cards) less the total amount of cash prizes. Example Total proceeds of a raffle were $1,070 (535 tickets at $2 each). Cash prizes were: 1st $ 500 2nd $ 200 3rd $ 100 Total $ 800 Total proceeds $ 1,070 Cash prizes $ 800 Difference $ 270 You must include $270 in Box 5 of the return for the taxable period covering the date the raffle was drawn. If one raffle has a number of draws, account for the GST in the return covering the date of the first draw. You can claim GST for the cost of non-cash prizes in the normal way. Non-resident businesses and GST The GST rules for non-residents depend on the circumstances of the business. Non-resident GST business claimants Non-resident businesses that do not carry out a taxable activity in New Zealand, but receive goods or services here, may be able to register for and claim GST. Non-resident businesses supplying remote services Non-resident businesses that supply remote services, including online services, from outside New Zealand to customers resident in New Zealand may be required to register for GST if they meet certain conditions. For full details go to ird.govt.nz/international-tax GST PLUS14 GST on assets sold by not for profits Generally, GST input credits can be claimed for the purchase of an asset or for expenses that include GST relating to that asset. Where input credits are claimed, the asset will be considered part of the GST activity. In these situations, GST output tax will be payable on the disposal of the asset or an equivalent event (eg an insurance pay-out in the event of a fire). From 1 April 2019 there will be a 24-month transition period that a not for profit can elect to remove an asset from their GST base where it is not part of the taxable activity. Any GST input credits claimed for the asset will need to be repaid. The election will need to provide details of the asset, calculation of input credits being repaid and period of election. Elections should be sent to Charities.queries@ird.govt.nz Telecommunications – mobile roaming services Outbound mobile roaming services Outbound mobile roaming services means mobile roaming services used outside New Zealand by a person with a New Zealand registered mobile device, whose usual mobile network is in New Zealand. These services are subject to GST of 15% Inbound mobile roaming services Inbound mobile roaming services means mobile roaming services used by a non-resident who is in New Zealand and whose, usual mobile network is outside New Zealand. These services are zero-rated for GST if supplied by a resident, or treated as being made outside New Zealand ( and so not subject to GST) if supplied by a non-resident. 15 Part 5 - GST and koha If your koha is an unconditional gift you do not have to pay GST on it. An unconditional gift is a voluntary payment to a non profit body that does not benefit the payer or giver in the form of goods or services. If the koha, such as payments, goods or services are not an unconditional gift they will be liable for GST. Deciding if your koha is liable for GST Using the unconditional gift rule will let you know whether your koha is liable for GST. To help you decide, we’ve added some examples below. They’re based on a non profit marae registered for GST. GST on marae member payments When a marae member gives money, goods or a service (koha) to their marae and expects nothing in return, then it is not subject to GST or liable for income tax. Types of payments not taxed are: • money given to bereaved family or committee at a tangihanga or hura kōhatu • money given to a married couple or committee at a mārena • koha given to a marae committee to assist in paying for a building house or church • visitors on a marae giving a collection to donate to the marae committee Types of payments that must be taxed are: • a government department giving payment on a marae • tourists given a tour on a marae for a fee • fund raising activities by marae committee • a marae building is made available for a function in exchange for koha. Koha given to the tangata whenua A group of people arrange to stay on your marae for a couple of nights at no charge by your marae. The group gives a koha to the tangata whenua at the pōwhiri. The koha is an unconditional gift and is not liable for GST. It’s unconditional because the payment was voluntary and not given for goods or services. Staff workshop on your marae A company holds a two-day staff workshop for thirty people on your marae. You charge a fee of $50 per person per day. You must charge GST, because the money is paid for the goods and services supplied by you. You can claim GST on all goods and services you purchase to host this workshop. Participants give a koha after staff workshop After the workshop (in the example above) some of the participants give a koha to you in appreciation of the hospitality shown. As this koha is not for goods and services you have supplied and gives no direct benefit to the payers/giver, it is an unconditional gift and not liable for GST. If your marae is not registered for GST, it cannot charge GST for any goods and services they supplied and cannot claim GST back on goods and services they pay for. GST PLUS16 Part 6 - Further GST rate change adjustments Adjustments for finance lease payments The supplier (lessor) of goods under a finance lease is able to elect for the GST rate on payments made after 1 October 2010 to remain at the rate of 12.5%, provided all these conditions are met: • The term of the finance lease began before 1 October 2010 and ends on or after 1 October 2010. • The term of the finance lease is less than or equal to five years. • The lessor advised the purchaser no later than 31 October 2010 that the GST rate on payments after 1 October 2010 would remain at 12.5%. If you make or receive payments for a finance lease after 1 October 2010 that have GST included at 12.5%, you need to account for these as an adjustment in the GST return for the period in which the payment is made or received. The GST component of the payment can be calculated by dividing the amount of the payment by 9. If you are making the payment, include this amount as an “other” adjustment in the bottom part of your GST adjustments calculation sheet - IR372. If you are receiving the payment, include this amount as an “other” adjustment in the top part of your GST adjustments calculation sheet - IR372. A finance lease eligible to have payments continue at the GST rate of 12.5% must have met the following criteria: • Periodic payments are made during the term of the agreement. • Part of the amount payable under the agreement is towards credit (interest) under a credit contract. • If the agreement were to end early, the final amount of GST calculated for the supply of goods would be calculated on the basis that the amount paid towards the credit (interest) had decreased with each periodic payment. Adjustments for qualifying supplies In your GST return that covered 30 September 2010 you may have made a GST rate change adjustment. The GST rate change adjustment was needed for any “qualifying supplies” that had GST charged at the 12.5% rate but wouldn’t be accounted for until after 1 October 2010. Your qualifying supplies depended on your accounting basis. Payments (or cash) basis Qualifying supplies were all goods and services: • bought and invoiced on or before 30 September 2010, where full payment was not made by 30 September 2010 • sold and invoiced on or before 30 September 2010, where full payment was not made by 30 September 2010. Invoice basis Qualifying supplies: • are any secondhand goods bought from a non-GST- registered person on or before 30 September 2010, where full payment wasn’t received by 30 September 2010 • didn’t include goods or services you’ve sold. Hybrid basis Qualifying supplies: • are all goods and services bought on or before 30 September 2010, where full payment wasn’t received by 30 September 2010 • didn’t include goods or services you’ve sold. The amount of each qualifying supply was the amount unpaid by 30 September 2010 and not written off as a bad debt by that date. Zero-rated or exempt supplies were not included in your qualifying supplies. If, after making a GST rate change adjustment, you either write off a qualifying supply as a bad debt, or a credit or debit note is issued in relation to a qualifying supply, a further adjustment will be required. Bad debts If you write off a qualifying supply that you included in your GST rate change adjustment, calculate your further GST rate change adjustment by dividing the amount written off as a bad debt by 51.75. The result is the amount of GST payable. Include this amount as an “other” adjustment in the top part of your GST adjustments calculation sheet - IR372. Debit/credit notes If you issue or receive a credit or debit note for a qualifying supply you’ve already included in your GST rate adjustment, calculate your further GST rate change adjustment like this: • Subtract from the GST-inclusive price on the original tax invoice the GST-inclusive price on the new debit or credit note. • Divide the result by 51.75. If the result is a positive amount, you have GST to pay. Include this amount as an “other” adjustment in the top part of your GST adjustments calculation sheet - IR372. If the result is a negative amount, you have a GST credit. Include this amount as an “other” adjustment in the bottom part of your GST adjustments calculation sheet - IR372. 17 How to contact Inland Revenue How to get our forms and guides You can get copies of our forms and guides at ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Need to speak with us?

This guide covers some infrequent and/or complex GST issues which only apply to a limited number of registered persons, or only occur under certain conditions. There may still be some situations we have not covered here. For more help: • go to our website ird.govt.nz/gst • read our GST Guide - IR375 • call us on 0800 377 776. About this guide GST PLUS4 Part 1 - Adjustments Change of accounting basis You may want to change your GST accounting basis to suit your business situation. Make sure you’re eligible to use the accounting basis you want to change to. • In myIR, go to your GST account > More > Manage account > Update GST account details • Select the accounting basis you want to change to. We’ll contact you within 15 working days to confirm the date the change comes into effect. You’ll need to adjust your next GST return for any outstanding debtors and creditors: • For GST returns in myIR, add any debit and/or credit adjustments in the ‘Change of accounting basis’ fields. • For paper returns add in your debit and/or credit adjustments in the ‘Change of accounting basis’ Boxes then copy the figures into Boxes 9 and 13 of your GST return. Making adjustments for debtors and creditors • From payments to invoice If GST on debtors is more than GST on creditors, include a debit adjustment for the difference. myIR GST return > Debit adjustments > Change of accounting basis > net amount. If GST on creditors is more than GST on debtors, include a credit adjustment for the difference. myIR GST return > Credit adjustments > Change of accounting basis > net amount. For paper returns show the net amount you have worked out in either the - Debit adjustments Box 9 or Credit adjustments Box 13. Note: For an entity in receivership or liquidation, the liquidator, receiver or administrator cannot change the accounting basis from payments to invoice. • From payments to hybrid Calculate the GST on debtors. myIR GST return > Debit adjustments > Change of accounting basis > amount.

For paper returns include the credit adjustment in Box 13 of your return. Assets kept after you cancel your GST registration When you cancel your registration, you must make an adjustment in your final GST return to include the value of any assets you keep from your taxable activity. The adjustment amount is 3/23 of the open (current) market value of the assets. For assets bought before 1 October 1986, the value will be the lesser of the cost price and the open market value. If a retained asset has been used for business, and private or exempt use, you must make a debit adjustment based on the percentage of business use, at market value. The adjustment for a mixed-use asset for a property developer will be equivalent to returning GST at full market value, offset by any input tax not already claimed. You must return the GST on the value of the asset regardless of your accounting basis. myIR GST return > Debit adjustment > Assets kept after cancelling registration > amount. For paper returns include the debit adjustment in Box 9 of your return. Once you have made the adjustment, you do not need to return GST on the asset in the future. It does not matter what you do with the assets after you’ve filed your final return. Example Charlie was registered for GST and had a taxi business. He retired on 30 November and kept his taxi for personal use. The value of the vehicle based on current market value was $17,250. In his final GST return he included 3/23 of $17,250 ($2,250) as a debit adjustment for assets kept after cancelling registration. Note: If you do not make an adjustment for an asset you have retained, you will remain liable to pay GST on any future sale or disposal even though you may no longer be GST registered. GST PLUS5 Exempt supplies are goods and services which are not subject to GST. You do not include these supplies in your GST return. Donated goods-services If goods or services are donated to a not-for-profit organisation, they cannot charge GST if they sell them later. Example A car dealer gives a car to a church. The car is used by the church for 2 years before selling it. The sale of the car is exempt. A not-for-profit organisation cannot claim a GST credit for expenses relating to supplying donated goods and services. For example, an opportunity shop charity selling only donated clothing cannot claim GST credits on the shop expenses, such as rates, electricity, or maintenance. If this was the charity’s only activity, it would not even register for GST. However, if the charity also sells purchased goods, GST may be claimed on the expenses directly related to those goods. All other expenses must be apportioned between the exempt and taxable supply use. For more information go to Income tax and GST for not-for- profits Financial services These include: • paying or collecting any amount of interest • mortgages and other loans • bank fees • securities such as stocks and shares • providing credit under a credit contract • exchanging currency (for example, changing US$ into NZ$) • arranging or agreeing to do any of the above (for example, mortgage broking) • financial options • provision or transfer of ownership of a financial option • deliverable future contracts • non-deliverable future contracts. For more information see our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB), Vol 16, No 10 (November 2004). Financial planning fees cover The various types of fees charged by financial advisers for financial planning services they provide. Financial planning fees subject to GST Services relating to initial planning fees, monitoring fees, evaluation fees and replanning fees. Part 2 - Exempt supplies Financial planning fees not subject to GST Services relating to implementation fees, administration fees and switching fees exempt from GST. For more information see Tax Information Bulletin (TIB), Vol 13, No 7 (July 2001). Renting a residential dwelling GST cannot be charged on the rent for a residential dwelling. A landlord cannot claim any GST on dwelling expenses, such as maintenance, rates and insurance. If a residential dwelling is sold as part of a taxable activity, and it was rented for at least 5 years beforehand, the sale is an exempt supply. If a property developer acquires a property for the principal purpose of making a taxable supply and then subsequently rents the property out, a change-of-use adjustment may be required. Residential accommodation under a head lease A tenant, the head lessee, has overall responsibility as set out in the lease with the landlord. This type of lease would most likely exist for a large multi-tenanted building. The supply of residential property for lease under a head lease is an exempt supply, if the property is to be used for the principal purpose of residential accommodation, unless all the following apply: • the supplier and recipient agree the exemption does not apply • the supply was made under a lease entered into before 16 May 2000 • previous supplies were treated as taxable. Penalty interest Interest charges on overdue accounts are treated as exempt supplies. For example, if you sell goods to another supplier on a 30, 60 or 90 day account basis and the account becomes overdue, any penalty interest chargeable on the non-payment should not be included in your GST return. Fines and penalties imposed for an offence created by statute are not subject to GST. For example, parking fines imposed by the court or local authorities as infringement fees are penalties for offences against the Transport Act 1962. GST PLUS6 Supply of fine metals The sale of fine metal by a dealer, or anyone importing fine metal is an exempt supply. The exception is when newly refined fine metal is supplied by a refiner to a dealer as an investment item, then it is a zero-rated supply. Fine metal is any form of: • gold with a fineness of not less than 99.5% • silver with a fineness of not less than 99.9% • platinum with a fineness of not less than 99%. GST PLUS7 Zero-rated supplies are supplies not subject to GST in certain situations. A rate of 0% applies to these supplies. Copyrights and patents Services relating to copyrights, patents, and similar property, which apply outside New Zealand are zero-rated. Example A New Zealand publishing company has the copyright on a New Zealand author's book. The company sells the overseas copyright to another New Zealand company. Because the other company will be publishing and selling the book overseas (performing a service), the fee for the right is zero-rated. Transport of household goods in NZ Transport of household goods in New Zealand is zero-rated if: • the services are supplied to a non-resident outside New Zealand at the time they are performed • the goods are for home consumption under the Customs and Excise Act 1996 • the arrangement for the services is made before the goods enter New Zealand, and • the services are expected to be completed within 28 days of the entry of the goods. Duty-free goods Goods purchased from duty-free shops by international travellers are zero-rated when a retailer: • sells goods to a tourist and arranges to send the items overseas to them • arranges to send the items to an overseas customer • arranges to send goods to the airport for a traveller to pick up at the time of departure. Goods sold by duty-free shops are zero-rated if they are: • licensed as export warehouses, and • operating within the Customs processing area at international airports. GST may be payable to Customs upon entry of goods to New Zealand. Exported vessels (boats and aircrafts) The purchase of vessels capable of being exported from New Zealand under their own power can be zero-rated. This includes: • goods incorporated into or used up as part of servicing a boat or aircraft being exported • services provided directly in connection with an exported boat or aircraft. Part 3 - Zero-rated supplies Exported goods Goods may qualify for zero-rating if they are or going to be exported in your name. Exported goods include: • items not requiring export entry, valued less than $1,000 - you must have proof you have exported or will export them • stores supplied to aircraft and ships for use outside New Zealand. Timeframe for exporting If you have entered goods for export, they must be exported within 28 days of the time of supply, unless we have agreed to an extension. Aircraft and boats can be zero-rated if they are exported: • from New Zealand under their own power within 60 days of the recipient taking possession, and • full documentation is provided to us. Goods that were to be exported but are destroyed, die or cease to exist from circumstances outside the control of both the supplier and recipient, are zero-rated. First sale - refined metal When newly-refined fine metal (gold, silver, platinum) is supplied by a refiner to a dealer as an investment item, it is a zero-rated supply. Goods not in NZ at the time of supply Goods located outside New Zealand, which are not going to be imported into New Zealand, are zero-rated. Services performed outside New Zealand Services performed outside New Zealand are zero-rated. For example, if a NZ singer performs overseas, they will charge GST at 0%. Remote services supplied from outside New Zealand Non-resident businesses are not required to charge and return GST on remote services, including online services, supplied to New Zealand GST-registered businesses. They are also not required to provide taxable supply information. A non-resident business can treat the supply as zero-rated, taxed at 0%, to claim back New Zealand GST on the costs incurred in making zero-rated supplies to GST-registered businesses. GST PLUS8 If you receive a zero-rated remote service from a non-resident business, you may need to make an adjustment if you use the service for something other than your taxable activity. If you estimate an acquired service will be used less than 95% in your taxable activity or discover in a later return period your actual use of the service is less than 95%, you’ll need to adjust GST for the non-taxable use. Work out the GST that would’ve been charged on the service if it was not zero-rated and adjust for the proportion of non-taxable use. Services relating to goods to be exported Services performed directly in connection with goods that are, or will be, entered for export are zero-rated. Example A New Zealand fruit grower exports 1,000 crates of fruit. The offshore recipient wants to ensure the quality of the fruit. He contracts a New Zealand horticultural firm to inspect the fruit independently and prepare a report. This service is zero-rated. Services relating to portable personal property Information services provided directly in connection with portable personal property are zero-rated. Example Electronic equipment is sent to New Zealand from Germany for testing. The test results are collected, analysed and sent back to Germany. These services are zero-rated. Services supplied to non-residents outside New Zealand Services are zero-rated when supplied to a non-resident who is outside New Zealand when the service is supplied. Example Legal advice given to a person living in Australia by a lawyer who is resident in New Zealand is zero-rated. Services zero-rated but carried out in New Zealand Land outside New Zealand Services connected directly with land or buildings located outside New Zealand, for example, architectural, real estate and legal services, are zero-rated. Example A New Zealand architect designs a building to be constructed on an overseas property for an overseas client. The charge for this service is zero-rated. Goods outside New Zealand Zero-rating applies to services carried out directly in connection with goods situated outside New Zealand. Example A New Zealand insurance company gives cover to a car located outside New Zealand. The premiums are zero-rated. Some financial services Supplies of financial intermediation services, for example, for deposit-taking intermediation and brokerage services may be zero-rated to recipients if: • they are registered for GST • 75% or more of their supplies in a 12-month period are taxable supplies. Supplies to recipients who do not meet these criteria must be treated as exempt supplies. You must make an election to zero- rate these supplies. Inland Revenue Significant Enterprises PO Box 2198 Wellington For more information about the zero-rating of financial services see GST guidelines for working with the zero-rating rules for financial services in our Tax Information Bulletin. Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 16, No 10 (November 2004). Some imported services You are required to charge and return GST on any services you import into New Zealand. These can include services you acquire while you're outside New Zealand. But, if these services can only take place outside New Zealand, they may be zero- rated. The exception is for services which are intangible in nature. Specialised tools New Zealand manufacturers can zero-rate income from tools used to manufacture goods for export, if the tools are: • used in New Zealand solely for the exported good • supplied to a non-GST registered non-resident. Tools include jigs, patterns, templates, dies, punches and similar machine tools. The tools do not have to be exported with the goods to be zero- rated. For more information see the Specialised tools section of our webpage Zero-rated supplies GST PLUS9 Land transactions A land transaction must be zero-rated when made by a GST- registered person, if the supply wholly or partly includes land, and: • is made to another registered person • the recipient acquires the goods with the intention of using them for making taxable supplies • it is not intended to be used as a principal place of residence by the recipient or a relative of the recipient. All these conditions must be satisfied at the time of settlement of the transaction. If any of them are not satisfied at the time of settlement, the supply must be taxed at 15%. Leases for dwellings and most commercial leases are excluded from this definition. For more information about the zero-rating of land transactions see our Interpretation Statement 17/08. Land acquired by not-for-profit organisations Land acquired by a not-for-profit organisation in New Zealand may be zero-rated if it’s used for making taxable supplies. Sale of going concern A sale of a going concern by one registered person to another registered person is zero-rated. The sale is also zero-rated when only part of a taxable activity (able to operate separately) is sold as a going concern. To be a going concern, the sale must meet the following criteria: • It must be the supply of the whole or stand-alone part of a taxable activity, from one registered person to another. • It must be the supply of all the goods and services necessary for the continued operation of the activity. • Both parties must agree that there is a supply of a going concern, and record this agreement in a document. • Both parties must intend the activity is capable of being carried on as a going concern by the purchaser. • The business must be a going concern at the time of supply and carried on up to the time of the transfer to the purcha s er. For example, Paul sells his dairy farm, including land, herd, all buildings and machinery to another GST-registered farmer. This is a sale of a going concern. If he had sold the land and building but kept the machinery and the herd, it would not be a going concern. The sale of the land and buildings may still be zero-rated. Supplies to foreign-based pleasure craft Zero-rating applies to: • Goods supplied for use on a foreign-based pleasure craft that cause or enable the craft to sail, or goods that ensure the safety of passengers and crew. This applies to foreign- based pleasure craft in New Zealand under a temporary import entry issued by the New Zealand Customs Service (Customs) • The supply of consumable stores for use outside New Zealand on foreign-based pleasure craft departing New Zealand. The zero-rating applies to the final provisioning of consumable stores. Foreign-based pleasure craft are defined as those pleasure craft in New Zealand as temporary imports under Customs legislation. Consumable stores are goods passengers and crew on board intend to consume, and those necessary to operate or maintain the pleasure craft, including fuel and lubricants but excluding spare parts and equipment. Before zero-rating, a supplier of maritime goods and consumable stores must be satisfied the goods and stores are for a foreign-based pleasure craft, and the craft is departing New Zealand. Goods and services - temporary imports The most common services are repairs and maintenance. Materials used to repair a temporary import, and become an integral part of the import, are zero-rated. Similarly, if the repair materials become worthless for anything else after the repair job, the materials are zero-rated. Anyone supplying goods or services to a temporary import must keep a copy of the Temporary Import Entry form issued by Customs. For example, a New Zealand-owned boat normally operating in the Cook Islands, is put into dry dock in New Zealand for repairs. Any services involved in the repair would be zero-rated if the boat is temporarily imported. GST PLUS10 Transport of goods to and from New Zealand Zero-rated services include the international journey, and any transport within New Zealand (including loading and unloading costs), as long as it's part of the international transport and is supplied by the same person or agent. These other services in relation to international transportation are also zero-rated: • insuring or arranging insurance • arranging the transport. Transport of people to and from New Zealand Zero-rating applies to the transport of passengers, including the international journey and any air travel within New Zealand if it is: • part of the international carriage • booked at the same time as the international journey • provided through the same agent or supplier. For example, Kate buys a single air ticket for flights from Napier to Auckland, then on to Perth. GST is not charged on either flight as the travel is a contract for international carriage. GST PLUS11 Special supplies are different from the normal business sales or purchases. Agents Special rules apply if a New Zealand agent who is registered for GST acts on behalf of a non-resident principal who is outside New Zealand, and not registered for GST. New Zealand agent buying supplies for a non- resident principal The agent may, in certain circumstances, claim GST incurred when importing or exporting goods to or from New Zealand or arranging transportation. Non-resident principal contracts services agent to sell and distribute their goods In some cases a non-resident, non-registered principal may wish to sell goods in New Zealand but does not want to have a place of business here. They may contract the services of an agent to sell and distribute their goods. If the New Zealand GST-registered agent and the principal agree, the agent will be responsible for returning GST on the sale of the goods rather than the non-resident. The agent will be able to claim GST incurred when importing the goods into New Zealand. Art gallery A non-resident art gallery decides to sell several pieces of art in New Zealand. The gallery arranges for a GST-registered agent in New Zealand to carry out the sale. The agent agrees to act as the supplier and importer of the artwork, rather than the art gallery. The agent may claim for any GST paid to import the goods and is responsible for charging GST on the sale of the artwork in New Zealand. Coin and token-operated machines These rules do not apply to gaming machines. Coin-operated machines If you supply goods or services through any coin-operated device or machine, for example, a video game, snack machine or parking meter, you must account for the total value of the coins removed from the machine. Include the amount in the return covering the date you removed the coins. Token-operated machines If you supply goods or services through a token-operated device or machine, you account for GST on the tokens in the same way as other tokens, stamps or vouchers - as a supply when the customer buys them. If you receive business goods or services through a coin or token-operated machine, you may claim a GST credit in the period you paid the money. Part 4 - Special supplies Exported secondhand goods If you claim a GST input credit for secondhand goods you bought and those goods are going to be exported, the full amount of the goods can be zero-rated if you meet 2 conditions before the goods are entered for export: • the goods must leave New Zealand within 28 days of the time of supply, and • the recipient must provide a declaration (for example, in the sale and purchase agreement or other sales document) at or before the time of supply, neither they nor an associated person will cause the goods to be re-imported to New Zealand in the same condition in which they were exported. If both these conditions are not met, you must account for the GST input credit you’ve claimed in myIR by adding this back as a debit adjustment in your GST return (Box 9 if you file paper returns). It does not matter which accounting basis you use - you must include these details in your return: • the sale or invoiced amount of the sale under Sales and Income (Box 5 for paper returns) • the same amount in zero-rated supplies (Box 6 for paper), as long as you hold evidence of export • 3/23 of the full purchase price of the exported secondhand goods as a debit adjustment under ‘Other’ (Box 9 for paper returns). Example Secondhand dealer, Tom, buys antique pieces for $405 and $515 from a non-registered person and claims 3/23 of these amounts, totalling $120. He sells them to an Australian company for $2,200. The antiques leave New Zealand within 28 days of Tom purchasing them, and a declaration is signed by the Australian purchaser neither they, nor an associated person will re-import the goods into New Zealand. As the supply is zero-rated, GST is charged at the rate of 0%. Tom shows the following in his return: • $2,200 in total sales (Box 5 for paper returns) • $2,200 in zero-rated supplies (Box 6 for paper returns). Costs in raising capital funds You can claim for GST input tax incurred on supplies of financial services made to raise funds intended for expenditure in your taxable activity, to the extent the capital funds your taxable activity. It does not apply to persons who principally make supplies of financial services. Example A building company sells shares to purchase a development property that will be 80% commercial and 20% residential incurs $6,900 (including GST of $900) in expenses to sell the shares. The company claims $720 (80% GST for the commercial property). This would be subject to further adjustment if the estimated use differs from the actual use. GST PLUS12 Summary table The following table sets out the different types of emissions units transactions and their GST treatment.

Emissions Trading Scheme The supply of these emissions units is zero-rated for GST: • New Zealand units • Kyoto-compliant units • approved overseas units • certain ‘grey list’ or ‘voluntary’ units, for example, voluntary carbon standard units and gold standard units. The supply of emissions units made under the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) or the Permanent Forest Sink Initiative (PFSI) is also zero-rated. Standard GST rules still apply to the supply of units such as fuel costs created in the normal course of a business. Post-1989 forest land owners/permanent forest sink initiative (PFSI) participants If you receive allocations of emissions units under post-1989 forest ownership or a PFSI, you make a supply of carbon removal services as consideration for the units. Include these services as zero-rated supplies in your GST returns. If an unincorporated body receives an allocation of units or if multiple legal owners receive an allocation from one NZ Emissions Unit Register (NZEUR) holding account, the GST-registered body/group makes the supply to the Crown. Individuals in the allocation group do not make or receive a supply. GST PLUS13 Foreign currency payments If you are paid for goods or services in a foreign currency, convert the amount to New Zealand dollars using the exchange rate for the date of the GST time of supply. To claim a GST credit you must hold taxable supply information such as an invoice in New Zealand currency. GST on imported services - reverse charge When you import services from a non-resident supplier you’ll usually not be charged GST if you let them know you're also GST registered. However, if you then use some or all of those services for something other than your taxable activity, you'll need to account for the GST on the non-taxable use. You add GST to the price of the services you've received, and include it as income in your GST return. This is called a ‘reverse charge’. If you were charged GST at the rate of 0% (zero-rated) you will need to make an adjustment if you use the services for non-taxable use. When you acquire the services, if you estimate your taxable use of the services will be less than 95% of total use, then you'll be treated as if you supplied the services yourself in the course of your taxable activity. You'll need to add GST to the cost of those services and include them in your GST return. You'll also be able to claim as an expense the GST-inclusive cost of the imported services, in proportion to your estimate of their taxable use. You'll also need to account for the GST reverse charge on imported services if you find at the end of an adjustment period your taxable use of an imported service was less than 95%. This is also done by adding GST to the cost of the service and including it in the relevant GST return. You also claim as an expense the GST-inclusive cost in proportion to your actual taxable use. Example Melissa is a GST-registered self-employed publicist. She purchases a graphics software package from a non-resident supplier for $400, and because she identifies herself as GST registered she is not charged GST on the purchase. She estimates the software will be used 50% for her business and 50% for home use. Under the reverse charge rule, Melissa is treated as supplying the software package to herself for $460 ($400 plus $60 GST). She includes this amount as income in her GST return. However, she can also claim half of the amount as an expense, to reflect her business use of the software. She does this by claiming $230 ($200 plus $30 GST) as an expense in the same GST return. For information about GST on supplies of remote services see Tax Information Bulletin (TIB), Vol 28, No 6 (July 2016). Lotteries and other games of chance If you run raffles, lotteries, or other games of chance, you must account for the proceeds of the lottery (for example, total sales of tickets or cards) less the total amount of cash prizes. Example Total proceeds of a raffle were $1,070 (535 tickets at $2 each). Cash prizes were: 1st $ 500 2nd $ 200 3rd $ 100 Total $ 800 Total proceeds $ 1,070 Cash prizes $ 800 Difference $ 270 You must include Sales and income of $270 (Box 5 for paper returns) covering the return period the raffle was drawn. If one raffle has multiple draws, account for the GST in the return covering the date of the first draw. You can claim GST for the cost of non-cash prizes in the normal way. GST on assets sold by not for profits Generally, GST input credits can be claimed for the purchase of an asset or for expenses including GST relating to that asset. Where input credits are claimed, the asset will be considered part of the GST activity. In these situations, GST output tax will be payable on the disposal of the asset or an equivalent event (for example, an insurance pay-out in the event of a fire). Since 1 April 2019, not-for-profit businesses have a 24-month transition period to elect to remove an asset so it is not part of their GST taxable activity. Any GST input credits claimed for the asset will need to be repaid. The election needs to provide details of the asset, calculation of input credits being repaid and period of election. Elections should be sent to Charities.queries@ird.govt.nz GST PLUS14 Telecommunications – mobile roaming services Outbound mobile roaming services These are mobile roaming services used outside New Zealand by a person with a New Zealand registered mobile device, and their usual mobile network is in New Zealand. These services are subject to GST of 15%. Inbound mobile roaming services These are mobile roaming services used by a non-resident who is in New Zealand and their usual mobile network is outside New Zealand. These services are zero-rated for GST if supplied by a resident or treated as being made outside New Zealand (and so not subject to GST) if supplied by a non-resident. GST on goods purchased on deferred payment term Generally, a person who is registered for GST on a payments basis can claim input tax deductions only when payment has been made. This includes goods purchased under a standard sales agreement or goods purchased on a ‘buy now, pay later’ basis. However: • If a person has entered into a hire purchase agreement for the purchase of goods, they can claim a full input tax deduction when they enter into the agreement. • If a person has entered into a layby sales agreement for the purchase of goods, they can claim an input tax deduction only when property in the goods is transferred, typically after the final payment has been made. Summary – for payments basis persons Type of agreement When an input tax deduction can be claimed Standard sales agreement When and to the extent that payment has been made. ‘Buy now, pay later’ (BNPL) agreement Typically, when the agreement is entered into as the BNPL provider pays for the supply in full. Hire purchase agreement When the agreement is entered into. Layby sales agreement When property in the goods is transferred, typically after final payment has been made. For more information go to taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz and refer to Question we’ve been asked (QB) 23/06: GST – goods purchased on deferred payment terms GST PLUS15 Part 5 - GST and koha If your koha is an unconditional gift you do not have to pay GST on it. An unconditional gift is a voluntary payment to a not-for- profit organisation that does not benefit the payer or giver in the form of goods or services. If the koha, such as payments, goods or services are not an unconditional gift they are liable for GST. Deciding if your koha is liable for GST The unconditional gift rule will help you decide whether your koha is liable for GST. We’ve added some examples based on a not-for-profit marae registered for GST. GST on marae member payments When a marae member gives money, goods or a service (koha) to their marae and expects nothing in return, then it is not subject to GST or liable for income tax. Types of payments not taxed are: • money given to bereaved family or committee at a tangihanga or hura kōhatu • money given to a married couple or committee at a mārena • koha given to a marae committee to assist in paying for a building, house or church • visitors on a marae giving a collection to donate to the marae committee. Types of payments that must be taxed are: • a government department giving payment on a marae • tourists given a tour on a marae for a fee • fund raising activities by marae committee • a marae building is made available for a function in exchange for koha. Koha given to the tangata whenua A group of people arrange to stay on your marae for a couple of nights at no charge by your marae. The group gives a koha to the tangata whenua at the pōwhiri. The koha is an unconditional gift and is not liable for GST. It’s unconditional because the payment was voluntary and not given for goods or services. Staff workshop on your marae A company holds a 2-day staff workshop for thirty people on your marae. You charge a $50 per person, per day fee. You must charge GST, because the money is paid for the goods and services supplied by you. You can claim GST on all goods and services you purchase to host this workshop. Participants give a koha after staff workshop After the workshop (in the last example) some of the participants give a koha to you in appreciation of the hospitality shown. As this koha is not for goods and services you have supplied and gives no direct benefit to the payers/giver, it is an unconditional gift and not liable for GST. If your marae is not registered for GST, it cannot charge GST for any goods and services they supplied and cannot claim GST back on goods and services they pay for. GST PLUS16 Part 6 - Non-resident businesses and GST The GST rules for non-residents depend on the circumstances of the business. For full details, go to ird.govt.nz/nrgst Supplying goods or services in New Zealand A non-resident business carrying on a taxable activity and making supplies of goods or services in New Zealand, may be required to register for GST. The business will need to charge GST on its sales and can claim back GST on its business expenses. Supplying remote services Non-resident sellers and online marketplace operators that supply remote services, such as digital content from outside New Zealand to customers resident in New Zealand, may need to register for, file, and pay GST on these supplies. Non-resident suppliers of online gambling services who register for GST must also register for offshore gambling duty. For more information, go to ird.govt.nz/ogd Supplying low value imported goods From 1 December 2019, non-resident sellers, online marketplace operators and redeliverers supplying low value goods to customers in New Zealand, may need to register for, collect and return GST. A low value good is a physical good valued at NZ$1,000 or less (excluding GST), for example clothing, cosmetics and electronic items. Supplying listed services From 1 April 2024, non-resident online marketplace operators facilitating the sale of short-stay and visitor accommodation, ride-sharing, and food and beverage delivery may need to register for, collect and return GST when the service is performed, provided, or received in New Zealand. Claiming GST if you do not make taxable supplies in New Zealand Non-resident businesses who are not making taxable supplies in New Zealand, but receive goods or services here, may be able to register for GST as a non-resident business claimant and claim back GST paid on New Zealand business expenses. To be eligible, conditions must be met. GST PLUS17 How to get our forms and guides You can get copies of our forms and guides at ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Need to speak with us?

This guide covers some infrequent and/or complex GST issues which only apply to a limited number of registered persons, or only occur under certain conditions. There may still be some situations we have not covered here. For more help: • go to our website ird.govt.nz/gst • read our GST Guide - IR375 • call us on 0800 377 776. About this guide GST PLUS4 Part 1 - Adjustments Change of accounting basis You may want to change your GST accounting basis to suit your business situation. Make sure you’re eligible to use the accounting basis you want to change to. • In myIR, go to your GST account > More > Manage account > Update GST account details • Select the accounting basis you want to change to. We’ll contact you within 15 working days to confirm the date the change comes into effect. You’ll need to adjust your next GST return for any outstanding debtors and creditors: • For GST returns in myIR, add any debit and/or credit adjustments in the ‘Change of accounting basis’ fields. • For paper returns add in your debit and/or credit adjustments in the ‘Change of accounting basis’ Boxes then copy the figures into Boxes 9 and 13 of your GST return. Making adjustments for debtors and creditors • From payments to invoice If GST on debtors is more than GST on creditors, include a debit adjustment for the difference. myIR GST return > Debit adjustments > Change of accounting basis > net amount. If GST on creditors is more than GST on debtors, include a credit adjustment for the difference. myIR GST return > Credit adjustments > Change of accounting basis > net amount. For paper returns show the net amount you have worked out in either the - Debit adjustments Box 9 or Credit adjustments Box 13. Note: For an entity in receivership or liquidation, the liquidator, receiver or administrator cannot change the accounting basis from payments to invoice. • From payments to hybrid Calculate the GST on debtors. myIR GST return > Debit adjustments > Change of accounting basis > amount.

For paper returns include the credit adjustment in Box 13 of your return. • From hybrid to invoice Calculate the GST on creditors. myIR GST return > Credit adjustments > Change of accounting basis > amount. For paper returns include the credit adjustment in Box 13 of your return. Assets kept after you cancel your GST registration When you cancel your registration, you must make an adjustment in your final GST return to include the value of any assets you keep from your taxable activity. The adjustment amount is 3/23 of the open (current) market value of the assets. For assets bought before 1 October 1986, the value will be the lesser of the cost price and the open market value. If a retained asset has been used for business, and private or exempt use, you must make a debit adjustment based on the percentage of business use, at market value. The adjustment for a mixed-use asset for a property developer will be equivalent to returning GST at full market value, offset by any input tax not already claimed. You must return the GST on the value of the asset regardless of your accounting basis. myIR GST return > Debit adjustment > Assets kept after cancelling registration > amount. For paper returns include the debit adjustment in Box 9 of your return. Once you have made the adjustment, you do not need to return GST on the asset in the future. It does not matter what you do with the assets after you’ve filed your final return. Example Charlie was registered for GST and had a taxi business. He retired on 30 November and kept his taxi for personal use. The value of the vehicle based on current market value was $17,250. In his final GST return he included 3/23 of $17,250 ($2,250) as a debit adjustment for assets kept after cancelling registration. Note: If you do not make an adjustment for an asset you have retained, you will remain liable to pay GST on any future sale or disposal even though you may no longer be GST registered. GST PLUS5 Exempt supplies are goods and services which are not subject to GST. You do not include these supplies in your GST return. Donated goods-services If goods or services are donated to a not-for-profit organisation, they cannot charge GST if they sell them later. Example A car dealer gives a car to a church. The car is used by the church for 2 years before selling it. The sale of the car is exempt. A not-for-profit organisation cannot claim a GST credit for expenses relating to supplying donated goods and services. For example, an opportunity shop charity selling only donated clothing cannot claim GST credits on the shop expenses, such as rates, electricity, or maintenance. If this was the charity’s only activity, it would not even register for GST. However, if the charity also sells purchased goods, GST may be claimed on the expenses directly related to those goods. All other expenses must be apportioned between the exempt and taxable supply use. For more information go to Income tax and GST for not-for- profits Financial services These include: • paying or collecting any amount of interest • mortgages and other loans • bank fees • securities such as stocks and shares • providing credit under a credit contract • exchanging currency (for example, changing US$ into NZ$) • arranging or agreeing to do any of the above (for example, mortgage broking) • financial options • provision or transfer of ownership of a financial option • deliverable future contracts • non-deliverable future contracts. For more information see our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB), Vol 16, No 10 (November 2004). Financial planning fees cover The various types of fees charged by financial advisers for financial planning services they provide. Financial planning fees subject to GST Services relating to initial planning fees, monitoring fees, evaluation fees and replanning fees. Part 2 - Exempt supplies Financial planning fees not subject to GST Services relating to implementation fees, administration fees and switching fees exempt from GST. For more information see Tax Information Bulletin (TIB), Vol 13, No 7 (July 2001). Renting a residential dwelling GST cannot be charged on the rent for a residential dwelling. A landlord cannot claim any GST on dwelling expenses, such as maintenance, rates and insurance. If a residential dwelling is sold as part of a taxable activity, and it was rented for at least 5 years beforehand, the sale is an exempt supply. If a property developer acquires a property for the principal purpose of making a taxable supply and then subsequently rents the property out, a change-of-use adjustment may be required. Residential accommodation under a head lease A tenant, the head lessee, has overall responsibility as set out in the lease with the landlord. This type of lease would most likely exist for a large multi-tenanted building. The supply of residential property for lease under a head lease is an exempt supply, if the property is to be used for the principal purpose of residential accommodation, unless all the following apply: • the supplier and recipient agree the exemption does not apply • the supply was made under a lease entered into before 16 May 2000 • previous supplies were treated as taxable. Penalty interest Interest charges on overdue accounts are treated as exempt supplies. For example, if you sell goods to another supplier on a 30, 60 or 90 day account basis and the account becomes overdue, any penalty interest chargeable on the non-payment should not be included in your GST return. Fines and penalties imposed for an offence created by statute are not subject to GST. For example, parking fines imposed by the court or local authorities as infringement fees are penalties for offences against the Transport Act 1962. GST PLUS6 Supply of fine metals The sale of fine metal by a dealer, or anyone importing fine metal is an exempt supply. The exception is when newly refined fine metal is supplied by a refiner to a dealer as an investment item, then it is a zero-rated supply. Fine metal is any form of: • gold with a fineness of not less than 99.5% • silver with a fineness of not less than 99.9% • platinum with a fineness of not less than 99%. GST PLUS7 Zero-rated supplies are supplies not subject to GST in certain situations. A rate of 0% applies to these supplies. Copyrights and patents Services relating to copyrights, patents, and similar property, which apply outside New Zealand are zero-rated. Example A New Zealand publishing company has the copyright on a New Zealand author's book. The company sells the overseas copyright to another New Zealand company. Because the other company will be publishing and selling the book overseas (performing a service), the fee for the right is zero-rated. Transport of household goods in NZ Transport of household goods in New Zealand is zero-rated if: • the services are supplied to a non-resident outside New Zealand at the time they are performed • the goods are for home consumption under the Customs and Excise Act 1996 • the arrangement for the services is made before the goods enter New Zealand, and • the services are expected to be completed within 28 days of the entry of the goods. Duty-free goods Goods purchased from duty-free shops by international travellers are zero-rated when a retailer: • sells goods to a tourist and arranges to send the items overseas to them • arranges to send the items to an overseas customer • arranges to send goods to the airport for a traveller to pick up at the time of departure. Goods sold by duty-free shops are zero-rated if they are: • licensed as export warehouses, and • operating within the Customs processing area at international airports. GST may be payable to Customs upon entry of goods to New Zealand. Exported vessels (boats and aircrafts) The purchase of vessels capable of being exported from New Zealand under their own power can be zero-rated. This includes: • goods incorporated into or used up as part of servicing a boat or aircraft being exported • services provided directly in connection with an exported boat or aircraft. Part 3 - Zero-rated supplies Exported goods Goods may qualify for zero-rating if they are or going to be exported in your name. Exported goods include: • items not requiring export entry, valued less than $1,000 - you must have proof you have exported or will export them • stores supplied to aircraft and ships for use outside New Zealand. Timeframe for exporting If you have entered goods for export, they must be exported within 28 days of the time of supply, unless we have agreed to an extension. Aircraft and boats can be zero-rated if they are exported: • from New Zealand under their own power within 60 days of the recipient taking possession, and • full documentation is provided to us. Goods that were to be exported but are destroyed, die or cease to exist from circumstances outside the control of both the supplier and recipient, are zero-rated. First sale - refined metal When newly-refined fine metal (gold, silver, platinum) is supplied by a refiner to a dealer as an investment item, it is a zero-rated supply. Goods not in NZ at the time of supply Goods located outside New Zealand, which are not going to be imported into New Zealand, are zero-rated. Services performed outside New Zealand Services performed outside New Zealand are zero-rated. For example, if a NZ singer performs overseas, they will charge GST at 0%. Remote services supplied from outside New Zealand Non-resident businesses are not required to charge and return GST on remote services, including online services, supplied to New Zealand GST-registered businesses. They are also not required to provide taxable supply information. A non-resident business can treat the supply as zero-rated, taxed at 0%, to claim back New Zealand GST on the costs incurred in making zero-rated supplies to GST-registered businesses. GST PLUS8 If you receive a zero-rated remote service from a non-resident business, you may need to make an adjustment if you use the service for something other than your taxable activity. If you estimate an acquired service will be used less than 95% in your taxable activity or discover in a later return period your actual use of the service is less than 95%, you’ll need to adjust GST for the non-taxable use. Work out the GST that would’ve been charged on the service if it was not zero-rated and adjust for the proportion of non-taxable use. Services relating to goods to be exported Services performed directly in connection with goods that are, or will be, entered for export are zero-rated. Example A New Zealand fruit grower exports 1,000 crates of fruit. The offshore recipient wants to ensure the quality of the fruit. He contracts a New Zealand horticultural firm to inspect the fruit independently and prepare a report. This service is zero-rated. Services relating to portable personal property Information services provided directly in connection with portable personal property are zero-rated. Example Electronic equipment is sent to New Zealand from Germany for testing. The test results are collected, analysed and sent back to Germany. These services are zero-rated. Services supplied to non-residents outside New Zealand Services are zero-rated when supplied to a non-resident who is outside New Zealand when the service is supplied. Example Legal advice given to a person living in Australia by a lawyer who is resident in New Zealand is zero-rated. Services zero-rated but carried out in New Zealand Land outside New Zealand Services connected directly with land or buildings located outside New Zealand, for example, architectural, real estate and legal services, are zero-rated. Example A New Zealand architect designs a building to be constructed on an overseas property for an overseas client. The charge for this service is zero-rated. Goods outside New Zealand Zero-rating applies to services carried out directly in connection with goods situated outside New Zealand. Example A New Zealand insurance company gives cover to a car located outside New Zealand. The premiums are zero-rated. Some financial services Supplies of financial intermediation services, for example, for deposit-taking intermediation and brokerage services may be zero-rated to recipients if: • they are registered for GST • 75% or more of their supplies in a 12-month period are taxable supplies. Supplies to recipients who do not meet these criteria must be treated as exempt supplies. You must make an election to zero- rate these supplies. Inland Revenue Significant Enterprises PO Box 2198 Wellington For more information about the zero-rating of financial services see GST guidelines for working with the zero-rating rules for financial services in our Tax Information Bulletin. Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 16, No 10 (November 2004). Some imported services You are required to charge and return GST on any services you import into New Zealand. These can include services you acquire while you're outside New Zealand. But, if these services can only take place outside New Zealand, they may be zero- rated. The exception is for services which are intangible in nature. Specialised tools New Zealand manufacturers can zero-rate income from tools used to manufacture goods for export, if the tools are: • used in New Zealand solely for the exported good • supplied to a non-GST registered non-resident. Tools include jigs, patterns, templates, dies, punches and similar machine tools. The tools do not have to be exported with the goods to be zero- rated. For more information see the Specialised tools section of our webpage Zero-rated supplies GST PLUS9 Land transactions A land transaction must be zero-rated when made by a GST- registered person, if the supply wholly or partly includes land, and: • is made to another registered person • the recipient acquires the goods with the intention of using them for making taxable supplies • it is not intended to be used as a principal place of residence by the recipient or a relative of the recipient. All these conditions must be satisfied at the time of settlement of the transaction. If any of them are not satisfied at the time of settlement, the supply must be taxed at 15%. Leases for dwellings and most commercial leases are excluded from this definition. For more information about the zero-rating of land transactions see our Interpretation Statement 17/08. Land acquired by not-for-profit organisations Land acquired by a not-for-profit organisation in New Zealand may be zero-rated if it’s used for making taxable supplies. Sale of going concern A sale of a going concern by one registered person to another registered person is zero-rated. The sale is also zero-rated when only part of a taxable activity (able to operate separately) is sold as a going concern. To be a going concern, the sale must meet the following criteria: • It must be the supply of the whole or stand-alone part of a taxable activity, from one registered person to another. • It must be the supply of all the goods and services necessary for the continued operation of the activity. • Both parties must agree that there is a supply of a going concern, and record this agreement in a document. • Both parties must intend the activity is capable of being carried on as a going concern by the purchaser. • The business must be a going concern at the time of supply and carried on up to the time of the transfer to the purcha s er. For example, Paul sells his dairy farm, including land, herd, all buildings and machinery to another GST-registered farmer. This is a sale of a going concern. If he had sold the land and building but kept the machinery and the herd, it would not be a going concern. The sale of the land and buildings may still be zero-rated. Supplies to foreign-based pleasure craft Zero-rating applies to: • Goods supplied for use on a foreign-based pleasure craft that cause or enable the craft to sail, or goods that ensure the safety of passengers and crew. This applies to foreign- based pleasure craft in New Zealand under a temporary import entry issued by the New Zealand Customs Service (Customs) • The supply of consumable stores for use outside New Zealand on foreign-based pleasure craft departing New Zealand. The zero-rating applies to the final provisioning of consumable stores. Foreign-based pleasure craft are defined as those pleasure craft in New Zealand as temporary imports under Customs legislation. Consumable stores are goods passengers and crew on board intend to consume, and those necessary to operate or maintain the pleasure craft, including fuel and lubricants but excluding spare parts and equipment. Before zero-rating, a supplier of maritime goods and consumable stores must be satisfied the goods and stores are for a foreign-based pleasure craft, and the craft is departing New Zealand. Goods and services - temporary imports The most common services are repairs and maintenance. Materials used to repair a temporary import, and become an integral part of the import, are zero-rated. Similarly, if the repair materials become worthless for anything else after the repair job, the materials are zero-rated. Anyone supplying goods or services to a temporary import must keep a copy of the Temporary Import Entry form issued by Customs. For example, a New Zealand-owned boat normally operating in the Cook Islands, is put into dry dock in New Zealand for repairs. Any services involved in the repair would be zero-rated if the boat is temporarily imported. GST PLUS10 Transport of goods to and from New Zealand Zero-rated services include the international journey, and any transport within New Zealand (including loading and unloading costs), as long as it's part of the international transport and is supplied by the same person or agent. These other services in relation to international transportation are also zero-rated: • insuring or arranging insurance • arranging the transport. Transport of people to and from New Zealand Zero-rating applies to the transport of passengers, including the international journey and any air travel within New Zealand if it is: • part of the international carriage • booked at the same time as the international journey • provided through the same agent or supplier. For example, Kate buys a single air ticket for flights from Napier to Auckland, then on to Perth. GST is not charged on either flight as the travel is a contract for international carriage. GST PLUS11 Special supplies are different from the normal business sales or purchases. Agents Special rules apply if a New Zealand agent who is registered for GST acts on behalf of a non-resident principal who is outside New Zealand, and not registered for GST. New Zealand agent buying supplies for a non- resident principal The agent may, in certain circumstances, claim GST incurred when importing or exporting goods to or from New Zealand or arranging transportation. Non-resident principal contracts services agent to sell and distribute their goods In some cases a non-resident, non-registered principal may wish to sell goods in New Zealand but does not want to have a place of business here. They may contract the services of an agent to sell and distribute their goods. If the New Zealand GST-registered agent and the principal agree, the agent will be responsible for returning GST on the sale of the goods rather than the non-resident. The agent will be able to claim GST incurred when importing the goods into New Zealand. Art gallery A non-resident art gallery decides to sell several pieces of art in New Zealand. The gallery arranges for a GST-registered agent in New Zealand to carry out the sale. The agent agrees to act as the supplier and importer of the artwork, rather than the art gallery. The agent may claim for any GST paid to import the goods and is responsible for charging GST on the sale of the artwork in New Zealand. Coin and token-operated machines These rules do not apply to gaming machines. Coin-operated machines If you supply goods or services through any coin-operated device or machine, for example, a video game, snack machine or parking meter, you must account for the total value of the coins removed from the machine. Include the amount in the return covering the date you removed the coins. Token-operated machines If you supply goods or services through a token-operated device or machine, you account for GST on the tokens in the same way as other tokens, stamps or vouchers - as a supply when the customer buys them. If you receive business goods or services through a coin or token-operated machine, you may claim a GST credit in the period you paid the money. Part 4 - Special supplies Exported secondhand goods If you claim a GST input credit for secondhand goods you bought and those goods are going to be exported, the full amount of the goods can be zero-rated if you meet 2 conditions before the goods are entered for export: • the goods must leave New Zealand within 28 days of the time of supply, and • the recipient must provide a declaration (for example, in the sale and purchase agreement or other sales document) at or before the time of supply, neither they nor an associated person will cause the goods to be re-imported to New Zealand in the same condition in which they were exported. If both these conditions are not met, you must account for the GST input credit you’ve claimed in myIR by adding this back as a debit adjustment in your GST return (Box 9 if you file paper returns). It does not matter which accounting basis you use - you must include these details in your return: • the sale or invoiced amount of the sale under Sales and Income (Box 5 for paper returns) • the same amount in zero-rated supplies (Box 6 for paper), as long as you hold evidence of export • 3/23 of the full purchase price of the exported secondhand goods as a debit adjustment under ‘Other’ (Box 9 for paper returns). Example Secondhand dealer, Tom, buys antique pieces for $405 and $515 from a non-registered person and claims 3/23 of these amounts, totalling $120. He sells them to an Australian company for $2,200. The antiques leave New Zealand within 28 days of Tom purchasing them, and a declaration is signed by the Australian purchaser neither they, nor an associated person will re-import the goods into New Zealand. As the supply is zero-rated, GST is charged at the rate of 0%. Tom shows the following in his return: • $2,200 in total sales (Box 5 for paper returns) • $2,200 in zero-rated supplies (Box 6 for paper returns). Costs in raising capital funds You can claim for GST input tax incurred on supplies of financial services made to raise funds intended for expenditure in your taxable activity, to the extent the capital funds your taxable activity. It does not apply to persons who principally make supplies of financial services. Example A building company sells shares to purchase a development property that will be 80% commercial and 20% residential incurs $6,900 (including GST of $900) in expenses to sell the shares. The company claims $720 (80% GST for the commercial property). This would be subject to further adjustment if the estimated use differs from the actual use. GST PLUS12 Summary table The following table sets out the different types of emissions units transactions and their GST treatment.

Emissions Trading Scheme The supply of these emissions units is zero-rated for GST: • New Zealand units • Kyoto-compliant units • approved overseas units • certain ‘grey list’ or ‘voluntary’ units, for example, voluntary carbon standard units and gold standard units. The supply of emissions units made under the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) or the Permanent Forest Sink Initiative (PFSI) is also zero-rated. Standard GST rules still apply to the supply of units such as fuel costs created in the normal course of a business. Post-1989 forest land owners/permanent forest sink initiative (PFSI) participants If you receive allocations of emissions units under post-1989 forest ownership or a PFSI, you make a supply of carbon removal services as consideration for the units. Include these services as zero-rated supplies in your GST returns. If an unincorporated body receives an allocation of units or if multiple legal owners receive an allocation from one NZ Emissions Unit Register (NZEUR) holding account, the GST-registered body/group makes the supply to the Crown. Individuals in the allocation group do not make or receive a supply. GST PLUS13 Foreign currency payments If you are paid for goods or services in a foreign currency, convert the amount to New Zealand dollars using the exchange rate for the date of the GST time of supply. To claim a GST credit you must hold taxable supply information such as an invoice in New Zealand currency. GST on imported services - reverse charge When you import services from a non-resident supplier you’ll usually not be charged GST if you let them know you're also GST registered. However, if you then use some or all of those services for something other than your taxable activity, you'll need to account for the GST on the non-taxable use. You add GST to the price of the services you've received, and include it as income in your GST return. This is called a ‘reverse charge’. If you were charged GST at the rate of 0% (zero-rated) you will need to make an adjustment if you use the services for non-taxable use. When you acquire the services, if you estimate your taxable use of the services will be less than 95% of total use, then you'll be treated as if you supplied the services yourself in the course of your taxable activity. You'll need to add GST to the cost of those services and include them in your GST return. You'll also be able to claim as an expense the GST-inclusive cost of the imported services, in proportion to your estimate of their taxable use. You'll also need to account for the GST reverse charge on imported services if you find at the end of an adjustment period your taxable use of an imported service was less than 95%. This is also done by adding GST to the cost of the service and including it in the relevant GST return. You also claim as an expense the GST-inclusive cost in proportion to your actual taxable use. Example Melissa is a GST-registered self-employed publicist. She purchases a graphics software package from a non-resident supplier for $400, and because she identifies herself as GST registered she is not charged GST on the purchase. She estimates the software will be used 50% for her business and 50% for home use. Under the reverse charge rule, Melissa is treated as supplying the software package to herself for $460 ($400 plus $60 GST). She includes this amount as income in her GST return. However, she can also claim half of the amount as an expense, to reflect her business use of the software. She does this by claiming $230 ($200 plus $30 GST) as an expense in the same GST return. For information about GST on supplies of remote services see Tax Information Bulletin (TIB), Vol 28, No 6 (July 2016). Lotteries and other games of chance If you run raffles, lotteries, or other games of chance, you must account for the proceeds of the lottery (for example, total sales of tickets or cards) less the total amount of cash prizes. Example Total proceeds of a raffle were $1,070 (535 tickets at $2 each). Cash prizes were: 1st $ 500 2nd $ 200 3rd $ 100 Total $ 800 Total proceeds $ 1,070 Cash prizes $ 800 Difference $ 270 You must include Sales and income of $270 (Box 5 for paper returns) covering the return period the raffle was drawn. If one raffle has multiple draws, account for the GST in the return covering the date of the first draw. You can claim GST for the cost of non-cash prizes in the normal way. GST on assets sold by not for profits Generally, GST input credits can be claimed for the purchase of an asset or for expenses including GST relating to that asset. Where input credits are claimed, the asset will be considered part of the GST activity. In these situations, GST output tax will be payable on the disposal of the asset or an equivalent event (for example, an insurance pay-out in the event of a fire). Since 1 April 2019, not-for-profit businesses have a 24-month transition period to elect to remove an asset so it is not part of their GST taxable activity. Any GST input credits claimed for the asset will need to be repaid. The election needs to provide details of the asset, calculation of input credits being repaid and period of election. Elections should be sent to Charities.queries@ird.govt.nz GST PLUS14 Telecommunications – mobile roaming services Outbound mobile roaming services These are mobile roaming services used outside New Zealand by a person with a New Zealand registered mobile device, and their usual mobile network is in New Zealand. These services are subject to GST of 15%. Inbound mobile roaming services These are mobile roaming services used by a non-resident who is in New Zealand and their usual mobile network is outside New Zealand. These services are zero-rated for GST if supplied by a resident or treated as being made outside New Zealand (and so not subject to GST) if supplied by a non-resident. GST on goods purchased on deferred payment term Generally, a person who is registered for GST on a payments basis can claim input tax deductions only when payment has been made. This includes goods purchased under a standard sales agreement or goods purchased on a ‘buy now, pay later’ basis. However: • If a person has entered into a hire purchase agreement for the purchase of goods, they can claim a full input tax deduction when they enter into the agreement. • If a person has entered into a layby sales agreement for the purchase of goods, they can claim an input tax deduction only when property in the goods is transferred, typically after the final payment has been made. Summary – for payments basis persons Type of agreement When an input tax deduction can be claimed Standard sales agreement When and to the extent that payment has been made. ‘Buy now, pay later’ (BNPL) agreement Typically, when the agreement is entered into as the BNPL provider pays for the supply in full. Hire purchase agreement When the agreement is entered into. Layby sales agreement When property in the goods is transferred, typically after final payment has been made. For more information go to taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz and refer to Question we’ve been asked (QB) 23/06: GST – goods purchased on deferred payment terms GST PLUS15 Part 5 - GST and koha If your koha is an unconditional gift you do not have to pay GST on it. An unconditional gift is a voluntary payment to a not-for- profit organisation that does not benefit the payer or giver in the form of goods or services. If the koha, such as payments, goods or services are not an unconditional gift they are liable for GST. Deciding if your koha is liable for GST The unconditional gift rule will help you decide whether your koha is liable for GST. We’ve added some examples based on a not-for-profit marae registered for GST. GST on marae member payments When a marae member gives money, goods or a service (koha) to their marae and expects nothing in return, then it is not subject to GST or liable for income tax. Types of payments not taxed are: • money given to bereaved family or committee at a tangihanga or hura kōhatu • money given to a married couple or committee at a mārena • koha given to a marae committee to assist in paying for a building, house or church • visitors on a marae giving a collection to donate to the marae committee. Types of payments that must be taxed are: • a government department giving payment on a marae • tourists given a tour on a marae for a fee • fund raising activities by marae committee • a marae building is made available for a function in exchange for koha. Koha given to the tangata whenua A group of people arrange to stay on your marae for a couple of nights at no charge by your marae. The group gives a koha to the tangata whenua at the pōwhiri. The koha is an unconditional gift and is not liable for GST. It’s unconditional because the payment was voluntary and not given for goods or services. Staff workshop on your marae A company holds a 2-day staff workshop for thirty people on your marae. You charge a $50 per person, per day fee. You must charge GST, because the money is paid for the goods and services supplied by you. You can claim GST on all goods and services you purchase to host this workshop. Participants give a koha after staff workshop After the workshop (in the last example) some of the participants give a koha to you in appreciation of the hospitality shown. As this koha is not for goods and services you have supplied and gives no direct benefit to the payers/giver, it is an unconditional gift and not liable for GST. If your marae is not registered for GST, it cannot charge GST for any goods and services they supplied and cannot claim GST back on goods and services they pay for. GST PLUS16 Part 6 - Non-resident businesses and GST The GST rules for non-residents depend on the circumstances of the business. For full details, go to ird.govt.nz/nrgst Supplying goods or services in New Zealand A non-resident business carrying on a taxable activity and making supplies of goods or services in New Zealand, may be required to register for GST. The business will need to charge GST on its sales and can claim back GST on its business expenses. Supplying remote services Non-resident sellers and online marketplace operators that supply remote services, such as digital content from outside New Zealand to customers resident in New Zealand, may need to register for, collect and return GST on these supplies. Supplying low value imported goods From 1 December 2019, non-resident sellers, online marketplace operators and redeliverers supplying low value goods to customers in New Zealand, may need to register for, collect and return GST. A low value good is a physical good valued at NZ$1,000 or less (excluding GST), for example clothing, cosmetics and electronic items. Supplying listed services From 1 April 2024, non-resident online marketplace operators facilitating the sale of short-stay and visitor accommodation, ride-sharing, and food and beverage delivery may need to register for, collect and return GST when the service is performed, provided, or received in New Zealand. Claiming GST if you do not make taxable supplies in New Zealand Non-resident businesses who are not making taxable supplies in New Zealand, but receive goods or services here, may be able to register for GST as a non-resident business claimant and claim back GST paid on New Zealand business expenses. To be eligible, conditions must be met. GST PLUS17 How to get our forms and guides You can get copies of our forms and guides at ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Need to speak with us?

Elect someone to act on your behalf Complete this form to nominate someone as your agent to act on your behalf with Inland Revenue. By nominating a person, you are appointing that person as your agent to do things such as make enquiries, complete forms, receive your statements, refunds and other correspondence and set up payment arrangements on your behalf. Having a nominated person as your agent allows Inland Revenue to talk to your agent about your tax affairs, but it doesn't change your obligations, and you remain responsible for your own tax affairs, so you need to make sure any returns or payments are made by the due date. You are also responsible for advising us if you wish to end a nominated person's authority.

Payroll giving is a voluntary scheme where you pass your employee’s donations on to the chosen donee organisation and reduce their PAYE with a tax credit for payroll donations. As an employer, you can only offer payroll giving if you file your Employment information - IR348 electronically. If you offer payroll giving, your employees can make donations from their salary or wages to their chosen donee organisation. They may decide how much, when and who they'd like to donate to depending on how your scheme is set up. They receive an immediate tax credit for the payroll donation. This reduces their PAYE deducted from their wages. For information about donee organisations see page 7. Only approved donee organisations are eligible to receive donations through payroll giving. For a list of donee organisations go to ird.govt.nz/donee Using myIR If you want to offer payroll giving you'll need to register for a myIR Secure Online Services account. Go to ird.govt.nz/myIR to register. Once you have a myIR account you’ll be able to offer payroll giving. Who can offer payroll giving? NO NO YESYES Do you file your returns\* electronically? Do you want to offer payroll giving to your employees? Set up your payroll giving scheme using your payroll software and inform your employees they can make donations to approved donee organisations. You can't offer payroll giving to your employees. If you want to offer the scheme, you need to file your returns electronically. To register for myIR go to ird.govt.nz/myIR Continue filing your returns as you currently do. Go to diagram on page 4. \* Employment information - IR348 Payroll giving ird.govt.nz 4 The employer's role As an employer you are responsible for: • deducting the requested donation amount from your employee's salary or wage • calculating the correct tax credits for each payroll donation made • recording the tax credits for payroll donations on your IR348 • keeping records of all tax credits for payroll donations, donation amounts, donee organisations and payment dates • passing the donation on to the chosen donee organisations within the specified timeframe • advising the donee organisations that the donations are made through payroll giving. How payroll giving works This flowchart shows the process to follow when you deduct donations from your employee's salary or wages and pass them on to the chosen donee organisations. NO NO YES NO YES YES Is the donation recipient on the approved donee organisation list? The donation should not be made using payroll giving. Do you have sufficient details to make the requested donation? Ask the employee for the missing details. Does the employee provide you with the missing details? Advise the employee you can't make the deduction as you don't have all the details you need. Deduct the donation on the requested pay period. Calculate the tax credits for payroll donations. Deduct the amount of tax credits for payroll donations from the employee's PAYE. Show the amount of tax credits for payroll donations on the IR348. Record the donee organisation, donation amount, tax credits for payroll donations amount and date of donation in your wage records. Show the donation and tax credits for payroll donations on the employee's pay slip. Pass the donation on to the donee organisation. Advise them the donations are from a payroll giving scheme. If the donee organisation issues a receipt keep this with your employer records. Payroll giving ird.govt.nz 5 Timeframe for passing on donations Donations have to be passed to the donee organisation on or before the PAYE payment due date that is closest to the end of the two months from the last day of the pay period when the donation was deducted. The following explanation and table show how the date is calculated: • Date A is the last day of the pay period. If the pay covers 1–30 June, the last day of the pay period is 30 June. • To find Date B, add two months to Date A. • Date C is the nearest PAYE payment due date to Date B. This could either be before or after Date B. Date C is the last day you can pass the donation on to the donee organisation. You can pass the donation on at any time up to and including this date.

Just tell us the amount of tax credits for payroll donations on your IR348. The donation and tax credits for payroll donations should show in your wage records and on your employee's pay slips. Setting up your payroll giving scheme You’ll need to register for myIR before you offer payroll giving. There are two options when filing online: • On-screen form where you complete details on your IR348 online. This may suit if you have a manual wage book. • File transfer through Gateway services where you attach a file from your own software. If you use an electronic payroll system this may suit you better. If you already use payroll software it may be set up for payroll giving in your workplace. Ask your payroll software provider for help if you have any questions about using their software to support your payroll giving scheme. You decide how payroll giving will run in your workplace but it's a good idea to involve your employees in the decision as they'll be using the scheme. Some options to consider when setting up your scheme include: • letting individual employees choose any approved donee organisation • offering a limited list of approved donee organisations • letting employees vote for an approved donee organisation (eg, donee organisation of the month or the year) that they can donate to • letting your employees promote their chosen donee organisation to each other then everyone voting for donee organisation of the month or the year. If your scheme allows it, the frequency, amount and donee organisations chosen by your individual employees can change at their discretion. Payroll giving ird.govt.nz 6 Your employee is responsible for checking their chosen donee organisation is on our approved list, but we recommend you check the list as well. If you use a payroll intermediary you can still choose to offer payroll giving to your employees. Here's how payroll giving could run in your workplace. Example 1 Company A files employment information electronically and decides to offer payroll giving to their employees. Each year, their employees select a charity, which they support with monthly fundraising activities. Company A limits their employees to donating to the chosen charity of the year. Example 2 Company B has 250 employees. It decides to offer payroll giving to its employees who can choose any approved donee organisation but a minimum donation amount (eg $10.00) is set. Example 3 Company C decides to offer payroll giving to their employees. They select five donee organisations and tell their staff these are the only donee organisations they can donate to. When you've decided how your scheme will run and when it will start, you need to let your staff know so they can decide if they're going to donate. The employee's role Employees are responsible for checking the donee organisation they choose is on the approved donee list. They're also responsible for giving you sufficient information for you to pass on their donation to the donee organisation. This includes: • donee organisation's name • amount of the donation • pay period, or periods, they want to donate in • bank account or postal address details for the donee organisation. Employees will receive tax credits for donations made through payroll giving in their pay. They cannot claim the same donations at the end of the year on the Tax credit claim form - IR526. Employees can use the IR526 to claim tax credits for donations not made through payroll giving. What is a donee organisation? A donee organisation is an organisation that has Inland Revenue donee status. Individuals, companies and Māori authorities can get certain tax benefits by making gifts of money to a donee organisation. A charity can also be a donee organisation. Note: Only Inland Revenue-approved donee organisations listed on our website at ird.govt.nz/donee are eligible to receive donations under payroll giving. If any of your employees ask you to donate to an organisation that isn't on our approved list, don't give them the tax credits. You may not wish to make the requested donation, but if you do, the donation made will not form part of the payroll giving scheme and not be eligible for tax credits for payroll donations. You may wish to discuss this with your employee. If you make a deduction for a donation and later discover the donee organisation isn't on the approved donee list, you must adjust the employee's PAYE. See page 11 "Correcting tax credits for payroll donations after you've filed your Employment information". Payroll giving ird.govt.nz 7 Calculating tax credits for payroll donations The tax credit for payroll donations is 33⅓ cents for each dollar donated. Calculate the tax credit for payroll donations and then reduce your employees' PAYE by the amount of this tax credit. Tax credits for payroll donations must not exceed the amount of tax for the pay period. Example Employee's gross wage$762.00 Donation amount$10.00 PAY E$150.08 Tax credit for payroll donation ($10.00 × 33⅓)$3.33 PAYE less tax credits for payroll donation$146.75 Employee's gross wage$762.00 less PAYE less tax credits for payroll donation$146.75 less donation$10.00 Employee's take home pay$605.25 You can use our PAYE/KiwiSaver calculator at ird.govt.nz/tools-calculators to calculate tax credits for payroll donations. Maximum donation amount Before donating, employees must have met all their tax obligations and had any legally required payments deducted from their pay. These include: • PAYE (tax and ACC earner levy) • student loan • child support • KiwiSaver. Example Paul’s tax code is M SL and he earns $1,400 a week. He is a KiwiSaver member contributing 4% of his pay and is also paying off his student loan. Paul wants to donate $200 to his local sports group, which is on the approved donee list. He checks the maximum donation he could make. Weekly wage$1,400.00 less PAYE$306.84 less KiwiSaver$56.00 less student loan$121.80 Maximum donation amount$915.36 He works out he could donate up to $885.87 so goes ahead with his donation of $200 and gets a tax credit of $66.66 ($200 donation × 33⅓%). Payroll giving ird.govt.nz 8 Employee pay details You need to provide each employee with a record of their donations and the tax credits they receive. Example Employee’s monthly pay slip. Gross wage$4,164.00 less PAYE (including ACC earners' levy)$724.14 less student loan$299.00 less KiwiSaver employee deduction$166.40 Donation (not on IR348)$150.00 Total deductions$1,340.80 plus tax credit for payroll donations$49.99 Take home pay (after donation)$2,873.19 The deductions for KiwiSaver and student loans have been calculated using the tax code M SL as at April 2020. The KiwiSaver employee deduction rate shown in this example is 4%. Payroll giving ird.govt.nz 9 Employment information You must record tax credits for payroll donations for your employee’s donations on your Employment information - IR348. The image below shows the employment information submission screen in your myIR payroll account. Use the ’Payroll donations’ field for this. Leave the field blank for any employees who don’t make donations. All tax credits for payroll donation entries will be added up and the total amount will show in the Total tax credits for payroll donations field. If you don’t offer payroll giving, these fields remain blank. Payroll giving ird.govt.nz 10 Employment information submissions You can check the details you’ve sent us by clicking on the “View submissions” box in your myIR Payroll returns account. If you want to see more details for an individual employee, simply select their name and a breakdown of their details will be displayed. 111-111-111 Payroll giving ird.govt.nz 11 Correcting tax credits for payroll donations after you’ve filed your IR348 If you’ve filed your employment information and then want to amend the tax credit amount you’ve recorded, you can do this in the Payroll returns account in myIR. Disallowed tax credits for payroll donations and penalties Situations where we will disallow tax credits for payroll donations include where a donation has been passed to a non-approved donee or where the donation has not been passed to the donee organisation within the specified timeframe. See page 5 to find out how to work out the timeframe. Keeping records Employers must keep any receipts received from donee organisations for donations made under the payroll giving scheme. Donee organisations may decide to issue receipts for donations made through payroll giving. These receipts should be clearly marked "payroll giving". Keep these receipts with your payroll records and don't include them as business or individual donation receipts for tax purposes. You may keep your records stored electronically, but you must be able to print them out if we ask you to. Keep all records for seven years.

If any of the other tests prove that a person (person A) and another person (person B) are associated, person A is treated as holding the interests of person B for tax purposes. Aggregation rule for land provisions For land transactions, the rule determines that a person (person A) and another person (person B) are associated if they're: • married, in a civil union, or in a de facto relationship • a parent and infant child • trustees of separate trusts with the same settlor • a trustee and a settlor • a trustee and a person with power to appoint or remove a trustee • a partner and a partnership • associated through the tripartite test. Beneficiary Generally this is a person who has benefited from or is eligible to benefit from a trust. Infant child A child by blood, adoption or marriage under the age of 20 years. Land provisions Land provisions are specific rules relating to land transactions. These principally address tax avoidance arrangements and structures that are used to alter the tax status of land transactions. The following areas have specific provisions relating to land transactions: two companies, a company and a person other than a company, two relatives, PIEs and entities eligible to be PIEs. The land provisions don't apply to the tests for person and trustee for relative (section YB 5), trustee and beneficiary (section YB 6), settlor and beneficiary (section YB 9). Market value circumstance A person's interest in a company is generally measured by their voting interests in the company. If, in certain circumstances, these voting interests don't accurately reflect the person's economic interest in a company, then the person's interests are also measured by their market value interests in the company. Generally this means looking outside the market value interest to see if voting rights are affected by shares, options, debentures or arrangements. Market value interest A person's market value interest in a company is measured where a market value circumstance exists. At any time, a person's market value interest equals their share of the total market value of shares and options held in the company. Narrow relatives test The definition under the two relatives test has a narrower application for the purposes of the land provisions (see 'Aggregation rule for land provisions' above). www.ird.govt.nz 5 Non-arm's length This generally refers to persons who for personal or family reasons enter into a transaction at a different value from the amount that would be paid by two independent persons. A non-arm's length transaction is one that isn't freely entered into between a willing vendor and purchaser. Person A person can be an individual, company, trustee of a trust, limited partnership, a partnership and any other separate entity. PIE Portfolio investment entity—a type of managed fund that makes and holds investments on behalf of its investors. Purpose trust and community trust These types of trusts don't have beneficiaries and therefore aren't associated under the beneficiary-related tests. Relative The definition of "relative" in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 has been simplified so that it extends only to the second degree of blood relationship. Previously the definition also extended for the purposes of some provisions to the fourth degree of blood relationship. The new definition of relative includes a trustee of a trust under which a relative has benefited or is eligible to benefit—this continues the effect of paragraph (c) (v) of the old relative definition. Settlor This is the person who sets up the trust and makes the initial settlement of funds to the trust. This can be as little as $1 especially when the trust is established by a professional advisor. The term "settlor" doesn't include a person who provides services to a trust for less than market value. Consequently, a professional advisor who provides free services to a trust will not be treated as a settlor of the trust. There is also an exception for the settlor of a charitable trust. Tr u s t e e A person who is responsible for the trust operating within the guidelines set out in the trust deed and trustee law. The trust isn't a legal entity so everything the trust does is carried out by the trustee of the trust. The trustees are for the most part legally responsible for the actions of the trust. 6 A guide to associated persons definitions for income tax purposes PART A Introduction The associated persons rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 are designed to ensure the tax treatment of transactions involving associated persons don't: • create a tax benefit • use the tax system to subsidise the cost of what are effectively private transactions • disguise the nature of a business or private transaction • disguise the person(s) involved in the transaction. Generally transactions that are non-arm's length need to be considered under the associated persons rules to ensure that they are treated the same from a tax perspective as if the transaction was made by two independent parties. Why are the rules required? The rules ensure the tax status of any transaction isn't changed when the parties involved are associated. For example, tax avoidance arrangements could be structured through associated persons to hide or disguise the true nature of a transaction. A transaction made by a person in business has a tax consequence. The same transaction, if conducted by someone for personal or non-business reasons, may not have a tax consequence. Therefore there could be an incentive to move transactions out of the business environment. What types of transactions could be involved? • Persons involved in property development could use associated structures such as trusts to move property transactions from their own taxable business environment to a capital (non-taxable) investment in a trust. This is one of the main areas of concern. • A tax deduction could be claimed for the loss made on the sale of an item that was heavily discounted when sold to a family member. • Employment-related benefits are often included in an employee's overall salary package. The benefit could be provided to an associate of the employee so the employee avoids paying tax. What are the rules designed to do? The rules have been designed to: • prevent changes to the tax treatment of a transaction by flowing it through an associated person or conducting the transaction with an associated person • ensure that a transaction between related parties is afforded the same tax treatment as if the transaction was conducted between arm's length parties. Transactions between associated persons are often required to be valued at market value and not at a price agreed between the parties. This is particularly relevant in a situation where the transaction is part of a business for only one of the parties. Under the land provisions, if a person associated to a property developer sells a property within 10 years of purchase, this transaction will generally be considered to be part of a business activity for tax purposes. How have the rules been changed? Amendments have been made to strengthen and rationalise the definitions of "associated persons" for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 2007. www.ird.govt.nz 7 The key changes include: • strengthening the definitions relating to trusts • aggregating the interests of associates to prevent the tests for associating two companies and a company and an individual being circumvented by the fragmentation of interests among close associates • implementing a tripartite test associating two persons if they are each associated with the same third person. This booklet provides an overview of the associated person provisions outlined in section YB of the Income Tax Act 2007 including the changes made in the Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Act 2009. Scenarios and examples have been included to help you determine if a person is associated under the associated person definitions. This is not an exhaustive list of scenarios and examples. When do the new rules apply? Transactions involving land For persons and associated persons who are involved in a building business, the new rules apply for land on which improvements started on or after 6 October 2009. For other persons and associated persons, the provisions apply for land acquired on or after 6 October 2009. Transactions other than land The changes to the other provisions apply to transactions occurring in 2010–11 and later income years. What are the tests? There are 11 tests to determine if two persons are associated. Test 1 Two companies (section YB 2): – common voting interests – common market value interests – control by any other means – aggregation rule—non-land provisions – aggregation rule—land provisions. Test 2 Company and person other than a company (section YB 3): – common voting interests – common market value interests – aggregation rule—non-land provisions – aggregation rule—land provisions. Test 3 Two relatives (section YB 4): – degrees of relationship—non-land provision – degrees of relationship—land provisions. Test 4 Person and a trustee for a relative (section YB 5). Test 5 Trustee and a beneficiary (section YB 6). Test 6 Two trustees of separate trusts with a common settlor (section YB 7). Test 7 Trustee and a settlor (section YB 8). Test 8 Settlor and a beneficiary (section YB 9). Test 9 Trustee and a person with power of appointment or removal (section YB 11). Test 10 Partnership and a partner (section YB 12). Test 11 Tripartite relationship (section YB 14). 8 A guide to associated persons definitions for income tax purposes PART B The following is an overview of each test. See Part D for further details Overview of each test Associating two companies – test 1 (a more limited version of the aggregation rule applies to land transactions) The primary test provides that two companies are associated if there is a group of persons whose total voting interests in each company are 50% or more. If the primary test does not apply the second part of the test provides that two companies are associated if a market value circumstance exists for either company and there is a group of persons whose total market value interests in each company are 50% or more. A person's interest in a company is generally measured by their voting interests in the company. If these voting interests in certain circumstances do not accurately reflect the person's economic interest in a company, then the person's interests are also measured by their market value interests in the company. Finally, two companies are associated if a group of persons controls both companies by any other means. For example a director of two companies who has virtual control of both companies. An aggregation rule provides that, in determining whether two companies are associated, a person is treated as holding the interests of the other person if tests 3 to 11 prove they are associated. This aggregation rule is designed to prevent the two companies test being circumvented by the fragmentation of interests among associated persons, resulting in the 50% interest threshold not being reached. A unit trust is a company for the purposes of the associated persons rules. Exceptions The control by any other means test does not apply to a company that is a state enterprise, Crown Research Institute, Crown Health Enterprise or a company that is part of the same group of companies as one of the Crown-related entities. In the international tax rules, two companies are not associated if one, but not both, is a non-resident. Associating a company and a person other than a company – test 2 The primary test provides that a company and a person other than a company are associated if the person has a voting interest in the company of 25% or more. If the primary test does not apply the second part of the test provides that a company and a person other than a company are associated persons if a market value circumstance exists for the company and the person has a market value interest in the company of 25% or more. An aggregation rule applies for the purposes of determining whether a company and a person other than a company are associated. A person is treated as holding the interests of the other person if tests 3 to 11 prove they are associated. As with the two companies test, the aggregation rule in the company and a person other than a company test is designed to prevent the test being circumvented by the fragmentation of interests among associated persons, resulting in the interest threshold of 25% not being reached. A more limited version of the aggregation rule applies for land transactions. www.ird.govt.nz 9 The holdings of the other person are only aggregated when the other person who isn't a company is associated by being: • a relative by marriage, civil union, or a de facto relationship under the relatives test (test 3), or • an infant child (under 20 yrs) under the relatives test (test 3), or • a person associated under tests 5, 6, 9, 10 or 11, or • a combination of the person and the other persons referred to above. A portfolio investment entity (PIE) or an entity eligible to be a PIE isn't included for the aggregation purposes of the test. A person other than a company includes a company acting in its capacity as a trustee of a trust. Associating two relatives – test 3 There are three aspects to this test: blood relation, relation by marriage and relation to in-laws. 1 Blood relationship This now extends only to the second degree of blood relationship, instead of the fourth degree as previously stipulated. This means that grandparents and siblings are included but not nephews and nieces (third degree) and cousins (fourth degree). An adopted child is treated as the natural child of the adoptive parents. 2 Relationship by marriage Two persons who are married, in a civil union, or in a de facto relationship are associated. 3 Relationship to in-laws Two persons are associated if one person is within two degrees of blood relationship to the other person's spouse, civil union partner, or de facto partner. This aspect associates persons with their in-laws and step-children. The first and third aspects of this test do not apply for land transactions. Instead, persons are associated because of a blood relationship only if one is the infant child (under 20 years) of the other. This rule applies for the other tests, particularly when considering if the tripartite test applies. Associating a person and a trustee for a relative – test 4 A person (first person) and a trustee of a trust are associated persons if a relative of the first person (as proven by two relatives test 3) has benefited or is eligible to benefit under the trust. For example, a husband and a trustee of a trust under which the husband's wife is a beneficiary would be associated under this test. Associating a trustee and beneficiary – test 5 A trustee of a trust and a person who has benefited or is eligible to benefit under the trust will be associated persons. This test doesn't apply for: • land transactions • certain employee trusts such as an employee superannuation fund • certain trusts such as energy consumer trusts and the trust administering bonus bonds. • beneficiaries that are charitable trusts. 10 A guide to associated persons definitions for income tax purposes Associating two trustees with common settlor – test 6 A trustee of a trust and a trustee of another trust are associated persons if the same person is a settlor of both trusts. There is an exception to this test for certain employee trusts. Associating a trustee and settlor – test 7 A trustee of a trust and a settlor of the trust are associated persons. There is an exception to this test for certain employee and charitable trusts. Associating a settlor and beneficiary – test 8 A settlor of a trust and a person who has benefited or is eligible to benefit under the trust are associated persons. This test doesn't apply for: • land transactions • certain employee trusts • beneficiaries that are charitable trusts. Associating a trustee and person with power of appointment – test 9 A trustee of a trust and a person who has the power to appoint or remove a trustee are associated persons. Associating a partnership and partner – test 10 A partnership and a partner in the partnership are associated persons. A separate test applies in the case of a limited partnership and a limited partner in that they are associated only if the limited partner has a share of 25% or more in the limited partnership. This includes a partnership share of 25% or more in a right, obligation, or other property, status, or thing of the limited partnership. A partner isn't associated to the other partners in the partnership under this test, but may be associated by one of the other tests. Under the aggregation rule, which applies only for limited partnerships in this test, anything held by one limited partner is treated as being held by the other limited partner if any of the tests have proved them to be associated. Associating under the tripartite relationship – test 11 The tripartite relationship (tripartite test) will associate two persons if they are each associated with the same third person under different tests. The tripartite test acts as an important buttress to the other associated persons tests and makes the associated persons definition as a whole more difficult to circumvent. The requirement that the two persons cannot be associated with the same third person under the tripartite test itself is necessary to prevent the tripartite test operating in a reiterative manner. www.ird.govt.nz 11 PART C Associating two companies YB 2 Test 1 Common voting interests YB 2(1) If 50% or more of the voting interests in two companies is held by the same group (a "group" could include companies, individuals, trusts, partnerships, unit trusts, PIEs, or any combination of these entities or one person), the two companies are associated. Example 1 There are two companies, Company 1 and Company 2. The AEC Trust and John hold between them 50% of the voting power for decisions made by Company 1, and 55% of the voting power for decisions made by Company 2. As the group (consisting of the AEC Trust and John) has a common voting interest of at least 50% in Company 1 and Company 2, Company 1 and Company 2 will be associated to each other. This will mean for example, if either Company 1 or Company 2 is a property developer and the other isn't, any land transactions carried out by either associated party will generally be taxable.

Example 2 Alan (person A) and an unrelated person each own 50% of the shares in Company 1. Alan, Alan's wife Betty (person B) and an unrelated second person each own 33% of the shares in Company 2. As Alan and Betty are associated to each other under the two relatives test (test 3), Alan is treated as holding Betty's shares in Company 2 giving him a total of 66% of the shares. Alan therefore holds 50% in Company 1 and 66% in Company 2 making the two companies associated.

Example 3 Marie owns 5 shares in Company 1. Marie also settled a trust that Mark is a trustee of. Mark owns 22 shares in Company 1.

Example 4 The KMF Partnership (A above) has a 40% voting interest in Company 1. As the KMF Partnership has a voting interest in Company 1 of more than 25%, the partnership and the company will be associated. This will mean for example, if either the company or the partnership is a property developer and the other isn't, any land transactions carried out by either party will generally be taxable.

Example 5 Marie holds 5 shares in Company 1. Marie is also a partner in the KMF Partnership which holds 27 shares in Company 1. As Marie is associated to the partnership under the partnership and partner test (test 10), both she and the KMF Partnership are deemed to hold 32 shares in Company 1 for the purposes of example 4 (see page 14).

This means there are only two scenarios where two relatives are associated for the purpose of the land provisions: Scenario 1: A person is related to their spouse, civil union partner or de factor partner Scenario 2: A person is related to their child who is under 20 (including an adopted child).

Key features of the reforms The reforms to the associated persons definitions generally involve replacing the definitions with the objective of strengthening them. The other major part of the reforms involves rationalising these definitions and other income tax provisions which employ a similar concept. The changes aim to give effect to the policy intention of capturing non-arm's length transactions, while not applying more widely than is necessary to protect the tax base. The 11 associated persons tests generally apply for the purposes of the Income Tax Act. The main exception is in the land provisions where modifications are made so the associated persons definitions cover situations under the effective control of property dealers, developers and builders, but do not apply to other situations. The tests for determining whether two companies, or a company and a person other than a company, are associated persons include rules that aggregate the interests of associates. This prevents the company-related tests being circumvented by the fragmentation of interests among associated persons. The test for associating relatives is reduced from four degrees of blood relationship to two degrees only. This test is further limited to spouses and parents and their infant children for the purposes of the land provisions and compliance cost-saving provisions relating to low turnover traders and adverse event livestock transfers. The weaknesses in the previous general associated persons definition in relation to trusts have been addressed by including tests associating a trustee and beneficiary, trustee and settlor, two trustees with common settlor, settlor and beneficiary, and a trustee and a person with the power to appoint or remove the trustee. A number of modifications apply to the trust-based tests to ensure that the associated persons definitions do not apply more widely than is necessary to protect the tax base. They include: • Not applying the beneficiary-based associated persons tests (the trustee-beneficiary and settlor-beneficiary tests), and the test associating a person and a trustee for a relative in the case of land sales. It is not necessary to apply these tests to catch the type of structures being used to circumvent the land sale tax rules; the structures causing concern can be caught by other associated persons tests—in particular, the settlor-based trust and tripartite tests. • Not treating charitable organisations as beneficiaries for the purposes of the trustee and beneficiary, and settlor and beneficiary tests and excluding charitable trusts from the trustee and settlor test. • The definition of "settlor" that applies for the purposes of the associated persons tests will not include a person who provides services to a trust for less than market value. Persons who are married, in a civil union, or in a de facto relationship are treated as the same single person for the purpose of identifying a common settlor under the two trustees with a common settlor test in section YB 7. This treatment prevents the new associated persons definition being circumvented by the use of "mirror trusts". The new associated persons definition introduces a tripartite test which associates two persons if they are each associated with the same third person, under different associated persons tests. The tripartite test acts as an important buttress to the other associated persons tests and makes the associated persons definition as a whole more difficult to circumvent. The reforms also rationalise the current income tax definition of associated persons and other income tax provisions that employ a similar concept, such as the definition of "related person" in the dividend rules. This represents a significant simplification and makes the associated persons concept in the Income Tax Act more coherent. www.ird.govt.nz 31 Application date The general application date for the reforms (excluding those applying for the land provisions) is the 2010–11 and later income years. For the purposes of the land provisions (as defined in section YA 1), except for the section which relates to disposal of land within 10 years of completing improvements (section CB 11), the reforms apply to land acquired on or after 6 October 2009, the date of enactment. Given that association is tested in the land provisions at the time of acquisition, this means that for land acquired before 6 October 2009 the former associated persons definitions are the relevant provisions in determining whether the sale of such land is taxable. For the purposes of section CB 11, the reforms apply to land on which improvements started on or after 6 October 2009. Therefore, in the case of the land provisions, the relevant application date is 6 October 2009 irrespective of a person's balance date. Detailed analysis Subpart YB containing the associated persons definition rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 has been substantially replaced. New section YB 1(4) states the general rule that the various associated persons tests in subpart YB apply for the purposes of the whole Act unless a provision expressly states otherwise. The main situation where certain exceptions will apply in the new associated persons tests is the land provisions, which are defined in section YA 1. For example, a narrow range of relatives (namely, spouses, civil union partners, de facto partners and infant children) applies in the new associated persons definitions for the purposes of the land provisions. New sections YB 1(5) to (8) contain cross-references to several special rules that modify the associated persons definitions for the purpose of specific provisions. These special rules are contained in sections DS 4 (Meaning of film reimbursement scheme), EB 13 (Low-turnover valuation), EX 4 (Limits to requirement to include associated person interests in the controlled foreign company rules), and LP 2 (Tax credits for supplementary dividends). These special rules have not been changed as part of this reform. Two companies test (section YB 2) Section YB 2 contains the test for associating two companies. Two companies will be associated if: • there is a group of persons whose total voting interests in each company are 50% or more—this is the primary test for associating two companies. The concept of voting interests is defined in subpart YC. • a market value circumstance exists for either company and there is a group of persons whose total market value interests in each company are 50% or more. A "market value circumstance" is defined in section YA 1 and a "market value interest" is defined in subpart YC. Under the measurement of company ownership rules in subpart YC, a person's interest in a company is generally measured by reference to the person's voting interests in the company. If these voting interests in certain circumstances—coming within the definition of "market value circumstance" in section YA 1—do not reflect accurately the person's economic interest in a company then the person's interests are also measured by reference to the person's market value interests in the company. • there is a group of persons who control both companies by any other means. 32 A guide to associated persons definitions for income tax purposes Aggregation rule two companies The test associating two companies contains a general aggregation rule which provides that in determining whether two companies are associated, a person is treated as holding anything held by persons associated with that person under sections YB 4 to YB 14 (section YB 2(4)). This rule applies for the purposes of the whole Act except the land provisions. The aggregation rule is designed to prevent the two companies test being circumvented by the fragmentation of interests among associated persons, resulting in the 50% interest threshold not being reached. The two companies test contains a separate rule which aggregates the interests of associates for the purposes of the land provisions (section YB 2(5)). Under this rule, a person is treated as holding anything held by persons associated with them under the limited relatives definition in section YB 4 (namely, spouses, civil union partners, de facto partners and infant children) and under the tests in sections YB 7, YB 8, and YB 10 to YB 14. This modification ensures that for the purposes of the land provisions, the general relatives test and the beneficiary- related trust tests do not apply in the aggregation rule for the test associating two companies. When applying the rules aggregating the interest of associates, the rule is applied afresh to each person and it is irrelevant that a person does not directly hold any shares in a company before the application of the aggregation rule. Example Application of general aggregation rule in two companies test Suzy Tr u s t Company A Suzy Co Company B 100% 100% Associated under the tripartite test in YB 14 Power of appointment www.ird.govt.nz 33 In this example the aggregation rule, in conjunction with the tripartite test, can be applied to treat Suzy as holding Trust's shares in Company B. Specifically, Suzy is associated with Suzy Co under the company and person other than a company test in section YB 3, and Suzy Co (with power of appointment of the trustees of Trust) is associated with Trust under section YB 11. Therefore, Suzy and Trust are associated under the tripartite test, and the aggregation rule in section YB 2(4) treats Suzy as holding Trust's shares in Company B. Taking into account the shares Suzy holds directly in Company A, Company A and Company B are associated under the two companies test in section YB 2. Example Application of general aggregation rule in two companies test In this example, the question is whether Company A and Company B are associated. First, in conjunction with the relatives test in section YB 4, the aggregation rule in section YB 2(4) is applied so that John is treated as holding anything held by his associates. In this case, John is treated as holding Jo's shares in Company A through his association with Jo under the relatives test in section YB 4. Secondly, the aggregation rule, in conjunction with the tripartite test, can also be applied to treat John as holding Trust's shares in Company B. This is because John is associated with Trust under the tripartite test in section YB 14. Specifically, John is associated with John Co under the company and person other than a company test in section YB 3, and John Co (as beneficiary of Trust) is associated with Trust under the trustee and beneficiary test in section YB 6. Therefore, John and Trust are associated under the tripartite test, and the aggregation rule in section YB 2(4) treats John as holding Trust's shares in Company B. As a result, because John is treated as holding all the shares in Company A and Company B under section YB 2(4), Company A and Company B are associated under section YB 2. Jo Tr u s t Company A John Co Company B 100% 100% Associated under the tripartite test in YB 14 Beneficiary of Trust John (Jo's son) 100% YB 4 34 A guide to associated persons definitions for income tax purposes It is irrelevant that John does not directly hold shares in Company A and Company B before the application of the aggregation rule in section YB 2(4). Example Application of aggregation rule in two companies test in the context of the land provisions In this example, the husband owns 100% of the voting interests in Company A, which is a property developer, and his wife holds 100% of the voting interests in Company B, which sells some land within 10 years of acquisition. Without the aggregation rule in section YB 2(5), the two companies would not be associated despite their close community of interests. The application of the aggregation rule ensures that the two companies are associated under section YB 2, resulting in Company B being liable to tax on the sale of the land. Husband Wife Company A (Developer) 100% 100% Company B (sells land) www.ird.govt.nz 35 Example Application of aggregation rule in two companies test in the context of the land provisions In this example, Trust A and Trust B are associated under the two trustees with common settlor test in section YB 7. Trust A owns 100% of the voting interests in Company A, which is a property developer, and Trust B owns 100% of the voting interests in Company B, which sells some land within 10 years of acquisition. The two companies are associated under the two companies test through the use of the aggregation rule contained in that test. Applying the aggregation rule to this example, Trust A is treated as holding anything held by persons associated with it. In this case, Trust A and Trust B are associated under the two trustees with common settlor test in section YB 7. Accordingly, taking into account Trust A's direct shareholding in Company A, Trust A is treated as holding all the voting interests in Company A and Company B, meaning these two companies are associated. The aggregation rule can also be applied to treat the common settlor as holding all the voting interests in Company A and Company B because the settlor is associated with Trust A and Trust B under the trustee- settlor test in section YB 8. This also means the two companies are associated. A result of Company A and Company B being associated is that Company B is liable to tax on the sale of land. Without the aggregation rule, Company A and Company B would not be associated despite their close community of interests. Settlor Company A (Developer) 100% 100% Company B (sells land) Trust A Trust B 36 A guide to associated persons definitions for income tax purposes Other features The two companies test provides that the control by any other means limb in the test does not apply to a company that is a state enterprise, Crown Research Institute, Crown Health Enterprise or a company that is part of the same group of companies as one of these Crown-related entities (section YB 2(6)). It also provides that in the international tax rules (defined in section YA 1) two companies are not associated if one, but not both, is a non-resident (section YB 2(7)). Additionally, for the purposes of the land provisions, two companies are not associated persons if one is a portfolio investment entity (PIE) or an entity that qualifies for PIE status (section YB 2(8)). This exception ensures that a widely held managed fund is not adversely affected because of the personal land dealings of the directors of the fund. Company and person other than a company test (section YB 3) Section YB 3 contains the test for associating a company and a person other than a company. A company and a person other than a company are associated if: • the person has a voting interest in the company of 25% or more. The concept of voting interests is defined in subpart YC. • a market value circumstance exists for the company and the person has a market value interest in the company of 25% or more. A "market value circumstance" is defined in section YA 1, and a "market value interest" is defined in subpart YC. Under the measurement of company ownership rules in subpart YC, a person's interest in a company is generally measured by reference to the person's voting interests in the company. If these voting interests in certain circumstances—coming within the definition of "market value circumstance" in section YA 1—do not reflect accurately the person's economic interest in a company then the person's interests are also measured by reference to the person's market value interests in the company. Aggregation rule company and individual The test associating a company and person other than a company test contains a general aggregation rule, which applies for the purposes of the whole Act except the land provisions (section YB 3(3)). Accordingly, for the purposes of determining whether a company and a person other than a company are associated, a person is treated as holding anything held by persons associated with the person under sections YB 4 to YB 14. This aggregation rule is designed to prevent the test associating a company and a person other than a company being circumvented by the fragmentation of interests among associated persons, resulting in the interest threshold of 25% not being reached. The test associating a company and a person other than a company contains a separate rule which aggregates the interests of associates for the purposes of the land provisions (section YB 3(4)). Under this rule, a person is treated as holding anything held by persons associated with the person under the limited relatives definition in sections YB 4 (namely, spouses, civil union partners, de facto partners and infant children) and under the tests in sections YB 7, YB 8, and YB 10 to YB 14. This modification ensures that for the purposes of the land provisions, the general relatives test and the beneficiary-related trust tests do not apply in the aggregation rule for the test associating a company and person other than a company. When applying the rule aggregating the interests of associates, the rule is applied afresh to each person being tested for association with a company and it is irrelevant that a person does not directly hold shares in a company before the application of the aggregation rule. The aggregation rules are an element of both of the company-based tests in sections YB 2 and YB 3. As noted above, the aggregation rules are designed to prevent these tests being circumvented by the fragmentation of interests among associated persons, resulting in the interest thresholds in these tests not being met. As such, the aggregation rules do not act as separate associated persons tests. www.ird.govt.nz 37 Example Application of the general aggregation rule in the company and person other than a company test Without an aggregation rule, neither Sister A, B nor C would be associated with Family Company under the company and person other than a company test because their respective interests do not meet the required 25% threshold. However, under the aggregation rule in section YB 3(3), each sister would be associated with the company. This is because for the purposes of determining whether Sister A is associated with Family Company under section YB 3(1), she is treated as holding her sisters' 20% voting interests in the company (10% each from Sister B and Sister C). This 20%, when aggregated with her own 10% voting interest, means that Sister A is treated as holding a 30% interest and, therefore, is associated with the company. The aggregation rule applies afresh to each person—so similarly, Sister B and Sister C are each treated as holding the other two sisters' aggregate 20% voting interests in the company. Therefore, when aggregated with the 10% interest they each own in the company, Sister B and Sister C are each associated with Family Company. Sister B 10% 10% Family Company Sister ASister C 10% 38 A guide to associated persons definitions for income tax purposes Example Application of the general aggregation rule in the company and person other than a company test Jo settles Family Trusts 1 and 2 and arranges for each of them to hold 20% of the shares in Family Co. Jo also arranges for her spouse and child to hold 20% each in Family Co. Jo directly holds only 20%. Under the aggregation rule in section YB 3(3), Jo is treated as holding the shares in Family Co held by the family trusts and relatives because they are her associates. Accordingly, Jo is associated with Family Co. Without the rule aggregating the interests held by associated persons Jo would not be associated with Family Co despite the close community of interests. Jo Family Trust 1 Jo's spouse settles 20% Family Co settles Jo's child Family Trust 2 20%20% 20% 20% www.ird.govt.nz 39 Example Application of aggregation rule in the company and person other than a company test in the context of the land provisions The question in this case is whether the appointer of the trustee in Trust 2 is associated with Developer Co under the test in section YB 3 associating a company and a person other than a company. The appointer is associated with Developer Co under this test because of the application of the aggregation rule for land provisions in section YB 3(4) which treats a person as holding anything held by their associates. The appointer is associated with Trust 1 under the tripartite test in section YB 14. Specifically, the appointer is associated with Trust 2 under the test in section YB 11 associating a trustee and their appointer, and Trust 2 is associated with Trust 1 under the test in section YB 7 associating two trustees with a common settlor. Therefore, under the aggregation rule for land provisions in section YB 3(4) the appointer is treated as holding Trust 1's shares in Developer Co. Accordingly, the appointer and Developer Co are associated under section YB 3. Note, however, that the relative of the appointer would not be associated with Developer Co. In particular, the tripartite test does not associate Trust 1 and the relative and therefore the relative is not treated as holding Trust 1's shares in Developer Co. The aggregation rule is applied afresh to the relative, and not to the appointer, for the purposes of determining whether the relative is associated with Developer Co. Therefore, the fact that the appointer is treated under the aggregation rule as holding Trust 1's shares when testing for association between the appointer and Developer Co is disregarded when testing for association between the relative and Developer Co. Developer Co Settlor YB 3 100% Trust 1 Trust 2 Appointer Relative 40 A guide to associated persons definitions for income tax purposes Corporate trustees In section YB 3, "a person other than a company" includes a company acting in its capacity as a trustee of a trust (section YB 3(5)). This amendment is of a clarifying nature only and is consistent with long-standing policy (Tax Information Bulletin (TIB), Vol 3, No 7, April 1992 at page 23). The company look-through rules in subpart YC applying to voting and market value interests do not apply to a corporate trustee; therefore, the voting interests or market value interests held by a corporate trustee are not traced through to the shareholders of that corporate trustee. This treatment is a result of the separate capacity that a trustee (whether a company or natural person) has under the Income Tax Act 2007, and is recognised in the definition of "trustee" in section YA 1 which refers to a trustee "only in the capacity of trustee of the trust". This separate trustee capacity feature of the income tax law has been maintained in the new associated persons definitions. Therefore the shareholders of a corporate trustee are not relevant when testing for association between that trustee and other persons. This is consistent with the general position under the Income Tax Act, which is that a company acting in its capacity as trustee is treated as a trustee rather than a company. This means that the relevant test for determining association between a corporate trustee and a company in which the corporate trustee is a shareholder is section YB 3. Relatives test (section YB 4) There are three limbs to the general relatives test in the new associated persons definitions: • The first limb associates two persons who are within two degrees of blood relationship (section YB 4(1)(a)). Previously the general relatives test extended to the fourth degree of blood relationship. This means that the blood relationships limb of the general relatives test extends to grandparents and siblings but not to nephews and nieces (third degree) and cousins (fourth degree) as the previous test did. • The second limb associates two persons who are married, in a civil union, or in a de facto relationship (section YB 4(1)(b)). • The third limb associates two persons if one person is within two degrees of blood relationship to the other person's spouse, civil union partner, or de facto partner (section YB 4(1)(c)). This limb associates persons with their in-laws and step-children. For the purposes of the relatives associated persons test, a child by adoption is treated as a natural child of the adoptive parents and not as a natural child of the birth parents (section YB 4(3)). A new provision (section YB 4(4)) has been added to the test associating two relatives to ensure that a person is not associated with another person if the person cannot reasonably be expected to know that the other person exists or that they are within two degrees of blood relationship to the other person. This exclusion is designed to deal with a small minority of situations such as when siblings are separated at a very young age and do not know of each other's existence. Narrower application of relatives test in certain cases (section YB 4(2)) The first and third limbs (section YB 4(1)(a) and (c)) of the general relatives test of association do not apply for the purposes of the land provisions (defined in section YA 1) or two compliance-cost saving provisions in the Income Tax Act—namely, the low turnover trader provision in section EB 13, and the provision relating to the adverse event livestock transfers in section EC 5. In these circumstances, persons are associated because of a blood relationship only if one is the infant child of the other. An "infant child" is defined in the Age of Majority Act 1970 as a person under 20 years of age. www.ird.govt.nz 41 Example Application of narrow relatives test in section YB 4(2) Under the trading stock provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007, there are special low-compliance cost rules which apply to a "low-turnover trader". For a person to be a low-turnover trader, the turnover of that person's business, when aggregated with the turnover of associated persons, must be no more than $3 million. In this example, because a narrow relatives test applies for the purposes of the low-turnover trader rules, Adult Sam and his step-mothers' company are not associated and therefore Sam is entitled to use the low-turnover trader rules for his business. In particular, because Adult Sam is not treated under the relatives test in section YB 4 as being associated with his step-mother, the aggregation rule in the test in section YB 3 associating a company and a person other than a company does not apply to treat Adult Sam as holding his step-mother's shares in her company. If the ordinary relatives associated persons test had applied to the low-turnover trader rules Sam would be treated as being associated with his step-mothers' company under section YB 3 and therefore would not have been entitled to use the low-turnover trader rules. Father's new wife (step-mother) Father 100% X Adult Sam ($150,000 turnover) Step-mother’s company (3 million turnover) 42 A guide to associated persons definitions for income tax purposes Trustee for relative test (section YB 5) A person (first person) and a trustee of a trust under which a relative (as defined in section YB 4) of the first person has benefited or is eligible to benefit are associated persons under new section YB 5. For example, a husband and a trustee of a trust under which the husband's wife is a beneficiary would be associated under this test. The trustee for relative test does not apply for the purposes of the land provisions. This is consistent with the land provision exclusions in the other beneficiary-related tests in section YB 6 (trustee and beneficiary) and YB 9 (settlor and beneficiary). Example Person and trustee for relative: exception for the purposes of the land provisions Because the trustee for relative test does not apply for the purposes of the land provisions, the husband would not be associated with the trustee of the trust under which his wife is a beneficiary. Under the previous trustee for relative test in former section YB 12, the husband would have been associated with the trustee for the purposes of the land provisions. Additionally, as further discussed below, this test does not apply to energy consumer trusts established under the Energy Companies Act 1992 or the unit trust administering bonus bonds (section YB 16). Husband Wife Trustee (Developer) Beneficiary of trust X www.ird.govt.nz 43 Trustee and beneficiary test (section YB 6) A trustee of a trust and a person who has benefited or is eligible to benefit under the trust are associated persons under new section YB 6. This provision does not apply for the purposes of the land provisions. Persons have benefited under a trust if they have received a distribution under the trust. Inland Revenue's long-standing policy on when a person is eligible to benefit under a trust will continue (Ta x Information Bulletin (TIB), Vol 7, No 9, February 1996 at page 25). In particular, a person is "eligible to benefit" when the person is either: • named by the trustee as a potential beneficiary, or • designated as a member of a class of potential beneficiaries, for example, "the children of ...". When trustees have a general power of appointment, persons not already appointed as beneficiaries under the power are not treated as being eligible to benefit. Therefore, a person who is eligible to benefit under a trust (as described above) does not need to have actually received a distribution (as defined in section HC 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007) under the trust to qualify as a beneficiary. An exception to the trustee and beneficiary test for certain employee trusts is contained in section YB 15. Additionally, as with section YB 5, this test does not apply to energy consumer trusts or the unit trust administering bonus bonds (section YB 16). The trustee and beneficiary test (and other trustee-related tests) are not relevant to unit trust investment vehicles. This is because such unit trusts are treated as companies for all income tax purposes. This means that it is the company related tests—in particular, section YB 3—that are the relevant associated persons tests. The 25% threshold in section YB 3 would ensure that retail investors would not be associated with widely held public unit trusts. The trustee and beneficiary test (and other beneficiary-related tests) are not relevant to purpose trusts such as charitable trusts and community trusts referred to in the Community Trusts Act 1999 (these trusts were established to hold the shares in the successor companies to the former trustee banks). This is because purpose trusts do not at law have beneficiaries. The previous general definition of associated persons did not contain a trustee and beneficiary test. This constituted a significant omission in test coverage and transactions were often structured to take advantage of the loophole. Without a trustee and beneficiary test in the associated persons definitions, many of the operative rules in the Income Tax Act using the general associated persons definition could be readily circumvented by simply interposing a discretionary trust. 44 A guide to associated persons definitions for income tax purposes Example In this example, the company provides a benefit to a beneficiary of its trustee shareholder. The company provides the benefit because the trustee is its sole shareholder. Section CD 6(1)(a)(ii) in the dividend rules treats payments to associated persons of shareholders as dividends. However, without a trustee and beneficiary test, this simple arrangement would avoid the dividend rules. Under the new trustee and beneficiary test, because the company is providing a benefit to an associated person (Beneficiary) of a shareholder in the company (Trust), the company has made a dividend to the beneficiary under section CD 6(1)(a)(ii). Example In this example, an employer provides a low interest loan to a trust under which an employee is a beneficiary. Under section CX 18, FBT applies to fringe benefits provided to associated persons of employees. Without the trustee and beneficiary test in section YB 6, this simple arrangement avoids this rule. However, because of the new trustee and beneficiary test, the employer would be providing a fringe benefit (the low interest loan) to an associated person of the employee (the Trust) and would therefore be subject to FBT. Beneficiary Tr u s t Company benefit 100% Employer Tr u s t low interest loan Employee (Beneficiary) distribution www.ird.govt.nz 45 Two trustees with common settlor test (section YB 7) Under new section YB 7, a trustee of a trust and a trustee of another trust are associated persons if the same person is a settlor of both trusts. New section YB 10 provides that for the purposes of the new section YB 7, "settlor" has the meaning set out in section HC 27 of the Income Tax Act 2007, but does not include a person who provides services to a trust for less than market value. An exception to the two trustees with common settlor test for certain employee trusts is contained in section YB 15. Without a test associating two trustees with a common settlor many of the operative rules in the Income Tax Act which use the associated persons definition, such as the dividend rules, could be circumvented by structures such as the following example. Example In this example, Megan settles Family Trust 1, a trust that owns all of the shares in Family Co. Megan also settles Family Trust 2 whose discretionary beneficiaries include Megan's children and Megan herself. Family Co. makes a payment to Family Trust 2. Under the dividend rules in sections CD 3 to CD 6 of the Income Tax Act, any payment made by a company to an associated person of a shareholder of the company is treated as a dividend if that payment would have been a dividend if it had been made to the shareholder. Megan Family Trust 1 settles Family Co settles Family Trust 2 100% payment YB 7 Megan and Megan's children distribution to beneficiaries 46 A guide to associated persons definitions for income tax purposes In the absence of a two trustees with common settlor test, Family Co has not made a payment to an associated person of its shareholder (Family Trust 1), in terms of section CD 6(1)(a)(ii). Therefore, the payment from Family Co to Family Trust 2 would not be treated as a dividend. Under the new two trustees with common settlor test in section YB 7, Family Trust 1 and Family Trust 2 are associated persons as they have a common settlor (Megan). Therefore, the payment from Family Co to Family Trust 2 (an associated person of Family Co's shareholder, Family Trust 1) is treated as a dividend. Two trustees with common settlor: mirror trusts For the purposes of the two trustees with a common settlor test in section YB 7, two persons who are married, in a civil union, or in a de facto relationship are treated as the same single person. This is relevant to identifying a common settlor of two trusts, and prevents the new associated persons definition being circumvented by the use of "mirror trusts". This is illustrated in the following example. Example In this example spouse A settles a family trust (Trust A) for the benefit of spouse B and spouse B settles another family trust (Trust B) for the benefit of spouse A. Without the provision in the two trustees with common settlor test treating two persons who are married, in a civil union, or in a de facto relationship as the same single person, the trustees of Trust A and Trust B would not be associated despite the close community of interests. The trustees of Trust A and Trust B are associated under new section YB 7 because Spouse A and Spouse B are treated as the same single person and therefore the trustees of Trust A and Trust B have a common settlor. YB 7 Spouse A beneficiary Trust A Trust B Spouse B settlessettles Spouse A Spouse B beneficiary www.ird.govt.nz 47 Trustee and settlor test (section YB 8) A trustee of a trust and a settlor of the trust are associated persons under new section YB 8. New section YB 10 provides that for the purposes of new section YB 8, "settlor" has the meaning set out in section HC 27, with the modification that a settlor does not include a person who provides services to a trust for less than market value. An exception to the trustee and settlor test for certain employee trusts is contained in section YB 15. As with the other trustee-related tests, the trustee and settlor test is an important element of the new associated persons definitions. Without this test in the associated persons definitions, schemes could be developed to exploit such a loophole. This is illustrated by the following examples. Example In this example, Family Co makes a payment to Family Trust. Ben is the sole shareholder of Family Co and the settlor of Family Trust. Without a trustee and settlor test in the associated persons definition the payment from Family Co to Family Trust is not caught as a dividend despite the close community of interests. This is because Family Trust would not be associated with Ben who is the sole shareholder of Family Co. Under the new trustee and settlor test in section YB 8, Ben and Family Trust are associated persons as Ben is the settlor of Family Trust. The payment from Family Co to the Family Trust is accordingly treated as a dividend because Family Co has made a payment to an associated person (Family Trust) of its shareholder (Ben) in terms of section CD 6(1)(a)(ii). settles Family Co 100% Family Tr u s t payment Ben's children distribution to beneficiaries Ben 48 A guide to associated persons definitions for income tax purposes Example Non-resident settlor In this example, a non-resident settles a New Zealand trust (with a New Zealand-incorporated company as trustee) which owns New Zealand land and buildings. This investment by the trustee is funded by a loan from the non-resident settlor. If the non-resident is not associated with the New Zealand trustee, then the interest paid on this loan qualifies for the approved issuer levy (AIL) of 2% instead of being subject to the higher NRWT (non-resident withholding tax) rate. The previous associated persons definition used in the AIL rules was generally deficient in relation to arrangements involving trusts. In this example in particular, without a trustee and settlor test of association, the interest would qualify for AIL treatment despite the in-substance association between the two parties. The new trustee and settlor test in section YB 8 would associate the non-resident with the New Zealand trustee. Accordingly, the interest derived by the non-resident from New Zealand would be subject to a higher rate of NRWT instead of AIL at 2%, which is the appropriate treatment. Settlor and beneficiary test (section YB 9) A settlor of a trust and a person who has benefited or is eligible to benefit under the trust are associated persons under section YB 9. This test does not apply for the purposes of the land provisions (as defined in section YA 1). The settlor and beneficiary test is the third test of association (the others being the trustees with a common settlor and trustee and settlor tests) that is based on the settlor of a trust. This focus on the settlor is consistent with the settlor-based focus of the trust taxation rules. Given that there is a sufficient connection between a trustee and a beneficiary, as well as between a trustee and a settlor to justify treating them as associated persons, there is equally a sufficient connection between a settlor and a beneficiary to justify treating them as associated persons as well. An exception to the settlor and beneficiary test for certain employee trusts is also contained in section YB 15. Non-resident (beneficiary) settles New Zealand Trust (holding NZ property) loan interest www.ird.govt.nz 49 Definition of settlor (section YB 10) As mentioned, for the purposes of the settlor-based tests in sections YB 7 to YB 9, settlor has the meaning set out in section HC 27, with the modification that a settlor does not include a person who provides services to a trust for less than market value. This modification prevents a professional advisor who provides services to a trust at no charge being treated as a settlor of the trust. The term "settlor" has a wide meaning under section HC 27 definition of that term. A settlor of a trust is defined to mean broadly a person who transfers value to a trust. The definition of settlor is further extended by the provisions of section HC 28, the most significant of which are: • When a company makes a settlement, any shareholder with an interest of 10% or more in that company is treated as a settlor in relation to that settlement as well as the company itself. • When a trustee of a trust (the first trust) settles another trust (the second trust), the settlor of the second trust is treated as including any person who is a settlor of the first trust. • When a person has any rights or powers in relation to a trustee or settlor of a trust which enables the person to require the trustee to treat the person (or any nominee) as a beneficiary of the trust, the person is treated as a settlor of that trust. The definition of "settlor" is used extensively in the Income Tax Act and its wide meaning is consistent with the settlor-based focus of the trust taxation rules in the Income Tax Act. The definition of "settlor", in conjunction with the nominee look-through rule in section YB 21, does not include professional advisors acting on behalf of clients and other persons such as friends and family members who simply allow their name to be listed as the settlor on a trust deed. The definition of "settlor" that is being used is essentially the same as that originally enacted in 1988 as part of a reform of the trust rules (with the exception that the provision of services at less than market value are excluded). The main focus of this definition is on persons who provide the trust property, and therefore does not include persons who merely allow their name to go on the trust deed as the named settlor. It is therefore the client of the professional advisor, or the person that the friend or family member is acting for, who is treated as the settlor under the settlor-based tests in sections YB 7 to YB 9. This position is consistent with Inland Revenue's long-standing policy. Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) of November 1989 on the trust rules at paragraph 6.93 states: "Often professional advisers or relatives will assist in establishing a trust by settling a nominal sum on trust on behalf of another person. In these circumstances it is not appropriate to expose the professional adviser or relative to a potential tax liability. The professional adviser or relative is not the real settlor of the trust but is in effect only an intermediary or facilitator. The real settlor is the person on whose behalf the professional adviser or relative acted in making the settlement. Thus, s.226(3) \[now section YB 21 of the Income Tax Act 2007\] treats the person for whom the nominee or the nominal settlor acted as the settlor rather than the nominee or nominal settlor." Trustee and person with power of appointment or removal test (section YB 11) A trustee of a trust and person who has a power of appointment or removal of the trustee are associated persons under section YB 11. This test is intended to complement the test associating a trustee and settlor in section YB 8. In many cases, a settlor of a trust, as the author of the instrument creating and governing the administration of the trust, retains the power to appoint or remove trustees. However, this power could be reposed in a separate person. There is sufficient connection between a trustee of a trust and the person who has the power to appoint or remove the trustee to justify treating them as associated persons. 50 A guide to associated persons definitions for income tax purposes The situations considered to be caught by the test in section YB 11 associating a trustee and a person with the power of appointment or removal of the trustee include: • a person who holds a power to appoint or remove trustees jointly with another person • a person who holds a power to appoint or remove trustees only with the consent of another person (often referred to as the "protector"). However, the following situations are not considered to be caught by the test in section YB 11: • a person who holds a power to appoint or remove trustees only on the happening of certain events in the future (for example, the incapacity of another person) are not treated as currently holding a power of appointment or removal • a person (often referred to as the protector) who holds the power to veto the appointments or removal of a trustee (because they do not hold any positive power). The requirement in the tripartite test in section YB 14 that two persons must be associated with the same third person under different associated persons tests should obviate any concerns about whether otherwise unrelated trustees are associated under that test merely because a professional advisor acting in their capacity as such has been granted the power to appoint or remove trustees by their clients. An exception to the test associating a trustee and a person with a power of appointment or removal of the trustee for certain employee trusts is contained in section YB 15. Partnership and partner test (section YB 12) A partnership and a partner in the partnership are associated persons under section YB 12(1). The tripartite test in section YB 14—which associates two persons if they are each associated with the same third person under different associated persons tests—will not apply to associate the partners themselves with each other. This is because partners in a partnership would be associated with the same third person (the partnership) under the same associated persons test, namely section YB 12. Example Partnership and partner Partner A Partnership Partner B Partner C YB 12YB 12YB 12 www.ird.govt.nz 51 A, B and C are individuals who are partners in a partnership. Under the partnership and partner test in section YB 12, Partners A, B and C are each associated with the partnership. However, they are not associated with each other under the tripartite test in section YB 14 through their association with the partnership. The partners may still be associated with each other under a different associated persons test. For example, if partners B and C were married they would be associated with each other under the relatives test in section YB 4. The test associating a partnership and an associate of a partner in former section YB 17 has been subsumed by the new tripartite test in section YB 14, which associates two persons if they are each associated with the same third person under different associated persons tests. This means that an associate of a partner, such as a spouse of a partner, would still be associated with the partnership itself, as illustrated in the following example. Example Partnership and associate of a partner: association through tripartite test In this example, the spouse of Partner C is associated with Partner C under the relatives test in section YB 4, and Partner C and Partnership are associated under the partnership and partner test in section YB 12. Therefore, applying the tripartite test, Spouse and Partnership are associated persons as they are each associated with the same third person (Partner C) under different associated persons tests. Limited partnerships There is a separate test for determining if a limited partnership and a limited partner are associated. A limited partnership (as defined in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007) and a limited partner are associated only if the limited partner has a partnership share of 25% or more in the limited partnership (section YB 12(2)). This treatment is appropriate because a limited partner cannot be involved in the management of the partnership (unlike in a general partnership). It should be noted that section YB 12(2) is limited to the limited partners and not the general partner in a limited partnership. A general partner in a limited partnership will be associated with the limited partnership under section YB 12(1). Section YB 12(3) and (4) contain aggregation rules for limited partnerships, similar to the aggregation rules in the company and person other than a company test in section YB 3 (the aggregation rule in section YB 12(3) applies for the purposes of the whole Act except the land provisions, and the more limited aggregation rule in section YB 12(4) applies for the purposes of the land provisions). This is appropriate given that a limited partner is more akin to a shareholder in a company and the interest threshold for associating a limited partner in a limited partnership – 25% – is the same as the threshold in section YB 3. Partner A Partnership Partner B Partner C YB 12YB 12YB 12 Spouse tripartite test (YB 14) YB 4 52 A guide to associated persons definitions for income tax purposes Example Aggregation rule for limited partnership In this example, in the absence of an aggregation rule, Spouse A and Spouse B would not be associated with Limited Partnership, as their respective shares in the partnership do not meet the required 25% threshold. However, applying the aggregation rule for limited partnerships in section YB 12(3), both Spouse A and Spouse B would be associated with Limited Partnership. This is because for the purposes of determining whether Spouse A is associated with Limited Partnership under section YB 12(2), Spouse A is treated as holding anything held by associates—in this case, Spouse A is associated with Spouse B under the relatives test in section YB 4. When Spouse A's 12.5% share in Limited Partnership is aggregated with his associate's (Spouse B) 12.5% share, the required 25% threshold is met and Spouse A is therefore associated with Limited Partnership under section YB 12(2). Once again, the aggregation rule is applied afresh to each person. As a result, the aggregation rule is also applied in this case to associate Spouse B with Limited Partnership. This is consistent with the application of the aggregation rule in the company-related tests. Tripartite test (section YB 14) The tripartite test in section YB 14 associates two persons if they are each associated with the same third person under different associated persons tests. The tripartite test acts as an important buttress to the other associated persons tests and makes the associated persons definition as a whole more difficult to circumvent. For the tripartite test to associate two persons, each of these persons must be associated with the same third person under different associated persons tests, not including the tripartite test itself. The requirement that the two persons cannot be associated with the same third person under the tripartite test itself is necessary to prevent the tripartite test operating in a reiterative manner. The requirement that the two persons have to be associated with the same third person under different associated persons tests ensures that the tripartite test does not apply more widely than is necessary to protect the tax base. The following examples illustrate the important role of the tripartite test in preventing the other associated persons tests being circumvented by arrangements involving the interposition of relatives, companies and trusts which are under the influence or control of the main protagonists. Spouse (limited partner 1) A 12.5%12.5% Spouse (limited partner 1) B Limited Partnership All other limited partners YB 4 www.ird.govt.nz 53 Example Application of the tripartite test In this example, the employer makes a low-interest loan to Trust which in turn makes a distribution to Beneficiary Co which is wholly owned by an employee of the employer. The tripartite test in section YB 14 associates Trust with the employee because they are both associated with Beneficiary Co. In particular, Trust is associated with Beneficiary Co under the trustee-beneficiary test in section YB 6, and the employee is associated with Beneficiary Co under the test in section YB 3 associating a company and a person other than a company. As a result, because the employer has provided a fringe benefit (the low-interest loan) to an associate of an employee, the employer would have to account for FBT on the low-interest loan. Employer Tr u s t low-interest loan YB 3 100% Beneficiary Co Employee YB 6 tripartite test (YB 14) 54 A guide to associated persons definitions for income tax purposes Example Application of the tripartite test In the above example, Suzie settles two family trusts: Trust A and Trust B. Trust A in turn owns all the shares in Family Co. The issue is whether Family Co is associated with Trust B. Without a tripartite test, Family Co and Trust B would not be associated, despite the close community of interests between them. However, under the tripartite test in section YB 14, Family Co and Trust B are associated. In particular, Family Co is associated with Trust A under the company and person other than a company test in section YB 3, and Trust A is associated with Trust B under the two trustees with a common settlor test in section YB 7. Therefore, under the tripartite test, Family Co and Trust B are associated persons. Suzie Trust A settles Family Co settles Trust B 100% YB 3 Tripartite test (YB 14) YB 7 www.ird.govt.nz 55 Example Application of the tripartite test and the aggregation rule In this example, Developer's spouse settles Trust, which in turn owns all the shares in Family Co. The issue is whether Developer is associated with Family Co under the test associating a company and a person other than a company in section YB 3. Developer would be associated with Family Co under the company and person other than a company test because of the application of the aggregation rule in that test, in conjunction with the tripartite test. In particular, Developer would be treated for the purposes of the company and person other than a company test as holding all the shares held by Trust in Family Co. This is because Trust is associated with Developer under the tripartite test: Developer is associated with his spouse under the relatives test (section YB 4) and Developer's spouse is associated with Trust under the trustee and settlor test (section YB 8), which means that Developer is associated with Trust under the tripartite test. Without the tripartite test in section YB 14 and the rule in the company and person other than a company test aggregating interests held by associated persons, Developer would not be associated with Family Co even though there is a large community of interest between them. Different associated persons requirement The requirement in the tripartite test in section YB 14 that the two persons have to be associated with the same third person under different associated person tests is designed to prevent the tripartite test applying more widely than is necessary to protect the tax base. This requirement is illustrated by the following examples. Developer's spouse Tr u s t settles YB 8 YB 3 Family Co Developer 100% YB 3 tripartite test (YB 14) YB 4 56 A guide to associated persons definitions for income tax purposes Example In this example, individuals X, Y and Z, who are not associated with each other, own all the shares in Company A, Company B and Company C. Without the different associated persons tests requirement, Company A and Company C would be associated under the tripartite test in section YB 14, despite not having any common shareholders. However, because Company A and Company C are each associated with Company B under the same two companies test in section YB 2, they are not associated under the tripartite test. Example In this example, Jim and Jo, who are not separately associated with each other, each hold 50% of the voting interests in Company D and are therefore each associated with Company D under the test in section YB 3 associating a company and a person other than a company. Without the different associated persons tests requirement, Jim and Jo would be associated under the tripartite test. However, because Jim and Jo are each associated with Company D (the common third person) under the same test (section YB 3), they are not associated under the tripartite test in section YB 14. Company D JimJo 50%50% XYZ 50%50% Company B Company C Company A 100%50%50% www.ird.govt.nz 57 Exception for companies tests (section YB 14(2)) As well as not applying to associate two persons if they are each associated with the same third person under the same associated persons test, the tripartite test will not associate two persons if they are each associated with the same third person under the company-related tests in sections YB 2 and YB 3. Example Tripartite test: Companies tests exception In this example, Sid is associated with Company X under the company and person other than a company test in section YB 3, and Company X and Company Y are associated under the two companies test in section YB 2. Without the companies tests exception in section YB 14(2), the tripartite test would apply to associate Sid and Company Y (Company X being the common third person). This would be the case even though Sid only has a 12.5% interest in Company Y—the product of multiplying Sid's 25% interest in Company X by Company X's 50% interest in Company Y—which is below the 25% threshold in the company and person other than a company test in section YB 3. The companies test exception in section YB 14(2) ensures that Sid is not associated with Company Y under the tripartite test. Exceptions for certain trusts and charitable organisations (sections YB 16 and YB 8(2)) Energy consumer trusts and bonus bonds unit trust Under section YB 16(1), a lines trust established under the Energy Companies Act 1992, commonly referred to as an energy consumer trust, is excluded from the trustee for relative test (section YB 5) and the test associating trustees and beneficiaries (section YB 6). This is because such trusts are public in nature and are not intended to be subject to the associated persons tests. Excluding energy consumer trusts from the tests in sections YB 5 and YB 6, ensures that discounts to consumers from electricity lines companies owned by consumer trusts are not treated as dividends, as illustrated in the following example. Company X Company Y Sid associated under YB 3 25% associated under YB 2 50% 58 A guide to associated persons definitions for income tax purposes Example Exception for energy consumer trusts The exception for energy consumer trusts also prevents consumer beneficiaries from being associated with one another. Even without this exception, the scope of the tripartite test is such that it would not apply to treat consumer beneficiaries as associated persons. Using the above example, this means that the developer beneficiary and the non-developer beneficiary will not be associated persons. This is because they are both associated with the same third person (Energy consumer trust) under the same associated persons test, namely the trustee and beneficiary test in section YB 6, which means that the tripartite test does not apply. Additionally, section YB 16(1) also excludes the unit trust that administers bonus bonds from the associated persons tests in sections YB 5 and YB 6 because of its public nature. This unit trust is excluded from the unit trust definition in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007, and therefore is not treated as a company, which means that the trust-related associated persons tests could potentially apply to it. Charitable organisations Under section YB 16(2), "charitable organisations" (as defined in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007) are not treated as beneficiaries for the purposes of tests associating trustees and beneficiaries (section YB 6) and settlors and beneficiaries (section YB 9). YB 6 YB 3 100% Electric Lines Company Developer beneficiary Energy consumer trust Consumer beneficiaries X Non-developer beneficiary discounts (via electricity retailers) www.ird.govt.nz 59 Example Without the exception for charitable organisations in section YB 16(2), the beneficiary-related tests could have unintended consequences. For example, if the beneficiary of several unrelated trusts is the same charity, the trustee and settlor of each such trust could end up being associated with the trustee and settlor of all such trusts without being aware of the fact. This exception therefore ensures that trustees and settlors of trusts in this situation are not treated as associated persons simply because the same charity is a beneficiary under their trust. Charitable trusts The trustee and settlor test in section YB 8 does not apply if the trust is a charitable trust. This exception— section YB 8(2)—prevents donors to a charitable trust being associated with each other. A charitable trust under the Income Tax Act 2007 is required to be registered as a charitable entity under the Charities Act 2005 and is therefore subject to any regulatory requirements of that Act. Such charities do not pose a risk to the tax base and therefore it is not necessary to include them in the trustee and settlor associated persons test. Rationalising associated persons references in operative provisions A number of operative provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 previously contained modifications or additional wording in their associated persons references. These modifications were a result of different combinations of the associated persons tests in former subpart YB applying, in particular, the tests that applied for the purposes of the whole Act (excluding the 1973, 1988 and 1990 version provisions) or the 1988 version provisions (corresponding to the associated persons definitions in sections OD 7 and OD 8(3) of the Income Tax Act 2004). An example of such a provision was section EX 21(15). These modifications to the associated person references in the operative provisions of the Income Tax Act 2007 have been generally omitted because they have been effectively subsumed by the various reforms to the associated persons tests in new subpart YB. The wording of these operative provisions therefore has been significantly simplified because they will simply refer to persons being associated without more (for example, without various references to the 1973, 1988 or 1990 version provisions). As a result, the wording of the associated person references in the operative provisions of the Income Tax Act 2007 are now streamlined and easier to understand. Trust 1 Settlor 1 Settlor 2 Settlor 3 Trust 2 Trust 3 Charitable organisation beneficiary 60 A guide to associated persons definitions for income tax purposes For example, the wording of section GB 28(2) was: "A person is treated as being associated with another person if a person would be treated as being associated under the parts of subpart YB (associated persons and nominees) that apply for the purposes of the whole Act (excluding the 1973, 1988, and 1990 version provisions), or the 1988 version provisions, at the time the services are personally performed by the working person." This wording has been replaced by: "A person is treated as being associated with another person if they are associated at the time the services are personally performed by the working person." The definitions of the 1973, 1988 and 1990 version provisions and previous section YB 20 have been repealed because they are largely subsumed by the various reforms to the associated persons tests in subpart YB. These definitions equate to the lists of operative provisions to which the former specific associated persons definitions in sections OD 8(4), OD 8(3) and OD 8(1) of the Income Tax Act 2004 applied. However, because of the various modifications that apply in the associated persons tests in relation to the land transaction provisions, previously defined as the "1973 version provisions", this definition has been re-enacted in section YA 1 and called "land provisions". The new associated persons definition in the Income Tax Act 2007 also applies in the Tax Administration Act 1994 because of section 3(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. A number of the specific modifications or additional wording in the associated persons references in the operative provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 were incorrect. These references have been corrected applicable from the commencement of the Income Tax Act 2007 on 1 April 2008, even though these references themselves have been omitted as part of these reforms of the associated persons definitions. It is necessary to correct these references from the commencement of the Income Tax Act 2007 on 1 April 2008 because the current associated person reforms do not apply generally until the 2010–11 income year. Section CD 6(1)(a)(iii) repealed A transfer of value from a company to a person is a dividend if the cause of the transfer is a shareholding in the company as described in section CD 6 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Section CD 6(1)(a)(iii) contained an extension which treated as a dividend any distribution made by a company to a trust under which a shareholder of the company, or spouse, civil union, or de facto partner of the shareholder, was a beneficiary. This trust extension rule has been repealed because its function is performed by the new associated persons definition—in particular, the trustee-beneficiary test in new section YB 6. Section CD 22(9) amendment The definition of "fifteen percent interest reduction" in section CD 22(9), which relates to the share buy-back exclusion from the dividend definition, refers to "counted associate", which is defined inter alia as "a trustee of a trust under which a spouse, civil union partner or de facto partner, or minor child of the shareholder is a beneficiary". This wording has been amended so that it is consistent with other references in the associated persons definitions which describe discretionary beneficiaries. The provision now refers to a person who has benefited or is eligible to benefit under a trust (instead of referring to a beneficiary). Section DB 42(2) amendment Section DB 42(1) allows a taxpayer a deduction for any loss arising through misappropriation by an employee. Former section DB 42(2) stated that this deduction was not available if the taxpayer and the employee were associated in certain ways. The new associated persons definition is comprehensive enough to cover all the relationships described in former section DB 42(2). Therefore the specific associated persons tests in this provision have been replaced by a standard associated persons reference. New section DB 42(2) simply provides that the section does not apply when a person who misappropriates property is associated with the person who carries on the business. www.ird.govt.nz 61 Omitted tests Several associated persons tests contained in the previous subpart YB of the Income Tax Act 2007 have been omitted for simplification and rationalisation purposes. These omitted tests were: • The test associating two persons if they habitually act together (former section YB 18). • The test associating a person and a charity, friendly society, or non-profit body controlled by that person or a relative of that person (former section YB 19). • The tests associating two companies and a company and a person other than a company, which were based on income interests (former sections YB 3 and YB 7). These tests were redundant given the equivalent comprehensive tests based on voting interests. The existence of these tests can be explained historically by the fact that they were originally enacted in 1988 before the voting interest concept was enacted in 1992. • The test associating a partnership and an associate of a partner (former section YB 17). This test has been subsumed by the new tripartite test in section YB 14. Under the tripartite test two persons are associated if they are each associated with the same third person under different associated persons tests. This means that an associate of a partner, such as a spouse of a partner, would still be associated with the partnership under the tripartite test. Rationalisation of other income tax provisions A number of provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 embodying a related person concept, similar to that in the associated persons definitions, have been rationalised. It is desirable, from a simplification perspective, that similar concepts in the Act be addressed similarly. Replacing company control definition with associated persons definition Section YC 1 of the Income Tax Act, which defined when a company was treated as being under the control of any persons, has been repealed. Its function is now performed by the new associated persons definition. The definition of company control in section YC 1 and the definitions of associated persons in subpart YB are conceptually similar in that they define related parties for the purposes of operative provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007. The separate use of the section YC 1 company control definition rather than the associated persons definitions was probably a legacy of the company control definition being developed in the Income Tax Act before the associated persons definitions. The company control definition in the Act was first implemented in 1939, whereas the first associated persons definition in the Act was not enacted until 1968. Allowing section YC 1 to be subsumed by the new associated persons definition is a desirable simplification measure. The provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 which previously employed the section YC 1 definition of company control, have been amended to use the new associated persons definition. They are: • section GC 5 (leases for inadequate rent) • section RF 11 (dividends paid to companies under control of non-residents) • paragraph (a) of the definition of "holding company" in section YA 1. Replacing related person definition with associated person definition Former section CD 44(15) to (17) of the Income Tax Act 2007 contained a definition of "related person" which was used in section CD 44(11) and (12) to determine the amount of the capital gain exclusion from a dividend arising from the realisation of a capital asset in the course of a company's liquidation. As part of the amendments to rationalise the Income Tax Act provisions which embody an associated persons concept, the function of the former related person definition in section CD 44 will be performed by the new associated person definition. 62 A guide to associated persons definitions for income tax purposes Section CD 44(11) and (12) have been replaced by section CD 44(10A) and (10B) with associated persons references replacing related persons references. The new provisions apply for capital gain amounts derived or losses incurred after 31 March 2010, therefore ensuring that the changes have prospective application only. For capital gain amounts derived or capital loss amounts incurred between 1 April 1988 and 31 March 2010, the previous law which used the related person definition continues to apply. This law contained in former section CD 44(11), (12) and (15) to (17), is now contained in section CZ 9B of the Income Tax Act 2007. The references to related persons in the dividend definition in section YA 1 have also been replaced with references to associated persons. Definition of "relative" The definition of "relative" in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 has been simplified so that it extends only to the second degree of blood relationship. Previously the definition also extended for the purposes of some provisions to the fourth degree of blood relationship. The new definition of relative includes a trustee of a trust under which a relative has benefited or is eligible to benefit—this continues the effect of paragraph (c) (v) of the old relative definition. Non Resident Withholding Tax and Approved Issuer Levy NRWT and AIL use the associated person rules outlined earlier in this publication but also have specific associated person rules and tests. Indirect associated funding - exists when a non-resident indirect lender provides funds to a direct lender who then provides the funds to a person associated with the non-resident indirect lender. Non Resident owning bodies - A group of non-residents that have characteristics that indicate they are acting together to debt fund a NZ company for which they own 50% or more. Related party debt - A financial arrangement where the lender is an associated person or funding is provided through an indirect funding arrangement or lender is a member of a non-resident owning body that is associated with the borrower and expenditure arises to the borrower for which they are allowed a deduction (this excludes a member of a NZ banking group). Application of changes to other Acts A number of provisions in other Acts, which utilise the associated persons definitions in the Income Tax Act 2007, have been consequently amended as a result of these reforms. The provisions in these other Acts are: Fisheries Act 1996, section 59(10)(c) and (d) Misuse of Drugs Amendment Act 2005, section 31 Privacy Act 1993, section 6 Radiocommunications Act 1989, sections 153(2) and 161(2) Smoke-free Environments Act 1990, section 2(1). A number of provisions in other Acts also utilised former section YC 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007, which defined when a company was treated as being under the control of any persons. These references to section YC 1 have been replaced with references to the new associated persons definition in the Income Tax Act 2007. The provisions in these other Acts are: Insolvency Act 2006, section 182(1) Public Service Investment Society Management Act (No.2) 1979, section 2(2) Trustee Companies Management Act 1975, section 2(2) Unit Trusts Act 1960, section 3(4). www.ird.govt.nz 63 Legislative references Sections CB 8(c), CD 5, CD 5(2B), CD 6(1)(a)(ii), CD 22(9), CD 25(4), CD 27(1)(b), CD 27(3)(a)(ii), CD 44(10B), CD 44(10C), CD 44(14B), CX 2(5), CZ 9B, DB 42(2), EB 13(2), EX 20B(5)(a)(i), EX 20B(9)(c), FE 21(3)(d)(ii), FE 21(7)(a)(i), FE 21(7)(a)(ii), FE 21(8), GB 28(2), GB 48(1)(b), GB 48(3)(d), GB 48(3)(e), GC 5(5), HC 15(5)(a)(ii), HC 21(3), HC 27(1)(e), HC 27(3), HC 32(2), HC 35(4)(a), HC 36(5), RF 11, YA 1, YB 1 – YB 16, of the Income Tax Act 2007.

If any of the other tests prove that a person (person A) and another person (person B) are associated, person A is treated as holding the interests of person B for tax purposes. Aggregation rule for land provisions For land transactions, the rule determines that a person (person A) and another person (person B) are associated if they're: • • married, in a civil union, or in a de facto relationship • • a parent and infant child • • trustees of separate trusts with the same settlor • • a trustee and a settlor • • a trustee and a person with power to appoint or remove a trustee • • a partner and a partnership • • associated through the tripartite test. Beneficiary Generally this is a person who has benefited from or is eligible to benefit from a trust. Infant child A child by blood, adoption or marriage under the age of 20 years. Land provisions Land provisions are specific rules relating to land transactions. These principally address tax avoidance arrangements and structures that are used to alter the tax status of land transactions. The following areas have specific provisions relating to land transactions: 2 companies, a company and a person other than a company, 2 relatives, Portfolio Investment Entities (PIEs) and entities eligible to be PIEs. The land provisions do not apply to the tests for person and trustee for relative (section YB 5), trustee and beneficiary (section YB 6), settlor and beneficiary (section YB 9). Market value circumstance A person's interest in a company is generally measured by their voting interests in the company. If, in certain circumstances, these voting interests do not accurately reflect the person's economic interest in a company, then the person's interests are also measured by their market value interests in the company. Generally this means looking outside the market value interest to see if voting rights are affected by shares, options, debentures or arrangements. Market value interest A person's market value interest in a company is measured where a market value circumstance exists. At any time, a person's market value interest equals their share of the total market value of shares and options held in the company. Narrow relatives test The definition under the 2 relatives test has a narrower application for the purposes of the land provisions (see 'Aggregation rule for land provisions' above). ird.govt.nz 5 Non-arm's length This generally refers to persons who for personal or family reasons enter into a transaction at a different value from the amount that would be paid by 2 independent persons. A non-arm's length transaction is one that isn't freely entered into between a willing vendor and purchaser. Person A person can be an individual, company, trustee of a trust, limited partnership, a partnership and any other separate entity. Portfolio investment entity (PIE) A type of managed fund that makes and holds investments on behalf of its investors. Purpose trust and community trust These types of trusts do not have beneficiaries and therefore are not associated under the beneficiary-related tests. Relative The definition of ‘relative’ in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 has been simplified so that it extends only to the second degree of blood relationship. Previously the definition also extended for the purposes of some provisions to the fourth degree of blood relationship. The new definition of relative includes a trustee of a trust under which a relative has benefited or is eligible to benefit—this continues the effect of paragraph (c) (v) of the old relative definition. Settlor The term settlor has a wide meaning and broadly means a person who transfers value to a trust. This includes both an initial settlement and at any other time. For the purposes of the associated persons definitions, the term settlor has the modification that it does not include a person who provides services to a trust for less than market value. Consequently, a professional advisor who provides free services to a trust will not be treated as a settlor of the trust. There is also an exception for the settlor of a charitable trust. Tr u s t e e A person who is responsible for the trust operating within the guidelines set out in the trust deed and trustee law. The trust is not a legal entity so everything the trust does is carried out by the trustee of the trust. The trustees are for the most part legally responsible for the actions of the trust. 6 A guide to associated persons definitions for income tax purposes PART A Introduction The associated persons rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 are designed to ensure the tax treatment of transactions involving associated persons do not: • • create a tax benefit • • use the tax system to subsidise the cost of what are effectively private transactions • • disguise the nature of a business or private transaction • • disguise the person(s) involved in the transaction. Generally transactions that are non-arm's length need to be considered under the associated persons rules to ensure that they are treated the same from a tax perspective as if the transaction was made by 2 independent parties. Why are the rules required? The rules ensure the tax status of any transaction is not changed when the parties involved are associated. For example, tax avoidance arrangements could be structured through associated persons to hide or disguise the true nature of a transaction. A transaction made by a person in business has a tax consequence. The same transaction, if conducted by someone for personal or non-business reasons, may not have a tax consequence. Therefore there could be an incentive to move transactions out of the business environment. What types of transactions could be involved? • • Persons involved in property development could use associated structures such as trusts to move property transactions from their own taxable business environment to a capital (non-taxable) investment in a trust. This is 1 of the main areas of concern. • • A tax deduction could be claimed for the loss made on the sale of an item that was heavily discounted when sold to a family member. • • Employment-related benefits are often included in an employee's overall salary package. The benefit could be provided to an associate of the employee so the employee avoids paying tax. What are the rules designed to do? The rules have been designed to: • • prevent changes to the tax treatment of a transaction by flowing it through an associated person or conducting the transaction with an associated person • • ensure that a transaction between related parties is afforded the same tax treatment as if the transaction was conducted between arm's length parties. Transactions between associated persons are often required to be valued at market value and not at a price agreed between the parties. This is particularly relevant in a situation where the transaction is part of a business for only 1 of the parties. Under the land provisions, if a person associated to a property developer sells a property within 10 years of purchase, this transaction will generally be considered to be part of a business activity for tax purposes. How have the rules been changed? Amendments have been made to strengthen and rationalise the definitions of ‘associated persons’ for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 2007. ird.govt.nz 7 The key changes include: • • strengthening the definitions relating to trusts • • aggregating the interests of associates to prevent the tests for associating 2 companies and a company and an individual being circumvented by the fragmentation of interests among close associates • • implementing a tripartite test associating 2 persons if they are each associated with the same third person. This booklet provides an overview of the associated person provisions outlined in section YB of the Income Tax Act 2007 including the changes made in the Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Act 2009. Scenarios and examples have been included to help you determine if a person is associated under the associated person definitions. This is not an exhaustive list of scenarios and examples. When do the new rules apply? Transactions involving land For persons and associated persons who are involved in a building business, the new rules apply for land on which improvements started on or after 6 October 2009. For other persons and associated persons, the provisions apply for land acquired on or after 6 October 2009. Transactions other than land The changes to the other provisions apply to transactions occurring in 2010–11 and later income years. What are the tests? There are 11 tests to determine if 2 persons are associated. Test 1 Two companies (section YB 2): – common voting interests – common market value interests – control by any other means – aggregation rule—non-land provisions – aggregation rule—land provisions. Test 2 Company and person other than a company (section YB 3): – common voting interests – common market value interests – aggregation rule—non-land provisions – aggregation rule—land provisions. Test 3 Two relatives (section YB 4): – degrees of relationship—non-land provision – degrees of relationship—land provisions. Test 4 Person and a trustee for a relative (section YB 5). Test 5 Trustee and a beneficiary (section YB 6). Test 6 Two trustees of separate trusts with a common settlor (section YB 7). Test 7 Trustee and a settlor (section YB 8). Test 8 Settlor and a beneficiary (section YB 9). Test 9 Trustee and a person with power of appointment or removal (section YB 11). Test 10 Partnership and a partner (section YB 12). Test 11 Tripartite relationship (section YB 14). 8 A guide to associated persons definitions for income tax purposes PART B The following is an overview of each test. See Part D for further details Overview of each test Associating 2 companies – test 1 (a more limited version of the aggregation rule applies to land transactions) The primary test provides that 2 companies are associated if there is a group of persons whose total voting interests in each company are 50% or more. If the primary test does not apply the second part of the test provides that 2 companies are associated if a market value circumstance exists for either company and there is a group of persons whose total market value interests in each company are 50% or more. A person's interest in a company is generally measured by their voting interests in the company. If these voting interests in certain circumstances do not accurately reflect the person's economic interest in a company, then the person's interests are also measured by their market value interests in the company. Finally, 2 companies are associated if a group of persons controls both companies by any other means. For example a director of 2 companies who has virtual control of both companies. An aggregation rule provides that, in determining whether 2 companies are associated, a person is treated as holding the interests of the other person if tests 3 to 11 prove they are associated. This aggregation rule is designed to prevent the 2 companies test being circumvented by the fragmentation of interests among associated persons, resulting in the 50% interest threshold not being reached. A unit trust is a company for the purposes of the associated persons rules. Exceptions The control by any other means test does not apply to a company that is a state enterprise, Crown Research Institute, Crown Health Enterprise or a company that is part of the same group of companies as one of the Crown-related entities. In the international tax rules, 2 companies are not associated if one, but not both, is a non-resident. Associating a company and a person other than a company – test 2 The primary test provides that a company and a person other than a company are associated if the person has a voting interest in the company of 25% or more. If the primary test does not apply the second part of the test provides that a company and a person other than a company are associated persons if a market value circumstance exists for the company and the person has a market value interest in the company of 25% or more. An aggregation rule applies for the purposes of determining whether a company and a person other than a company are associated. A person is treated as holding the interests of the other person if tests 3 to 11 prove they are associated. As with the 2 companies test, the aggregation rule in the company and a person other than a company test is designed to prevent the test being circumvented by the fragmentation of interests among associated persons, resulting in the interest threshold of 25% not being reached. A more limited version of the aggregation rule applies for land transactions. ird.govt.nz 9 The holdings of the other person are only aggregated when the other person who is not a company is associated by being: • • a relative by marriage, civil union, or a de facto relationship under the relatives test (test 3), or • • an infant child (under 20 yrs) under the relatives test (test 3), or • • a person associated under tests 5, 6, 9, 10 or 11, or • • a combination of the person and the other persons referred to above. A PIE or an entity eligible to be a PIE is not included for the aggregation purposes of the test. A person other than a company includes a company acting in its capacity as a trustee of a trust. Associating 2 relatives – test 3 There are 3 aspects to this test: blood relation, relation by marriage and relation to in-laws. 1 Blood relationship This now extends only to the second degree of blood relationship, instead of the fourth degree as previously stipulated. This means that grandparents and siblings are included but not nephews and nieces (third degree) and cousins (fourth degree). An adopted child is treated as the natural child of the adoptive parents. 2 Relationship by marriage Two persons who are married, in a civil union, or in a de facto relationship are associated. 3 Relationship to in-laws Two persons are associated if one person is within 2 degrees of blood relationship to the other person's spouse, civil union partner, or de facto partner. This aspect associates persons with their in-laws and step-children. The first and third aspects of this test do not apply for land transactions. Instead, persons are associated because of a blood relationship only if one is the infant child (under 20 years) of the other. This rule applies for the other tests, particularly when considering if the tripartite test applies. Associating a person and a trustee for a relative – test 4 A person (first person) and a trustee of a trust are associated persons if a relative of the first person (as proven by 2 relatives test 3) has benefited or is eligible to benefit under the trust. For example, a husband and a trustee of a trust under which the husband's wife is a beneficiary would be associated under this test. Associating a trustee and beneficiary – test 5 A trustee of a trust and a person who has benefited or is eligible to benefit under the trust will be associated persons. This test doesn't apply for: • • land transactions • • certain employee trusts such as an employee superannuation fund • • certain trusts such as energy consumer trusts and the trust administering bonus bonds. • • beneficiaries that are charitable trusts. 10 A guide to associated persons definitions for income tax purposes Associating 2 trustees with common settlor – test 6 A trustee of a trust and a trustee of another trust are associated persons if the same person is a settlor of both trusts. There is an exception to this test for certain employee trusts. Associating a trustee and settlor – test 7 A trustee of a trust and a settlor of the trust are associated persons. There is an exception to this test for certain employee and charitable trusts. Associating a settlor and beneficiary – test 8 A settlor of a trust and a person who has benefited or is eligible to benefit under the trust are associated persons. This test doesn't apply for: • • land transactions • • certain employee trusts • • beneficiaries that are charitable trusts. Associating a trustee and person with power of appointment – test 9 A trustee of a trust and a person who has the power to appoint or remove a trustee are associated persons. Associating a partnership and partner – test 10 A partnership and a partner in the partnership are associated persons. A separate test applies in the case of a limited partnership and a limited partner in that they are associated only if the limited partner has a share of 25% or more in the limited partnership. This includes a partnership share of 25% or more in a right, obligation, or other property, status, or thing of the limited partnership. A partner is not associated to the other partners in the partnership under this test, but may be associated by one of the other tests. Under the aggregation rule, which applies only for limited partnerships in this test, anything held by one limited partner is treated as being held by the other limited partner if any of the tests have proved them to be associated. Associating under the tripartite relationship – test 11 The tripartite relationship (tripartite test) will associate 2 persons if they are each associated with the same third person under different tests. The tripartite test acts as an important buttress to the other associated persons tests and makes the associated persons definition as a whole more difficult to circumvent. The requirement that the 2 persons cannot be associated with the same third person under the tripartite test itself is necessary to prevent the tripartite test operating in a reiterative manner. ird.govt.nz 11 PART C Associating 2 companies YB 2 Test 1 Common voting interests YB 2(1) If 50% or more of the voting interests in 2 companies is held by the same group (a ‘group’ could include companies, individuals, trusts, partnerships, unit trusts, PIEs, or any combination of these entities or one person), the 2 companies are associated. Example 1 There are 2 companies, Company 1 and Company 2. The AEC Trust and John hold between them 50% of the voting power for decisions made by Company 1, and 55% of the voting power for decisions made by Company 2. As the group (consisting of the AEC Trust and John) has a common voting interest of at least 50% in Company 1 and Company 2, Company 1 and Company 2 will be associated to each other. This will mean for example, if either Company 1 or Company 2 is a property developer and the other is not, any land transactions carried out by either associated party will generally be taxable.

Example 2 Alan (person A) and an unrelated person each own 50% of the shares in Company 1. Alan, Alan's wife Betty (person B) and an unrelated second person each own 33% of the shares in Company 2. As Alan and Betty are associated to each other under the 2 relatives test (test 3), Alan is treated as holding Betty's shares in Company 2 giving him a total of 66% of the shares. Alan therefore holds 50% in Company 1 and 66% in Company 2 making the 2 companies associated.

Example 3 Marie owns 5 shares in Company 1. Marie also settled a trust that Mark is a trustee of. Mark owns 22 shares in Company 1. As Marie is associated to Mark under the trustee and settlor test (test 7), Marie and Mark are each deemed to hold 27 shares in Company 1.

Example 4 The KMF Partnership (A above) has a 40% voting interest in Company 1. As the KMF Partnership has a voting interest in Company 1 of more than 25%, the partnership and the company will be associated. This will mean for example, if either the company or the partnership is a property developer and the other is not, any land transactions carried out by either party will generally be taxable.

Example 5 Marie holds 5 shares in Company 1. Marie is also a partner in the KMF Partnership which holds 27 shares in Company 1. As Marie is associated to the partnership under the partnership and partner test (test 10), both she and the KMF Partnership are deemed to hold 32 shares in Company 1 for the purposes of example 4 (see page 14).

Section reference: YB 4(1) Relatives test – land provisions (narrow relatives test) YB 4(2) For the purpose of the land provisions (and sections EB 13 and EC 5 of the Income Tax Act 2007) a person is associated to another person if that person is their spouse, civil union partner, or de facto partner, or their child who is under 20 (including if the child is adopted). This means there are only 2 scenarios where 2 relatives are associated for the purpose of the land provisions: Scenario 1: A person is related to their spouse, civil union partner or de factor partner Scenario 2: A person is related to their child who is under 20 (including an adopted child). Note: This section does not apply if the person cannot be reasonably expected to know that the other person exists.

Key features of the reforms The reforms to the associated persons definitions generally involve replacing the definitions with the objective of strengthening them. The other major part of the reforms involves rationalising these definitions and other income tax provisions which employ a similar concept. The changes aim to give effect to the policy intention of capturing non-arm's length transactions, while not applying more widely than is necessary to protect the tax base. The 11 associated persons tests generally apply for the purposes of the Income Tax Act. The main exception is in the land provisions where modifications are made so the associated persons definitions cover situations under the effective control of property dealers, developers and builders, but do not apply to other situations. The tests for determining whether 2 companies, or a company and a person other than a company, are associated persons include rules that aggregate the interests of associates. This prevents the company-related tests being circumvented by the fragmentation of interests among associated persons. The test for associating relatives is reduced from 4 degrees of blood relationship to 2 degrees only. This test is further limited to spouses and parents and their infant children for the purposes of the land provisions and compliance cost-saving provisions relating to low turnover traders and adverse event livestock transfers. The weaknesses in the previous general associated persons definition in relation to trusts have been addressed by including tests associating a trustee and beneficiary, trustee and settlor, 2 trustees with common settlor, settlor and beneficiary, and a trustee and a person with the power to appoint or remove the trustee. A number of modifications apply to the trust-based tests to ensure that the associated persons definitions do not apply more widely than is necessary to protect the tax base. They include: • • Not applying the beneficiary-based associated persons tests (the trustee-beneficiary and settlor-beneficiary tests), and the test associating a person and a trustee for a relative in the case of land sales. It is not necessary to apply these tests to catch the type of structures being used to circumvent the land sale tax rules; the structures causing concern can be caught by other associated persons tests—in particular, the settlor-based trust and tripartite tests. • • Not treating charitable organisations as beneficiaries for the purposes of the trustee and beneficiary, and settlor and beneficiary tests and excluding charitable trusts from the trustee and settlor test. • • The definition of ‘settlor’ that applies for the purposes of the associated persons tests will not include a person who provides services to a trust for less than market value. Persons who are married, in a civil union, or in a de facto relationship are treated as the same single person for the purpose of identifying a common settlor under the 2 trustees with a common settlor test in section YB 7. This treatment prevents the new associated persons definition being circumvented by the use of ‘mirror trusts’. The new associated persons definition introduces a tripartite test which associates 2 persons if they are each associated with the same third person, under different associated persons tests. The tripartite test acts as an important buttress to the other associated persons tests and makes the associated persons definition as a whole more difficult to circumvent. The reforms also rationalise the current income tax definition of associated persons and other income tax provisions that employ a similar concept, such as the definition of ‘related person’ in the dividend rules. This represents a significant simplification and makes the associated persons concept in the Income Tax Act more coherent. ird.govt.nz 31 Application date The general application date for the reforms (excluding those applying for the land provisions) is the 2010–11 and later income years. For the purposes of the land provisions (as defined in section YA 1), except for the section which relates to disposal of land within 10 years of completing improvements (section CB 11), the reforms apply to land acquired on or after 6 October 2009, the date of enactment. Given that association is tested in the land provisions at the time of acquisition, this means that for land acquired before 6 October 2009 the former associated persons definitions are the relevant provisions in determining whether the sale of such land is taxable. For the purposes of section CB 11, the reforms apply to land on which improvements started on or after 6 October 2009. Therefore, in the case of the land provisions, the relevant application date is 6 October 2009 irrespective of a person's balance date. Detailed analysis Subpart YB containing the associated persons definition rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 has been substantially replaced. New section YB 1(4) states the general rule that the various associated persons tests in subpart YB apply for the purposes of the whole Act unless a provision expressly states otherwise. The main situation where certain exceptions will apply in the new associated persons tests is the land provisions, which are defined in section YA 1. For example, a narrow range of relatives (namely, spouses, civil union partners, de facto partners and infant children) applies in the new associated persons definitions for the purposes of the land provisions. New sections YB 1(5) to (8) contain cross-references to several special rules that modify the associated persons definitions for the purpose of specific provisions. These special rules are contained in sections DS 4 (Meaning of film reimbursement scheme), EB 13 (Low-turnover valuation), EX 4 (Limits to requirement to include associated person interests in the controlled foreign company rules), and LP 2 (Tax credits for supplementary dividends). These special rules have not been changed as part of this reform. Two companies test (section YB 2) Section YB 2 contains the test for associating 2 companies. Two companies will be associated if: • • there is a group of persons whose total voting interests in each company are 50% or more—this is the primary test for associating 2 companies. The concept of voting interests is defined in subpart YC. • • a market value circumstance exists for either company and there is a group of persons whose total market value interests in each company are 50% or more. A ‘market value circumstance’ is defined in section YA 1 and a ‘market value interest’ is defined in subpart YC. Under the measurement of company ownership rules in subpart YC, a person's interest in a company is generally measured by reference to the person's voting interests in the company. If these voting interests in certain circumstances—coming within the definition of ‘market value circumstance’ in section YA 1—do not reflect accurately the person's economic interest in a company then the person's interests are also measured by reference to the person's market value interests in the company. • • there is a group of persons who control both companies by any other means. 32 A guide to associated persons definitions for income tax purposes Aggregation rule 2 companies The test associating 2 companies contains a general aggregation rule which provides that in determining whether 2 companies are associated, a person is treated as holding anything held by persons associated with that person under sections YB 4 to YB 14 (section YB 2(4)). This rule applies for the purposes of the whole Act except the land provisions. The aggregation rule is designed to prevent the 2 companies test being circumvented by the fragmentation of interests among associated persons, resulting in the 50% interest threshold not being reached. The 2 companies test contains a separate rule which aggregates the interests of associates for the purposes of the land provisions (section YB 2(5)). Under this rule, a person is treated as holding anything held by persons associated with them under the limited relatives definition in section YB 4 (namely, spouses, civil union partners, de facto partners and infant children) and under the tests in sections YB 7, YB 8, and YB 10 to YB 14. This modification ensures that for the purposes of the land provisions, the general relatives test and the beneficiary- related trust tests do not apply in the aggregation rule for the test associating 2 companies. When applying the rules aggregating the interest of associates, the rule is applied afresh to each person and it is irrelevant that a person does not directly hold any shares in a company before the application of the aggregation rule. Example Application of general aggregation rule in 2 companies test Suzy Tr u s t Company A Suzy Co Company B 100% 100% Associated under the tripartite test in YB 14 Power of appointment ird.govt.nz 33 In this example the aggregation rule, in conjunction with the tripartite test, can be applied to treat Suzy as holding Trust's shares in Company B. Specifically, Suzy is associated with Suzy Co under the company and person other than a company test in section YB 3, and Suzy Co (with power of appointment of the trustees of Trust) is associated with Trust under section YB 11. Therefore, Suzy and Trust are associated under the tripartite test, and the aggregation rule in section YB 2(4) treats Suzy as holding Trust's shares in Company B. Taking into account the shares Suzy holds directly in Company A, Company A and Company B are associated under the 2 companies test in section YB 2. Example Application of general aggregation rule in 2 companies test In this example, the question is whether Company A and Company B are associated. First, in conjunction with the relatives test in section YB 4, the aggregation rule in section YB 2(4) is applied so that John is treated as holding anything held by his associates. In this case, John is treated as holding Jo's shares in Company A through his association with Jo under the relatives test in section YB 4. Secondly, the aggregation rule, in conjunction with the tripartite test, can also be applied to treat John as holding Trust's shares in Company B. This is because John is associated with Trust under the tripartite test in section YB 14. Specifically, John is associated with John Co under the company and person other than a company test in section YB 3, and John Co (as beneficiary of Trust) is associated with Trust under the trustee and beneficiary test in section YB 6. Therefore, John and Trust are associated under the tripartite test, and the aggregation rule in section YB 2(4) treats John as holding Trust's shares in Company B. As a result, because John is treated as holding all the shares in Company A and Company B under section YB 2(4), Company A and Company B are associated under section YB 2. Jo Tr u s t Company A John Co Company B 100% 100% Associated under the tripartite test in YB 14 Beneficiary of Trust John (Jo's son) 100% YB 4 34 A guide to associated persons definitions for income tax purposes It is irrelevant that John does not directly hold shares in Company A and Company B before the application of the aggregation rule in section YB 2(4). Example Application of aggregation rule in 2 companies test in the context of the land provisions In this example, the husband owns 100% of the voting interests in Company A, which is a property developer, and his wife holds 100% of the voting interests in Company B, which sells some land within 10 years of acquisition. Without the aggregation rule in section YB 2(5), the 2 companies would not be associated despite their close community of interests. The application of the aggregation rule ensures that the 2 companies are associated under section YB 2, resulting in Company B being liable to tax on the sale of the land. Husband Wife Company A (Developer) 100% 100% Company B (sells land) ird.govt.nz 35 Example Application of aggregation rule in 2 companies test in the context of the land provisions In this example, Trust A and Trust B are associated under the 2 trustees with common settlor test in section YB 7. Trust A owns 100% of the voting interests in Company A, which is a property developer, and Trust B owns 100% of the voting interests in Company B, which sells some land within 10 years of acquisition. The 2 companies are associated under the 2 companies test through the use of the aggregation rule contained in that test. Applying the aggregation rule to this example, Trust A is treated as holding anything held by persons associated with it. In this case, Trust A and Trust B are associated under the 2 trustees with common settlor test in section YB 7. Accordingly, taking into account Trust A's direct shareholding in Company A, Trust A is treated as holding all the voting interests in Company A and Company B, meaning these 2 companies are associated. The aggregation rule can also be applied to treat the common settlor as holding all the voting interests in Company A and Company B because the settlor is associated with Trust A and Trust B under the trustee- settlor test in section YB 8. This also means the 2 companies are associated. A result of Company A and Company B being associated is that Company B is liable to tax on the sale of land. Without the aggregation rule, Company A and Company B would not be associated despite their close community of interests. Settlor Company A (Developer) 100% 100% Company B (sells land) Trust A Trust B 36 A guide to associated persons definitions for income tax purposes Other features The 2 companies test provides that the control by any other means limb in the test does not apply to a company that is a state enterprise, Crown Research Institute, Crown Health Enterprise or a company that is part of the same group of companies as one of these Crown-related entities (section YB 2(6)). It also provides that in the international tax rules (defined in section YA 1) 2 companies are not associated if one, but not both, is a non-resident (section YB 2(7)). Additionally, for the purposes of the land provisions, 2 companies are not associated persons if one is a portfolio investment entity (PIE) or an entity that qualifies for PIE status (section YB 2(8)). This exception ensures that a widely held managed fund is not adversely affected because of the personal land dealings of the directors of the fund. Company and person other than a company test (section YB 3) Section YB 3 contains the test for associating a company and a person other than a company. A company and a person other than a company are associated if: • • the person has a voting interest in the company of 25% or more. The concept of voting interests is defined in subpart YC. • • a market value circumstance exists for the company and the person has a market value interest in the company of 25% or more. A ‘market value circumstance’ is defined in section YA 1, and a ‘market value interest’ is defined in subpart YC. Under the measurement of company ownership rules in subpart YC, a person's interest in a company is generally measured by reference to the person's voting interests in the company. If these voting interests in certain circumstances—coming within the definition of ‘market value circumstance’ in section YA 1—do not reflect accurately the person's economic interest in a company then the person's interests are also measured by reference to the person's market value interests in the company. Aggregation rule company and individual The test associating a company and person other than a company test contains a general aggregation rule, which applies for the purposes of the whole Act except the land provisions (section YB 3(3)). Accordingly, for the purposes of determining whether a company and a person other than a company are associated, a person is treated as holding anything held by persons associated with the person under sections YB 4 to YB 14. This aggregation rule is designed to prevent the test associating a company and a person other than a company being circumvented by the fragmentation of interests among associated persons, resulting in the interest threshold of 25% not being reached. The test associating a company and a person other than a company contains a separate rule which aggregates the interests of associates for the purposes of the land provisions (section YB 3(4)). Under this rule, a person is treated as holding anything held by persons associated with the person under the limited relatives definition in sections YB 4 (namely, spouses, civil union partners, de facto partners and infant children) and under the tests in sections YB 7, YB 8, and YB 10 to YB 14. This modification ensures that for the purposes of the land provisions, the general relatives test and the beneficiary-related trust tests do not apply in the aggregation rule for the test associating a company and person other than a company. When applying the rule aggregating the interests of associates, the rule is applied afresh to each person being tested for association with a company and it is irrelevant that a person does not directly hold shares in a company before the application of the aggregation rule. The aggregation rules are an element of both of the company-based tests in sections YB 2 and YB 3. As noted above, the aggregation rules are designed to prevent these tests being circumvented by the fragmentation of interests among associated persons, resulting in the interest thresholds in these tests not being met. As such, the aggregation rules do not act as separate associated persons tests. ird.govt.nz 37 Example Application of the general aggregation rule in the company and person other than a company test Without an aggregation rule, neither Sister A, B nor C would be associated with Family Company under the company and person other than a company test because their respective interests do not meet the required 25% threshold. However, under the aggregation rule in section YB 3(3), each sister would be associated with the company. This is because for the purposes of determining whether Sister A is associated with Family Company under section YB 3(1), she is treated as holding her sisters' 20% voting interests in the company (10% each from Sister B and Sister C). This 20%, when aggregated with her own 10% voting interest, means that Sister A is treated as holding a 30% interest and, therefore, is associated with the company. The aggregation rule applies afresh to each person—so similarly, Sister B and Sister C are each treated as holding the other 2 sisters' aggregate 20% voting interests in the company. Therefore, when aggregated with the 10% interest they each own in the company, Sister B and Sister C are each associated with Family Company. Sister B 10% 10% Family Company Sister ASister C 10% 38 A guide to associated persons definitions for income tax purposes Example Application of the general aggregation rule in the company and person other than a company test Jo settles Family Trusts 1 and 2 and arranges for each of them to hold 20% of the shares in Family Co. Jo also arranges for her spouse and child to hold 20% each in Family Co. Jo directly holds only 20%. Under the aggregation rule in section YB 3(3), Jo is treated as holding the shares in Family Co held by the family trusts and relatives because they are her associates. Accordingly, Jo is associated with Family Co. Without the rule aggregating the interests held by associated persons Jo would not be associated with Family Co despite the close community of interests. Jo Family Trust 1 Jo's spouse settles 20% Family Co settles Jo's child Family Trust 2 20%20% 20% 20% ird.govt.nz 39 Example Application of aggregation rule in the company and person other than a company test in the context of the land provisions The question in this case is whether the appointer of the trustee in Trust 2 is associated with Developer Co under the test in section YB 3 associating a company and a person other than a company. The appointer is associated with Developer Co under this test because of the application of the aggregation rule for land provisions in section YB 3(4) which treats a person as holding anything held by their associates. The appointer is associated with Trust 1 under the tripartite test in section YB 14. Specifically, the appointer is associated with Trust 2 under the test in section YB 11 associating a trustee and their appointer, and Trust 2 is associated with Trust 1 under the test in section YB 7 associating 2 trustees with a common settlor. Therefore, under the aggregation rule for land provisions in section YB 3(4) the appointer is treated as holding Trust 1's shares in Developer Co. Accordingly, the appointer and Developer Co are associated under section YB 3. Note, however, that the relative of the appointer would not be associated with Developer Co. In particular, the tripartite test does not associate Trust 1 and the relative and therefore the relative is not treated as holding Trust 1's shares in Developer Co. The aggregation rule is applied afresh to the relative, and not to the appointer, for the purposes of determining whether the relative is associated with Developer Co. Therefore, the fact that the appointer is treated under the aggregation rule as holding Trust 1's shares when testing for association between the appointer and Developer Co is disregarded when testing for association between the relative and Developer Co. Developer Co Settlor YB 3 100% Trust 1 Trust 2 Appointer Relative 40 A guide to associated persons definitions for income tax purposes Corporate trustees In section YB 3, ‘a person other than a company’ includes a company acting in its capacity as a trustee of a trust (section YB 3(5)). This amendment is of a clarifying nature only and is consistent with long-standing policy (Tax Information Bulletin (TIB), Vol 3, No 7, April 1992 at page 23). The company look-through rules in subpart YC applying to voting and market value interests do not apply to a corporate trustee; therefore, the voting interests or market value interests held by a corporate trustee are not traced through to the shareholders of that corporate trustee. This treatment is a result of the separate capacity that a trustee (whether a company or natural person) has under the Income Tax Act 2007, and is recognised in the definition of ‘trustee’ in section YA 1 which refers to a trustee ‘only in the capacity of trustee of the trust’. This separate trustee capacity feature of the income tax law has been maintained in the new associated persons definitions. Therefore the shareholders of a corporate trustee are not relevant when testing for association between that trustee and other persons. This is consistent with the general position under the Income Tax Act, which is that a company acting in its capacity as trustee is treated as a trustee rather than a company. This means that the relevant test for determining association between a corporate trustee and a company in which the corporate trustee is a shareholder is section YB 3. Relatives test (section YB 4) There are 3 limbs to the general relatives test in the new associated persons definitions: • • The first limb associates 2 persons who are within 2 degrees of blood relationship (section YB 4(1)(a)). Previously the general relatives test extended to the fourth degree of blood relationship. This means that the blood relationships limb of the general relatives test extends to grandparents and siblings but not to nephews and nieces (third degree) and cousins (fourth degree) as the previous test did. • • The second limb associates 2 persons who are married, in a civil union, or in a de facto relationship (section YB 4(1)(b)). • • The third limb associates 2 persons if one person is within 2 degrees of blood relationship to the other person's spouse, civil union partner, or de facto partner (section YB 4(1)(c)). This limb associates persons with their in-laws and step-children. For the purposes of the relatives associated persons test, a child by adoption is treated as a natural child of the adoptive parents and not as a natural child of the birth parents (section YB 4(3)). A new provision (section YB 4(4)) has been added to the test associating 2 relatives to ensure that a person is not associated with another person if the person cannot reasonably be expected to know that the other person exists or that they are within 2 degrees of blood relationship to the other person. This exclusion is designed to deal with a small minority of situations such as when siblings are separated at a very young age and do not know of each other's existence. Narrower application of relatives test in certain cases (section YB 4(2)) The first and third limbs (section YB 4(1)(a) and (c)) of the general relatives test of association do not apply for the purposes of the land provisions (defined in section YA 1) or 2 compliance-cost saving provisions in the Income Tax Act—namely, the low turnover trader provision in section EB 13, and the provision relating to the adverse event livestock transfers in section EC 5. In these circumstances, persons are associated because of a blood relationship only if one is the infant child of the other. An ‘infant child’ is defined in the Age of Majority Act 1970 as a person under 20 years of age. ird.govt.nz 41 Example Application of narrow relatives test in section YB 4(2) Under the trading stock provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007, there are special low-compliance cost rules which apply to a ‘low-turnover trader’. For a person to be a low-turnover trader, the turnover of that person's business, when aggregated with the turnover of associated persons, must be no more than $3 million. In this example, because a narrow relatives test applies for the purposes of the low-turnover trader rules, Adult Sam and his step-mothers' company are not associated and therefore Sam is entitled to use the low-turnover trader rules for his business. In particular, because Adult Sam is not treated under the relatives test in section YB 4 as being associated with his step-mother, the aggregation rule in the test in section YB 3 associating a company and a person other than a company does not apply to treat Adult Sam as holding his step-mother's shares in her company. If the ordinary relatives associated persons test had applied to the low-turnover trader rules Sam would be treated as being associated with his step-mothers' company under section YB 3 and therefore would not have been entitled to use the low-turnover trader rules. Father's new wife (step-mother) Father 100% X Adult Sam ($150,000 turnover) Step-mother’s company (3 million turnover) 42 A guide to associated persons definitions for income tax purposes Trustee for relative test (section YB 5) A person (first person) and a trustee of a trust under which a relative (as defined in section YB 4) of the first person has benefited or is eligible to benefit are associated persons under new section YB 5. For example, a husband and a trustee of a trust under which the husband's wife is a beneficiary would be associated under this test. The trustee for relative test does not apply for the purposes of the land provisions. This is consistent with the land provision exclusions in the other beneficiary-related tests in section YB 6 (trustee and beneficiary) and YB 9 (settlor and beneficiary). Example Person and trustee for relative: exception for the purposes of the land provisions Because the trustee for relative test does not apply for the purposes of the land provisions, the husband would not be associated with the trustee of the trust under which his wife is a beneficiary. Under the previous trustee for relative test in former section YB 12, the husband would have been associated with the trustee for the purposes of the land provisions. Additionally, as further discussed below, this test does not apply to energy consumer trusts established under the Energy Companies Act 1992 or the unit trust administering bonus bonds (section YB 16). Husband Wife Trustee (Developer) Beneficiary of trust X ird.govt.nz 43 Trustee and beneficiary test (section YB 6) A trustee of a trust and a person who has benefited or is eligible to benefit under the trust are associated persons under new section YB 6. This provision does not apply for the purposes of the land provisions. Persons have benefited under a trust if they have received a distribution under the trust. Inland Revenue's long-standing policy on when a person is eligible to benefit under a trust will continue, see Tax Information Bulletin (TIB), Vol 7, No 9, February 1996 page 25. In particular, a person is ‘eligible to benefit’ when the person is either: • • named by the trustee as a potential beneficiary, or • • designated as a member of a class of potential beneficiaries, for example, ‘the children of ...’. When trustees have a general power of appointment, persons not already appointed as beneficiaries under the power are not treated as being eligible to benefit. Therefore, a person who is eligible to benefit under a trust (as described above) does not need to have actually received a distribution (as defined in section HC 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007) under the trust to qualify as a beneficiary. An exception to the trustee and beneficiary test for certain employee trusts is contained in section YB 15. Additionally, as with section YB 5, this test does not apply to energy consumer trusts or the unit trust administering bonus bonds (section YB 16). The trustee and beneficiary test (and other trustee-related tests) are not relevant to unit trust investment vehicles. This is because such unit trusts are treated as companies for all income tax purposes. This means that it is the company related tests—in particular, section YB 3—that are the relevant associated persons tests. The 25% threshold in section YB 3 would ensure that retail investors would not be associated with widely held public unit trusts. The trustee and beneficiary test (and other beneficiary-related tests) are not relevant to purpose trusts such as charitable trusts and community trusts referred to in the Community Trusts Act 1999 (these trusts were established to hold the shares in the successor companies to the former trustee banks). This is because purpose trusts do not at law have beneficiaries. The previous general definition of associated persons did not contain a trustee and beneficiary test. This constituted a significant omission in test coverage and transactions were often structured to take advantage of the loophole. Without a trustee and beneficiary test in the associated persons definitions, many of the operative rules in the Income Tax Act using the general associated persons definition could be readily circumvented by simply interposing a discretionary trust. 44 A guide to associated persons definitions for income tax purposes Example In this example, the company provides a benefit to a beneficiary of its trustee shareholder. The company provides the benefit because the trustee is its sole shareholder. Section CD 6(1)(a)(ii) in the dividend rules treats payments to associated persons of shareholders as dividends. However, without a trustee and beneficiary test, this simple arrangement would avoid the dividend rules. Under the new trustee and beneficiary test, because the company is providing a benefit to an associated person (Beneficiary) of a shareholder in the company (Trust), the company has made a dividend to the beneficiary under section CD 6(1)(a)(ii). Example In this example, an employer provides a low interest loan to a trust under which an employee is a beneficiary. Under section CX 18, FBT applies to fringe benefits provided to associated persons of employees. Without the trustee and beneficiary test in section YB 6, this simple arrangement avoids this rule. However, because of the new trustee and beneficiary test, the employer would be providing a fringe benefit (the low interest loan) to an associated person of the employee (the Trust) and would therefore be subject to FBT. Beneficiary Tr u s t Company benefit 100% Employer Tr u s t low interest loan Employee (Beneficiary) distribution ird.govt.nz 45 Two trustees with common settlor test (section YB 7) Under new section YB 7, a trustee of a trust and a trustee of another trust are associated persons if the same person is a settlor of both trusts. New section YB 10 provides that for the purposes of the new section YB 7, ‘settlor’ has the meaning set out in section HC 27 of the Income Tax Act 2007, but does not include a person who provides services to a trust for less than market value. An exception to the 2 trustees with common settlor test for certain employee trusts is contained in section YB 15. Without a test associating 2 trustees with a common settlor many of the operative rules in the Income Tax Act which use the associated persons definition, such as the dividend rules, could be circumvented by structures such as the following example. Example In this example, Megan settles Family Trust 1, a trust that owns all of the shares in Family Co. Megan also settles Family Trust 2 whose discretionary beneficiaries include Megan's children and Megan herself. Family Co. makes a payment to Family Trust 2. Under the dividend rules in sections CD 3 to CD 6 of the Income Tax Act, any payment made by a company to an associated person of a shareholder of the company is treated as a dividend if that payment would have been a dividend if it had been made to the shareholder. Megan Family Trust 1 settles Family Co settles Family Trust 2 100% payment YB 7 Megan and Megan's children distribution to beneficiaries 46 A guide to associated persons definitions for income tax purposes In the absence of a 2 trustees with common settlor test, Family Co has not made a payment to an associated person of its shareholder (Family Trust 1), in terms of section CD 6(1)(a)(ii). Therefore, the payment from Family Co to Family Trust 2 would not be treated as a dividend. Under the new 2 trustees with common settlor test in section YB 7, Family Trust 1 and Family Trust 2 are associated persons as they have a common settlor (Megan). Therefore, the payment from Family Co to Family Trust 2 (an associated person of Family Co's shareholder, Family Trust 1) is treated as a dividend. Two trustees with common settlor: mirror trusts For the purposes of the 2 trustees with a common settlor test in section YB 7, 2 persons who are married, in a civil union, or in a de facto relationship are treated as the same single person. This is relevant to identifying a common settlor of 2 trusts, and prevents the new associated persons definition being circumvented by the use of ‘mirror trusts’. This is illustrated in the following example. Example In this example spouse A settles a family trust (Trust A) for the benefit of spouse B and spouse B settles another family trust (Trust B) for the benefit of spouse A. Without the provision in the 2 trustees with common settlor test treating 2 persons who are married, in a civil union, or in a de facto relationship as the same single person, the trustees of Trust A and Trust B would not be associated despite the close community of interests. The trustees of Trust A and Trust B are associated under new section YB 7 because Spouse A and Spouse B are treated as the same single person and therefore the trustees of Trust A and Trust B have a common settlor. YB 7 Spouse A beneficiary Trust A Trust B Spouse B settlessettles Spouse A Spouse B beneficiary ird.govt.nz 47 Trustee and settlor test (section YB 8) A trustee of a trust and a settlor of the trust are associated persons under new section YB 8. New section YB 10 provides that for the purposes of new section YB 8, ‘settlor’ has the meaning set out in section HC 27, with the modification that a settlor does not include a person who provides services to a trust for less than market value. An exception to the trustee and settlor test for certain employee trusts is contained in section YB 15. As with the other trustee-related tests, the trustee and settlor test is an important element of the new associated persons definitions. Without this test in the associated persons definitions, schemes could be developed to exploit such a loophole. This is illustrated by the following examples. Example In this example, Family Co makes a payment to Family Trust. Ben is the sole shareholder of Family Co and the settlor of Family Trust. Without a trustee and settlor test in the associated persons definition the payment from Family Co to Family Trust is not caught as a dividend despite the close community of interests. This is because Family Trust would not be associated with Ben who is the sole shareholder of Family Co. Under the new trustee and settlor test in section YB 8, Ben and Family Trust are associated persons as Ben is the settlor of Family Trust. The payment from Family Co to the Family Trust is accordingly treated as a dividend because Family Co has made a payment to an associated person (Family Trust) of its shareholder (Ben) in terms of section CD 6(1)(a)(ii). settles Family Co 100% Family Tr u s t payment Ben's children distribution to beneficiaries Ben 48 A guide to associated persons definitions for income tax purposes Example Non-resident settlor In this example, a non-resident settles a New Zealand trust (with a New Zealand-incorporated company as trustee) which owns New Zealand land and buildings. This investment by the trustee is funded by a loan from the non-resident settlor. If the non-resident is not associated with the New Zealand trustee, then the interest paid on this loan qualifies for the approved issuer levy (AIL) of 2% instead of being subject to the higher NRWT (non-resident withholding tax) rate. The previous associated persons definition used in the AIL rules was generally deficient in relation to arrangements involving trusts. In this example in particular, without a trustee and settlor test of association, the interest would qualify for AIL treatment despite the in-substance association between the 2 parties. The new trustee and settlor test in section YB 8 would associate the non-resident with the New Zealand trustee. Accordingly, the interest derived by the non-resident from New Zealand would be subject to a higher rate of NRWT instead of AIL at 2%, which is the appropriate treatment. Settlor and beneficiary test (section YB 9) A settlor of a trust and a person who has benefited or is eligible to benefit under the trust are associated persons under section YB 9. This test does not apply for the purposes of the land provisions (as defined in section YA 1). The settlor and beneficiary test is the third test of association (the others being the trustees with a common settlor and trustee and settlor tests) that is based on the settlor of a trust. This focus on the settlor is consistent with the settlor-based focus of the trust taxation rules. Given that there is a sufficient connection between a trustee and a beneficiary, as well as between a trustee and a settlor to justify treating them as associated persons, there is equally a sufficient connection between a settlor and a beneficiary to justify treating them as associated persons as well. An exception to the settlor and beneficiary test for certain employee trusts is also contained in section YB 15. Non-resident (beneficiary) settles New Zealand Trust (holding NZ property) loan interest ird.govt.nz 49 Definition of settlor (section YB 10) As mentioned, for the purposes of the settlor-based tests in sections YB 7 to YB 9, settlor has the meaning set out in section HC 27, with the modification that a settlor does not include a person who provides services to a trust for less than market value. This modification prevents a professional advisor who provides services to a trust at no charge being treated as a settlor of the trust. The term “settlor” has a wide meaning under the section HC 27 definition. A settlor of a trust is defined to include a person who transfers value to a trust, for the benefit of the trust, or on terms of the trust. Section HC 27 also includes rules for determining when a beneficiary is a settlor if they are owed money by the trustee and whether a transfer of value or provision of financial assistance has been made. These transfers of value are referred to as settlements. A settlement is any action that makes a person a settlor of a trust and includes any of the following: • • disposal of any property to the trust for less than market value • • property or funds made available to the trust for less than market value • • any property acquired from the trust or any service from the trustee for greater than market value. A settlement can also occur as a result of a transaction or series of transactions entered by a person that has the effect of making that person a settlor. The definition of settlor is further extended by the provisions of section HC 28, the most significant of which are: • • When a company makes a settlement, any shareholder with an interest of 10% or more in that company is treated as a settlor in relation to that settlement as well as the company itself. • • When a trustee of a trust (the first trust) settles another trust (the second trust), the settlor of the second trust is treated as including any person who is a settlor of the first trust. • • When a person has any rights or powers in relation to a trustee or settlor of a trust which enables the person to require the trustee to treat the person (or any nominee) as a beneficiary of the trust, the person is treated as a settlor of that trust. The definition of “settlor” is used extensively in the Income Tax Act and its wide meaning is consistent with the settlor-based focus of the trust taxation rules in the Income Tax Act. The definition of “settlor”, in conjunction with the nominee look-through rule in section YB 21, does not include professional advisors acting on behalf of clients and other persons such as friends and family members who simply allow their name to be listed as the settlor on a trust deed. The definition of “settlor” that is being used is essentially the same as that originally enacted in 1988 as part of a reform of the trust rules (with the exception that the provision of services at less than market value are excluded). The main focus of this definition is on persons who provide the trust property, and therefore does not include persons who merely allow their name to go on the trust deed as the named settlor. It is therefore the client of the professional advisor, or the person that the friend or family member is acting for, who is treated as the settlor under the settlor-based tests in sections YB 7 to YB 9. This position is consistent with Inland Revenue’s long-standing policy. Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) of November 1989 on the trust rules at paragraph 6.93 states: “Often professional advisers or relatives will assist in establishing a trust by settling a nominal sum on trust on behalf of another person. In these circumstances it is not appropriate to expose the professional adviser or relative to a potential tax liability. The professional adviser or relative is not the real settlor of the trust but is in effect only an intermediary or facilitator. The real settlor is the person on whose behalf the professional adviser or relative acted in making the settlement. Thus, s.226(3) \[now section YB 21 of the Income Tax Act 2007\] treats the person for whom the nominee or the nominal settlor acted as the settlor rather than the nominee or nominal settlor.” 50 A guide to associated persons definitions for income tax purposes Trustee and person with power of appointment or removal test (section YB 11) A trustee of a trust and person who has a power of appointment or removal of the trustee are associated persons under section YB 11. This test is intended to complement the test associating a trustee and settlor in section YB 8. In many cases, a settlor of a trust, as the author of the instrument creating and governing the administration of the trust, retains the power to appoint or remove trustees. However, this power could be reposed in a separate person. There is sufficient connection between a trustee of a trust and the person who has the power to appoint or remove the trustee to justify treating them as associated persons. The situations considered to be caught by the test in section YB 11 associating a trustee and a person with the power of appointment or removal of the trustee include: • • a person who holds a power to appoint or remove trustees jointly with another person • • a person who holds a power to appoint or remove trustees only with the consent of another person (often referred to as the ‘protector’). However, the following situations are not considered to be caught by the test in section YB 11: • • a person who holds a power to appoint or remove trustees only on the happening of certain events in the future (for example, the incapacity of another person) are not treated as currently holding a power of appointment or removal • • a person (often referred to as the protector) who holds the power to veto the appointments or removal of a trustee (because they do not hold any positive power). The requirement in the tripartite test in section YB 14 that 2 persons must be associated with the same third person under different associated persons tests should obviate any concerns about whether otherwise unrelated trustees are associated under that test merely because a professional advisor acting in their capacity as such has been granted the power to appoint or remove trustees by their clients. An exception to the test associating a trustee and a person with a power of appointment or removal of the trustee for certain employee trusts is contained in section YB 15. ird.govt.nz 51 Partnership and partner test (section YB 12) A partnership and a partner in the partnership are associated persons under section YB 12(1). The tripartite test in section YB 14—which associates 2 persons if they are each associated with the same third person under different associated persons tests—will not apply to associate the partners themselves with each other. This is because partners in a partnership would be associated with the same third person (the partnership) under the same associated persons test, namely section YB 12. Example Partnership and partner Partner A Partnership Partner B Partner C YB 12YB 12YB 12 A, B and C are individuals who are partners in a partnership. Under the partnership and partner test in section YB 12, Partners A, B and C are each associated with the partnership. However, they are not associated with each other under the tripartite test in section YB 14 through their association with the partnership. The partners may still be associated with each other under a different associated persons test. For example, if partners B and C were married they would be associated with each other under the relatives test in section YB 4. The test associating a partnership and an associate of a partner in former section YB 17 has been subsumed by the new tripartite test in section YB 14, which associates 2 persons if they are each associated with the same third person under different associated persons tests. This means that an associate of a partner, such as a spouse of a partner, would still be associated with the partnership itself, as illustrated in the following example. 52 A guide to associated persons definitions for income tax purposes Example Partnership and associate of a partner: association through tripartite test Partner A Partnership Partner B Partner C YB 12YB 12YB 12 Spouse tripartite test (YB 14) In this example, the spouse of Partner C is associated with Partner C under the relatives test in section YB 4, and Partner C and Partnership are associated under the partnership and partner test in section YB 12. Therefore, applying the tripartite test, Spouse and Partnership are associated persons as they are each associated with the same third person (Partner C) under different associated persons tests. Limited partnerships There is a separate test for determining if a limited partnership and a limited partner are associated. A limited partnership (as defined in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007) and a limited partner are associated only if the limited partner has a partnership share of 25% or more in the limited partnership (section YB 12(2)). This treatment is appropriate because a limited partner cannot be involved in the management of the partnership (unlike in a general partnership). It should be noted that section YB 12(2) is limited to the limited partners and not the general partner in a limited partnership. A general partner in a limited partnership will be associated with the limited partnership under section YB 12(1). Section YB 12(3) and (4) contain aggregation rules for limited partnerships, similar to the aggregation rules in the company and person other than a company test in section YB 3 (the aggregation rule in section YB 12(3) applies for the purposes of the whole Act except the land provisions, and the more limited aggregation rule in section YB 12(4) applies for the purposes of the land provisions). This is appropriate given that a limited partner is more akin to a shareholder in a company and the interest threshold for associating a limited partner in a limited partnership – 25% – is the same as the threshold in section YB 3. ird.govt.nz 53 Example Aggregation rule for limited partnership Spouse (limited partner 1) A 12.5%12.5% Spouse (limited partner 1) B Limited Partnership All other limited partners YB 4 In this example, in the absence of an aggregation rule, Spouse A and Spouse B would not be associated with Limited Partnership, as their respective shares in the partnership do not meet the required 25% threshold. However, applying the aggregation rule for limited partnerships in section YB 12(3), both Spouse A and Spouse B would be associated with Limited Partnership. This is because for the purposes of determining whether Spouse A is associated with Limited Partnership under section YB 12(2), Spouse A is treated as holding anything held by associates—in this case, Spouse A is associated with Spouse B under the relatives test in section YB 4. When Spouse A's 12.5% share in Limited Partnership is aggregated with his associate's (Spouse B) 12.5% share, the required 25% threshold is met and Spouse A is therefore associated with Limited Partnership under section YB 12(2). Once again, the aggregation rule is applied afresh to each person. As a result, the aggregation rule is also applied in this case to associate Spouse B with Limited Partnership. This is consistent with the application of the aggregation rule in the company-related tests. Tripartite test (section YB 14) The tripartite test in section YB 14 associates 2 persons if they are each associated with the same third person under different associated persons tests. The tripartite test acts as an important buttress to the other associated persons tests and makes the associated persons definition as a whole more difficult to circumvent. For the tripartite test to associate 2 persons, each of these persons must be associated with the same third person under different associated persons tests, not including the tripartite test itself. The requirement that the 2 persons cannot be associated with the same third person under the tripartite test itself is necessary to prevent the tripartite test operating in a reiterative manner. The requirement that the 2 persons have to be associated with the same third person under different associated persons tests ensures that the tripartite test does not apply more widely than is necessary to protect the tax base. The following examples illustrate the important role of the tripartite test in preventing the other associated persons tests being circumvented by arrangements involving the interposition of relatives, companies and trusts which are under the influence or control of the main protagonists. 54 A guide to associated persons definitions for income tax purposes Example Application of the tripartite test Employer Tr u s t low-interest loan YB 3 100% Beneficiary Co Employee YB 6 tripartite test (YB 14) In this example, the employer makes a low-interest loan to Trust which in turn makes a distribution to Beneficiary Co which is wholly owned by an employee of the employer. The tripartite test in section YB 14 associates Trust with the employee because they are both associated with Beneficiary Co. In particular, Trust is associated with Beneficiary Co under the trustee-beneficiary test in section YB 6, and the employee is associated with Beneficiary Co under the test in section YB 3 associating a company and a person other than a company. As a result, because the employer has provided a fringe benefit (the low-interest loan) to an associate of an employee, the employer would have to account for FBT on the low-interest loan. Example Application of the tripartite test Suzie Trust A settles Family Co settles Trust B 100% YB 3 Tripartite test (YB 14) YB 7 ird.govt.nz 55 In the above example, Suzie settles 2 family trusts: Trust A and Trust B. Trust A in turn owns all the shares in Family Co. The issue is whether Family Co is associated with Trust B. Without a tripartite test, Family Co and Trust B would not be associated, despite the close community of interests between them. However, under the tripartite test in section YB 14, Family Co and Trust B are associated. In particular, Family Co is associated with Trust A under the company and person other than a company test in section YB 3, and Trust A is associated with Trust B under the 2 trustees with a common settlor test in section YB 7. Therefore, under the tripartite test, Family Co and Trust B are associated persons. Example Application of the tripartite test and the aggregation rule Developer's spouse Tr u s t settles YB 8 YB 3 Family Co Developer 100% YB 3 tripartite test (YB 14) YB 4 In this example, Developer's spouse settles Trust, which in turn owns all the shares in Family Co. The issue is whether Developer is associated with Family Co under the test associating a company and a person other than a company in section YB 3. Developer would be associated with Family Co under the company and person other than a company test because of the application of the aggregation rule in that test, in conjunction with the tripartite test. In particular, Developer would be treated for the purposes of the company and person other than a company test as holding all the shares held by Trust in Family Co. This is because Trust is associated with Developer under the tripartite test: Developer is associated with his spouse under the relatives test (section YB 4) and Developer's spouse is associated with Trust under the trustee and settlor test (section YB 8), which means that Developer is associated with Trust under the tripartite test. Without the tripartite test in section YB 14 and the rule in the company and person other than a company test aggregating interests held by associated persons, Developer would not be associated with Family Co even though there is a large community of interest between them. Different associated persons requirement The requirement in the tripartite test in section YB 14 that the 2 persons have to be associated with the same third person under different associated person tests is designed to prevent the tripartite test applying more widely than is necessary to protect the tax base. This requirement is illustrated by the following examples. 56 A guide to associated persons definitions for income tax purposes Example XYZ 50%50% Company B Company C Company A 100%50%50% In this example, individuals X, Y and Z, who are not associated with each other, own all the shares in Company A, Company B and Company C. Without the different associated persons tests requirement, Company A and Company C would be associated under the tripartite test in section YB 14, despite not having any common shareholders. However, because Company A and Company C are each associated with Company B under the same 2 companies test in section YB 2, they are not associated under the tripartite test. Example Company D JimJo 50%50% In this example, Jim and Jo, who are not separately associated with each other, each hold 50% of the voting interests in Company D and are therefore each associated with Company D under the test in section YB 3 associating a company and a person other than a company. Without the different associated persons tests requirement, Jim and Jo would be associated under the tripartite test. However, because Jim and Jo are each associated with Company D (the common third person) under the same test (section YB 3), they are not associated under the tripartite test in section YB 14. ird.govt.nz 57 Exception for companies tests (section YB 14(2)) As well as not applying to associate 2 persons if they are each associated with the same third person under the same associated persons test, the tripartite test will not associate 2 persons if they are each associated with the same third person under the company-related tests in sections YB 2 and YB 3. Example Tripartite test: Companies tests exception Company X Company Y Sid associated under YB 3 25% associated under YB 2 50% In this example, Sid is associated with Company X under the company and person other than a company test in section YB 3, and Company X and Company Y are associated under the 2 companies test in section YB 2. Without the companies tests exception in section YB 14(2), the tripartite test would apply to associate Sid and Company Y (Company X being the common third person). This would be the case even though Sid only has a 12.5% interest in Company Y—the product of multiplying Sid's 25% interest in Company X by Company X's 50% interest in Company Y—which is below the 25% threshold in the company and person other than a company test in section YB 3. The companies test exception in section YB 14(2) ensures that Sid is not associated with Company Y under the tripartite test. Exceptions for certain trusts and charitable organisations (sections YB 16 and YB 8(2)) Energy consumer trusts and bonus bonds unit trust Under section YB 16(1), a lines trust established under the Energy Companies Act 1992, commonly referred to as an energy consumer trust, is excluded from the trustee for relative test (section YB 5) and the test associating trustees and beneficiaries (section YB 6). This is because such trusts are public in nature and are not intended to be subject to the associated persons tests. Excluding energy consumer trusts from the tests in sections YB 5 and YB 6, ensures that discounts to consumers from electricity lines companies owned by consumer trusts are not treated as dividends, as illustrated in the following example. 58 A guide to associated persons definitions for income tax purposes Example Exception for energy consumer trusts YB 6 YB 3 100% Electric Lines Company Developer beneficiary Energy consumer trust Consumer beneficiaries X Non-developer beneficiary discounts (via electricity retailers) The exception for energy consumer trusts also prevents consumer beneficiaries from being associated with one another. Even without this exception, the scope of the tripartite test is such that it would not apply to treat consumer beneficiaries as associated persons. Using the above example, this means that the developer beneficiary and the non-developer beneficiary will not be associated persons. This is because they are both associated with the same third person (Energy consumer trust) under the same associated persons test, namely the trustee and beneficiary test in section YB 6, which means that the tripartite test does not apply. Additionally, section YB 16(1) also excludes the unit trust that administers bonus bonds from the associated persons tests in sections YB 5 and YB 6 because of its public nature. This unit trust is excluded from the unit trust definition in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007, and therefore is not treated as a company, which means that the trust-related associated persons tests could potentially apply to it. Charitable organisations Under section YB 16(2), ‘charitable organisations’ (as defined in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007) are not treated as beneficiaries for the purposes of tests associating trustees and beneficiaries (section YB 6) and settlors and beneficiaries (section YB 9). ird.govt.nz 59 Example Trust 1 Settlor 1 Settlor 2 Settlor 3 Trust 2 Trust 3 Charitable organisation beneficiary Without the exception for charitable organisations in section YB 16(2), the beneficiary-related tests could have unintended consequences. For example, if the beneficiary of several unrelated trusts is the same charity, the trustee and settlor of each such trust could end up being associated with the trustee and settlor of all such trusts without being aware of the fact. This exception therefore ensures that trustees and settlors of trusts in this situation are not treated as associated persons simply because the same charity is a beneficiary under their trust. Charitable trusts The trustee and settlor test in section YB 8 does not apply if the trust is a charitable trust. This exception— section YB 8(2)—prevents donors to a charitable trust being associated with each other. A charitable trust under the Income Tax Act 2007 is required to be registered as a charitable entity under the Charities Act 2005 and is therefore subject to any regulatory requirements of that Act. Such charities do not pose a risk to the tax base and therefore it is not necessary to include them in the trustee and settlor associated persons test. Rationalising associated persons references in operative provisions A number of operative provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 previously contained modifications or additional wording in their associated persons references. These modifications were a result of different combinations of the associated persons tests in former subpart YB applying, in particular, the tests that applied for the purposes of the whole Act (excluding the 1973, 1988 and 1990 version provisions) or the 1988 version provisions (corresponding to the associated persons definitions in sections OD 7 and OD 8(3) of the Income Tax Act 2004). An example of such a provision was section EX 21(15). These modifications to the associated person references in the operative provisions of the Income Tax Act 2007 have been generally omitted because they have been effectively subsumed by the various reforms to the associated persons tests in new subpart YB. The wording of these operative provisions therefore has been significantly simplified because they will simply refer to persons being associated without more (for example, without various references to the 1973, 1988 or 1990 version provisions). As a result, the wording of the associated person references in the operative provisions of the Income Tax Act 2007 are now streamlined and easier to understand. 60 A guide to associated persons definitions for income tax purposes For example, the wording of section GB 28(2) was: ‘A person is treated as being associated with another person if a person would be treated as being associated under the parts of subpart YB (associated persons and nominees) that apply for the purposes of the whole Act (excluding the 1973, 1988, and 1990 version provisions), or the 1988 version provisions, at the time the services are personally performed by the working person.’ This wording has been replaced by: ‘A person is treated as being associated with another person if they are associated at the time the services are personally performed by the working person.’ The definitions of the 1973, 1988 and 1990 version provisions and previous section YB 20 have been repealed because they are largely subsumed by the various reforms to the associated persons tests in subpart YB. These definitions equate to the lists of operative provisions to which the former specific associated persons definitions in sections OD 8(4), OD 8(3) and OD 8(1) of the Income Tax Act 2004 applied. However, because of the various modifications that apply in the associated persons tests in relation to the land transaction provisions, previously defined as the ‘1973 version provisions’, this definition has been re-enacted in section YA 1 and called ‘land provisions’. The new associated persons definition in the Income Tax Act 2007 also applies in the Tax Administration Act 1994 because of section 3(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. A number of the specific modifications or additional wording in the associated persons references in the operative provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 were incorrect. These references have been corrected applicable from the commencement of the Income Tax Act 2007 on 1 April 2008, even though these references themselves have been omitted as part of these reforms of the associated persons definitions. It is necessary to correct these references from the commencement of the Income Tax Act 2007 on 1 April 2008 because the current associated person reforms do not apply generally until the 2010–11 income year. Section CD 6(1)(a)(iii) repealed A transfer of value from a company to a person is a dividend if the cause of the transfer is a shareholding in the company as described in section CD 6 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Section CD 6(1)(a)(iii) contained an extension which treated as a dividend any distribution made by a company to a trust under which a shareholder of the company, or spouse, civil union, or de facto partner of the shareholder, was a beneficiary. This trust extension rule has been repealed because its function is performed by the new associated persons definition—in particular, the trustee-beneficiary test in new section YB 6. Section CD 22(9) amendment The definition of ‘fifteen percent interest reduction’ in section CD 22(9), which relates to the share buy-back exclusion from the dividend definition, refers to ‘counted associate’, which is defined inter alia as ‘a trustee of a trust under which a spouse, civil union partner or de facto partner, or minor child of the shareholder is a beneficiary’. This wording has been amended so that it is consistent with other references in the associated persons definitions which describe discretionary beneficiaries. The provision now refers to a person who has benefited or is eligible to benefit under a trust (instead of referring to a beneficiary). Section DB 42(2) amendment Section DB 42(1) allows a taxpayer a deduction for any loss arising through misappropriation by an employee. Former section DB 42(2) stated that this deduction was not available if the taxpayer and the employee were associated in certain ways. The new associated persons definition is comprehensive enough to cover all the relationships described in former section DB 42(2). Therefore the specific associated persons tests in this provision have been replaced by a standard associated persons reference. New section DB 42(2) simply provides that the section does not apply when a person who misappropriates property is associated with the person who carries on the business. ird.govt.nz 61 Omitted tests Several associated persons tests contained in the previous subpart YB of the Income Tax Act 2007 have been omitted for simplification and rationalisation purposes. These omitted tests were: • • The test associating 2 persons if they habitually act together (former section YB 18). • • The test associating a person and a charity, friendly society, or non-profit body controlled by that person or a relative of that person (former section YB 19). • • The tests associating 2 companies and a company and a person other than a company, which were based on income interests (former sections YB 3 and YB 7). These tests were redundant given the equivalent comprehensive tests based on voting interests. The existence of these tests can be explained historically by the fact that they were originally enacted in 1988 before the voting interest concept was enacted in 1992. • • The test associating a partnership and an associate of a partner (former section YB 17). This test has been subsumed by the new tripartite test in section YB 14. Under the tripartite test 2 persons are associated if they are each associated with the same third person under different associated persons tests. This means that an associate of a partner, such as a spouse of a partner, would still be associated with the partnership under the tripartite test. Rationalisation of other income tax provisions A number of provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 embodying a related person concept, similar to that in the associated persons definitions, have been rationalised. It is desirable, from a simplification perspective, that similar concepts in the Act be addressed similarly. Replacing company control definition with associated persons definition Section YC 1 of the Income Tax Act, which defined when a company was treated as being under the control of any persons, has been repealed. Its function is now performed by the new associated persons definition. The definition of company control in section YC 1 and the definitions of associated persons in subpart YB are conceptually similar in that they define related parties for the purposes of operative provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007. The separate use of the section YC 1 company control definition rather than the associated persons definitions was probably a legacy of the company control definition being developed in the Income Tax Act before the associated persons definitions. The company control definition in the Act was first implemented in 1939, whereas the first associated persons definition in the Act was not enacted until 1968. Allowing section YC 1 to be subsumed by the new associated persons definition is a desirable simplification measure. The provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 which previously employed the section YC 1 definition of company control, have been amended to use the new associated persons definition. They are: • • section GC 5 (leases for inadequate rent) • • section RF 11 (dividends paid to companies under control of non-residents) • • paragraph (a) of the definition of ‘holding company’ in section YA 1. Replacing related person definition with associated person definition Former section CD 44(15) to (17) of the Income Tax Act 2007 contained a definition of ‘related person’ which was used in section CD 44(11) and (12) to determine the amount of the capital gain exclusion from a dividend arising from the realisation of a capital asset in the course of a company's liquidation. As part of the amendments to rationalise the Income Tax Act provisions which embody an associated persons concept, the function of the former related person definition in section CD 44 will be performed by the new associated person definition. 62 A guide to associated persons definitions for income tax purposes Section CD 44(11) and (12) have been replaced by section CD 44(10A) and (10B) with associated persons references replacing related persons references. The new provisions apply for capital gain amounts derived or losses incurred after 31 March 2010, therefore ensuring that the changes have prospective application only. For capital gain amounts derived or capital loss amounts incurred between 1 April 1988 and 31 March 2010, the previous law which used the related person definition continues to apply. This law contained in former section CD 44(11), (12) and (15) to (17), is now contained in section CZ 9B of the Income Tax Act 2007. The references to related persons in the dividend definition in section YA 1 have also been replaced with references to associated persons. Definition of ‘relative’ The definition of ‘relative’ in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 has been simplified so that it extends only to the second degree of blood relationship. Previously the definition also extended for the purposes of some provisions to the fourth degree of blood relationship. The new definition of relative includes a trustee of a trust under which a relative has benefited or is eligible to benefit—this continues the effect of paragraph (c) (v) of the old relative definition. Non Resident Withholding Tax and Approved Issuer Levy NRWT and AIL use the ‘associated person’ rules outlined earlier in this publication but also have specific ‘associated person’ rules and tests. Indirect associated funding - exists when a non-resident indirect lender provides funds to a direct lender who then provides the funds to a person associated with the non-resident indirect lender. Non Resident owning bodies - A group of non-residents that have characteristics that indicate they are acting together to debt fund a NZ company for which they own 50% or more. Related party debt - A financial arrangement where the lender is an associated person or funding is provided through an indirect funding arrangement or lender is a member of a non-resident owning body that is associated with the borrower and expenditure arises to the borrower for which they are allowed a deduction (this excludes a member of a NZ banking group). Application of changes to other Acts A number of provisions in other Acts, which utilise the associated persons definitions in the Income Tax Act 2007, have been consequently amended as a result of these reforms. The provisions in these other Acts are: Fisheries Act 1996, section 59(10)(c) and (d) Misuse of Drugs Amendment Act 2005, section 31 Privacy Act 1993, section 6 Radiocommunications Act 1989, sections 153(2) and 161(2) Smoke-free Environments Act 1990, section 2(1). A number of provisions in other Acts also utilised former section YC 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007, which defined when a company was treated as being under the control of any persons. These references to section YC 1 have been replaced with references to the new associated persons definition in the Income Tax Act 2007. The provisions in these other Acts are: Insolvency Act 2006, section 182(1) Public Service Investment Society Management Act (No.2) 1979, section 2(2) Trustee Companies Management Act 1975, section 2(2) Unit Trusts Act 1960, section 3(4). ird.govt.nz 63 Legislative references Sections CB 8(c), CD 5, CD 5(2B), CD 6(1)(a)(ii), CD 22(9), CD 25(4), CD 27(1)(b), CD 27(3)(a)(ii), CD 44(10B), CD 44(10C), CD 44(14B), CX 2(5), CZ 9B, DB 42(2), EB 13(2), EX 20B(5)(a)(i), EX 20B(9)(c), FE 21(3)(d)(ii), FE 21(7)(a)(i), FE 21(7)(a)(ii), FE 21(8), GB 28(2), GB 48(1)(b), GB 48(3)(d), GB 48(3)(e), GC 5(5), HC 15(5)(a)(ii), HC 21(3), HC 27(1)(e), HC 27(3), HC 32(2), HC 35(4)(a), HC 36(5), RF 11, YA 1, YB 1 – YB 16, of the Income Tax Act 2007.

IR633 April 2023 Declaration for trusts and estates not required to file returns • To be completed by a complying trust, estate or testamentary trust which does not want to file an income tax return for a tax year, because it is non-active, and it satisfies Criteria A below or it is a testamentary trust that satisfies Criteria B below. The trust, estate or testamentary trust will need to file a return if it becomes active again or no longer meets the relevant criteria • Read the notes before you fill in this form. • You will need to have ceased your GST or employer registration before we can action this request. • You can complete this declaration in myIR. Trust name Postal address IRD number ( 8 digit numbers start in the second box. ) Balance date Day Month Year Criteria A The trust is a: Complying trust Estate The complying trust or estate has met all the following conditions throughout the income year corresponding to the tax year: 1. It has not derived any assessable income fr om any source. 2. It has no deductions. 3. It has not been party to, or perpetuated, or continued with, any transactions with assets of the trust that give rise to any of the following during the tax year: a. income in any associated person’s hand b. fringe benefits to any employee or former employee See the notes below for further clarification on what should be consider ed and what can be ignored. Criteria B The trust is a: Complying testamentary trust The testamentary trust does not meet the conditions of Criteria A but has met all the following conditions throughout the income year corresponding to that tax year: 1. The trust ear ned less than $5,000 of assessable reportable income. 2. The trust ear ned less than $1,000 of non-reportable income and had allowable deductions that reduces the net income to $200 or less for the income year The trust or estate has met Criteria A or B from the tax year onwards. If the trust, estate or testamentary trust has made a declaration and stops meeting any of the above conditions at any time, the trustee(s) must tell us that it is no longer a non-active trust or meets Criteria B and start filing annual income tax returns. If the trust, estate or testamentary trust needs to request to be active again, either file a return for the year that it became active again, send a message through myIR, phone us, or advise us in writing. Name of authorised person Designation or title Email address Phone number ( ) Signature Date Day Month Year Send this declaration to: Inland Revenue PO Box 39010 Wellington Mail Centre Lower Hutt 5045 Tax Administration Act 1994 Notes Criteria A Factors not considered when establishing non-active criteria for complying trusts and estates When deciding whether a complying trust or estate is “non-active” the following should not be considered: • bank char ges or other minimal administration costs that total $1,500 or less in the tax year • r easonable fees paid to professional trustees to administer the trust or estate • r eportable income derived during the tax year that totals $1,000 or less • insurance, rates, inter est, and other expenditure incidental to the occupation of a dwelling owned by the trust or estate and incurred by the beneficiaries of the trust. An estate is different to a testamentary trust that Criteria B are relevant for. Estates refer to the property of a deceased held by an executor or administrator in the period before a trust (testamentary or otherwise) arises. Criteria B The above criteria do not apply to testamentary trusts that are making a declaration under criteria B. A testamentary trust is a trust that is created by the terms of the will which provide (or from which it be implied) that trustees must hold some assets in trust for beneficiaries. This can include situations where the dispositions provided for in the will cannot be made because the assets of an estate are unable to vest absolutely in the interest of the beneficiary until a specific event occurs. For income years prior to 2021/22 Criteria A and B only apply for the 2021/22 income year onwards. When deciding if your complying trust or estate was non-active in an earlier year it needs to meet all the following conditions: 1. It has not derived any gr oss income from any source. 2. It has no deductions. 3. It has not been party to, or perpetuated, or continued with, any transactions with assets of the trust that give rise to any of the following during the tax year: a. income in any associated person’s hand b. fringe benefits to any employee or former employee When deciding whether the trust or estate is “non-active” the following shouldn’t be considered: • bank charges or other minimal administration costs that total $200 or less in the tax year • reasonable fees paid to professional trustees to administer the trust • inter est earned on any trust assets in any bank account during the tax year that totals $200 or less • insurance, rates, and other expenditur e incidental to the dwelling owned by the trust and incurred by the beneficiaries of the trust. Ending non-active status To assist in the future if the trust, estate or testamentary trust becomes active again, you may wish to record the following information when you make this declaration: • losses available • contact details of the trustees, settlors, and beneficiaries of the trust. If the trust, estate or testamentary trust stops meeting any of the Criteria A or B conditions after it has made a declaration, it must tell us it is no longer a non-active trust or satisfies Criteria B. Request for returns A trust, estate or testamentary trust who has completed this declaration must still file income tax returns if we ask for them.

Please refer to our website for the most up-to-date information. Families Ngā Whanāu This is a quick guide to show you what types of payments you may be entitled to and how to apply for them. Working for Families Tax Credits (WfFTC) are payments to help make it easier for you to work and raise a family. They're payments for families with dependent children aged 18 or under. There are different WfFTC payments and you may qualify for one or more, depending on your personal situation. Who can receive WfFTC To be eligible for WfFTC, you must: • be aged 16 years or older and the person responsible for the day-to-day care of the children, and • care for the children on more than a temporary basis (eg, not a child minder) The children must: • be 18 years or under, and • not be financially independent. One of these residency requirements must be met: • You were a New Zealand resident and present in New Zealand continuously for at least 12 months at any time. You must also be a New Zealand tax resident for the period you are claiming payments. However, you or your spouse, civil union or de facto partner cannot be claiming the transitional tax resident exemption. • Your child or children are both resident and present in New Zealand throughout the period you are claiming WfFTC payments. The WfFTC payments Family tax credit This payment offers financial support for most families. The amount of payment depends on your family situation. In-work tax credit In-work tax credit is for families who are in paid work. You can’t get in-work tax credit if you get an income- tested benefit or student allowance. From 1 April 2021, you’ll keep receiving the in-work tax credit payments for up to two weeks during an unpaid break from work. For example, changing jobs, leaving employment, or unpaid time such as school holidays. If you or your partner start receiving an income-tested benefit or student allowance, your payments will stop. What are Working for Families Tax Credits? For more information, go to ird.govt.nz/topics/ working-for-families/types-of-working-for-families Minimum family tax credit Minimum family tax credit tops up your family income to a minimum amount after tax each week. To get this, at least one parent must be working for salary or wages. A two-parent family must work at least 30 hours a week between them, and a single parent must work at least 20 hours a week. Best Start tax credit Best Start tax credit helps families with the costs in a child's first three years. You can't get Best Start tax credit while you receive paid parental leave for the same child. If you're entitled to both, your Best Start tax credit payments will start after your paid parental leave payments finish. How to apply for WfFTC If your main income is a benefit from Work and Income, you'll generally get your family tax credit from them. If you don't get a benefit, or if you want us to pay your family tax credit, you can apply online in your myIR account or you can call us on 0800 227 773 Monday to Friday 8am to 8pm and Saturday 9am to 1pm if you have no access to our online service. When we receive your application, we'll work out your weekly or fortnightly payments and send you a Notice of entitlement.
