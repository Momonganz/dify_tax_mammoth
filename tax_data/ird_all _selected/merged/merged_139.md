### 1984-1985 Legislation

### Income Tax Amendment Act 1984

### Income Tax Amendment Act 1985

### National Superannuitant Surcharge

### Introduction

This Public Information Bulletin contains:

1.  Details of the legislation giving effect to the national superannuitant surcharge which applied from 1 April 1985.
2.  Supplementary information on a number of matters affecting the surcharge.
3.  Two examples of how the various provisions of the surcharge interact.
4.  A decision model flowchart which can be used to determine a national superannuitant's liability for the surcharge and the ways in which he can pay that surcharge.

**Note:** This Bulletin does not take into account the changes to the national superannuitant surcharge announced in the June 1985 Budget, namely, the increase in the maximum specified exemption levels from $6,240 to $7,200 and from $10,400 to $12,000 which are to take effect from 1 April **1986**, and the extension of the period in respect of which national superannuation continues to be paid to a superannuitant who is temporarily overseas from 13 weeks to 26 weeks.

### The Legislation - The New Part XA

The surcharge is imposed in a new Part XA of the Income Tax Act 1976 (hereafter referred to as the principal Act) which was inserted by section 17(1) of the Income Tax Amendment Act 1984 and was subsequently amended (before its 1 April 1985 introduction) by the Income Tax Amendment Act 1985.

The new Part provides that national superannuitants who have taxable incomes other than national superannuation in any income year above certain limits shall be liable to a surcharge of 25 cents in the dollar on the balance of that other income. There is however a maximum surcharge liability in respect of any income year which will be the net amount of national superannuation received by each national superannuitant in that income year.

The new Part XA consists of sections 336A to 336M. Before analysing the legislation in detail a brief description of each section follows:

*   Section 336A - contains definitions of various terms and expressions which are used in the Part.
*   Section 336B - provides a further definition, that of "other income", upon which the new surcharge is based.
*   Section 336BA - provides a further definition, that of a "specified exemption", which is the amount of "other income" which can be derived by a national superannuitant before he/she becomes liable to the surcharge.
*   Section 336C - specifies the application date for the Part and the surcharge as being from the 1985/86 income year.
*   Section 336D - imposes the surcharge and provides details of how it is to be calculated.
*   Section 336E - empowers the Commissioner to make assessments of the surcharge and enables objections thereto.
*   Section 336F - provides details of the election which must be made by national superannuitants as to the class of income on which they wish to pay the surcharge.
*   Sections 336G and 336H - list the procedures to be followed where a national superannuitant elects to pay the surcharge against his national superannuation.
*   Sections 336I to 336K list the procedures to be followed where a national superannuitant elects to pay the surcharge against his "other income".
*   Section 336L - details the surcharge codes to be used in making surcharge deductions on a PAYE basis.
*   Section 336M - applies the other provisions of the principal Act with any necessary modifications.

### Section 336A - Interpretation

This section is the interpretation section and lists twelve definitions relevant to the new Part of the principal Act. In addition, section 2 of the principal Act contains three further definitions which are directly relevant to the new Part and section 17(2) of the 1984 Amendment Act inserts a further definition in that section which is relevant. Each definition is discussed below:

(a) "_**Gross**_"

This definition is contained in section 2 of the principal Act. In relation to any amount, it means without any deduction whatsoever from that amount.

Its relevance to the new Part is that the word is used several times throughout the Part where reference is made to a national superannuitant's "gross national superannuation". In accordance with the section 2 definition that expression refers to an amount of national superannuation before deducting any PAYE tax deduction or any surcharge deduction.

(b) "_**Income From Employment**_"

Section 336A gives this expression the same meaning as in section 105(1) of the principal Act, which means:

1.  salary, wages and extra emoluments (income from employment as defined in section 2 of the Act);
2.  salary, wages and other income of shareholder/employees of private companies (in accordance with section 6(2) of the Act);
3.  withholding payments for work done or services rendered by casual agricultural workers and payments to Deputy Returning Officers, poll clerks, interpreters, ushers, and other persons engaged for any election or poll (clause 10 of Part A and clause 6 of Part B of the Schedule to the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979).

(c) "_**National Superannuation**_"

This definition is contained in section 2 of the principal Act. National superannuation means:

"National superannuation paid or payable under Part I of the Social Security Act 1964; but does not include any supplement or benefit paid or payable under section 61A or section 61E or section 61G of that Act:"

The section 61A, 61E and 61G exclusions refer respectively to the child supplement, accommodation benefit and special benefit which are all additions to the basic national superannuation benefit which are paid on hardship grounds.

Thus only the basic national superannuation benefit is subject to the national superannuitant surcharge.

(d) "_**National Superannuitant**_"

Section 336A defines a national superannuitant as being any person who receives national superannuation in an income year. This includes a person who receives the national superannuation benefit for only part of an income year but does not include a person who may have been entitled to receive national superannuation but who for any reason had not applied for it.

Specifically excluded from the definition are national superannuitants who receive national superannuation in accordance with section 16 of the Social Security Act 1964. The class of persons referred to here are persons over the age of 60 who have met the residential requirements and who have a spouse under the age of 60 or a spouse who has _not_ met the residential requirements. In these cases, section 16 of the Social Security Act allows each spouse to receive half the "married couple" rate ($220.28 each gross per fortnight as at 1 April 1985) instead of the over 60 person receiving the full single rate ($267.66 gross per fortnight as at 1 April 1985) only. Where this situation arises _both_ spouses will not be liable for the surcharge by virtue of their not being national superannuitants, since the option to receive half the married couple rate is subject to an income test.

(e) "_**National Superannuitant Surcharge" or "Surcharge**_"

This is a new definition which is inserted in section 2 of the principal Act in accordance with section 17(2) of the Income Tax Amendment Act 1984.

The definition merely provides a title for the new surcharge and caters for its abbreviation wherever it occurs in the principal Act, mainly in the new Part XA.

(f) "_**Net National Superannuation**_"

This definition, which is contained in section 336A, is necessary for the purposes of section 336D(3) which is the provision that restricts the liability for the surcharge of any national superannuitant in any income year to the net amount of national superannuation he receives during the income year.

In particular, net national superannuation is calculated in accordance with an a - (b - c) formula where "a" is a national superannuitant's gross national superannuation and "b - c" is the tax applicable to that gross national superannuation.

It is important to note that the tax applicable to the gross national superannuation is calculated as the difference between the amount of tax assessed in respect of a national superannuitant's taxable income and the amount of tax that would have been assessed if he/she had not received national superannuation, thereby treating the national superannuation as the _last_ "slice" of income derived. The tax applicable to the benefit is calculated on an _annual_ basis. Any entitlement to the section 105 standard deduction in respect of the national superannuation received, bearing in mind his/her other income from employment (if any), will be taken into account in a manner that is similar to that required in the determination of "other income" under section 336B(1).

Net national superannuation is thus also calculated on an _annual_ basis. Any PAYE tax deductions (whether deducted on any of codes "A" to "G", "SEC", "ND", "SHR", or "SSH" or on a special tax code) or surcharge deductions made from national superannuation are therefore not relevant in calculating net national superannuation.

(g) "_**Other Income**_"

The section 336A definition simply refers to an amount of other income determined in accordance with section 336B. Details of this definition are included in the commentary on that section.

(h) "_**Source Deduction Payment**_"

The section 336A definition provides that any reference to a source deduction payment in the new Part shall not include a withholding payment, a payment which would otherwise be included in that definition by virtue of the definition in section 6(1) of the principal Act.

Source deduction payments thus mean, for the purposes of the new Part only, payments by way of salary, wages and extra emoluments(which because of the section 2 definition of salary or wages, also includes payments of national superannuation and pension payments). Any surcharge payable on withholding payments will be payable on a "provisional tax" basis. In practice this may mean that some national superannuitants who derive withholding payments may need to furnish IR3 returns (for surcharge and income tax purposes) instead of the IR5 returns that they might otherwise have furnished for income tax purposes.

(i) "_**Special Surcharge Code**_"

A special surcharge code refers to the special surcharge rates which are determined where a superannuitant wishes to have the surcharge deducted against his/her other income. (It does not refer to the special rates determined by Inland Revenue district offices and supplied to the Department of Social Welfare where surcharge deductions are to be made against a superannuitant's national superannuation). Accordingly, the definition refers to codes supplied by the Commissioner in a similar manner to special tax code certificates supplied pursuant to section 351 of the principal Act.

(j) "_**Specified Exemption**_"

Section 336A provides that "specified exemption" has the meaning specified in section 336BA. For further information see the commentary on that section.

(k) "_**Specified Foreign Social Security Pension**_"

The definition provided by section 336A, includes only those pensions or benefits which reduce an eligible person's entitlement to national superannuation. The pensions in this category are:

1.  United Kingdom National Insurance Pensions
2.  Canadian Old Age Security Pensions
3.  German Insurance Pensions
4.  Greek Old Age Pensions
5.  Italian Old Age Pensions
6.  Netherlands Old Age Security Pensions
7.  United States Retirement Insurance Benefits

(see the section entitled "Foreign Social Security Pensions" on page 26.)

(l) "_**Specified Income**_"

This is a new definition in section 336A which is the complement of the "source deduction payment" definition discussed above. That is, specified income means all income other than source deduction payments. Withholding payments are included in the term "specified income" by virtue of their exclusion from the "source deduction payment" definition.

Both the "source deduction payment" and "specified income" definitions are needed for the purpose of making an election as to how any surcharge liability is to be paid (see section 336F) and the rules which apply if that election is to have the surcharge paid on a national superannuitant's other income (see sections 336I to 336K).

(m) "_**Standard Deduction Entitlement**_"

This is a new definition in section 336A which is only used in the new Part in section 336B as part of the calculation of a national superannuitant's "other income". It refers to the portion (if any) of a standard deduction/employment related expense claim which relates to a national superannuitant's national superannuation benefit.

As the standard deduction/employment related expense claim provided in section 105 of the Income Tax Act 1976 is allowed against payments of national superannuation as well as against other income from employment, this definition details a set of rules to be followed in determining what portion of any such claim (if any) relates to the national superannuation benefit. For this purpose it is assumed that where a standard deduction claim is made, the standard deduction relates firstly to income from employment other than national superannuation and secondly (if there is any balance) to national superannuation. The standard deduction entitlement that relates to national superannuation is thus treated as the last segment of any standard deduction claim.

In particular, the definition requires that the standard deduction entitlement that relates to national superannuation is:

*   where national superannuation is the only "income from employment", the lesser of $52 or 2 percent of the national superannuation (the 2 percent could occur where national superannuation was received for part of a year only);
*   where the "income from employment" other than national superannuation is _less than_ $2,600, 2 percent of the difference between that amount and $2,600;
*   where the "income from employment" other than national superannuation is _equal to or greater than_ $2,600, nil.

This definition and its associated rules are necessary to ensure that the calculation of a national superannuitant's "other income" (see the commentary on section 336B) not only excludes the superannuitant's gross national superannuation but also adds back the portion of any standard deduction/employment related expenditure claim which relates to it.

(n) "_**Surcharge Code**_"

This section 336A definition refers to the "SAJ", "MAJ", "MIN" and special surcharge codes (as described in section 336L) which are to be used in paying the surcharge along with tax deductions from source deduction payments (other than national superannuation) on a PAYE basis where the national superannuitant has elected to have the surcharge paid on his other income and that other income includes source deduction payments.

The definition is similar to the "tax code" definition in section 2 of the Act.

(o) "_**Surcharge Deduction**_"

This section 336A definition simply refers to any PAYE deduction of the surcharge made from any source deduction payment (including national superannuation) in the same way that any PAYE deduction of income tax is referred to as a "tax deduction".

(p) "_**Taxable Income**_"

For the purposes of the new Part, any reference to taxable income simply takes the same meaning that applies for income tax purposes in accordance with the section 2 definition of that term.

The definition is referred to in the calculations required to compute "net national superannuation" (as described above) and "other income" (see below).

### Section 336B - Determination of "Other Income"

This section is in effect another definition section. It simply provides the formula to be used in determining the amount of a national superannuitant's "other income" which is the base on which any surcharge liability is calculated after deducting the specified exemption.

_Subsection (1)_ provides for the calculation of other income in all cases where:

*   national superannuation has been received by a national superannuitant for a full year;
*   national superannuation has been received by a national superannuitant for only part of a year for any reason other than those mentioned in subsection (2) (where an apportionment formula is required). This will include those cases where, during an income year, a superannuitant dies, goes overseas temporarily for more than 13 weeks on a continuous basis (at which time payments of national superannuation cease to be made) or decides not to accept payments of national superannuation for some part of the year. (Where a superannuitant does not accept any national superannuation in a year, although entitled to it, he is not a national superannuitant as defined in section 336A and thus has no surcharge liability.)

In such cases, the "other income" of a national superannuitant is calculated in accordance with the formula:

| a - (b - c) - d |     |
| --- | --- |
| where |     |
| a   | is the superannuitant's taxable income in the income year, |
| (b - c) | is the portion of that taxable income that relates to national superannuation, this being calculated as the gross national superannuation received in the income year less the standard deduction entitlement that relates to it, |
| d   | is the amount of all specified foreign social security pensions received. |

_Subsection (2)_ provides for the calculation of "other income" in those cases where national superannuation has been received by a national superannuitant for only part of a year by reason of:

*   that national superannuitant commencing to receive national superannuation after the beginning of an income year. This would include not only those persons who reach age 60 and apply for the benefit during the year but also persons who arrive in New Zealand during the year and/or meet the residential qualifications in order to obtain the national superannuation benefit.
*   that national superannuitant permanently departing from New Zealand. In such cases, processing of the final part year income tax return completed before departure will need to include a calculation of any surcharge liability payable. As national superannuation ceases to be paid 13 weeks after departure in such circumstances, the "final" part year IR12 included in the tax return will generally represent all payments of national superannuation during the year.

In such cases, instead of making the calculation required in subsection (1), income sources are apportioned in the following manner to arrive at the national superannuitant's "other income":

*   any income derived from any source (excluding national superannuation and specified foreign social security pension payments) which, in the opinion of the Commissioner, was derived _only_ in that part or those parts of the year while the national superannuitant was receiving national superannuation is to be _included_. This would generally include those pensions which commence to be paid from the date a person reaches age 60.
*   any income derived from any source (excluding national superannuation and specified foreign social security pension payments) which, in the opinion of the Commissioner, was derived _only_ in that part or those parts of the year while the national superannuitant was _not_ receiving national superannuation is to be _excluded_. This would include, for example, any salary or wages derived by an employee before he ceased employment on reaching age 60, a situation which commonly occurs in the public sector.
*   all "remaining income" (ie, income derived in periods both where the national superannuitant was receiving national superannuation, and in periods where he/she was not receiving national superannuation) excluding a "specified foreign social security pension" payment is to be apportioned on the basis of the number of fortnightly periods in respect of which national superannuation was received in the income year compared with the number of fortnightly payment days that occurred in that year. (These fortnightly payment days are defined as "pay days" in section 3 of the Social Security Act 1964).

The apportionment is handled by the apportionment formula:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| (d \- e \- g) x f | \+ e |
| h   |

where

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| d \- e \- g | represents the "remaining income" described above |
| d   | is the total amount of "other income" in the year (as determined in accordance with section 336B(1)) |
| e   | is that portion derived only while in receipt of national superannuation |
| g   | is that portion received only while NOT in receipt of national superannuation |
| f/h | is the apportionment fraction |
| f   | is the number of pay days in respect of which national superannuation has been received |
| h   | is the number of pay days in that income year, which must be 26 or 27 depending on the year concerned |

A practical example of how the formula works is set out at _Example B_ on page 39 of this Bulletin.

(As to the general rules which apply in determining whether income from any source comes within **"e"** or **"g"**, see the section entitled _"Apportionments of 'Other Income' and 'Specified Exemptions' in Certain Cases Where National Superannuation is Received for Part Only of an Income Year"_ on page 28).

_Subsection (3)_ provides a limited exception to the rules (detailed above) in relation to when the determination of "other income" can involve apportionments of income sources.

The subsection provides that where any source of income is received within a reasonable period after a national superannuitant has commenced receiving national superannuation _and_ where the receipt of that income was delayed due to circumstances beyond the control of the national superannuitant, the Commissioner may treat that income as having been received in full before the superannuitant commenced receiving national superannuation.

The purpose of the subsection is to cater particularly for those cases where a person ceases employment prior to receiving national superannuation but receives his last payments of salary or wages, possibly together with a retiring allowance, soon after he has reached age 60 and commenced receiving national superannuation. The determination of what constitutes a reasonable period will of course depend on the facts in each case.

### Section 336BA - Determination of "Specified Exemption"

**Subsection (1)**

_Section 336BA(1)_ provides the method for calculating a superannuitant's "specified exemption" where an income tax/surcharge assessment is made in the normal course (section 336BA(2) deals with "early" assessments made under section 12 of the Income Tax Act (assessments to date of death, persons going overseas etc.))

A superannuitant's specified exemption is calculated as the sum of _up to_ four different amounts, each of which is calculated in one of paragraphs (a) to (d), as follows:

_Single Persons_

*   **Paragraph (a)** represents an exemption for single superannuitants of $6,240 multiplied by a fraction representing the number of fortnightly payments of national superannuation (defined as pay days in the Social Security Act 1964), in the income year, made at the "single" rate (this is described in the Social Security Act as being 60 percent of the married rate).

_Married Person on Married Rate Benefit_

*   **Paragraph (b)** represents a similar apportionment of the married couple exemption, based on the number of fortnightly payments of national superannuation which have been paid at the "married" rate (this is described in the Social Security Act as being 50 percent of the married rate). The exemption for a married superannuitant (receiving the married rate of national superannuation) is the _greater_ of:
    1.  $10,400 reduced by an amount equal to the "other income" of the superannuitant's spouse:
    2.  $5,200.

**Example:**

|     | "Other" Income | National Superannuation" | Total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A   | $10,000 pa | $5,727 | $15,727 |
| Spouse of A | $3,000 pa | $5,727 | $8,727 |
| **Exemption** |     |     |     |
| A   | $10,400 pa \- $3,000 = $7,400 |     |     |
| Spouse of A | $3,000 |     |     |

_Married Person on Single Rate Benefit_

*   **paragraph (c)** represents a similar apportionment based on the number of fortnightly payments of national superannuation which have been paid at the single rate of benefit. This applies to a married superannuitant with a non-qualifying spouse. The exemption for a married superannuitant receiving the single rate of national superannuation (this occurs where the superannuitant's spouse is under age 60 or has not met the 10 year residential requirement) is the _greater_ of:
    1.  $10,400 reduced by an amount equal to the taxable income (excluding specified foreign social security pensions) of the superannuitant's spouse:
    2.  $6,240.

**Note:**

In calculating the amount of the taxable income of the superannuitant's spouse in (i) above, where that non-qualifying spouse has qualified to receive national superannuation during the income year, the amount of national superannuation received by him/her should, as is the case with specified foreign social security pensions, also be excluded.

**Example:**

|     | "Other" Income | National Superannuation" | Total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A   | $10,000 | $6,959 | $16,959 |
| Spouse of A | $3,000 | N/A | $3,000 |
| **Exemption** |     |     |     |
| A   | $10,400 \- $3,000 = $7,400 |     |     |
| Spouse of A | N/A |     |     |

_Adjustment for any period national superannuation not received_

*   **paragraph (d)** represents the allocation of a portion, of one of the exemptions provided in paragraphs (a) to (c) above, to that period of the income year (if any) in respect of which national superannuation is _not_ paid in those cases where the national superannuitant is temporarily overseas (the Social Security Act provides for the stopping of payments where a superannuitant is absent for more than 13 weeks) or has not applied for, or has refused receipt of, national superannuation. This paragraph effectively ensures a full year's exemption is applicable in all cases where a full year's other income is taken into account

In the majority of cases only one of the formulae in paragraphs (a) to (c) will apply since the same rate of national superannuation will have been paid in the same circumstances throughout the income year. In such cases, the a/b, d/e, or g/h segments of the apportionment formulae will equal 1 so that a simple calculation of the annual exemption is all that is required.

**Other points to note** concerning section 336BA(1) are:

*   The $6,240 exemption level for single superannuitants is equal to 60 percent of the combined household exemption of $10,400 for married superannuitants. This percentage is consistent with that used for the payment of national superannuation whereby the single rate of benefit is set at a level of 60 percent of the total benefit that two married persons each receive.
*   The $10,400 household exemption was introduced to place the married national superannuitant who is unable to split his income in the same position as the superannuitant who is able to avail himself of the maximum amount of exemption available. The transferability of an unused exemption will always go from a lesser-earning national superannuitant to his/her spouse. There will however be no transferability where both spouses have an income in excess of $5,200.
*   The exemption level for married superannuitants receiving the single rate of national superannuation is a combination on the other two exemptions. It arises from the fact that superannuitants in this position receive the single rate of benefit - calculated at 60 percent of the married rate of benefit.
*   Married superannuitants who have a non-qualifying spouse may instead of receiving the single rate (and being subject to the surcharge as described above) apply to receive two married rates with both the superannuitant and his/her spouse receiving national superannuation as if they both qualified for national superannuation. This latter option is however subject to an income test administered by the Department of Social Welfare. Arising from the strictness of that income test, superannuitants receiving national superannuation on this basis are not liable to the surcharge. This is achieved through their exclusion from the section 336A definition of a "national superannuitant", (they receive national superannuation pursuant to section 16 of the Social Security Act 1964).
*   The use of the words "_in respect of_ which that national superannuation was payable" in the descriptions of item "a" in the formula in paragraph (a), item "d" in the formula in paragraph (b), and item "g" in the formula in paragraph (c) is important. It not only covers normal fortnightly national superannuation payments but also relates to lump sum "back" period payments. The Social Security Act provides that these "back" period payments cannot extend back more than six months. However in cases where such a "back" payment has been made and this extends back into a former income year, a superannuitant could receive the equivalent of more than the standard 26 or 27 pay days in the income year the lump sum is received. In these cases, a superannuitant should not however be allowed a higher specified exemption than that which would apply on an annual basis. (This is because the specified exemption relates to the amount of other income received rather than the amount of any national superannuation received.)
*   In allocating a portion of one of the exemptions provided in paragraphs (a) to (c) to a part of the income year in respect of which national superannuation is _not_ paid for any reason _other than_ those stated in subparagraphs (i) to (iii) of paragraph (d), the general rule (as contained in subparagraph (iv)) involves the use of the exemption that applied to the last fortnightly payment made _in the same income year_ prior to national superannuation not being paid. Where there has been no such prior fortnightly payment in the income year (ie the first fortnightly payment in the income year was not received), then subparagraph (v) provides that the exemption to be used shall be that applied to the first fortnightly payment _made in the same income year_. (No provision is necessary where national superannuation is not paid for the full income year as there would be no liability for the surcharge).
*   In those cases where national superannuation is _not_ received for part of an income year for any of the reasons stated in subparagraphs (i) to (iii) of paragraph (d) no allocation of any of the exemptions in paragraphs (a) to (c) is required. Instead the exemptions provided by paragraphs (a) to (c) will be less than a full year equivalent. This effectively ensures a part year exemption is applicable in all cases where a part year's other income is taken into account. See the section entitled "Apportionments of Other Income" and "Specified Exemptions" in Certain Cases where National Superannuation is Received for Part only of an Income Year" on page 28).

_Changes in eligibility for benefit_

*   Whereas paragraphs (a) to (d) clearly cater for apportionments of the exemption level in those cases where:
    1.  a single superannuitant marries another superannuitant during the income year (paragraph (a) to (b)), or
    2.  a married superannuitant's qualifying spouse dies during the income year (paragraph (b) to (a)), or
    3.  a single superannuitant marries a non-qualifying person and does not opt for the income tested married rates during the income year (paragraph (a) to (c)), or
    4.  the non-qualifying spouse of a married superannuitant (who had not opted for the income tested married rates) dies during the income year (paragraph (c) to (a)), or
    5.  the non-qualifying spouse of a married superannuitant (who had not opted for the income tested married rates) qualifies during the income year (paragraph (c) to (b)), or (**Note:** a simple change from paragraph (b) to (c) is generally not possible unless a married superannuitant's qualifying spouse dies and he/she immediately remarries a non-qualifying spouse during the income year).
    6.  any combination of (i) to (v) above, or
    7.  any of (i) to (vi) above with non-payment of national superannuation for part of the income year,

*   they do not _explicitly_ cover all possible situations where an apportionment would be necessary. Examples of this follow:
    
    *   **Example (1):**
        *   Where a married superannuitant with a non-qualifying spouse has been receiving the income tested married rates of benefit and his/her spouse qualifies during the income year. (In such cases the exemption level should be apportioned to reflect the period that the superannuitant was liable for the surcharge, ie not receiving the income tested benefit - his/her "other income" would likewise be apportioned on a time basis.)
    *   **Example (2):**
        *   Where a single superannuitant or married superannuitant with no dependent children is in hospital for a period in excess of 13 weeks, in which case his/her after-tax rate of national superannuation is reduced to $10 per week. (In the case of single superannuitants the single rate exemption in paragraph (a) should be applied in respect of each $20 fortnightly national superannuation payment. In the case of married superannuitants who have qualifying spouses, however, the Social Security Act provides that the qualifying spouse's benefit will, after the 13 weeks, be increased to the single rate. In these cases, the variable $6,240 to $10,400 exemption in paragraph (c) should be applied to the single rate recipient in respect of each fortnightly payment made at the single rate. (As a hospitalised superannuitant will be entitled in most cases to a maximum exemption in his/her own right, the exemption obtained by both married superannuitants can be up to $11,440).

*   _Subsection (2) Section 336BA(2)_ provides the method for calculating a superannuitant's "specified exemption" where an income tax/surcharge "early" assessment is to be made pursuant to section 12(2) of the Income Tax Act (ie the assessments to date of death, persons going permanently overseas, etc). In order to avoid the need to wait until the end of a tax year to determine the correct specified exemption of a married superannuitant, in such cases the subsection (1) formulae should be applied using only the spouse's "other income" to the superannuitant's date of death, date of departure or date of becoming bankrupt rather than using "other income" for the full income year.

### Section 336C - Application of this Part

This section is the application section for the purposes of the new Part XA.

_**Subsection (1)**_ provides that the national superannuitant surcharge shall be payable by every national superannuitant in accordance with the provisions of the new Part XA.

_**Subsection (2)**_ specifies that the surcharge, which is in respect of the "other income" of a national superannuitant, is to apply from the _income year_ commencing on 1 April 1985.

This application date is particularly important in so far as it affects superannuitants with balance dates other than 31 March. Arising from the income year application date, the surcharge will in effect be applied against each superannuitant's income as shown in his/her annual tax return. Thus, where for example a superannuitant has a 30 June balance date the surcharge will apply, in the first year to which the surcharge applies, to source deduction income derived in the year ended 31 March 1986 and business income for the year ended 30 June 1986 where the superannuitant has elected to have the surcharge applied against other income. If, instead, the election is made to have the surcharge applied against the gross national superannuation the surcharge will be deducted from the superannuitant's national superannuation in the year ended 31 March 1986.

In addition those superannuitants who have early balance dates may have derived other income prior to 1 April 1985 commencement date which will be subject to the surcharge. For example, a superannuitant with a 31 October balance date who has elected to have the surcharge applied against "other income" should in theory already be making provision for the surcharge. However, as all such non-31 March year income comes within the definition of specified income and as the surcharge paid on such income is paid as if it were provisional tax with no provisional tax being required in the first year of the surcharge, this should cause no difficulties in practice.

### Section 336D - National Superannuitant Surcharge Imposed

This section imposes the national superannuitant surcharge and details how any liability for the surcharge is to be calculated.

_**Subsection (1)**_ imposes the surcharge in respect of national superannuitants who receive national superannuation at any stage during an income year.

In such cases, the annual surcharge liability imposed in respect of any income year is an amount equal to 25 percent of the excess of a national superannuitant's "other income" over the specified exemption. Subsection (3) however places a maximum on that liability.

_**Subsection (2)**_ has been repealed by section 3(3)(b) of the Income Tax Amendment Act 1985. The provisions of the previous subsection (2) have been incorporated in section 336BA.

_**Subsection (3)**_ limits the amount of the surcharge for which any national superannuitant is liable in any income year, as calculated in accordance with subsection (1), to the amount of "net national superannuation" of that national superannuitant for that income year.

Using the rates of national superannuation applicable at 1 April 1985 and the new rates which will apply, the maximum surcharge applies where:

*   in the case of superannuitants on the single rate and eligible for a specified exemption of $6,240, their estimated total taxable "other income" (ie, excluding national superannuation) exceeds $22,657 per annum; and
*   in the case of superannuitants on half the married couple rate and eligible for a specified exemption of $5,200, their estimated total taxable "other income" exceeds $20,133 per annum; and
*   in the case of superannuitants on half the married couple rate and eligible for a specified exemption of $10,400, their estimated total taxable "other income" exceeds $23,637 per annum.

### Section 336E - Assessment of Surcharge

This section empowers the Commissioner to assess the amount of the surcharge and applies the objection provisions of the principal Act to the surcharge in the same manner as they apply to income tax with any necessary modifications. This section makes it clear that assessments of the surcharge and objections thereto shall be treated in the manner as if they were assessments of income tax and objections thereto.

Panels for the annual _assessments_ of surcharge will be included in national superannuitants' tax returns, in particular in both the IR3 and IR5 forms. As the surcharge is to apply from the income year commencing on 1 April 1985, the 1984/85 tax returns will not be affected. The first appearance of a surcharge assessment panel, which it is envisaged will be combined with the tax assessment panel, will thus be on 1985/86 tax returns.

### Section 336F - Election by National Superannuitant in Respect of Payment of Surcharge

This section is the main operative section of the new Part XA. In essence, the section requires any national superannuitant who expects to be liable for the surcharge to make an election as to whether he wishes to pay that surcharge liability by way of deductions from his gross national superannuation or by way of payments from his "other income".

In those cases where a superannuitant elects to have the surcharge paid by way of deductions from his gross national superannuation, the provisions of sections 336G and 336H apply.

However, where the national superannuitant elects to have the surcharge paid by way of payments from his "other income", the provisions of sections 336I, 336J or 336K will apply depending on the composition of his "other income". In particular:

*   Section 336I will apply where the superannuitant's other income comprises only "specified income", (ie, income other than source deduction payments).
*   Section 336J will apply where the superannuitant's other income comprises source deduction payments only.
*   Section 336K will apply where the superannuitant's other income consists of both specified income and source deduction payments.

_**Subsection (1)**_ is the provision which requires the making of an election, by any national superannuitant who expects that he will be liable for the surcharge, as to how the surcharge is to be paid.

It should be noted that if a national superannuitant fails to make an election that failure is, by virtue of sections 336M and 416(1)(d) of the principal Act, an offence against the Act. (Section 416(2) provides that every person who commits such an offence shall be liable to a fine not exceeding $500.)

_**Subsection (2)**_ sets out the elections available to any national superannuitant who expects to be liable for the surcharge dependent on the composition of his "other income".

_**Subsection (3)**_ requires that where a national superannuitant has made an election, as to how the surcharge is to be paid, under one of the paragraphs of subsection (2) and finds that due to a change in the composition of his "other income" subsequent to the making of that first election, he should have made an election under another paragraph, a fresh election is to be made in accordance with that other paragraph.

For example, an employed national superannuitant who has elected to have the surcharge deducted from his salary, and who also pays surcharge on his rental income as provisional tax, may stop working. In this case he must make a new election, the new election being whether he now wants the surcharge deducted from his gross national superannuation or whether he wants to pay it on his rental income as provisional tax only.

### Section 336G - Surcharge Deductions from National Superannuation, and Section 336H National Superannuitant to Estimate Other Income

As spelt out in section 336G(1) these sections apply to national superannuitants who have elected in accordance with section 336F to have the surcharge paid by way of deductions from their gross national superannuation for any year.

In such cases, section 336H(1) requires those national superannuitants to provide to the Commissioner, as soon as practicable after the making of their election: (a) an estimate of the "other income" they expect to receive in that year and (b) an estimate of the amount of national superannuation which they expect to receive in that year. Section 336H(2) requires that information to be provided to the Commissioner on a prescribed form (this is the IR23S) together with the national superannuitant's IR12 tax code declaration.

Section 336H(3) then requires that on receipt of the tax code declaration and the IR23S prescribed form from a national superannuitant, the Commissioner is to determine the amount of the surcharge deduction to be made against future payments of national superannuation by the Department of Social Welfare in that year.

Although not specified in the legislation, the surcharge deduction will be determined on a basis which is consistent with the "other income" and the specified exemption provisions in the new Part XA.

Section 336H(3) also requires that the Commissioner, having determined the surcharge deduction amount, advise the Department of Social Welfare of it. Section 336G(2) then requires that Department to deduct from any payment of national superannuation to that national superannuitant in that year a surcharge deduction equal to that amount and to pay that to the Commissioner with the fortnightly tax deduction on the national superannuation.

In every case where the combined total of the fortnightly tax deduction (using the superannuitant's tax code) and the surcharge deduction applied by the Department of Social Welfare would equal or exceed the gross amount of the national superannuation payment, the superannuitant will not receive any national superannuation and the gross national superannuation will be paid direct to Inland Revenue.

Any shortfall in the surcharge deduction made, compared with that determined by the Commissioner, is to be accounted for in the end of year assessment panel in the national superannuitant's tax return. This means that any national superannuitant who has a special tax code, operating in respect of his national superannuation, which deducts a low rate of PAYE and who has elected this option could face a substantial debit in his/her year end assessment.

### Section 336I - Surcharge Paid As Provisional Tax

As spelt out in section 336I(1), this section applies to those national superannuitants who have elected in accordance with section 336F to have the surcharge paid as provisional tax. This option can be selected only by a national superannuitant where his/her "other income" consists of specified income only. (However where specified income and source deduction payments are both derived, see section 336K).

In such cases, section 336I(2) provides that the provisions of Part XII of the principal Act (which relate to provisional tax) will apply to a national superannuitant's surcharge liability in respect of his expected specified income as if that liability were payable as provisional tax.

The surcharge will thus generally be payable in two instalments (in three instalments in the case of some farmers) due 7 August and 7 February in each income year being 1/3 and 2/3 portions respectively. Also, as with provisional income and income tax, the surcharge payable can be based on the previous year's specified income.\\

The specified income of a national superannuitant is reduced by the amount of his/her specified exemption in order that the exemption can be taken into account in regard to his 1/3 and 2/3 "provisional tax" payments.

It is important to note that the proviso to section 336I(2) provides that in respect of the first income year where the surcharge is payable by a national superannuitant, he shall be relieved of his obligation to pay that provisional tax. This means that all national superannuitants who can and have elected to have the surcharge deducted on their other income in accordance with this section will not be required to make provisional tax payments in the 1985/86 income year. Instead their first payment will be a 1/3 instalment due on 7 August 1986, based on the specified income of the national superannuitant in the 1985/86 income year reduced by the amount of his/her specified exemption. The 1985/86 terminal surcharge will still, however, be payable and this is due by 7 February 1987 together with the 2/3 provisional surcharge balance. Superannuitants should therefore be advised of this "doubling up" which would occur at that time under this option.

The proviso therefore provides a treatment which is similar to that where a taxpayer becomes a provisional taxpayer for the first time and gets a deferral advantage in the first year with a "doubling up" of tax payments in the second.

The proviso however goes further than this. It not only relieves national superannuitants from liability to pay the surcharge as provisional tax in the 1985/86 income year but also relieves any other national superannuitant from liability to pay the surcharge as provisional tax where he is able and does, in any future income year, elect to pay the surcharge under this section for the first time. Where, for example, a national superannuitant pays the surcharge on a provisional tax basis in one year, as deductions against his gross national superannuation in the second year, and on a provisional tax basis again in the third year, he will _not_ be able to obtain the deferral advantage in respect of that third year.

### Section 336J - Surcharge Deductions from Source Deduction Payments

As spelt out in section 336J(1) this section applies where a national superannuitant has elected in accordance with section 336F to have his surcharge liability paid by way of deductions from source deduction payments other than national superannuation. This option can only be selected only by a national superannuitant where his/her "other income" consists of source deduction payments only.

In such cases, the election is made by the national superannuitant specifying, along with his tax code for PAYE deduction purposes, a surcharge deduction code on each IR12 or other tax deduction certificate. There are four surcharge deduction codes used for this purpose - "SAJ", "MAJ", "MIN", or a special surcharge code, description of which appear in the commentary on section 336L. In simple terms the "SAJ" surcharge code allows a $120 per week ($6,240 per annum) exemption against the largest source deduction payment of national superannuitants who receive national superannuation at the single rate. The "MAJ" surcharge code allows a $100 per week ($5,200 per annum) exemption against the largest source deduction payment of national superannuitants who receive national superannuation at half of the married rate. The "MIN" surcharge code charges the 25 percent surcharge in full and should be used in respect of all source deduction payments except the largest one. The special surcharge code allows for the surcharge to be deducted at a special rate which is calculated by the Inland Revenue Department. It is expected that the main use for this surcharge code will be where a superannuitant's spouse has other income of less than $5,200. In those circumstances the superannuitant can qualify for a specified exemption of up to $10,400.

Section 336J(2) provides for the payer of any source deduction payment to a national superannuitant to make a surcharge deduction therefrom, in addition to the PAYE tax deduction, of an amount which corresponds with the relevant surcharge code.

Having made any such surcharge deduction, paragraph (b) of section 336J(2) then requires the payer of the source deduction payment to pay that deduction to the Commissioner as if it were a PAYE tax deduction. That is, surcharge deductions are included with tax deductions in each month and both are paid in on an IR66N by the 20th day of the following month.

Employers and other payers of source deduction payments can similarly include surcharge deductions and PAYE tax deduction together in their records. The IR12 tax deduction certificate returned to employees or other recipients of source deduction payments after 31 March (or earlier where for example, an employee ceases work) should show a gross figure and a PAYE deductions figure which incorporates both surcharge and tax deductions. These deductions will be set off against the combined total of income tax and surcharge assessed in the superannuitant's annual tax return.

An important point to note in relation to surcharge deductions being made from source deduction payments using the "SAJ, "MAJ", and "MIN" surcharge codes is that where the largest source deduction payment is less than the specified exemption but total source deduction payments exceed the specified exemption, the full effect of the exemption cannot be obtained using the surcharge codes. In such cases, national superannuitants may ensure that they do not make overpayments of surcharge during the year by taking either of the following courses:

1.  electing to have surcharge deductions made from their gross national superannuation instead of against their "other income"; or
2.  applying for a special tax code in order to decrease the rate of PAYE tax payable on one or more source deduction payments to which the surcharge code "_min_" applies.

Similarly, an overpayment of surcharge may occur where there is a large source deduction payment which exceeds $22,657 (superannuitants who receive national superannuation at the single rate and are eligible for an exemption of $6,240) or $20,133 (those who receive the benefit at half the "married couple" rate and are eligible for an exemption of $5,200). This is because _the surcharge codes do not allow for cutting out the surcharge above the level_ at which the maximum surcharge is reached. National superannuitants may ensure that they do not overpay the surcharge during the year, by _also_ taking one of the two courses mentioned above.

A final point to note is that the surcharge codes do not take into account the section 105 standard deduction. In general, superannuitants will therefore be slightly _better off_, on a PAYE basis, where they have surcharge deductions made from their gross national superannuation rather than from their source deduction payments. (Refer to _Example A_ on page 37. They will however pay the same surcharge in the end of year assessment whichever method of surcharge payment is used.)

### Section 336K - Surcharge Deductions from Source Deduction Payments and Surcharge Paid as Provisional Tax

As spelt out in section 336K(1) this section applies where a national superannuitant has elected in accordance with section 336F to have his surcharge liability paid _both_ by way of deductions from source deduction payments (other than national superannuation) and as provisional tax on his/her specified income. This option can only be selected where a national superannuitant's "other income" comprises both source deduction payments and specified income (income other than source deduction payments).

Subsections (2) and (3) of section 336K specify the rule as to which class of income the specified exemption is to be applied against. That rule is that the exemption is to he allowed against the largest class (ie, the greater of total specified income and total source deduction payments).

_**Subsection (2)**_ deals with the situation where a national superannuitant's expected specified income is _larger_ than his expected source deduction payments (other than national superannuation). In such cases:

*   The specified exemption is deducted from the superannuitant's specified income and is thus reflected in his 1/3 and 2/3 "provisional tax" instalments. By virtue of the reference to section 3361 in subsection (2), the national superannuitant is however relieved from his obligation to pay "provisional tax" in the first year in which he is liable for the surcharge.
*   The surcharge code "MIN" which charges the full 25 percent deduction rate should he used in respect of all source deduction payments. Payers of the source deduction payments should make surcharge deductions at the appropriate rate and pay them to the Department as if they were tax deductions (the commentary on section 336J refers).

Subsection (3) deals with the situation where a national superannuitant's expected specified income is _equal to or less than_ his expected source deduction payments (other than national superannuation). In such cases:

*   The surcharge is payable on the national superannuitant's specified income in the same manner as provisional tax but no reduction in the specified income is allowed for that purpose.
*   The surcharge code "SAJ" or "MAJ" is used in respect of the largest source deduction payment (other than national superannuation) which allows the specified exemption against that source deduction payment, with the "MIN" surcharge code applying to all other source deduction payments (other than national superannuation). Payers of such source deduction payments should make surcharge deductions at the appropriate rates and pay them to the Department as if they were tax deductions (the commentary on section 336J refers).

It should be noted that in the situation of subsection (3) above, where the source deduction payment to which the "SAJ" or "MAJ" code applies is less than the specified exemption the full benefit of the exemption cannot be obtained. To avoid overpayment of surcharge deductions by national superannuitants in these cases, these superannuitants are advised to _either_ have the surcharge deducted against their gross national superannuation rather than against their "other income", OR to apply for a special tax code which will fix a lower rate of tax and surcharge.

### Section 336L - Application of Surcharge Codes Specified in Tax Code Declarations

This section specifies the surcharge codes which are to be used in making payments of a national superannuitant's surcharge liability by way of deductions from source deduction payments (other than national superannuation).

The four codes used for this purpose are specified in section 336L (1) as:

1.  "SAJ" code - This code allows on a pay period basis the benefit of the $6,240 single superannuitant "other income" exemption.
2.  "MAJ" code - This is the code which allows on a pay period basis the benefit of the $5,200 married superannuitant "minimum other income" exemption.
3.  "MIN" code - This is the code which does not allow an exemption on a pay period basis, with the result that the surcharge is deducted at a flat rate of 25 cents in the dollar.
4.  Special Surcharge Code - This is a code which may be used at the option of the superannuitant instead of using one of the codes described in (1) to (3) above. Its main use is expected to be in allowing married superannuitants to obtain on a pay period basis an exemption level of up to $10,400 per annum, (ie above the $5,200 and $6,240 minima).

It should be noted that the above codes are applicable only where a national superannuitant elects to pay the surcharge on his _other_ income. The "special surcharge code" in particular should not be confused with the special rate of PAYE deduction to be advised by Inland Revenue district offices to the Department of Social Welfare where a national superannuitant has elected to have the surcharge deducted from his/her national superannuation.

Surcharge deductions should be made at the appropriate rate for each _complete_ dollar of income on which the surcharge is payable.

For various pay periods, the specified exemption in terms of the "SAJ" code ($6,240 per annum) is allowed in accordance with subsection (1A) as follows:

| Pay/Period | Specified Exemption |
| --- | --- |
| 1 day | $24 |
| 1 week | $120 |
| 2 weeks | $240 |
| 3 weeks | $360 |
| 4 weeks | $480 |
| 1 month | $520 |

Where the "MAJ" code applies, subsection (2) provides that the specified exemption is as follows:

| Pay/Period | Specified Exemption |
| --- | --- |
| 1 day | $20 |
| 1 week | $100 |
| 2 weeks | $200 |
| 3 weeks | $300 |
| 4 weeks | $400 |
| 1 month | $433.34 |

### Section 336M - Application of Other Parts

This section is the general section which relates to the new Part XA all Parts of the principal Act, other than Part IV in so far as they are applicable and with any necessary modifications, as if the surcharge were income tax levied under section 38 of the principal Act.

This section is important in that it applies many provisions of the principal Act in conjunction with the new Part XA. The major areas those other provisions relate to are:

*   the furnishing of returns of income upon which surcharge assessments can be made;
*   the making of assessments and reassessments and the treatment of objections thereto (see also section 336E of the Act);
*   the due dates for payment of the surcharge in respect of surcharge deductions and surcharge payments made on a provisional tax basis and also in respect of the surcharge assessed in the end of year assessment;
*   procedures for recovery of the surcharge;
*   provisions allowing refunds or relief from the surcharge;
*   the penalty and offence provisions of the Act.

In all cases the application, of those other provisions to the surcharge is identical to their application to, as the context requires, income tax, tax deductions or provisional tax.

### The Legislation - Other Section 17 Subsections and Transitional Provisions

As already stated the new Part XA of the principal Act was introduced by subsection (1) of section 17 of the Income Tax Amendment Act 1984. In addition, subsections (2) to (4) of section 17 made amendments to sections 2, 57(1) and 356(1) respectively of the principal Act, consequential on the introduction of the surcharge. A transitional provision concerning implementation of the surcharge was enacted at section 5 of the Income Tax Amendment Act 1985.

**Section 17(2)**

This subsection inserts in section 2 of the principal Act a definition of "national superannuitant surcharge" or "surcharge". A comment on this amendment is included under the reference to that definition in the commentary on section 336A.

**Section 17(3)**

This subsection amends section 57(1) of the principal Act, (which relates to the allowing of rebates of income tax against amounts of income tax payable) to provide that in any case where the tax rebates of a national superannuitant exceed the income tax payable by him, the surplus rebates can be offset against any amount of surcharge assessed to the national superannuitant.

**Section 17(4)**

This subsection amends section 356(1)(a) of the principal Act to ensure that all persons liable for the surcharge in any income year are excluded from the definition of a "pay-period taxpayer".

The consequence of this is that all persons liable for the surcharge in any income year are required to furnish annual returns of income in respect of that year.

**Section 17(5)**

This subsection specifies the time of the coming into force, and the application subsection for section 17 of the Income Tax Amendment Act 1984, which differ from the general application provisions specified in section 2 of that amendment Act.

It provides that section 17 is to come into force on the day on which the Act receives the Governor-General's assent and is to apply on and from that day. It should be noted however that, so far as the new Part XA is concerned, the 1985/86 income year application date specified in section 336C(2) overrides the application date specified in section 17(5).

**Transitional Provision**

Section 5 of the Income Tax Amendment Act 1985 introduced a transitional provision relating to the implementation of the surcharge. This provision was necessary in order to cater for the short time available prior to 1 April 1985 in which to implement the surcharge and in particular the changes made to it in the Income Tax Amendment Act 1985.

Where a national superannuitant did not deliver to his employer ("employer" includes the Director-General of Social Welfare by virtue of the definition of "employer" in section 2 of the principal Act) by 1 April 1985 a new IR12 tax code declaration or special tax code certificate to apply in respect of the 1985/86 income year, then the employer could continue to make PAYE tax deductions using the tax codes in force on 31 March 1985 (instead of the "no declaration" rate) until the _earlier_ of 31 May 1985 or the date on which a new IR12 tax code declaration or special tax code declaration was so delivered.

This dispensation applied only to _national superannuitants_ (as defined in section 336A) and only where a new tax code declaration/special tax code certificate was not delivered to an employer _by reason of delay in ascertaining a_ _surcharge code_ for the superannuitant.

In all cases, after 31 May 1985, the "no declaration" rate is however to be used where a tax code declaration/special tax code certificate in respect of the 1985/86 income year was not supplied to an employer on or after that date.

Supplementary Information
-------------------------

### Foreign Social Security Pensions

This section details the treatment of certain social security pensions for the purposes of the surcharge.

### Background

At present a number of national superannuitants receive overseas pensions which are similar in form to the New Zealand national superannuation. In some cases, where the amount of the overseas pension exceeds national superannuation, the superannuitant receives the amount of the foreign pension only, with no payment of national superannuation. In such cases, since the foreign pension recipients do not receive national superannuation, they are not national superannuitants (as defined in section 336A) and thus are not affected by the surcharge.

In other cases, however, the overseas pension is less than national superannuation in which case the Department of Social Welfare pays the superannuitant a "top up" portion of national superannuation. The result in such cases is that the total payment of national superannuation and foreign pension, combined, is equal to the amount of national superannuation to which the superannuitant would be eligible had he not received the foreign pension. The most common example of this kind of pension is the United Kingdom national insurance pension which is paid through the Department of Social Welfare. Other similar overseas pensions are paid direct to the superannuitant with a top up portion of national superannuation being paid by the Department of Social Welfare.

**Foreign pension excluded from "other" income**

The Income Tax Amendment Act 1985 provides that the amount of any "specified foreign social security pension" is excluded from the definition of "other income". This ensures that national superannuitants receiving those foreign pensions have the same income thresholds as other superannuitants, before they are required to pay the surcharge.

**Calculation of net national superannuation**

However as the foreign pension is not national superannuation, the amount of a superannuitant's "net national superannuation", which represents the maximum amount of surcharge which is payable, is calculated using only the "topping up" portion of the national superannuation payment. This is to ensure that the surcharge will not in effect claw back a pension for which the superannuitant is independently eligible and which is not paid by the New Zealand Government.

**Types of foreign pension included**

As mentioned previously, "specified foreign social security pensions" include the following:

1.  United Kingdom National Insurance Pensions
2.  Canadian Old Age Security Pensions
3.  German Insurance Pensions
4.  Greek Old Age Pensions
5.  Italian Old Age Pensions
6.  Netherlands Old Age Security Pensions
7.  United States Retirement Insurance Benefits

**Other foreign pensions treated as "other income"**

All other types of foreign pension will form part of a national superannuitant's "other income" unless they have been specifically exempted from income tax. For example, war pensions paid from any foreign Government in respect of any disability or disablement attributable to or aggravated by service in the armed forces are exempt from tax pursuant to section 61(10) of the Income Tax Act and accordingly, since they are not included in a recipient's taxable income, they are not "other income" and thus are not liable for the surcharge. On the other hand, armed forces "service" pensions would be included as "other income" since they are simply related to employment in the same manner as the Government Superannuation Fund is in New Zealand.

**Examples**

1.  A single national superannuitant's income comprises:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| National Superannuation | $6,959 | ($5,000 foreign pension + $1,959 top up) |
| Salary | $12,000 |     |
|     | $18,959 |     |
| His taxable income | $18,959 - $52 (standard deduction) = $18,907 |     |
| His "other income" | $18,907 - ($1,959 - nil) - $5,000 (a - (b - c) - d) = $11,948 |     |

|     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| His surcharge liability is thus | ($11,948 | \-  | $6,240) | x 0.25 = $1,427 |
|     | other  <br>income |     | single  <br>exemption |     |

However, his "net national superannuation" calculated in accordance with the definition in section 336A is:

\= $1,959 - (Tax on $18,907 - Tax on ($11,948 + 5,000)) (a - (b - c))

\= $1,959 - ($5,459.31 - $4,812.84)

\= $1,312.53

The surcharge payable is $1,312.53 being the net national superannuation maximum. Together with tax deductions thereon he thus effectively loses the full amount of the "top up".

His "net national superannuation" (a - (b - c)) is:

\= $727 - (Tax on $12,212 - Tax on $(6,500 + $5,000))

\= $727 - ($3,249.96 - $3,015.00)

\= $492.04

The surcharge payable is $325. As this is less than his net national superannuation the superannuitant effectively retains a portion of his "top up".

**NB:** In this example, the standard deduction has been calculated at $14.54 this being 2 percent of the $727 top up payment. The standard deduction is not allowable against the interest or the foreign pension (which is not related to past employment) as neither constitutes income from employment in accordance with section 105 of the Income Tax Act.

2.  The income of a married national superannuitant (whose spouse derives income over $5,200) comprises:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| National Superannuation | $5,727 | ($5,000 foreign pension + $727 top up) |
| Interest (after $200 exemption) | $6,500 |     |
|     | $12,227 |     |
|     |     |     |
| His taxable income | $12,227 \- $14.54 (standard deduction) = $12,212.46 |     |
| His "other income"  <br>_\[(a \- (b \- c) \- d)\]_ | $12,212.46 \- ($727 \- $14.54) - $5,000 = $6,500 |     |

|     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| His surcharge liability is thus | ($6,500 | \-  | $5,200) | x 0.25 = $325 |
|     | other  <br>income |     | married  <br>exemption |     |

His "net national superannuation" (a - (b - c)) is: = $727 - (Tax on $12,212 - Tax on $(6,500 + $5,000)) = $727 - ($3,249.96 - $3,015.00) = $492.04 The surcharge payable is $325. As this is less than his net national superannuation the superannuitant effectively retains a portion of his "top up". NB:In this example, the standard deduction has been calculated at $14.54 this being 2 percent of the $727 top up payment. The standard deduction is not allowable against the interest or the foreign pension (which is not related to past employment) as neither constitutes income from employment in accordance with section 105 of the Income Tax Act.

Apportionments of "Other Income" and "Specified Exemptions" in certain cases where National Superannuation is received for part only of an income year
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(a) **General**

In the majority of cases, a national superannuitant will receive national superannuation throughout an entire income year. In such cases, his/her liability for the surcharge is calculated by taking into account his/her "other income" for the _full_ year and his/her specified exemption for the full year.

In other cases however, national superannuation may be received for part only of an income year. In same circumstances the "other income" and "specified exemption" will be apportioned in relation to the number of pay periods in respect of which national superannuation is payable. In other cases the "other income" derived during the whole of the year, and the full amount of the "specified exemption" will be used to calculate the surcharge.

The following list shows the basis for the calculation of the surcharge in various circumstances.

| "Full Year" cases |     | "Part Year Apportionment" cases |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1.  | National superannuation paid in respect of the full income year | 1.  | Superannuitant reaches age 60 during the income year |
| 2.  | Superannuitant temporarily departs from New Zealand during the income year (or returns to New Zealand after having temporarily departed) | 2.  | Superannuitant meets residential requirements during the income year |
| 3.  | Superannuitant refuses to accept or does not apply for, while eligible, national superannuation | 3.  | Superannuitant dies during the income year |
| 4.  | Superannuitant is in a penal institution | 4.  | Superannuitant permanently departs from New Zealand during the income year |
| 5.  | Superannuation received for part of the year although entitled to receive it for the full year. |     |     |

(b) **Other Income Apportionments**

The determination by the Commissioner of the sources from which a superannuitant derived income during _only_ the period in respect of which national superannuation _was_ payable (item "e" of the other income apportionment formula) and of the sources from which a superannuitant derived income during _only_ the period in respect of which national superannuation was _not_ payable (item "g" of the other income apportionment formula), will depend upon the circumstances of each case.

For such determinations the general rules are:

1.  Salary and Wages/Superannuation
    *   The general rule is that where income from an employer or a superannuation fund is paid during an income year and
        *   A - the income is paid during a _part_ of the income year where national superannuation was not also being paid at any time during that part, that income will comprise item "g";
        *   B - the income is paid during a _part_ of the income year where national superannuation was also being paid at all times during that part, that income will comprise item "e";
        *   C - the income is paid either for the full income year or during a part of the income year in any case other than those above (ie where national superannuation was paid both at some time during that part and at some time outside that part), that income will comprise neither item "e" nor item "g". (It will thus form part of the "d - e - g" residue).

The following example illustrates the general rule (but see the exception below): Mr M turns 60 and consequently becomes a national superannuitant on 1 July. His income for the year ending on the following 31 March is as follows:

| Employer's Name | Period Employed | Gross Earnings |
| --- | --- | --- |
| G Packers Ltd | 1/4/85 to 30/6/85 | $3,950 |
| RSA | 1/4/85 to 15/7/85 | $ 817 |
| DSW (Nat Super) | 1/7/85 to 31/3/86 | $5,081 |

During the year additional income derived was:

1.  Investment income (net of exemption) $5,500
2.  Backpay from G Packers Ltd not included in original IR12 $2,200

In determining the amount of "other income" for surcharge purposes:

1.  Income from wages from G Packers Ltd is not included as this was derived from a source from which no income was derived after the taxpayer became a national superannuitant.
2.  The backpay, although received after 1 July is deemed to have been received before 1 July as provided for under section 336B(3) and is therefore not included in "other" income.
3.  The investment income is apportioned on a "pay day" basis (see below).
4.  Income from wages from RSA is also apportioned, as income from this source was derived both before and after the taxpayer became a national superannuitant. The "other income" thus calculated in accordance with the following formula is thus:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| (d - e - g) x f | \+ e (Section 336B(2)) |
| h   |

**where**

|     |
| --- |
| d = $12,415 (all income except national superannuation less the $52 standard deduction) |     |
| e = nil |     |
| g = $6,150 (wages and backpay G. Packers Ltd $3,950 + $2,200) |     |
| f = 20 (national superannuation pay days after 1 July) |
| h = 26 (pay days in the full year) |     |

Hence "other income" is

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| ($12,415 \-0\-$6,150) x 20 | + 0 |
| 26  |
| \= $4,819.23 |     |

It should be noted that the salary or wage payable from EACH employer is treated as a separate source of income.

**Exception**: In respect of item "c" in the general rule above, where a superannuitant can show what portion of a salary/wage was derived while he was also receiving national superannuation and correspondingly the portion derived while he was not receiving national superannuation, AND it is to the superannuitant's advantage, the respective portions can be treated as comprising item "g" and item "e" rather than forming part of the "d - e - g" residue.

If in respect of the same example above, Mr M had advised the Department that of his $817 salary from the RSA only $117 was derived after he qualified for national superannuation on 1 July (and he had a letter from the RSA supporting this), his "other income" would then be:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| ($12,415 - 117 - $6,850) x 20 | \+ 117 |
| 26  |
|     |     |

|     |
| --- |
| where |     |
| d = $12,414 (all income except national superannuation less the $52 standard deduction) |     |
| e = $117 (R.S.A.) |     |
| g = 20 (pay days after 1 July) |     |
| h = 26 (pay days in the full year) |     |

2.  Income Other than from Salary and Wages
    *   In respect of each source of income (all interest is treated as one source, all dividends as one source, all rents as one source, all business income as one source), the general rule is that where income from that source is derived during an income year and
        *   D - the income is derived during a _part_ of the income year where national superannuation was not also being paid at any time during that part, that income will comprise item "g";
        *   E - the income is derived during a _part_ of the income year where national superannuation was also being paid at all times during that part, that income will comprise item "e";
        *   F - the income is derived either throughout the full income year or during a part of the income year in any case other than those above (ie where national superannuation was paid both at some time during that part and at some time outside that part), that income will comprise neither item "e" nor item "g". (It will thus form part of the "d - e - g" residue).

As each type of income (interest, dividends, rents, business income) is treated as being a separate source, in most cases such income will comprise neither item "e" nor item "g" in accordance with item "f" above. As a general rule then, it will be only where all accounts or all shareholdings or all properties or all businesses are "sold" or "purchased" that a separation into item "e" or item "g" could be considered. **Exception**: Where a superannuitant can show what portion of each source (for example, dividends from individual companies) was derived while he was also receiving national superannuation and correspondingly the portion derived while he was not receiving national superannuation _and_ it is to the superannuitant's advantage, the respective portions can be treated as comprising item "g" and item "e" rather than forming part of the "d - e - g" residue.

_**Specified Exemption Apportionments**_

The formulae used in apportioning a superannuitant's specified exemption are contained in section 336BA. A full commentary on these formulae and when they should be used is contained on pages 9 to 14.

### Lump Sum Payments of National Superannuation

The Department of Social Welfare may on occasions pay backdated payments of national superannuation.

For income tax purposes the national superannuation is taxable in the year in which it is received. The same interpretation will be used for the purposes of the national superannuitant surcharge.

This affects the calculations of "net national superannuation" and "other income". The gross level of national superannuation which constitutes items "a" and "b" in the calculation of "net national superannuation" and "other income" respectively is the total of payments of national superannuation PAID in that income year. When calculating the taxable income figure (item "a" in the "other income" formulae) any payments received in the income year (and therefore liable to income tax in that year) but paid in respect of any other income year _should_ be included.

### Returns of Income Covering Periods Other than 12 Months Owing to a Change in Balance Date

In those cases where a superannuitant, with the Department's approval, changes his balance date with the result that a return of income for a period other than 12 months is furnished, the superannuitant's "other income" and "net national superannuation" calculations need no adjustment as in both cases each relates to the period covered by the non 12-month return of income. The superannuitant's "specified exemption" will however be adjusted to reflect the number of pay days (within the other than 12-months period) in respect of which national superannuation was paid.

The following example illustrates the procedure to be followed:

**Example:**

Joe Farmer retires to the city and obtains the Commissioner's approval for a change of balance date from 30 June to 31 March. This results in a 9 month return of income for the year in which the change is made.

Joe was a single national superannuitant for the entire period and had invested the proceeds from the sale of the farm to derive the following income for the period 1/7/85 to 31/3/86:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Interest | $ 3,800 |     |
| Dividends | $ 4,400 |     |
| National Superannuation | $ 5,353 | (20 pay days) |
|     | $ 13,553 |     |

The surcharge is calculated as follows:

|     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| His taxable income | $13,553 | \-  | $52 - $200 | \= $13,301 |
|     |     |     | (standard  <br>deduction) | (interest/dividend  <br>exemption) |

**Note:** For _income tax_ assessment purposes tax is calculated on the income of $13,301 at the rate applying to an income of $17,734 (13,301 x 12/9)(section 16(6)) and any special exemption or section 50A to 55 rebates would need similar adjustments (section 16(4) and (5)).

(2) His "other income" _(a\-(b\-c)\-d)=_ $13,301\-($5,353\-$52) - 0 = **$8,000**

(3) His specified exemption =

|     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 6,240 | x   | 20  | \=$4,800 |     |
| 26  |
| (single  <br>exemption) |     |     | (assumes 26 pay  <br>days in year to 31/3/86) |     |
|     |
|     |     |     |     |     |

(4) His surcharge liability at 25 cents of each complete dollar of the excess of his other income over his specified exemption is:

|     |
| --- |
| 0.25 x ($8,000 - $4,800 |
| **\=$800** |

(5) His net national superannuation (a - (b - c)) =

|     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $5,353 | \-  | (Tax rate on $13,301  <br>as rate for $17,734 | \-  | Tax on $8,000  <br>at rate for $10,666 |
| $5,353 - ($3,804.08 \- $2,054.96) |     |     |     |     |     |
| \= $3,603.88 |     |     |     |     |     |

(6) His surcharge payable is thus $800, this being less than his net national superannuation maximum.

**Notes:**

1.  The procedures followed in the above example are used in respect of other than 12-month surcharge assessments resulting from _changes in balance date only._ Other than 12-month assessments arising from, for example, returns to date of death or date of permanent departure from New Zealand are subject to the "other income" and "specified exemption" apportionment provisions outlined in sections 336B and 336BA.
2.  If, in the above example, Joe Farmer had been entitled to the maximum $1400 life insurance/superannuation special exemption, his entitlement to that exemption would need to have been proportionately decreased to 9/12 (1400) = $1,050. His taxable income in (1) would thus be reduced to $12,251, his "other income" in (2) would be reduced to $6,950 and his surcharge liability in (4) would then be 0.25 x ($6,950 - $4,800) = $537.50. His net national superannuation in (5) would similarly require adjustment.

### Amount of salary or wages on which tax and/or surcharge deductions are calculated where payments to a superannuation fund are made

Where deductions for superannuation contributions are made from an employee's salary or wages the deduction is, for tax deduction purposes, limited to $22.07 in the case of a weekly pay period, in accordance with section 341 of the Income Tax Act 1976.

For pay periods exceeding 1 week the deduction is limited to:

*   $46.14 for fortnightly pay periods
*   $69.21 for three weekly pay periods
*   $92.28 for four weekly pay periods
*   $99.27 for monthly periods

This limitation applies for national superannuitant surcharge purposes where a national superannuitant elects to pay the surcharge on his "other income" and that other income comprises salary or wages.

However, while the same superannuation contribution limitations are taken into account, it should be noted that a difference arises between the PAYE tax and surcharge deduction methods in relation to the treatment of the $52 standard deduction. While the standard deduction is taken into account in the deduction amounts shown in the normal PAYE tax deduction tables (IR184X, IR184Y and IR184Z) and while the deduction amounts shown in the supplementary PAYE tax and surcharge deduction tables (IR184NS) are calculated using the same PAYE figures as a base, the amount added to them as a surcharge deduction, in accordance with the amount specified in section 336L, ignores the standard deduction.

The following example, which is contained in the IR184NS tables applying from pay periods ending on or after 1 April 1985, illustrates the correct procedure to be followed by an employer in making tax/surcharge deductions from the amount of salary or wages payable to a national superannuitant who has specified a tax code and a surcharge code in respect of that income (ie the surcharge is to be paid by way of deductions from the national superannuitant's other income).

**Example**

Basic weekly pay $350.00; overtime $18.80 and shift allowance $12.00; superannuation contribution $35.00 (approved fund); tax code G; surcharge code MAJ.

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
|     | Tax Purposes | Actual |
| Basic weekly pay | $350.00 | $350.00 |
| Plus overtime | 18.80 | 18.80 |
| Plus shift allowance | 12.00 | 12.00 |
| GROSS EARNINGS | $380.80 | $380.80 |
| Deduct current superannuationfund contribution (limited for tax deduction purposes) | 23.07 | 35.00 |
|     | $357.73 | $345.80 |
| TAX TO BE DEDUCTED AT CODE G MAJ (on $357.73) |     | $166.73 |
|     |     | $179.07 |
| Add non-taxable allowances (such as tool money), if any |     | 4.50 |
| NET PAYMENT TO EMPLOYEE SUPERANNUITANT | $183.57 |     |

### Further Information

If further information is required two booklets are available from local tax offices. "Income Tax Surcharge on National Superannuation" (IR262) deals with the deduction of the surcharge from national superannuation, while "Surcharge Codes for National Superannuitants" (IR262A) sets out information for superannuitants who elect to have the surcharge deducted from other income.

### Examples

**Example A**

A single national superannuitant expects that his income in the year ending 31 March 1986 will be:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| National Superannuation (full year) | $6,959.16 |
| Government Superannuation | $12,000.00 |
| Interest and dividends (net of exemption) | $4,000.00 |
|     | $22,959.16 |

The first step is to determine whether he is liable for the surcharge. To do this it needs to be known whether his "other income" exceeds the specified exemption (section 336D(1)). As he is in receipt of national superannuation at the single rate, the specified exemption is $6,240.

As national superannuation is to be received for the full year, "other income" is determined in accordance with section 336B(1) as:

(Taxable income - (Gross national superannuation - Standard deduction entitlement) - specified foreign social security pensions)

\= $22,907.16 - (6,959.16 - 0) - 0

\= $15,948

As this exceeds the $6,240 specified exemption the superannuitant is liable for the surcharge. His liability for the surcharge as calculated in accordance with section 336D(1) is:

(Other income - $6,240) x 25 percent

\= (15,948 - $6,240) x 0.25

\= 9,708 x 0.25

\= $2,427.00

In accordance with section 336D(3) however, the annual surcharge cannot exceed the amount of the national superannuitant's net national superannuation. This is calculated under section 336A as:

(Gross national superannuation - (tax payable on taxable income-tax payable on taxable income other than national superannuation))

\= $6,959.16 - (tax on 22,907.16 - Tax on 15,948.00))

\= $6,959.16 - (6,779.31 - 4,482.84)

\= 4,662.69

As the surcharge liability is less than the net national superannuation, the liability remains at $2,427.

The next step is to consider the options which the national superannuitant has for paying that surcharge liability. As the other income comprises both a source deduction payment (government superannuation) and specified income (interest and dividends) the national superannuitant's options (as spelt out in section 336F(2)(c)) are to pay the surcharge:

(1) by way of deductions against gross national superannuation; or

(2) both by way of deductions from government superannuation and as provisional tax on his interest and dividends.

_**If option (1) is chosen**_, the superannuitant is required to inform the Commissioner of his estimated income detailed above on a form entitled "Application to have Surcharge Deducted from National Superannuation" (IR23S) and also forward to the Commissioner his tax deduction certificate(IR12) in respect of national superannuation to be payable to him by the Department of Social Welfare. (Sections 336H(1) and 336H(2)). Section 336H(3) then requires the Commissioner to determine the amount of the surcharge deduction to be made from gross national superannuation and to advise the Department of Social Welfare accordingly.

The surcharge deduction to be determined by the Commissioner would simply be the surcharge liability ($2,427) divided by the number of pay days in the 1985/86 year (26). The amount is thus $93.34 per fortnight.

If the national superannuitant has also correctly self-coded his tax code, for his national superannuation, at the secondary rate the PAYE deduction required on the national superannuation is calculated as the gross fortnightly payment ($267.66) multiplied by the secondary tax rate (0.33) = $88.32

The combined surcharge and PAYE tax deduction required to be deducted from each $267.66 fortnightly payment is thus $181.66 so that the national superannuitant receives $86.00.

_**If option (2) is chosen**_, then section 336K(3) is applicable since the national superannuitant's expected source deduction payment (government superannuation) exceeds his expected specified income (interest and dividends). Under that subsection, the surcharge is payable:

(a) on his specified income as if it were provisional tax (section 336K(3)(a)), but by virtue of the proviso to section 336I, no surcharge will be payable on a provisional basis in the first year. The terminal surcharge liability on that $4,000 of interest and dividends (assuming that is the amount of interest and dividends actually derived) equals $1,000 (25 percent) and, is due by 7 February 1987.

(b) on his source deduction payment (government superannuation) the "SAJ" surcharge code is used (section 336K(3)(b)(i)).

As government superannuation is paid four-weekly, the amount of the source deduction per four weeks is calculated, in accordance with section 336L(2)(b), as:

(four-weekly payment - 480 (4 week exemption entitlement)) X 0.25

\= (923.07 - 480) x 0.25

\= $110.76

The surcharge paid annually from this source would thus be $110.76 x 13 = $1,439.88. The surcharge thus paid from both (a) and (b) is $2,439.88.

Comparing the two options, it can be seen that there is a difference in the surcharge paid on an annual basis of $12.88. This arises from a combination of a rounding difference of $0.12 and a $13.00 difference ($52 x 0.25) since the surcharge codes do not take into account a standard deduction entitlement.

Credit for the above excess ($12.88) which represents an overpayment of surcharge will in effect be given when the annual return of income is furnished as part of the annual "square up".

**Example B**

A single national superannuitant knows that halfway through the 1985/86 year he will turn 60 and will stop work. At that time he expects to apply for national superannuation. He has estimated his income in that year to be:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| National superannuation (13 pay days) | $3,479.58 |
| Employment (6 months) | $13,000.00 |
| Interest and Dividends (net of exemption) | $18,000.00 |
|     | $34,479.58 |

The first step is to determine whether he is liable for the surcharge. To do this it needs to be known whether his "other income" exceeds the apportioned specified exemption.

As national superannuation is to be received for part only of the year by reason of the national superannuitant reaching age 60, the national superannuitant's other income is determined, in accordance with section 336B(2), as:

|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (d) | \-  | (e) | \-  | (g) | x   | (f) |
| (Other income  <br>as determined in  <br>s 336B(1) | income while  <br>on N/S | income while  <br>not N/S | No. of pay days  <br>where N/S received |
| No. of pay days in year (h) |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| +   | Income while on N/S(e) |     |     |     |     |     |
| \=  | (Taxable income - (Gross N/S - Standard Deduction entitlement) - 0 - 13,000 x 13 |     |     |     |     |     |
|     | 26  |     |     |     |     |     |
| +   | 0   |     |     |     |     |     |
| \=  | (34,427.58 - (3,479.58 - 0) - 13,000 x 0.5 |     |     |     |     |     |
| \=  | $8,974 |     |     |     |     |     |
| The superannuitant's specified exemption, under section 336BA, is calculated as: |     |     |     |     |     |     |
|     | Number of pay days where N/S received |     |     |     | x $6,240 |     |     |
|     | Number of pay days in year |     |     |     |
| \=  | 13  | x $6,240 |     |     |     |     |
|     | 26  |     |     |     |     |
| \=  | $3,120 |     |     |     |     |     |     |

As the "other income" ($8,974) exceeds the apportioned exemption level, the national superannuitant is liable for the surcharge. His liability for the surcharge is calculated in accordance with section 336D(2) as:

(apportioned other income) - specified exemption) x 25 percent

\= (8,974 - 3,120) x 0.25

\= $1,463.50

In accordance with section 336D(3), however, the annual surcharge cannot exceed the amount of the national superannuitant's net national superannuation. This is calculated under section 336A as:

(gross national superannuation - (tax payable on taxable income - tax payable on taxable income other than N/S))

\= ($3,479.58 - (Tax on 34,427.58 - Tax on 30,948.00))

\= ($3,479.58 - (12,208.54 - 10,256.82))

\= $1,527.86

As the surcharge liability is less than the net national superannuation, the liability remains at $1,463.50.

The next step is to consider the options which the national superannuitant has for paying that surcharge liability. As the other income comprises specified income (interest and dividends) only, the national superannuitant's options (as spelt out in section 336F(2)(a)) are to pay the surcharge:

(1) by way of deductions against gross national superannuation; or

(2) as provisional tax in respect of his specified income.

_**If option (1) is chosen**_, the superannuitant is required to inform the Commissioner of his estimated income, detailed above, on a form entitled "Application to have Surcharge Deducted from National Superannuation" (IR23S) and to forward to the Commissioner his tax code deduction certificate in respect of national superannuation to be payable to him by the Department of Social Welfare (IR12) (sections 336H(1) and 336H(2)). Section 336H(3) then requires the Commissioner to determine the amount of the surcharge deduction to be made from gross national superannuation and to advise the Department of Social Welfare accordingly.

The surcharge deduction to be determined by the Commissioner would simply be the surcharge liability ($1,463.50) divided by the number of pay days for which the national superannuitant can receive national superannuation (13). The amount is thus $112.57 per fortnight.

If the national superannuitant had also correctly self-coded his tax code for his national superannuation at the "G" code, the PAYE deduction required on the gross fortnightly payment ($267.66) of national superannuation is $57.10.

The combined surcharge and PAYE tax deduction required to be deducted from each $267.66 fortnightly payment is thus $169.67 so that the national superannuitant receives $97.99.

_**If option (2) is chosen**_, then section 336I(2) is applicable. Under that subsection, the surcharge will be payable on the national superannuitant's specified income as if it were provisional tax. The superannuitant's specified exemption is allowed against his specified income. The proviso however means that no surcharge is payable on a provisional basis in the first year. The terminal surcharge liability on $5,854 (8,974 - 3,120) of interest and dividends (assuming that it is the amount of interest and dividends actually derived), which equals $1,463.50 (25 percent), would be due by 7 February 1987.

### National Superannuitant Surcharge Decision Model

(Use **only** where you receive National Superannuation for the full year.)

**Note:**

1.  If you receive National Superannuation for part only of the year see your nearest Inland Revenue Office.
2.  If you receive "Other Income" in excess of $5,200 in a year you must furnish a return of income. You need also furnish a return if your spouse wishes to claim an increased exemption based on your income.

### 1984-1985 Legislation

### Income Tax Amendment Act 1984

### Income Tax Amendment Act 1985

### National Superannuitant Surcharge

### Introduction

This Public Information Bulletin contains:

1.  Details of the legislation giving effect to the national superannuitant surcharge which applied from 1 April 1985.
2.  Supplementary information on a number of matters affecting the surcharge.
3.  Two examples of how the various provisions of the surcharge interact.
4.  A decision model flowchart which can be used to determine a national superannuitant's liability for the surcharge and the ways in which he can pay that surcharge.

**Note:** This Bulletin does not take into account the changes to the national superannuitant surcharge announced in the June 1985 Budget, namely, the increase in the maximum specified exemption levels from $6,240 to $7,200 and from $10,400 to $12,000 which are to take effect from 1 April **1986**, and the extension of the period in respect of which national superannuation continues to be paid to a superannuitant who is temporarily overseas from 13 weeks to 26 weeks.

### The Legislation - The New Part XA

The surcharge is imposed in a new Part XA of the Income Tax Act 1976 (hereafter referred to as the principal Act) which was inserted by section 17(1) of the Income Tax Amendment Act 1984 and was subsequently amended (before its 1 April 1985 introduction) by the Income Tax Amendment Act 1985.

The new Part provides that national superannuitants who have taxable incomes other than national superannuation in any income year above certain limits shall be liable to a surcharge of 25 cents in the dollar on the balance of that other income. There is however a maximum surcharge liability in respect of any income year which will be the net amount of national superannuation received by each national superannuitant in that income year.

The new Part XA consists of sections 336A to 336M. Before analysing the legislation in detail a brief description of each section follows:

*   Section 336A - contains definitions of various terms and expressions which are used in the Part.
*   Section 336B - provides a further definition, that of "other income", upon which the new surcharge is based.
*   Section 336BA - provides a further definition, that of a "specified exemption", which is the amount of "other income" which can be derived by a national superannuitant before he/she becomes liable to the surcharge.
*   Section 336C - specifies the application date for the Part and the surcharge as being from the 1985/86 income year.
*   Section 336D - imposes the surcharge and provides details of how it is to be calculated.
*   Section 336E - empowers the Commissioner to make assessments of the surcharge and enables objections thereto.
*   Section 336F - provides details of the election which must be made by national superannuitants as to the class of income on which they wish to pay the surcharge.
*   Sections 336G and 336H - list the procedures to be followed where a national superannuitant elects to pay the surcharge against his national superannuation.
*   Sections 336I to 336K list the procedures to be followed where a national superannuitant elects to pay the surcharge against his "other income".
*   Section 336L - details the surcharge codes to be used in making surcharge deductions on a PAYE basis.
*   Section 336M - applies the other provisions of the principal Act with any necessary modifications.

### Section 336A - Interpretation

This section is the interpretation section and lists twelve definitions relevant to the new Part of the principal Act. In addition, section 2 of the principal Act contains three further definitions which are directly relevant to the new Part and section 17(2) of the 1984 Amendment Act inserts a further definition in that section which is relevant. Each definition is discussed below:

(a) "_**Gross**_"

This definition is contained in section 2 of the principal Act. In relation to any amount, it means without any deduction whatsoever from that amount.

Its relevance to the new Part is that the word is used several times throughout the Part where reference is made to a national superannuitant's "gross national superannuation". In accordance with the section 2 definition that expression refers to an amount of national superannuation before deducting any PAYE tax deduction or any surcharge deduction.

(b) "_**Income From Employment**_"

Section 336A gives this expression the same meaning as in section 105(1) of the principal Act, which means:

1.  salary, wages and extra emoluments (income from employment as defined in section 2 of the Act);
2.  salary, wages and other income of shareholder/employees of private companies (in accordance with section 6(2) of the Act);
3.  withholding payments for work done or services rendered by casual agricultural workers and payments to Deputy Returning Officers, poll clerks, interpreters, ushers, and other persons engaged for any election or poll (clause 10 of Part A and clause 6 of Part B of the Schedule to the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979).

(c) "_**National Superannuation**_"

This definition is contained in section 2 of the principal Act. National superannuation means:

"National superannuation paid or payable under Part I of the Social Security Act 1964; but does not include any supplement or benefit paid or payable under section 61A or section 61E or section 61G of that Act:"

The section 61A, 61E and 61G exclusions refer respectively to the child supplement, accommodation benefit and special benefit which are all additions to the basic national superannuation benefit which are paid on hardship grounds.

Thus only the basic national superannuation benefit is subject to the national superannuitant surcharge.

(d) "_**National Superannuitant**_"

Section 336A defines a national superannuitant as being any person who receives national superannuation in an income year. This includes a person who receives the national superannuation benefit for only part of an income year but does not include a person who may have been entitled to receive national superannuation but who for any reason had not applied for it.

Specifically excluded from the definition are national superannuitants who receive national superannuation in accordance with section 16 of the Social Security Act 1964. The class of persons referred to here are persons over the age of 60 who have met the residential requirements and who have a spouse under the age of 60 or a spouse who has _not_ met the residential requirements. In these cases, section 16 of the Social Security Act allows each spouse to receive half the "married couple" rate ($220.28 each gross per fortnight as at 1 April 1985) instead of the over 60 person receiving the full single rate ($267.66 gross per fortnight as at 1 April 1985) only. Where this situation arises _both_ spouses will not be liable for the surcharge by virtue of their not being national superannuitants, since the option to receive half the married couple rate is subject to an income test.

(e) "_**National Superannuitant Surcharge" or "Surcharge**_"

This is a new definition which is inserted in section 2 of the principal Act in accordance with section 17(2) of the Income Tax Amendment Act 1984.

The definition merely provides a title for the new surcharge and caters for its abbreviation wherever it occurs in the principal Act, mainly in the new Part XA.

(f) "_**Net National Superannuation**_"

This definition, which is contained in section 336A, is necessary for the purposes of section 336D(3) which is the provision that restricts the liability for the surcharge of any national superannuitant in any income year to the net amount of national superannuation he receives during the income year.

In particular, net national superannuation is calculated in accordance with an a - (b - c) formula where "a" is a national superannuitant's gross national superannuation and "b - c" is the tax applicable to that gross national superannuation.

It is important to note that the tax applicable to the gross national superannuation is calculated as the difference between the amount of tax assessed in respect of a national superannuitant's taxable income and the amount of tax that would have been assessed if he/she had not received national superannuation, thereby treating the national superannuation as the _last_ "slice" of income derived. The tax applicable to the benefit is calculated on an _annual_ basis. Any entitlement to the section 105 standard deduction in respect of the national superannuation received, bearing in mind his/her other income from employment (if any), will be taken into account in a manner that is similar to that required in the determination of "other income" under section 336B(1).

Net national superannuation is thus also calculated on an _annual_ basis. Any PAYE tax deductions (whether deducted on any of codes "A" to "G", "SEC", "ND", "SHR", or "SSH" or on a special tax code) or surcharge deductions made from national superannuation are therefore not relevant in calculating net national superannuation.

(g) "_**Other Income**_"

The section 336A definition simply refers to an amount of other income determined in accordance with section 336B. Details of this definition are included in the commentary on that section.

(h) "_**Source Deduction Payment**_"

The section 336A definition provides that any reference to a source deduction payment in the new Part shall not include a withholding payment, a payment which would otherwise be included in that definition by virtue of the definition in section 6(1) of the principal Act.

Source deduction payments thus mean, for the purposes of the new Part only, payments by way of salary, wages and extra emoluments(which because of the section 2 definition of salary or wages, also includes payments of national superannuation and pension payments). Any surcharge payable on withholding payments will be payable on a "provisional tax" basis. In practice this may mean that some national superannuitants who derive withholding payments may need to furnish IR3 returns (for surcharge and income tax purposes) instead of the IR5 returns that they might otherwise have furnished for income tax purposes.

(i) "_**Special Surcharge Code**_"

A special surcharge code refers to the special surcharge rates which are determined where a superannuitant wishes to have the surcharge deducted against his/her other income. (It does not refer to the special rates determined by Inland Revenue district offices and supplied to the Department of Social Welfare where surcharge deductions are to be made against a superannuitant's national superannuation). Accordingly, the definition refers to codes supplied by the Commissioner in a similar manner to special tax code certificates supplied pursuant to section 351 of the principal Act.

(j) "_**Specified Exemption**_"

Section 336A provides that "specified exemption" has the meaning specified in section 336BA. For further information see the commentary on that section.

(k) "_**Specified Foreign Social Security Pension**_"

The definition provided by section 336A, includes only those pensions or benefits which reduce an eligible person's entitlement to national superannuation. The pensions in this category are:

1.  United Kingdom National Insurance Pensions
2.  Canadian Old Age Security Pensions
3.  German Insurance Pensions
4.  Greek Old Age Pensions
5.  Italian Old Age Pensions
6.  Netherlands Old Age Security Pensions
7.  United States Retirement Insurance Benefits

(see the section entitled "Foreign Social Security Pensions" on page 26.)

(l) "_**Specified Income**_"

This is a new definition in section 336A which is the complement of the "source deduction payment" definition discussed above. That is, specified income means all income other than source deduction payments. Withholding payments are included in the term "specified income" by virtue of their exclusion from the "source deduction payment" definition.

Both the "source deduction payment" and "specified income" definitions are needed for the purpose of making an election as to how any surcharge liability is to be paid (see section 336F) and the rules which apply if that election is to have the surcharge paid on a national superannuitant's other income (see sections 336I to 336K).

(m) "_**Standard Deduction Entitlement**_"

This is a new definition in section 336A which is only used in the new Part in section 336B as part of the calculation of a national superannuitant's "other income". It refers to the portion (if any) of a standard deduction/employment related expense claim which relates to a national superannuitant's national superannuation benefit.

As the standard deduction/employment related expense claim provided in section 105 of the Income Tax Act 1976 is allowed against payments of national superannuation as well as against other income from employment, this definition details a set of rules to be followed in determining what portion of any such claim (if any) relates to the national superannuation benefit. For this purpose it is assumed that where a standard deduction claim is made, the standard deduction relates firstly to income from employment other than national superannuation and secondly (if there is any balance) to national superannuation. The standard deduction entitlement that relates to national superannuation is thus treated as the last segment of any standard deduction claim.

In particular, the definition requires that the standard deduction entitlement that relates to national superannuation is:

*   where national superannuation is the only "income from employment", the lesser of $52 or 2 percent of the national superannuation (the 2 percent could occur where national superannuation was received for part of a year only);
*   where the "income from employment" other than national superannuation is _less than_ $2,600, 2 percent of the difference between that amount and $2,600;
*   where the "income from employment" other than national superannuation is _equal to or greater than_ $2,600, nil.

This definition and its associated rules are necessary to ensure that the calculation of a national superannuitant's "other income" (see the commentary on section 336B) not only excludes the superannuitant's gross national superannuation but also adds back the portion of any standard deduction/employment related expenditure claim which relates to it.

(n) "_**Surcharge Code**_"

This section 336A definition refers to the "SAJ", "MAJ", "MIN" and special surcharge codes (as described in section 336L) which are to be used in paying the surcharge along with tax deductions from source deduction payments (other than national superannuation) on a PAYE basis where the national superannuitant has elected to have the surcharge paid on his other income and that other income includes source deduction payments.

The definition is similar to the "tax code" definition in section 2 of the Act.

(o) "_**Surcharge Deduction**_"

This section 336A definition simply refers to any PAYE deduction of the surcharge made from any source deduction payment (including national superannuation) in the same way that any PAYE deduction of income tax is referred to as a "tax deduction".

(p) "_**Taxable Income**_"

For the purposes of the new Part, any reference to taxable income simply takes the same meaning that applies for income tax purposes in accordance with the section 2 definition of that term.

The definition is referred to in the calculations required to compute "net national superannuation" (as described above) and "other income" (see below).

### Section 336B - Determination of "Other Income"

This section is in effect another definition section. It simply provides the formula to be used in determining the amount of a national superannuitant's "other income" which is the base on which any surcharge liability is calculated after deducting the specified exemption.

_Subsection (1)_ provides for the calculation of other income in all cases where:

*   national superannuation has been received by a national superannuitant for a full year;
*   national superannuation has been received by a national superannuitant for only part of a year for any reason other than those mentioned in subsection (2) (where an apportionment formula is required). This will include those cases where, during an income year, a superannuitant dies, goes overseas temporarily for more than 13 weeks on a continuous basis (at which time payments of national superannuation cease to be made) or decides not to accept payments of national superannuation for some part of the year. (Where a superannuitant does not accept any national superannuation in a year, although entitled to it, he is not a national superannuitant as defined in section 336A and thus has no surcharge liability.)

In such cases, the "other income" of a national superannuitant is calculated in accordance with the formula:

| a - (b - c) - d |     |
| --- | --- |
| where |     |
| a   | is the superannuitant's taxable income in the income year, |
| (b - c) | is the portion of that taxable income that relates to national superannuation, this being calculated as the gross national superannuation received in the income year less the standard deduction entitlement that relates to it, |
| d   | is the amount of all specified foreign social security pensions received. |

_Subsection (2)_ provides for the calculation of "other income" in those cases where national superannuation has been received by a national superannuitant for only part of a year by reason of:

*   that national superannuitant commencing to receive national superannuation after the beginning of an income year. This would include not only those persons who reach age 60 and apply for the benefit during the year but also persons who arrive in New Zealand during the year and/or meet the residential qualifications in order to obtain the national superannuation benefit.
*   that national superannuitant permanently departing from New Zealand. In such cases, processing of the final part year income tax return completed before departure will need to include a calculation of any surcharge liability payable. As national superannuation ceases to be paid 13 weeks after departure in such circumstances, the "final" part year IR12 included in the tax return will generally represent all payments of national superannuation during the year.

In such cases, instead of making the calculation required in subsection (1), income sources are apportioned in the following manner to arrive at the national superannuitant's "other income":

*   any income derived from any source (excluding national superannuation and specified foreign social security pension payments) which, in the opinion of the Commissioner, was derived _only_ in that part or those parts of the year while the national superannuitant was receiving national superannuation is to be _included_. This would generally include those pensions which commence to be paid from the date a person reaches age 60.
*   any income derived from any source (excluding national superannuation and specified foreign social security pension payments) which, in the opinion of the Commissioner, was derived _only_ in that part or those parts of the year while the national superannuitant was _not_ receiving national superannuation is to be _excluded_. This would include, for example, any salary or wages derived by an employee before he ceased employment on reaching age 60, a situation which commonly occurs in the public sector.
*   all "remaining income" (ie, income derived in periods both where the national superannuitant was receiving national superannuation, and in periods where he/she was not receiving national superannuation) excluding a "specified foreign social security pension" payment is to be apportioned on the basis of the number of fortnightly periods in respect of which national superannuation was received in the income year compared with the number of fortnightly payment days that occurred in that year. (These fortnightly payment days are defined as "pay days" in section 3 of the Social Security Act 1964).

The apportionment is handled by the apportionment formula:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| (d \- e \- g) x f | \+ e |
| h   |

where

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| d \- e \- g | represents the "remaining income" described above |
| d   | is the total amount of "other income" in the year (as determined in accordance with section 336B(1)) |
| e   | is that portion derived only while in receipt of national superannuation |
| g   | is that portion received only while NOT in receipt of national superannuation |
| f/h | is the apportionment fraction |
| f   | is the number of pay days in respect of which national superannuation has been received |
| h   | is the number of pay days in that income year, which must be 26 or 27 depending on the year concerned |

A practical example of how the formula works is set out at _Example B_ on page 39 of this Bulletin.

(As to the general rules which apply in determining whether income from any source comes within **"e"** or **"g"**, see the section entitled _"Apportionments of 'Other Income' and 'Specified Exemptions' in Certain Cases Where National Superannuation is Received for Part Only of an Income Year"_ on page 28).

_Subsection (3)_ provides a limited exception to the rules (detailed above) in relation to when the determination of "other income" can involve apportionments of income sources.

The subsection provides that where any source of income is received within a reasonable period after a national superannuitant has commenced receiving national superannuation _and_ where the receipt of that income was delayed due to circumstances beyond the control of the national superannuitant, the Commissioner may treat that income as having been received in full before the superannuitant commenced receiving national superannuation.

The purpose of the subsection is to cater particularly for those cases where a person ceases employment prior to receiving national superannuation but receives his last payments of salary or wages, possibly together with a retiring allowance, soon after he has reached age 60 and commenced receiving national superannuation. The determination of what constitutes a reasonable period will of course depend on the facts in each case.

### Section 336BA - Determination of "Specified Exemption"

**Subsection (1)**

_Section 336BA(1)_ provides the method for calculating a superannuitant's "specified exemption" where an income tax/surcharge assessment is made in the normal course (section 336BA(2) deals with "early" assessments made under section 12 of the Income Tax Act (assessments to date of death, persons going overseas etc.))

A superannuitant's specified exemption is calculated as the sum of _up to_ four different amounts, each of which is calculated in one of paragraphs (a) to (d), as follows:

_Single Persons_

*   **Paragraph (a)** represents an exemption for single superannuitants of $6,240 multiplied by a fraction representing the number of fortnightly payments of national superannuation (defined as pay days in the Social Security Act 1964), in the income year, made at the "single" rate (this is described in the Social Security Act as being 60 percent of the married rate).

_Married Person on Married Rate Benefit_

*   **Paragraph (b)** represents a similar apportionment of the married couple exemption, based on the number of fortnightly payments of national superannuation which have been paid at the "married" rate (this is described in the Social Security Act as being 50 percent of the married rate). The exemption for a married superannuitant (receiving the married rate of national superannuation) is the _greater_ of:
    1.  $10,400 reduced by an amount equal to the "other income" of the superannuitant's spouse:
    2.  $5,200.

**Example:**

|     | "Other" Income | National Superannuation" | Total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A   | $10,000 pa | $5,727 | $15,727 |
| Spouse of A | $3,000 pa | $5,727 | $8,727 |
| **Exemption** |     |     |     |
| A   | $10,400 pa \- $3,000 = $7,400 |     |     |
| Spouse of A | $3,000 |     |     |

_Married Person on Single Rate Benefit_

*   **paragraph (c)** represents a similar apportionment based on the number of fortnightly payments of national superannuation which have been paid at the single rate of benefit. This applies to a married superannuitant with a non-qualifying spouse. The exemption for a married superannuitant receiving the single rate of national superannuation (this occurs where the superannuitant's spouse is under age 60 or has not met the 10 year residential requirement) is the _greater_ of:
    1.  $10,400 reduced by an amount equal to the taxable income (excluding specified foreign social security pensions) of the superannuitant's spouse:
    2.  $6,240.

**Note:**

In calculating the amount of the taxable income of the superannuitant's spouse in (i) above, where that non-qualifying spouse has qualified to receive national superannuation during the income year, the amount of national superannuation received by him/her should, as is the case with specified foreign social security pensions, also be excluded.

**Example:**

|     | "Other" Income | National Superannuation" | Total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A   | $10,000 | $6,959 | $16,959 |
| Spouse of A | $3,000 | N/A | $3,000 |
| **Exemption** |     |     |     |
| A   | $10,400 \- $3,000 = $7,400 |     |     |
| Spouse of A | N/A |     |     |

_Adjustment for any period national superannuation not received_

*   **paragraph (d)** represents the allocation of a portion, of one of the exemptions provided in paragraphs (a) to (c) above, to that period of the income year (if any) in respect of which national superannuation is _not_ paid in those cases where the national superannuitant is temporarily overseas (the Social Security Act provides for the stopping of payments where a superannuitant is absent for more than 13 weeks) or has not applied for, or has refused receipt of, national superannuation. This paragraph effectively ensures a full year's exemption is applicable in all cases where a full year's other income is taken into account

In the majority of cases only one of the formulae in paragraphs (a) to (c) will apply since the same rate of national superannuation will have been paid in the same circumstances throughout the income year. In such cases, the a/b, d/e, or g/h segments of the apportionment formulae will equal 1 so that a simple calculation of the annual exemption is all that is required.

**Other points to note** concerning section 336BA(1) are:

*   The $6,240 exemption level for single superannuitants is equal to 60 percent of the combined household exemption of $10,400 for married superannuitants. This percentage is consistent with that used for the payment of national superannuation whereby the single rate of benefit is set at a level of 60 percent of the total benefit that two married persons each receive.
*   The $10,400 household exemption was introduced to place the married national superannuitant who is unable to split his income in the same position as the superannuitant who is able to avail himself of the maximum amount of exemption available. The transferability of an unused exemption will always go from a lesser-earning national superannuitant to his/her spouse. There will however be no transferability where both spouses have an income in excess of $5,200.
*   The exemption level for married superannuitants receiving the single rate of national superannuation is a combination on the other two exemptions. It arises from the fact that superannuitants in this position receive the single rate of benefit - calculated at 60 percent of the married rate of benefit.
*   Married superannuitants who have a non-qualifying spouse may instead of receiving the single rate (and being subject to the surcharge as described above) apply to receive two married rates with both the superannuitant and his/her spouse receiving national superannuation as if they both qualified for national superannuation. This latter option is however subject to an income test administered by the Department of Social Welfare. Arising from the strictness of that income test, superannuitants receiving national superannuation on this basis are not liable to the surcharge. This is achieved through their exclusion from the section 336A definition of a "national superannuitant", (they receive national superannuation pursuant to section 16 of the Social Security Act 1964).
*   The use of the words "_in respect of_ which that national superannuation was payable" in the descriptions of item "a" in the formula in paragraph (a), item "d" in the formula in paragraph (b), and item "g" in the formula in paragraph (c) is important. It not only covers normal fortnightly national superannuation payments but also relates to lump sum "back" period payments. The Social Security Act provides that these "back" period payments cannot extend back more than six months. However in cases where such a "back" payment has been made and this extends back into a former income year, a superannuitant could receive the equivalent of more than the standard 26 or 27 pay days in the income year the lump sum is received. In these cases, a superannuitant should not however be allowed a higher specified exemption than that which would apply on an annual basis. (This is because the specified exemption relates to the amount of other income received rather than the amount of any national superannuation received.)
*   In allocating a portion of one of the exemptions provided in paragraphs (a) to (c) to a part of the income year in respect of which national superannuation is _not_ paid for any reason _other than_ those stated in subparagraphs (i) to (iii) of paragraph (d), the general rule (as contained in subparagraph (iv)) involves the use of the exemption that applied to the last fortnightly payment made _in the same income year_ prior to national superannuation not being paid. Where there has been no such prior fortnightly payment in the income year (ie the first fortnightly payment in the income year was not received), then subparagraph (v) provides that the exemption to be used shall be that applied to the first fortnightly payment _made in the same income year_. (No provision is necessary where national superannuation is not paid for the full income year as there would be no liability for the surcharge).
*   In those cases where national superannuation is _not_ received for part of an income year for any of the reasons stated in subparagraphs (i) to (iii) of paragraph (d) no allocation of any of the exemptions in paragraphs (a) to (c) is required. Instead the exemptions provided by paragraphs (a) to (c) will be less than a full year equivalent. This effectively ensures a part year exemption is applicable in all cases where a part year's other income is taken into account. See the section entitled "Apportionments of Other Income" and "Specified Exemptions" in Certain Cases where National Superannuation is Received for Part only of an Income Year" on page 28).

_Changes in eligibility for benefit_

*   Whereas paragraphs (a) to (d) clearly cater for apportionments of the exemption level in those cases where:
    1.  a single superannuitant marries another superannuitant during the income year (paragraph (a) to (b)), or
    2.  a married superannuitant's qualifying spouse dies during the income year (paragraph (b) to (a)), or
    3.  a single superannuitant marries a non-qualifying person and does not opt for the income tested married rates during the income year (paragraph (a) to (c)), or
    4.  the non-qualifying spouse of a married superannuitant (who had not opted for the income tested married rates) dies during the income year (paragraph (c) to (a)), or
    5.  the non-qualifying spouse of a married superannuitant (who had not opted for the income tested married rates) qualifies during the income year (paragraph (c) to (b)), or (**Note:** a simple change from paragraph (b) to (c) is generally not possible unless a married superannuitant's qualifying spouse dies and he/she immediately remarries a non-qualifying spouse during the income year).
    6.  any combination of (i) to (v) above, or
    7.  any of (i) to (vi) above with non-payment of national superannuation for part of the income year,

*   they do not _explicitly_ cover all possible situations where an apportionment would be necessary. Examples of this follow:
    
    *   **Example (1):**
        *   Where a married superannuitant with a non-qualifying spouse has been receiving the income tested married rates of benefit and his/her spouse qualifies during the income year. (In such cases the exemption level should be apportioned to reflect the period that the superannuitant was liable for the surcharge, ie not receiving the income tested benefit - his/her "other income" would likewise be apportioned on a time basis.)
    *   **Example (2):**
        *   Where a single superannuitant or married superannuitant with no dependent children is in hospital for a period in excess of 13 weeks, in which case his/her after-tax rate of national superannuation is reduced to $10 per week. (In the case of single superannuitants the single rate exemption in paragraph (a) should be applied in respect of each $20 fortnightly national superannuation payment. In the case of married superannuitants who have qualifying spouses, however, the Social Security Act provides that the qualifying spouse's benefit will, after the 13 weeks, be increased to the single rate. In these cases, the variable $6,240 to $10,400 exemption in paragraph (c) should be applied to the single rate recipient in respect of each fortnightly payment made at the single rate. (As a hospitalised superannuitant will be entitled in most cases to a maximum exemption in his/her own right, the exemption obtained by both married superannuitants can be up to $11,440).

*   _Subsection (2) Section 336BA(2)_ provides the method for calculating a superannuitant's "specified exemption" where an income tax/surcharge "early" assessment is to be made pursuant to section 12(2) of the Income Tax Act (ie the assessments to date of death, persons going permanently overseas, etc). In order to avoid the need to wait until the end of a tax year to determine the correct specified exemption of a married superannuitant, in such cases the subsection (1) formulae should be applied using only the spouse's "other income" to the superannuitant's date of death, date of departure or date of becoming bankrupt rather than using "other income" for the full income year.

### Section 336C - Application of this Part

This section is the application section for the purposes of the new Part XA.

_**Subsection (1)**_ provides that the national superannuitant surcharge shall be payable by every national superannuitant in accordance with the provisions of the new Part XA.

_**Subsection (2)**_ specifies that the surcharge, which is in respect of the "other income" of a national superannuitant, is to apply from the _income year_ commencing on 1 April 1985.

This application date is particularly important in so far as it affects superannuitants with balance dates other than 31 March. Arising from the income year application date, the surcharge will in effect be applied against each superannuitant's income as shown in his/her annual tax return. Thus, where for example a superannuitant has a 30 June balance date the surcharge will apply, in the first year to which the surcharge applies, to source deduction income derived in the year ended 31 March 1986 and business income for the year ended 30 June 1986 where the superannuitant has elected to have the surcharge applied against other income. If, instead, the election is made to have the surcharge applied against the gross national superannuation the surcharge will be deducted from the superannuitant's national superannuation in the year ended 31 March 1986.

In addition those superannuitants who have early balance dates may have derived other income prior to 1 April 1985 commencement date which will be subject to the surcharge. For example, a superannuitant with a 31 October balance date who has elected to have the surcharge applied against "other income" should in theory already be making provision for the surcharge. However, as all such non-31 March year income comes within the definition of specified income and as the surcharge paid on such income is paid as if it were provisional tax with no provisional tax being required in the first year of the surcharge, this should cause no difficulties in practice.

### Section 336D - National Superannuitant Surcharge Imposed

This section imposes the national superannuitant surcharge and details how any liability for the surcharge is to be calculated.

_**Subsection (1)**_ imposes the surcharge in respect of national superannuitants who receive national superannuation at any stage during an income year.

In such cases, the annual surcharge liability imposed in respect of any income year is an amount equal to 25 percent of the excess of a national superannuitant's "other income" over the specified exemption. Subsection (3) however places a maximum on that liability.

_**Subsection (2)**_ has been repealed by section 3(3)(b) of the Income Tax Amendment Act 1985. The provisions of the previous subsection (2) have been incorporated in section 336BA.

_**Subsection (3)**_ limits the amount of the surcharge for which any national superannuitant is liable in any income year, as calculated in accordance with subsection (1), to the amount of "net national superannuation" of that national superannuitant for that income year.

Using the rates of national superannuation applicable at 1 April 1985 and the new rates which will apply, the maximum surcharge applies where:

*   in the case of superannuitants on the single rate and eligible for a specified exemption of $6,240, their estimated total taxable "other income" (ie, excluding national superannuation) exceeds $22,657 per annum; and
*   in the case of superannuitants on half the married couple rate and eligible for a specified exemption of $5,200, their estimated total taxable "other income" exceeds $20,133 per annum; and
*   in the case of superannuitants on half the married couple rate and eligible for a specified exemption of $10,400, their estimated total taxable "other income" exceeds $23,637 per annum.

### Section 336E - Assessment of Surcharge

This section empowers the Commissioner to assess the amount of the surcharge and applies the objection provisions of the principal Act to the surcharge in the same manner as they apply to income tax with any necessary modifications. This section makes it clear that assessments of the surcharge and objections thereto shall be treated in the manner as if they were assessments of income tax and objections thereto.

Panels for the annual _assessments_ of surcharge will be included in national superannuitants' tax returns, in particular in both the IR3 and IR5 forms. As the surcharge is to apply from the income year commencing on 1 April 1985, the 1984/85 tax returns will not be affected. The first appearance of a surcharge assessment panel, which it is envisaged will be combined with the tax assessment panel, will thus be on 1985/86 tax returns.

### Section 336F - Election by National Superannuitant in Respect of Payment of Surcharge

This section is the main operative section of the new Part XA. In essence, the section requires any national superannuitant who expects to be liable for the surcharge to make an election as to whether he wishes to pay that surcharge liability by way of deductions from his gross national superannuation or by way of payments from his "other income".

In those cases where a superannuitant elects to have the surcharge paid by way of deductions from his gross national superannuation, the provisions of sections 336G and 336H apply.

However, where the national superannuitant elects to have the surcharge paid by way of payments from his "other income", the provisions of sections 336I, 336J or 336K will apply depending on the composition of his "other income". In particular:

*   Section 336I will apply where the superannuitant's other income comprises only "specified income", (ie, income other than source deduction payments).
*   Section 336J will apply where the superannuitant's other income comprises source deduction payments only.
*   Section 336K will apply where the superannuitant's other income consists of both specified income and source deduction payments.

_**Subsection (1)**_ is the provision which requires the making of an election, by any national superannuitant who expects that he will be liable for the surcharge, as to how the surcharge is to be paid.

It should be noted that if a national superannuitant fails to make an election that failure is, by virtue of sections 336M and 416(1)(d) of the principal Act, an offence against the Act. (Section 416(2) provides that every person who commits such an offence shall be liable to a fine not exceeding $500.)

_**Subsection (2)**_ sets out the elections available to any national superannuitant who expects to be liable for the surcharge dependent on the composition of his "other income".

_**Subsection (3)**_ requires that where a national superannuitant has made an election, as to how the surcharge is to be paid, under one of the paragraphs of subsection (2) and finds that due to a change in the composition of his "other income" subsequent to the making of that first election, he should have made an election under another paragraph, a fresh election is to be made in accordance with that other paragraph.

For example, an employed national superannuitant who has elected to have the surcharge deducted from his salary, and who also pays surcharge on his rental income as provisional tax, may stop working. In this case he must make a new election, the new election being whether he now wants the surcharge deducted from his gross national superannuation or whether he wants to pay it on his rental income as provisional tax only.

### Section 336G - Surcharge Deductions from National Superannuation, and Section 336H National Superannuitant to Estimate Other Income

As spelt out in section 336G(1) these sections apply to national superannuitants who have elected in accordance with section 336F to have the surcharge paid by way of deductions from their gross national superannuation for any year.

In such cases, section 336H(1) requires those national superannuitants to provide to the Commissioner, as soon as practicable after the making of their election: (a) an estimate of the "other income" they expect to receive in that year and (b) an estimate of the amount of national superannuation which they expect to receive in that year. Section 336H(2) requires that information to be provided to the Commissioner on a prescribed form (this is the IR23S) together with the national superannuitant's IR12 tax code declaration.

Section 336H(3) then requires that on receipt of the tax code declaration and the IR23S prescribed form from a national superannuitant, the Commissioner is to determine the amount of the surcharge deduction to be made against future payments of national superannuation by the Department of Social Welfare in that year.

Although not specified in the legislation, the surcharge deduction will be determined on a basis which is consistent with the "other income" and the specified exemption provisions in the new Part XA.

Section 336H(3) also requires that the Commissioner, having determined the surcharge deduction amount, advise the Department of Social Welfare of it. Section 336G(2) then requires that Department to deduct from any payment of national superannuation to that national superannuitant in that year a surcharge deduction equal to that amount and to pay that to the Commissioner with the fortnightly tax deduction on the national superannuation.

In every case where the combined total of the fortnightly tax deduction (using the superannuitant's tax code) and the surcharge deduction applied by the Department of Social Welfare would equal or exceed the gross amount of the national superannuation payment, the superannuitant will not receive any national superannuation and the gross national superannuation will be paid direct to Inland Revenue.

Any shortfall in the surcharge deduction made, compared with that determined by the Commissioner, is to be accounted for in the end of year assessment panel in the national superannuitant's tax return. This means that any national superannuitant who has a special tax code, operating in respect of his national superannuation, which deducts a low rate of PAYE and who has elected this option could face a substantial debit in his/her year end assessment.

### Section 336I - Surcharge Paid As Provisional Tax

As spelt out in section 336I(1), this section applies to those national superannuitants who have elected in accordance with section 336F to have the surcharge paid as provisional tax. This option can be selected only by a national superannuitant where his/her "other income" consists of specified income only. (However where specified income and source deduction payments are both derived, see section 336K).

In such cases, section 336I(2) provides that the provisions of Part XII of the principal Act (which relate to provisional tax) will apply to a national superannuitant's surcharge liability in respect of his expected specified income as if that liability were payable as provisional tax.

The surcharge will thus generally be payable in two instalments (in three instalments in the case of some farmers) due 7 August and 7 February in each income year being 1/3 and 2/3 portions respectively. Also, as with provisional income and income tax, the surcharge payable can be based on the previous year's specified income.\\

The specified income of a national superannuitant is reduced by the amount of his/her specified exemption in order that the exemption can be taken into account in regard to his 1/3 and 2/3 "provisional tax" payments.

It is important to note that the proviso to section 336I(2) provides that in respect of the first income year where the surcharge is payable by a national superannuitant, he shall be relieved of his obligation to pay that provisional tax. This means that all national superannuitants who can and have elected to have the surcharge deducted on their other income in accordance with this section will not be required to make provisional tax payments in the 1985/86 income year. Instead their first payment will be a 1/3 instalment due on 7 August 1986, based on the specified income of the national superannuitant in the 1985/86 income year reduced by the amount of his/her specified exemption. The 1985/86 terminal surcharge will still, however, be payable and this is due by 7 February 1987 together with the 2/3 provisional surcharge balance. Superannuitants should therefore be advised of this "doubling up" which would occur at that time under this option.

The proviso therefore provides a treatment which is similar to that where a taxpayer becomes a provisional taxpayer for the first time and gets a deferral advantage in the first year with a "doubling up" of tax payments in the second.

The proviso however goes further than this. It not only relieves national superannuitants from liability to pay the surcharge as provisional tax in the 1985/86 income year but also relieves any other national superannuitant from liability to pay the surcharge as provisional tax where he is able and does, in any future income year, elect to pay the surcharge under this section for the first time. Where, for example, a national superannuitant pays the surcharge on a provisional tax basis in one year, as deductions against his gross national superannuation in the second year, and on a provisional tax basis again in the third year, he will _not_ be able to obtain the deferral advantage in respect of that third year.

### Section 336J - Surcharge Deductions from Source Deduction Payments

As spelt out in section 336J(1) this section applies where a national superannuitant has elected in accordance with section 336F to have his surcharge liability paid by way of deductions from source deduction payments other than national superannuation. This option can only be selected only by a national superannuitant where his/her "other income" consists of source deduction payments only.

In such cases, the election is made by the national superannuitant specifying, along with his tax code for PAYE deduction purposes, a surcharge deduction code on each IR12 or other tax deduction certificate. There are four surcharge deduction codes used for this purpose - "SAJ", "MAJ", "MIN", or a special surcharge code, description of which appear in the commentary on section 336L. In simple terms the "SAJ" surcharge code allows a $120 per week ($6,240 per annum) exemption against the largest source deduction payment of national superannuitants who receive national superannuation at the single rate. The "MAJ" surcharge code allows a $100 per week ($5,200 per annum) exemption against the largest source deduction payment of national superannuitants who receive national superannuation at half of the married rate. The "MIN" surcharge code charges the 25 percent surcharge in full and should be used in respect of all source deduction payments except the largest one. The special surcharge code allows for the surcharge to be deducted at a special rate which is calculated by the Inland Revenue Department. It is expected that the main use for this surcharge code will be where a superannuitant's spouse has other income of less than $5,200. In those circumstances the superannuitant can qualify for a specified exemption of up to $10,400.

Section 336J(2) provides for the payer of any source deduction payment to a national superannuitant to make a surcharge deduction therefrom, in addition to the PAYE tax deduction, of an amount which corresponds with the relevant surcharge code.

Having made any such surcharge deduction, paragraph (b) of section 336J(2) then requires the payer of the source deduction payment to pay that deduction to the Commissioner as if it were a PAYE tax deduction. That is, surcharge deductions are included with tax deductions in each month and both are paid in on an IR66N by the 20th day of the following month.

Employers and other payers of source deduction payments can similarly include surcharge deductions and PAYE tax deduction together in their records. The IR12 tax deduction certificate returned to employees or other recipients of source deduction payments after 31 March (or earlier where for example, an employee ceases work) should show a gross figure and a PAYE deductions figure which incorporates both surcharge and tax deductions. These deductions will be set off against the combined total of income tax and surcharge assessed in the superannuitant's annual tax return.

An important point to note in relation to surcharge deductions being made from source deduction payments using the "SAJ, "MAJ", and "MIN" surcharge codes is that where the largest source deduction payment is less than the specified exemption but total source deduction payments exceed the specified exemption, the full effect of the exemption cannot be obtained using the surcharge codes. In such cases, national superannuitants may ensure that they do not make overpayments of surcharge during the year by taking either of the following courses:

1.  electing to have surcharge deductions made from their gross national superannuation instead of against their "other income"; or
2.  applying for a special tax code in order to decrease the rate of PAYE tax payable on one or more source deduction payments to which the surcharge code "_min_" applies.

Similarly, an overpayment of surcharge may occur where there is a large source deduction payment which exceeds $22,657 (superannuitants who receive national superannuation at the single rate and are eligible for an exemption of $6,240) or $20,133 (those who receive the benefit at half the "married couple" rate and are eligible for an exemption of $5,200). This is because _the surcharge codes do not allow for cutting out the surcharge above the level_ at which the maximum surcharge is reached. National superannuitants may ensure that they do not overpay the surcharge during the year, by _also_ taking one of the two courses mentioned above.

A final point to note is that the surcharge codes do not take into account the section 105 standard deduction. In general, superannuitants will therefore be slightly _better off_, on a PAYE basis, where they have surcharge deductions made from their gross national superannuation rather than from their source deduction payments. (Refer to _Example A_ on page 37. They will however pay the same surcharge in the end of year assessment whichever method of surcharge payment is used.)

### Section 336K - Surcharge Deductions from Source Deduction Payments and Surcharge Paid as Provisional Tax

As spelt out in section 336K(1) this section applies where a national superannuitant has elected in accordance with section 336F to have his surcharge liability paid _both_ by way of deductions from source deduction payments (other than national superannuation) and as provisional tax on his/her specified income. This option can only be selected where a national superannuitant's "other income" comprises both source deduction payments and specified income (income other than source deduction payments).

Subsections (2) and (3) of section 336K specify the rule as to which class of income the specified exemption is to be applied against. That rule is that the exemption is to he allowed against the largest class (ie, the greater of total specified income and total source deduction payments).

_**Subsection (2)**_ deals with the situation where a national superannuitant's expected specified income is _larger_ than his expected source deduction payments (other than national superannuation). In such cases:

*   The specified exemption is deducted from the superannuitant's specified income and is thus reflected in his 1/3 and 2/3 "provisional tax" instalments. By virtue of the reference to section 3361 in subsection (2), the national superannuitant is however relieved from his obligation to pay "provisional tax" in the first year in which he is liable for the surcharge.
*   The surcharge code "MIN" which charges the full 25 percent deduction rate should he used in respect of all source deduction payments. Payers of the source deduction payments should make surcharge deductions at the appropriate rate and pay them to the Department as if they were tax deductions (the commentary on section 336J refers).

Subsection (3) deals with the situation where a national superannuitant's expected specified income is _equal to or less than_ his expected source deduction payments (other than national superannuation). In such cases:

*   The surcharge is payable on the national superannuitant's specified income in the same manner as provisional tax but no reduction in the specified income is allowed for that purpose.
*   The surcharge code "SAJ" or "MAJ" is used in respect of the largest source deduction payment (other than national superannuation) which allows the specified exemption against that source deduction payment, with the "MIN" surcharge code applying to all other source deduction payments (other than national superannuation). Payers of such source deduction payments should make surcharge deductions at the appropriate rates and pay them to the Department as if they were tax deductions (the commentary on section 336J refers).

It should be noted that in the situation of subsection (3) above, where the source deduction payment to which the "SAJ" or "MAJ" code applies is less than the specified exemption the full benefit of the exemption cannot be obtained. To avoid overpayment of surcharge deductions by national superannuitants in these cases, these superannuitants are advised to _either_ have the surcharge deducted against their gross national superannuation rather than against their "other income", OR to apply for a special tax code which will fix a lower rate of tax and surcharge.

### Section 336L - Application of Surcharge Codes Specified in Tax Code Declarations

This section specifies the surcharge codes which are to be used in making payments of a national superannuitant's surcharge liability by way of deductions from source deduction payments (other than national superannuation).

The four codes used for this purpose are specified in section 336L (1) as:

1.  "SAJ" code - This code allows on a pay period basis the benefit of the $6,240 single superannuitant "other income" exemption.
2.  "MAJ" code - This is the code which allows on a pay period basis the benefit of the $5,200 married superannuitant "minimum other income" exemption.
3.  "MIN" code - This is the code which does not allow an exemption on a pay period basis, with the result that the surcharge is deducted at a flat rate of 25 cents in the dollar.
4.  Special Surcharge Code - This is a code which may be used at the option of the superannuitant instead of using one of the codes described in (1) to (3) above. Its main use is expected to be in allowing married superannuitants to obtain on a pay period basis an exemption level of up to $10,400 per annum, (ie above the $5,200 and $6,240 minima).

It should be noted that the above codes are applicable only where a national superannuitant elects to pay the surcharge on his _other_ income. The "special surcharge code" in particular should not be confused with the special rate of PAYE deduction to be advised by Inland Revenue district offices to the Department of Social Welfare where a national superannuitant has elected to have the surcharge deducted from his/her national superannuation.

Surcharge deductions should be made at the appropriate rate for each _complete_ dollar of income on which the surcharge is payable.

For various pay periods, the specified exemption in terms of the "SAJ" code ($6,240 per annum) is allowed in accordance with subsection (1A) as follows:

| Pay/Period | Specified Exemption |
| --- | --- |
| 1 day | $24 |
| 1 week | $120 |
| 2 weeks | $240 |
| 3 weeks | $360 |
| 4 weeks | $480 |
| 1 month | $520 |

Where the "MAJ" code applies, subsection (2) provides that the specified exemption is as follows:

| Pay/Period | Specified Exemption |
| --- | --- |
| 1 day | $20 |
| 1 week | $100 |
| 2 weeks | $200 |
| 3 weeks | $300 |
| 4 weeks | $400 |
| 1 month | $433.34 |

### Section 336M - Application of Other Parts

This section is the general section which relates to the new Part XA all Parts of the principal Act, other than Part IV in so far as they are applicable and with any necessary modifications, as if the surcharge were income tax levied under section 38 of the principal Act.

This section is important in that it applies many provisions of the principal Act in conjunction with the new Part XA. The major areas those other provisions relate to are:

*   the furnishing of returns of income upon which surcharge assessments can be made;
*   the making of assessments and reassessments and the treatment of objections thereto (see also section 336E of the Act);
*   the due dates for payment of the surcharge in respect of surcharge deductions and surcharge payments made on a provisional tax basis and also in respect of the surcharge assessed in the end of year assessment;
*   procedures for recovery of the surcharge;
*   provisions allowing refunds or relief from the surcharge;
*   the penalty and offence provisions of the Act.

In all cases the application, of those other provisions to the surcharge is identical to their application to, as the context requires, income tax, tax deductions or provisional tax.

### The Legislation - Other Section 17 Subsections and Transitional Provisions

As already stated the new Part XA of the principal Act was introduced by subsection (1) of section 17 of the Income Tax Amendment Act 1984. In addition, subsections (2) to (4) of section 17 made amendments to sections 2, 57(1) and 356(1) respectively of the principal Act, consequential on the introduction of the surcharge. A transitional provision concerning implementation of the surcharge was enacted at section 5 of the Income Tax Amendment Act 1985.

**Section 17(2)**

This subsection inserts in section 2 of the principal Act a definition of "national superannuitant surcharge" or "surcharge". A comment on this amendment is included under the reference to that definition in the commentary on section 336A.

**Section 17(3)**

This subsection amends section 57(1) of the principal Act, (which relates to the allowing of rebates of income tax against amounts of income tax payable) to provide that in any case where the tax rebates of a national superannuitant exceed the income tax payable by him, the surplus rebates can be offset against any amount of surcharge assessed to the national superannuitant.

**Section 17(4)**

This subsection amends section 356(1)(a) of the principal Act to ensure that all persons liable for the surcharge in any income year are excluded from the definition of a "pay-period taxpayer".

The consequence of this is that all persons liable for the surcharge in any income year are required to furnish annual returns of income in respect of that year.

**Section 17(5)**

This subsection specifies the time of the coming into force, and the application subsection for section 17 of the Income Tax Amendment Act 1984, which differ from the general application provisions specified in section 2 of that amendment Act.

It provides that section 17 is to come into force on the day on which the Act receives the Governor-General's assent and is to apply on and from that day. It should be noted however that, so far as the new Part XA is concerned, the 1985/86 income year application date specified in section 336C(2) overrides the application date specified in section 17(5).

**Transitional Provision**

Section 5 of the Income Tax Amendment Act 1985 introduced a transitional provision relating to the implementation of the surcharge. This provision was necessary in order to cater for the short time available prior to 1 April 1985 in which to implement the surcharge and in particular the changes made to it in the Income Tax Amendment Act 1985.

Where a national superannuitant did not deliver to his employer ("employer" includes the Director-General of Social Welfare by virtue of the definition of "employer" in section 2 of the principal Act) by 1 April 1985 a new IR12 tax code declaration or special tax code certificate to apply in respect of the 1985/86 income year, then the employer could continue to make PAYE tax deductions using the tax codes in force on 31 March 1985 (instead of the "no declaration" rate) until the _earlier_ of 31 May 1985 or the date on which a new IR12 tax code declaration or special tax code declaration was so delivered.

This dispensation applied only to _national superannuitants_ (as defined in section 336A) and only where a new tax code declaration/special tax code certificate was not delivered to an employer _by reason of delay in ascertaining a_ _surcharge code_ for the superannuitant.

In all cases, after 31 May 1985, the "no declaration" rate is however to be used where a tax code declaration/special tax code certificate in respect of the 1985/86 income year was not supplied to an employer on or after that date.

### Foreign Social Security Pensions

This section details the treatment of certain social security pensions for the purposes of the surcharge.

### Background

At present a number of national superannuitants receive overseas pensions which are similar in form to the New Zealand national superannuation. In some cases, where the amount of the overseas pension exceeds national superannuation, the superannuitant receives the amount of the foreign pension only, with no payment of national superannuation. In such cases, since the foreign pension recipients do not receive national superannuation, they are not national superannuitants (as defined in section 336A) and thus are not affected by the surcharge.

In other cases, however, the overseas pension is less than national superannuation in which case the Department of Social Welfare pays the superannuitant a "top up" portion of national superannuation. The result in such cases is that the total payment of national superannuation and foreign pension, combined, is equal to the amount of national superannuation to which the superannuitant would be eligible had he not received the foreign pension. The most common example of this kind of pension is the United Kingdom national insurance pension which is paid through the Department of Social Welfare. Other similar overseas pensions are paid direct to the superannuitant with a top up portion of national superannuation being paid by the Department of Social Welfare.

**Foreign pension excluded from "other" income**

The Income Tax Amendment Act 1985 provides that the amount of any "specified foreign social security pension" is excluded from the definition of "other income". This ensures that national superannuitants receiving those foreign pensions have the same income thresholds as other superannuitants, before they are required to pay the surcharge.

**Calculation of net national superannuation**

However as the foreign pension is not national superannuation, the amount of a superannuitant's "net national superannuation", which represents the maximum amount of surcharge which is payable, is calculated using only the "topping up" portion of the national superannuation payment. This is to ensure that the surcharge will not in effect claw back a pension for which the superannuitant is independently eligible and which is not paid by the New Zealand Government.

**Types of foreign pension included**

As mentioned previously, "specified foreign social security pensions" include the following:

1.  United Kingdom National Insurance Pensions
2.  Canadian Old Age Security Pensions
3.  German Insurance Pensions
4.  Greek Old Age Pensions
5.  Italian Old Age Pensions
6.  Netherlands Old Age Security Pensions
7.  United States Retirement Insurance Benefits

**Other foreign pensions treated as "other income"**

All other types of foreign pension will form part of a national superannuitant's "other income" unless they have been specifically exempted from income tax. For example, war pensions paid from any foreign Government in respect of any disability or disablement attributable to or aggravated by service in the armed forces are exempt from tax pursuant to section 61(10) of the Income Tax Act and accordingly, since they are not included in a recipient's taxable income, they are not "other income" and thus are not liable for the surcharge. On the other hand, armed forces "service" pensions would be included as "other income" since they are simply related to employment in the same manner as the Government Superannuation Fund is in New Zealand.

**Examples**

1.  A single national superannuitant's income comprises:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| National Superannuation | $6,959 | ($5,000 foreign pension + $1,959 top up) |
| Salary | $12,000 |     |
|     | $18,959 |     |
| His taxable income | $18,959 - $52 (standard deduction) = $18,907 |     |
| His "other income" | $18,907 - ($1,959 - nil) - $5,000 (a - (b - c) - d) = $11,948 |     |

|     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| His surcharge liability is thus | ($11,948 | \-  | $6,240) | x 0.25 = $1,427 |
|     | other  <br>income |     | single  <br>exemption |     |

However, his "net national superannuation" calculated in accordance with the definition in section 336A is:

\= $1,959 - (Tax on $18,907 - Tax on ($11,948 + 5,000)) (a - (b - c))

\= $1,959 - ($5,459.31 - $4,812.84)

\= $1,312.53

The surcharge payable is $1,312.53 being the net national superannuation maximum. Together with tax deductions thereon he thus effectively loses the full amount of the "top up".

His "net national superannuation" (a - (b - c)) is:

\= $727 - (Tax on $12,212 - Tax on $(6,500 + $5,000))

\= $727 - ($3,249.96 - $3,015.00)

\= $492.04

The surcharge payable is $325. As this is less than his net national superannuation the superannuitant effectively retains a portion of his "top up".

**NB:** In this example, the standard deduction has been calculated at $14.54 this being 2 percent of the $727 top up payment. The standard deduction is not allowable against the interest or the foreign pension (which is not related to past employment) as neither constitutes income from employment in accordance with section 105 of the Income Tax Act.

2.  The income of a married national superannuitant (whose spouse derives income over $5,200) comprises:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| National Superannuation | $5,727 | ($5,000 foreign pension + $727 top up) |
| Interest (after $200 exemption) | $6,500 |     |
|     | $12,227 |     |
|     |     |     |
| His taxable income | $12,227 \- $14.54 (standard deduction) = $12,212.46 |     |
| His "other income"  <br>_\[(a \- (b \- c) \- d)\]_ | $12,212.46 \- ($727 \- $14.54) - $5,000 = $6,500 |     |

|     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| His surcharge liability is thus | ($6,500 | \-  | $5,200) | x 0.25 = $325 |
|     | other  <br>income |     | married  <br>exemption |     |

His "net national superannuation" (a - (b - c)) is: = $727 - (Tax on $12,212 - Tax on $(6,500 + $5,000)) = $727 - ($3,249.96 - $3,015.00) = $492.04 The surcharge payable is $325. As this is less than his net national superannuation the superannuitant effectively retains a portion of his "top up". NB:In this example, the standard deduction has been calculated at $14.54 this being 2 percent of the $727 top up payment. The standard deduction is not allowable against the interest or the foreign pension (which is not related to past employment) as neither constitutes income from employment in accordance with section 105 of the Income Tax Act.

Apportionments of "Other Income" and "Specified Exemptions" in certain cases where National Superannuation is received for part only of an income year
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(a) **General**

In the majority of cases, a national superannuitant will receive national superannuation throughout an entire income year. In such cases, his/her liability for the surcharge is calculated by taking into account his/her "other income" for the _full_ year and his/her specified exemption for the full year.

In other cases however, national superannuation may be received for part only of an income year. In same circumstances the "other income" and "specified exemption" will be apportioned in relation to the number of pay periods in respect of which national superannuation is payable. In other cases the "other income" derived during the whole of the year, and the full amount of the "specified exemption" will be used to calculate the surcharge.

The following list shows the basis for the calculation of the surcharge in various circumstances.

| "Full Year" cases |     | "Part Year Apportionment" cases |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1.  | National superannuation paid in respect of the full income year | 1.  | Superannuitant reaches age 60 during the income year |
| 2.  | Superannuitant temporarily departs from New Zealand during the income year (or returns to New Zealand after having temporarily departed) | 2.  | Superannuitant meets residential requirements during the income year |
| 3.  | Superannuitant refuses to accept or does not apply for, while eligible, national superannuation | 3.  | Superannuitant dies during the income year |
| 4.  | Superannuitant is in a penal institution | 4.  | Superannuitant permanently departs from New Zealand during the income year |
| 5.  | Superannuation received for part of the year although entitled to receive it for the full year. |     |     |

(b) **Other Income Apportionments**

The determination by the Commissioner of the sources from which a superannuitant derived income during _only_ the period in respect of which national superannuation _was_ payable (item "e" of the other income apportionment formula) and of the sources from which a superannuitant derived income during _only_ the period in respect of which national superannuation was _not_ payable (item "g" of the other income apportionment formula), will depend upon the circumstances of each case.

For such determinations the general rules are:

1.  Salary and Wages/Superannuation
    *   The general rule is that where income from an employer or a superannuation fund is paid during an income year and
        *   A - the income is paid during a _part_ of the income year where national superannuation was not also being paid at any time during that part, that income will comprise item "g";
        *   B - the income is paid during a _part_ of the income year where national superannuation was also being paid at all times during that part, that income will comprise item "e";
        *   C - the income is paid either for the full income year or during a part of the income year in any case other than those above (ie where national superannuation was paid both at some time during that part and at some time outside that part), that income will comprise neither item "e" nor item "g". (It will thus form part of the "d - e - g" residue).

The following example illustrates the general rule (but see the exception below): Mr M turns 60 and consequently becomes a national superannuitant on 1 July. His income for the year ending on the following 31 March is as follows:

| Employer's Name | Period Employed | Gross Earnings |
| --- | --- | --- |
| G Packers Ltd | 1/4/85 to 30/6/85 | $3,950 |
| RSA | 1/4/85 to 15/7/85 | $ 817 |
| DSW (Nat Super) | 1/7/85 to 31/3/86 | $5,081 |

During the year additional income derived was:

1.  Investment income (net of exemption) $5,500
2.  Backpay from G Packers Ltd not included in original IR12 $2,200

In determining the amount of "other income" for surcharge purposes:

1.  Income from wages from G Packers Ltd is not included as this was derived from a source from which no income was derived after the taxpayer became a national superannuitant.
2.  The backpay, although received after 1 July is deemed to have been received before 1 July as provided for under section 336B(3) and is therefore not included in "other" income.
3.  The investment income is apportioned on a "pay day" basis (see below).
4.  Income from wages from RSA is also apportioned, as income from this source was derived both before and after the taxpayer became a national superannuitant. The "other income" thus calculated in accordance with the following formula is thus:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| (d - e - g) x f | \+ e (Section 336B(2)) |
| h   |

**where**

|     |
| --- |
| d = $12,415 (all income except national superannuation less the $52 standard deduction) |     |
| e = nil |     |
| g = $6,150 (wages and backpay G. Packers Ltd $3,950 + $2,200) |     |
| f = 20 (national superannuation pay days after 1 July) |
| h = 26 (pay days in the full year) |     |

Hence "other income" is

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| ($12,415 \-0\-$6,150) x 20 | + 0 |
| 26  |
| \= $4,819.23 |     |

It should be noted that the salary or wage payable from EACH employer is treated as a separate source of income.

**Exception**: In respect of item "c" in the general rule above, where a superannuitant can show what portion of a salary/wage was derived while he was also receiving national superannuation and correspondingly the portion derived while he was not receiving national superannuation, AND it is to the superannuitant's advantage, the respective portions can be treated as comprising item "g" and item "e" rather than forming part of the "d - e - g" residue.

If in respect of the same example above, Mr M had advised the Department that of his $817 salary from the RSA only $117 was derived after he qualified for national superannuation on 1 July (and he had a letter from the RSA supporting this), his "other income" would then be:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| ($12,415 - 117 - $6,850) x 20 | \+ 117 |
| 26  |
|     |     |

|     |
| --- |
| where |     |
| d = $12,414 (all income except national superannuation less the $52 standard deduction) |     |
| e = $117 (R.S.A.) |     |
| g = 20 (pay days after 1 July) |     |
| h = 26 (pay days in the full year) |     |

2.  Income Other than from Salary and Wages
    *   In respect of each source of income (all interest is treated as one source, all dividends as one source, all rents as one source, all business income as one source), the general rule is that where income from that source is derived during an income year and
        *   D - the income is derived during a _part_ of the income year where national superannuation was not also being paid at any time during that part, that income will comprise item "g";
        *   E - the income is derived during a _part_ of the income year where national superannuation was also being paid at all times during that part, that income will comprise item "e";
        *   F - the income is derived either throughout the full income year or during a part of the income year in any case other than those above (ie where national superannuation was paid both at some time during that part and at some time outside that part), that income will comprise neither item "e" nor item "g". (It will thus form part of the "d - e - g" residue).

As each type of income (interest, dividends, rents, business income) is treated as being a separate source, in most cases such income will comprise neither item "e" nor item "g" in accordance with item "f" above. As a general rule then, it will be only where all accounts or all shareholdings or all properties or all businesses are "sold" or "purchased" that a separation into item "e" or item "g" could be considered. **Exception**: Where a superannuitant can show what portion of each source (for example, dividends from individual companies) was derived while he was also receiving national superannuation and correspondingly the portion derived while he was not receiving national superannuation _and_ it is to the superannuitant's advantage, the respective portions can be treated as comprising item "g" and item "e" rather than forming part of the "d - e - g" residue.

_**Specified Exemption Apportionments**_

The formulae used in apportioning a superannuitant's specified exemption are contained in section 336BA. A full commentary on these formulae and when they should be used is contained on pages 9 to 14.

### Lump Sum Payments of National Superannuation

The Department of Social Welfare may on occasions pay backdated payments of national superannuation.

For income tax purposes the national superannuation is taxable in the year in which it is received. The same interpretation will be used for the purposes of the national superannuitant surcharge.

This affects the calculations of "net national superannuation" and "other income". The gross level of national superannuation which constitutes items "a" and "b" in the calculation of "net national superannuation" and "other income" respectively is the total of payments of national superannuation PAID in that income year. When calculating the taxable income figure (item "a" in the "other income" formulae) any payments received in the income year (and therefore liable to income tax in that year) but paid in respect of any other income year _should_ be included.

### Returns of Income Covering Periods Other than 12 Months Owing to a Change in Balance Date

In those cases where a superannuitant, with the Department's approval, changes his balance date with the result that a return of income for a period other than 12 months is furnished, the superannuitant's "other income" and "net national superannuation" calculations need no adjustment as in both cases each relates to the period covered by the non 12-month return of income. The superannuitant's "specified exemption" will however be adjusted to reflect the number of pay days (within the other than 12-months period) in respect of which national superannuation was paid.

The following example illustrates the procedure to be followed:

**Example:**

Joe Farmer retires to the city and obtains the Commissioner's approval for a change of balance date from 30 June to 31 March. This results in a 9 month return of income for the year in which the change is made.

Joe was a single national superannuitant for the entire period and had invested the proceeds from the sale of the farm to derive the following income for the period 1/7/85 to 31/3/86:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Interest | $ 3,800 |     |
| Dividends | $ 4,400 |     |
| National Superannuation | $ 5,353 | (20 pay days) |
|     | $ 13,553 |     |

The surcharge is calculated as follows:

|     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| His taxable income | $13,553 | \-  | $52 - $200 | \= $13,301 |
|     |     |     | (standard  <br>deduction) | (interest/dividend  <br>exemption) |

**Note:** For _income tax_ assessment purposes tax is calculated on the income of $13,301 at the rate applying to an income of $17,734 (13,301 x 12/9)(section 16(6)) and any special exemption or section 50A to 55 rebates would need similar adjustments (section 16(4) and (5)).

(2) His "other income" _(a\-(b\-c)\-d)=_ $13,301\-($5,353\-$52) - 0 = **$8,000**

(3) His specified exemption =

|     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 6,240 | x   | 20  | \=$4,800 |     |
| 26  |
| (single  <br>exemption) |     |     | (assumes 26 pay  <br>days in year to 31/3/86) |     |
|     |
|     |     |     |     |     |

(4) His surcharge liability at 25 cents of each complete dollar of the excess of his other income over his specified exemption is:

|     |
| --- |
| 0.25 x ($8,000 - $4,800 |
| **\=$800** |

(5) His net national superannuation (a - (b - c)) =

|     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $5,353 | \-  | (Tax rate on $13,301  <br>as rate for $17,734 | \-  | Tax on $8,000  <br>at rate for $10,666 |
| $5,353 - ($3,804.08 \- $2,054.96) |     |     |     |     |     |
| \= $3,603.88 |     |     |     |     |     |

(6) His surcharge payable is thus $800, this being less than his net national superannuation maximum.

**Notes:**

1.  The procedures followed in the above example are used in respect of other than 12-month surcharge assessments resulting from _changes in balance date only._ Other than 12-month assessments arising from, for example, returns to date of death or date of permanent departure from New Zealand are subject to the "other income" and "specified exemption" apportionment provisions outlined in sections 336B and 336BA.
2.  If, in the above example, Joe Farmer had been entitled to the maximum $1400 life insurance/superannuation special exemption, his entitlement to that exemption would need to have been proportionately decreased to 9/12 (1400) = $1,050. His taxable income in (1) would thus be reduced to $12,251, his "other income" in (2) would be reduced to $6,950 and his surcharge liability in (4) would then be 0.25 x ($6,950 - $4,800) = $537.50. His net national superannuation in (5) would similarly require adjustment.

### Amount of salary or wages on which tax and/or surcharge deductions are calculated where payments to a superannuation fund are made

Where deductions for superannuation contributions are made from an employee's salary or wages the deduction is, for tax deduction purposes, limited to $22.07 in the case of a weekly pay period, in accordance with section 341 of the Income Tax Act 1976.

For pay periods exceeding 1 week the deduction is limited to:

*   $46.14 for fortnightly pay periods
*   $69.21 for three weekly pay periods
*   $92.28 for four weekly pay periods
*   $99.27 for monthly periods

This limitation applies for national superannuitant surcharge purposes where a national superannuitant elects to pay the surcharge on his "other income" and that other income comprises salary or wages.

However, while the same superannuation contribution limitations are taken into account, it should be noted that a difference arises between the PAYE tax and surcharge deduction methods in relation to the treatment of the $52 standard deduction. While the standard deduction is taken into account in the deduction amounts shown in the normal PAYE tax deduction tables (IR184X, IR184Y and IR184Z) and while the deduction amounts shown in the supplementary PAYE tax and surcharge deduction tables (IR184NS) are calculated using the same PAYE figures as a base, the amount added to them as a surcharge deduction, in accordance with the amount specified in section 336L, ignores the standard deduction.

The following example, which is contained in the IR184NS tables applying from pay periods ending on or after 1 April 1985, illustrates the correct procedure to be followed by an employer in making tax/surcharge deductions from the amount of salary or wages payable to a national superannuitant who has specified a tax code and a surcharge code in respect of that income (ie the surcharge is to be paid by way of deductions from the national superannuitant's other income).

**Example**

Basic weekly pay $350.00; overtime $18.80 and shift allowance $12.00; superannuation contribution $35.00 (approved fund); tax code G; surcharge code MAJ.

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
|     | Tax Purposes | Actual |
| Basic weekly pay | $350.00 | $350.00 |
| Plus overtime | 18.80 | 18.80 |
| Plus shift allowance | 12.00 | 12.00 |
| GROSS EARNINGS | $380.80 | $380.80 |
| Deduct current superannuationfund contribution (limited for tax deduction purposes) | 23.07 | 35.00 |
|     | $357.73 | $345.80 |
| TAX TO BE DEDUCTED AT CODE G MAJ (on $357.73) |     | $166.73 |
|     |     | $179.07 |
| Add non-taxable allowances (such as tool money), if any |     | 4.50 |
| NET PAYMENT TO EMPLOYEE SUPERANNUITANT | $183.57 |     |

### Further Information

If further information is required two booklets are available from local tax offices. "Income Tax Surcharge on National Superannuation" (IR262) deals with the deduction of the surcharge from national superannuation, while "Surcharge Codes for National Superannuitants" (IR262A) sets out information for superannuitants who elect to have the surcharge deducted from other income.

### Examples

**Example A**

A single national superannuitant expects that his income in the year ending 31 March 1986 will be:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| National Superannuation (full year) | $6,959.16 |
| Government Superannuation | $12,000.00 |
| Interest and dividends (net of exemption) | $4,000.00 |
|     | $22,959.16 |

The first step is to determine whether he is liable for the surcharge. To do this it needs to be known whether his "other income" exceeds the specified exemption (section 336D(1)). As he is in receipt of national superannuation at the single rate, the specified exemption is $6,240.

As national superannuation is to be received for the full year, "other income" is determined in accordance with section 336B(1) as:

(Taxable income - (Gross national superannuation - Standard deduction entitlement) - specified foreign social security pensions)

\= $22,907.16 - (6,959.16 - 0) - 0

\= $15,948

As this exceeds the $6,240 specified exemption the superannuitant is liable for the surcharge. His liability for the surcharge as calculated in accordance with section 336D(1) is:

(Other income - $6,240) x 25 percent

\= (15,948 - $6,240) x 0.25

\= 9,708 x 0.25

\= $2,427.00

In accordance with section 336D(3) however, the annual surcharge cannot exceed the amount of the national superannuitant's net national superannuation. This is calculated under section 336A as:

(Gross national superannuation - (tax payable on taxable income-tax payable on taxable income other than national superannuation))

\= $6,959.16 - (tax on 22,907.16 - Tax on 15,948.00))

\= $6,959.16 - (6,779.31 - 4,482.84)

\= 4,662.69

As the surcharge liability is less than the net national superannuation, the liability remains at $2,427.

The next step is to consider the options which the national superannuitant has for paying that surcharge liability. As the other income comprises both a source deduction payment (government superannuation) and specified income (interest and dividends) the national superannuitant's options (as spelt out in section 336F(2)(c)) are to pay the surcharge:

(1) by way of deductions against gross national superannuation; or

(2) both by way of deductions from government superannuation and as provisional tax on his interest and dividends.

_**If option (1) is chosen**_, the superannuitant is required to inform the Commissioner of his estimated income detailed above on a form entitled "Application to have Surcharge Deducted from National Superannuation" (IR23S) and also forward to the Commissioner his tax deduction certificate(IR12) in respect of national superannuation to be payable to him by the Department of Social Welfare. (Sections 336H(1) and 336H(2)). Section 336H(3) then requires the Commissioner to determine the amount of the surcharge deduction to be made from gross national superannuation and to advise the Department of Social Welfare accordingly.

The surcharge deduction to be determined by the Commissioner would simply be the surcharge liability ($2,427) divided by the number of pay days in the 1985/86 year (26). The amount is thus $93.34 per fortnight.

If the national superannuitant has also correctly self-coded his tax code, for his national superannuation, at the secondary rate the PAYE deduction required on the national superannuation is calculated as the gross fortnightly payment ($267.66) multiplied by the secondary tax rate (0.33) = $88.32

The combined surcharge and PAYE tax deduction required to be deducted from each $267.66 fortnightly payment is thus $181.66 so that the national superannuitant receives $86.00.

_**If option (2) is chosen**_, then section 336K(3) is applicable since the national superannuitant's expected source deduction payment (government superannuation) exceeds his expected specified income (interest and dividends). Under that subsection, the surcharge is payable:

(a) on his specified income as if it were provisional tax (section 336K(3)(a)), but by virtue of the proviso to section 336I, no surcharge will be payable on a provisional basis in the first year. The terminal surcharge liability on that $4,000 of interest and dividends (assuming that is the amount of interest and dividends actually derived) equals $1,000 (25 percent) and, is due by 7 February 1987.

(b) on his source deduction payment (government superannuation) the "SAJ" surcharge code is used (section 336K(3)(b)(i)).

As government superannuation is paid four-weekly, the amount of the source deduction per four weeks is calculated, in accordance with section 336L(2)(b), as:

(four-weekly payment - 480 (4 week exemption entitlement)) X 0.25

\= (923.07 - 480) x 0.25

\= $110.76

The surcharge paid annually from this source would thus be $110.76 x 13 = $1,439.88. The surcharge thus paid from both (a) and (b) is $2,439.88.

Comparing the two options, it can be seen that there is a difference in the surcharge paid on an annual basis of $12.88. This arises from a combination of a rounding difference of $0.12 and a $13.00 difference ($52 x 0.25) since the surcharge codes do not take into account a standard deduction entitlement.

Credit for the above excess ($12.88) which represents an overpayment of surcharge will in effect be given when the annual return of income is furnished as part of the annual "square up".

**Example B**

A single national superannuitant knows that halfway through the 1985/86 year he will turn 60 and will stop work. At that time he expects to apply for national superannuation. He has estimated his income in that year to be:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| National superannuation (13 pay days) | $3,479.58 |
| Employment (6 months) | $13,000.00 |
| Interest and Dividends (net of exemption) | $18,000.00 |
|     | $34,479.58 |

The first step is to determine whether he is liable for the surcharge. To do this it needs to be known whether his "other income" exceeds the apportioned specified exemption.

As national superannuation is to be received for part only of the year by reason of the national superannuitant reaching age 60, the national superannuitant's other income is determined, in accordance with section 336B(2), as:

|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (d) | \-  | (e) | \-  | (g) | x   | (f) |
| (Other income  <br>as determined in  <br>s 336B(1) | income while  <br>on N/S | income while  <br>not N/S | No. of pay days  <br>where N/S received |
| No. of pay days in year (h) |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| +   | Income while on N/S(e) |     |     |     |     |     |
| \=  | (Taxable income - (Gross N/S - Standard Deduction entitlement) - 0 - 13,000 x 13 |     |     |     |     |     |
|     | 26  |     |     |     |     |     |
| +   | 0   |     |     |     |     |     |
| \=  | (34,427.58 - (3,479.58 - 0) - 13,000 x 0.5 |     |     |     |     |     |
| \=  | $8,974 |     |     |     |     |     |
| The superannuitant's specified exemption, under section 336BA, is calculated as: |     |     |     |     |     |     |
|     | Number of pay days where N/S received |     |     |     | x $6,240 |     |     |
|     | Number of pay days in year |     |     |     |
| \=  | 13  | x $6,240 |     |     |     |     |
|     | 26  |     |     |     |     |
| \=  | $3,120 |     |     |     |     |     |     |

As the "other income" ($8,974) exceeds the apportioned exemption level, the national superannuitant is liable for the surcharge. His liability for the surcharge is calculated in accordance with section 336D(2) as:

(apportioned other income) - specified exemption) x 25 percent

\= (8,974 - 3,120) x 0.25

\= $1,463.50

In accordance with section 336D(3), however, the annual surcharge cannot exceed the amount of the national superannuitant's net national superannuation. This is calculated under section 336A as:

(gross national superannuation - (tax payable on taxable income - tax payable on taxable income other than N/S))

\= ($3,479.58 - (Tax on 34,427.58 - Tax on 30,948.00))

\= ($3,479.58 - (12,208.54 - 10,256.82))

\= $1,527.86

As the surcharge liability is less than the net national superannuation, the liability remains at $1,463.50.

The next step is to consider the options which the national superannuitant has for paying that surcharge liability. As the other income comprises specified income (interest and dividends) only, the national superannuitant's options (as spelt out in section 336F(2)(a)) are to pay the surcharge:

(1) by way of deductions against gross national superannuation; or

(2) as provisional tax in respect of his specified income.

_**If option (1) is chosen**_, the superannuitant is required to inform the Commissioner of his estimated income, detailed above, on a form entitled "Application to have Surcharge Deducted from National Superannuation" (IR23S) and to forward to the Commissioner his tax code deduction certificate in respect of national superannuation to be payable to him by the Department of Social Welfare (IR12) (sections 336H(1) and 336H(2)). Section 336H(3) then requires the Commissioner to determine the amount of the surcharge deduction to be made from gross national superannuation and to advise the Department of Social Welfare accordingly.

The surcharge deduction to be determined by the Commissioner would simply be the surcharge liability ($1,463.50) divided by the number of pay days for which the national superannuitant can receive national superannuation (13). The amount is thus $112.57 per fortnight.

If the national superannuitant had also correctly self-coded his tax code for his national superannuation at the "G" code, the PAYE deduction required on the gross fortnightly payment ($267.66) of national superannuation is $57.10.

The combined surcharge and PAYE tax deduction required to be deducted from each $267.66 fortnightly payment is thus $169.67 so that the national superannuitant receives $97.99.

_**If option (2) is chosen**_, then section 336I(2) is applicable. Under that subsection, the surcharge will be payable on the national superannuitant's specified income as if it were provisional tax. The superannuitant's specified exemption is allowed against his specified income. The proviso however means that no surcharge is payable on a provisional basis in the first year. The terminal surcharge liability on $5,854 (8,974 - 3,120) of interest and dividends (assuming that it is the amount of interest and dividends actually derived), which equals $1,463.50 (25 percent), would be due by 7 February 1987.

### National Superannuitant Surcharge Decision Model

**Note:**

1.  If you receive National Superannuation for part only of the year see your nearest Inland Revenue Office.
2.  If you receive "Other Income" in excess of $5,200 in a year you must furnish a return of income. You need also furnish a return if your spouse wishes to claim an increased exemption based on your income.

Income Tax Amendment Act 1986
=============================

Archived legislative commentary on the Income Tax Amendment Act 1986 from PIB vol 146, May 1986.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 146, May 1986

[More information about _Public Information Bulletins_.](/about/about-our-publications)
 

Motor Vehicle Expense Claims
----------------------------

In April we sent practitioners a note explaining the new requirements relating to motor vehicle expense claims and particularly the record keeping rules. These changes first apply for the 1987 income year. The text of the Commissioner's note is set out below.

The "Tax Practitioner's Handbook for 1986" is not affected by the changes notified in April. The handbook contains on pages 18 and 19 the rules relating to the 1986 year, the last one on the old basis.

### TEXT OF COMMISSIONER'S APRIL ADVICE TO AGENTS.

Motor Vehicle Record Keeping Requirements
-----------------------------------------

### Introduction

The purpose of this notice is to inform you of the legislation contained in clause 16 of the Income Tax Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1985 which sets out new record keeping requirements for motor vehicles. From 1 April 1986 all self-employed persons and private companies will be required to keep records relating to:

*   the business use of any vehicle that is not used wholly for business purposes throughout the year; and
*   the total of all travel by the vehicle during the year.
*   If these records are not kept, the amount of vehicle expenses and depreciation which may be claimed for tax purposes will be limited to a maximum deduction of 25 percent.

When enacted, the new provisions will first apply for the income year commencing 1 April 1986 (or equivalent accounting year). For this reason details of the practical application are being conveyed to you now to enable you to comply with the new requirements when they come into force. The full text of the proposed legislation is set out in the Appendix to this circular.

### What is the effect of this new requirement?

Any future claim for motor vehicle expenditure and depreciation must be made factually on the basis of actual business use of the vehicle as supported by records. Estimations of business/private use adjustments will no longer be acceptable.

### Who will be affected?

The legislation will apply in respect of any road vehicle used by:

*   A self-employed person (this will include a partnership)
*   A private company in which any person is a "major shareholder" as defined. (Refer to the Appendix to this circular.)

Some self-employed taxpayers (e.g. doctors, farmers) have had special rules in the past regarding the apportionment between business and private use of motor vehicles. For and from the income year commencing 1 April 1986 these special rules of apportionment for motor vehicle expenditure and depreciation will no longer apply.

### When does it apply?

It applies for and from the income year commencing 1 April 1986, or equivalent accounting year. Taxpayers with early balance dates will not be required to maintain these records in respect of travel undertaken prior to 1 April 1986. In these cases the actual figures for the period from 1 April 1986 should be used as a basis for the apportionment of the expenditure and depreciation for the whole year.

### Vehicles for which records need to be kept

Records are required to be kept for each road vehicle of the business that is not used wholly for business purposes. (Use in providing a fringe benefit to an employee will be treated as business use where that private use constitutes a fringe benefit in terms of the fringe benefit tax legislation.) If the vehicle is used 100 percent for business purposes, a separate record of business use is not required.

### What records need to be kept?

The clause in the Bill now before Parliament says "... complete and accurate details relating to the distance travelled by any motor vehicle ..." must be kept in respect of:

*   the business use of the motor vehicle during the year, where that vehicle is not used wholly for business purposes and
*   the total distance travelled by that motor vehicle during the year.

A log book or similar record showing for each business related journey

*   The distance travelled.
*   A brief description of the purpose of the journey

would meet this requirement.

In addition the odometer reading will be required to be recorded at the beginning and end of the income year to give the total distance travelled by the vehicle in the year.

Where the vehicle is used wholly for business purposes, a separate record of business travel will not be required. However, where there is the possibility of any private use of the motor vehicle, the taxpayer should maintain a separate record.

This record keeping requirement is in addition to the existing requirement to maintain records of expenditure.

### What if there is more than one purpose for a journey?

The predominant purpose should be shown.

### What will happen if these records are not kept?

If these records are not kept and the vehicle is not used 100 percent for business purposes, the claim for motor vehicle expenditure and depreciation will be limited to 25 percent of the total expenditure and depreciation in respect of that vehicle.

If a vehicle is not used for business purposes at all, no deduction will be permitted.

### How will the claim for expenses and depreciation be calculated?

For and from the income year commencing 1 April 1986 (i.e.: 1986/87 income year) any claim for motor vehicle expenditure and depreciation will be required to be made factually on the basis of the actual business use of the vehicle.

For example:

|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Total business use of vehicle taken from log book |     |     |     |     |     | 15,000 km |
| Total use of vehicle |     |     |     | odometer at 1.4.86 | 25,000 km |     |
| odometer at 31.3.87 | 45,000 km |     |
|     |     |     |     |     |     | 20,000 km |
|     |     |     |     | Total expenditure | $6,000 |     |
| Allowable deduction: |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| 15,000 | X   | 6,000 | \= $4,500 |     |     |     |
| 20,000 | 1   |     |     |     |

The claim for depreciation will also be limited to 3/4 of that calculated on the written down value of the motor vehicle.

### What evidence will be required to accompany the return of income?

The record of distance travelled (i.e. the log book or other prime record) will not be required to be sent with the annual tax return. The summarised details from it will be the basis of the claim for deductions. As with other business records it must be kept for a period of ten years and must be available at any time for inspection if requested.

Income Tax Amendment Act 1986
=============================

Archived legislative commentary on the Income Tax Amendment Act 1986 from PIB vol 147 May 1986.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 147, May 1986

[More information about _Public Information Bulletins_](/about/about-our-publications)
.

### Section 1 - Short Title And Commencement

_**Subsection (1)**_ of this section provides that this Amendment Act is to be known as the Income Tax Amendment Act 1986, and that it should be read with, and form part of, the Income Tax Act 1976. _**Subsection (2)**_ provides that the date from which the sections in this Act are to apply is the date on which this Act received the Governor-General's assent unless there is a different application date provided in the particular section. The Amendment Act was assented to on March 1986.

It is important to check the date of commencement when applying any of the sections of the Act. The commentary on each provision makes particular mention of the application dates.

### Section 2 - Definition - "Expenditure On Account Of An Employee"

Section 2 amends the definition of the term "expenditure on account of an employee" in section 2 of the principal Act. (The effect of that definition is that where an employer makes a payment that comes within the definition of "expenditure on account of an employee" the amount concerned is deemed to be monetary remuneration of the employee and assessable in his or her hands.)

*   **Life Insurance Premiums** This amendment will exclude from that definition premiums of life insurance paid in respect of any group term insurance policy entered into by the employer. This confirms the original intent of the definition, and will have effect from 1 April 1985 being the date from which the definition first applied.
*   **Major Shareholders of Private Companies** This definition is also amended to ensure that where a private company incurs expenditure on behalf of a "major shareholder" (the definition of which is being inserted into section 336N of the principal Act by section 34(4) of this Amendment Act) who is also employed by the company, that expenditure will NOT be deemed to be "expenditure on account of an employee". Instead that expenditure will not be deductible by the company (because of the operation of section 106(1)(j) of the principal Act as amended by section 16 of this Amendment Act) and if that private company is also a "proprietary" company (as defined) that expenditure will be deemed to be a dividend to the shareholder if not repaid to the company. This amendment has effect from the income year that commenced on 1 April 1986, being the date from which all amendments relating to the fringe benefit tax treatment of shareholders of private companies have application.

### Section 3 - Meaning of Term "Dividends"

This section amends section 4(1) of the principal Act to ensure that as from the income year that commenced on 1 April 1986, where a private company provides a fringe benefit to a shareholder-employee who is not a "major shareholder", that benefit will not be treated as a dividend to the shareholder. This amendment is one of a number of amendments relating to the treatment of shareholder-employees for fringe benefit tax purposes. A full commentary on the new treatment of shareholders for fringe benefit tax purposes follows the commentary on section 34 of this Amendment Act.

### Section 4 - Meaning of Term "Source Deduction Payment"

This section amends section 6 of the principal Act to ensure that the exclusion of certain payments made by companies to shareholders from the definition of the term "source deduction payment" does not apply for fringe benefit tax purposes. The effect of this amendment, which has application from the income year that commenced on 1 April 1986, is to ensure that the provisions of subsections (2) and (3) of section 6, which exclude certain payments made to shareholder-employees from the definition of "source deduction payment" in that section, do not apply for the purposes of determining whether the recipient is an employee as defined in section 336N for fringe benefit tax purposes.

For a full commentary on the amendments relating to the treatment of shareholders for fringe benefit tax purposes, please refer to the commentary following section 34.

### Section 5 - Obligation To Pay Tax Where Objection Lodged

Section 5 extends the definition of the expression "day of determination of final liability" in section 34 of the principal Act to include a further two dates. The definition of "day of determination of final liability", which was inserted by section 7(1) of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 2) 1985, defines the cessation date of the period of deferral in respect of which one-half of the tax in dispute is able to be deferred. The "day of determination of final liability" is the day on which the right of the taxpayer to suspend payment of the amount of deferred tax expires. This definition has now been extended to include:

1.  The day on which the two month period, allowed to a taxpayer to exercise the right of further appeal following the formal disallowance of his or her objection by the Commissioner, expires.
2.  The day on which the Commissioner gives formal notice to the taxpayer that he has allowed the taxpayer's objection. Where the Commissioner gives notice that only part of the objection is allowed, the new "day of determination of final liability" provision relates to that part only.

This section applies from the original application date of the amended section 34 of the principal Act; it applies to any objection made on or after 1 April 1985.

### Section 6 - Interest on Certain Excess Tax

Section 6 amends the definition of the expression "qualifying tax in dispute" in section 34A(1) of the principal Act, to make it clear that a disputed credit of tax (for example an export tax credit) does qualify for the payment of interest where an objection to the determination of that credit has been found in the taxpayer's favour.

Previously the legislation, which was inserted by section 8(1) of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 2) 1985, required the existence of a "competent objection" for interest to be payable to a taxpayer where a dispute is resolved in his or her favour. The definition of "competent objection" specifically excludes "non-qualifying objections" and as a result excluded a determination of a credit of tax. The effect is that at present interest is not payable by the Commissioner where the dispute involves a credit of tax. This amendment corrects the position.

The section applies from the original application date of section 34A, being with respect to any objection made on or after 1 April 1985.

### Section 7 - Visiting Experts Rebate

This section terminates the right of any person to apply for approval as a visiting expert or a new and continuing enterprise in New Zealand under section 43 of the principal Act and therefore effectively commences the phase-out of the visiting experts rebate.

The visiting experts rebate is available in terms of section 43 only to persons or enterprises approved by the Minister of Finance or the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. The expression "approved" is defined in section 43(1) of the principal Act, and section 7 of this Amendment Act amends that definition. The amendment provides that no approval may be given unless ONE OR MORE of the following conditions is met:

1.  The application for approval was made in writing to the Commissioner on or before 20 August 1985 (this applies to applications for approval as a visiting expert or for approval of any enterprise or qualifying services); or
2.  The application for approval is made in writing to the Commissioner in respect of a PERSON who, on or before 7 November 1985, commenced a visit to New Zealand for the purpose of supplying services as a visiting expert (ie, services of the kind referred to in the definition of the expression "visiting expert" in section 43(1) of the principal Act); or
3.  The application is made in writing to the Commissioner in respect of a PERSON who, on or before 7 November 1985, had entered into a binding contract to provide services as a visiting expert (in this instance the visiting expert's visit to New Zealand must commence after 7 November 1985).

### Section 8 - Rebate In Respect of Gifts of Money and Payment of School Fees

This section amends section 56 A(2) of the principal Act which specifies the names of approved "overseas charities", donations to which are eligible for the charitable donations rebate for individuals and, consequentially, the deduction (under section 147 of the Tax Act) in calculating the assessable income of public companies.

_**Subsection (1)**_ of section 8 inserts the Rotary (District 992) Charitable Trust in that list of approved "overseas charities"

_**Subsection (2)**_ of section 8 provides that the application dates for qualifying donations to the Rotary (District 992) Charitable Trust will be:

*   For the purposes of the tax rebate under section 56A of the Tax Act, donations made in the 1986/87 income year (year ending 31 March 1987) and subsequent income years
*   For the purposes of the deduction allowable under section 147 in calculating the assessable income of a public company (as defined), the income year that commenced on 1 April 1986 (or equivalent accounting year) and subsequent income years (or equivalent accounting years).

### Section 9 - Special Exemption In Respect Of Life Insurance Premiums And Other Specified Contributions

This amendment corrects a drafting error in section 10(1) of the Income Tax Amendment Act 1984. Section 10(1) of the 1984 Amendment Act gave effect to the Government's decision to remove the special exemption for life insurance premiums paid on policies entered into after Budget night 1984. A new definition "policy of pension insurance" was introduced into section 59(1) of the principal Act to ensure that this type of pension policy continued to qualify for special exemption purposes.

Section 9 of this Amendment Act corrects the definition of the expression "policy of pension insurance" by removing the requirement that a policy of pension insurance satisfy the requirements of paragraph (d)(i) of the definition of the expression "policy of life insurance" in section 59(1) of the principal Act.

This amendment has effect from the first day of the income year that commenced on 1 April 1984 (ie, the 1985 tax year).

### Section 10 - Exemption of Dividends From Tax

Section 10 of the Amendment Act inserts a new section 63 in the principal Act (section 63 provides the exemption from income tax in New Zealand for the receipt of intercompany dividends).

The amendment gives effect to the Government's announcement in the l985 Statement on Taxation and Benefit Reform of its intention to stem an avenue for international tax avoidance. Such an opportunity to avoid tax could previously arise through an overseas company's ability to claim a deduction for expenditure which would also be exempt income in the hands of a New Zealand recipient company under section 63.

Section 10 provides that income derived by a New Zealand company by way of dividends on preference shares or interest on convertible notes will not be exempt from income tax in New Zealand where the related payment is deductible to the overseas company in any country outside New Zealand. The section applies with respect to dividends derived by New Zealand companies on or after 21 August 1985.

#### Subsection (1)

*   Repeals the existing section 63 and substitutes a new section.
*   _**Subsection (1)**_ of the new section defines income tax (for the purposes of section 63) as meaning any overseas tax which, in the opinion of the Commissioner, is substantially of the same nature as New Zealand income tax imposed under Part IV of the Act. The definition is used only in relation to references in section 63 to income tax payable in any country or territory outside New Zealand. (For example, in subsections (3)(c)(ii) or (3)(d)(ii)).
*   _**Subsection (2)**_ provides an exemption from income tax in New Zealand of intercompany dividends derived by any New Zealand resident company or group investment fund. The only change is the insertion of the words "in New Zealand" after the words "other than from companies that are exempt from income tax". The inclusion of these words makes it clear that the fact that dividends have been received from an overseas company that is exempt from tax overseas does not affect the exemption of those dividends from New Zealand tax under subsection (2) when received by a New Zealand company.
*   _**Subsection (3)**_ provides that the exemption does not apply to:
    1.  dividends derived by a company in respect of the business of life insurance carried on by it.
    2.  dividends derived from any company where a deduction has been allowed for the dividends paid on certain preference shares pursuant to section 194 of the Income Tax Act 1976. These provisions are the same that applied previously under section 6. The new provisions, contained in paragraphs (c) and (d), are as follows:
    3.  The exemption provided by section 63(2) will no longer apply in respect of dividends derived from any non-resident company where:
        1.  The dividends are distributed by the company in respectany preference shares or shares that are substantially of the same nature as preference shares
        2.  Those dividends are, or were, allowable as a deduction in calculating any liability of that company to income tax in any country or territory outside New Zealand.
    4.  Provides that the exemption will (in future) not apply to income that:
        *   would not be income from dividends if it was not deemed to be a dividend by section 4(1) AND
        *   is derived from any non-resident company AND
        *   has been allowed as a deduction in calculating the distributing company's liability to income tax in any country or territory outside New Zealand.

Paragraph (d) applies to income of the kind which section 4(1) of the Income Tax Act deems to be a dividend but which is not a dividend within the ordinary meaning of the word.  
The following "dividends" come within this category:

*   Section 4(1)(e) - Interest on floating rate debentures and debentures issued in substitution for shares
*   Section 4(1)(f) - interest paid under a convertible note issue pursuant to an offer made by a company after 8 September 1960.
*   Section 4(1)(g) - A distribution by a unit trust to a unit holder.

*   **_Subsection (4_)** is designed to prevent taxpayers avoiding subsection 3(c) by routing payments through one or more overseas intermediary companies. The subsection provides that dividends derived by any non-resident company (the specified company) from any other company shall, upon their distribution by the specified company to any of its shareholders, be deemed to be dividends that come within the provisions of subsection (3)(c) if:
    *   they are distributed by that other company in respect of any of its preference shares, and
    *   they are allowable as a deduction in calculating any liability of that other company to income tax in New Zealand or in any country or territory outside New Zealand, and the income that was the source of the distribution was not subject to income tax in any country or territory outside New Zealand.

### EXAMPLES

The following examples illustrate the effect of the provision. For the purposes of these examples:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Company A | is a New Zealand company |
| Company B | is a 100% owned overseas associate company |
| Company C | is a 100% owned New Zealand associate company |
| Company D | is a 100% owned overseas company |
| Company A and Company C are not the same company. |     |

### Example 1

*   Company (A) makes a specified preference share distribution to Company (B) and is allowed a deduction under section 194 of the Income Tax Act 1976.
*   This distribution is not taxable to company (B) in its country of residence.
*   Company (B) distributes the amount received to Company (C) as an ordinary dividend. Without the provisions enacted in subsection (4), the receipt of the dividends by Company (C) from Company (B) would be exempt income, because the dividends were not distributed by Company (B) in respect of preference shares and were not deductible to Company (B). However, the provisions of subsection (4) deem the dividends to have been distributed by Company (B) in respect of preference shares and to have been allowable as a deduction to that company in calculating its overseas tax liability. Subsection (4) applies because the dividends derived by Company (B) from Company prior to their redistribution to Company (C), were distributed by Company (A) in respect of preference shares. were deductible to Company (A) and were not taxed as income of Company (B). The result is that the dividends are taxable income of Company (C).

### Example 2

Company (B) makes a preference share distribution to Company (D) and is allowed a deduction in calculating its liability to income tax. Company (D) is not taxable on the dividend received and pays the amount on as an ordinary dividend (for which it receives no tax deduction) to an overseas Company (100% owned by Company (C)) which then on-pays this amount as an ordinary dividend to Company (C).

This example differs from example (1) in that the preference shares distribution is made offshore and is passed through a series of intermediary companies prior to payment to Company (C).

In order to analyse these transactions, it is preferable to break them into their components and apply subsection (4) to each component transaction.

*   Company (B) makes a preference share distribution to Company (D)
*   Company (B) is allowed a deduction in calculating its liability to income tax.
*   Company (D) receives dividends which are not taxable in its hands.

Company (D) is not a New Zealand company and therefore for the purposes of subsection (4) is a "specified company". For the reasons explained in example 1, the specified company is DEEMED to come within the provisions subsection (3)(c) in respect of the distribution of dividends to an overseas company.

The next component, in the application of subsection (4), is as follows:

*   Company (D) has been deemed (as explained above) to have distributed a dividend in respect of preference shares to an overseas company.
*   Company (D) has been deemed (as explained above) to have been allowed a deduction, in calculating its liability to income tax overseas, for the dividend distributed to an overseas company.
*   The overseas company is not liable to income tax on the dividend in its country of residence.

This results in the overseas company, for the purposes of subsection (4), being a "specified company". As such this company is DEEMED to come within the provisions of subsection (3)(c) in respect of the dividends it distributes to Company (C).

The result is that Company (C) receives dividends that come within the provisions of subsection (3)(c) and as such those dividends are not exempt from income tax in New Zealand.

It is important to note that subsection (4) requires the Commissioner to be satisfied that each of the tests contained in the subsection are met, most importantly that the income that was the source of the dividends paid to the New Zealand company was itself a dividend that meets the conditions set out in the subsection. If the funds that comprise the dividends to the New Zealand company were derived from a number of sources only one of which meets the requirements of the subsection, then the subsection can only be applied to that one source. It can only be applied where it is clear that the dividends have been funded in a manner set out in the legislation and in practice it is expected this will occur only where associated companies are involved.

_**Subsection (5)**_ has a similar effect to subsection (4) in that it is designed to prevent taxpayers avoiding subsection (3)(d) by using intermediary companies. It provides that income derived by any non-resident company (the overseas company) from any other company shall, upon payment by the overseas company to any of its shareholders, be deemed to be income that comes within the provisions of subsection (3)(d) if:

*   The income derived by the overseas company that gave rise to the payment was allowable as a deduction to the person from whom it was derived by the overseas company (whether in New Zealand or overseas), and
*   The overseas company was not liable to income tax in any country or territory outside New Zealand in respect of that income.

### Example 3

*   Company (B) makes a convertible note issue to another overseas company (100% owned by Company (C)) and claims a deduction for the interest paid pursuant to the issue in calculating its liability to income tax.
*   The interest received by that overseas company is not liable to income tax in the overseas country of residence.
*   The overseas company then issues an ordinary dividend to its New Zealand shareholder, Company (C).

Subsection (5) provides that the income derived by the overseas company from Company (B), upon payment by the overseas company to its shareholder (Company (C)), is income that comes within the provisions of section 3(d). This is because:

1.  The income paid by Company (B) to the overseas company was an amount that was allowable as a deduction in calculating Company (B)'s liability to income tax; and
2.  The overseas company was not liable to income tax on that income.

Like subsection (4) the provision requires the Commissioner to be satisfied that each of the tests are met, most importantly, that the source of the "deemed dividend" paid to the New Zealand company was such that it meets the conditions set out in subsection (5). If the funds that comprise the "dividends" to the New Zealand company were derived from a number of sources only one of which meets the requirements of the subsection then the subsection can only be applied where it is clear that the dividends have been funded from that source. In practice it is expected this will occur only where associated companies are involved.

_**Subsection (2)**_ of section 10 makes consequential amendments.

_**Subsection (3)**_ provides that the provisions of the new section apply with respect to dividends and to other income derived by a New Zealand company on or after 21 August 1985.

### Section 11 - Profits or Gains From Land Transactions

This section amends section 67 of the principal Act, which deals with the profit or gains from land transactions.

This amendment ensures that when land is sold for a profit by a land developer and that profit has been enhanced by a rezoning betterment factor, the provisions of section 67(4)(ba) and its associated exemptions (s 67(5)) will apply and not section 61(4)(d) and its related exemptions (s 67(6) and s 67(7)).

This amendment will apply in respect of land sales on or after 27 March 7986.

### Section 12 - Gains and Losses Due to Exchange Variations In Respect of Repayment of Loans

Section 12 of the Amendment Act replaces subsection (1) of section 71.

Section 71 of the principal Act brings into account, for income tax purposes, realised exchange gains and losses arising on the repayment of certain business loans. This amendment ensures that exchange gains and losses continue to be taxable or deductible following the floating of the New Zealand dollar and the repeal of the Exchange Control Regulations 1978.

The floating of the New Zealand dollar on 4 March 1985 necessitated an amendment to the definition of "exchange variation". The definition previously made explicit reference to the "official exchange rate in New Zealand" which is no longer effectively ascertainable under New Zealand's floating exchange rate regime.

The repeal of the Exchange Control Regulations 1978 by the Exchange Control Regulations 1985 also necessitated an amendment to the definition of "loan". That definition previously specified certain preconditions in relation to money lent to or by any taxpayer. In particular, in certain instances, the consent of the Reserve Bank under the Exchange Control Regulations 1978 was required. With the repeal of the 1978 regulations the Reserve Bank consent is no longer required nor sought. The amended definition of "loan" makes provision for this change.

_**Subsection (1)**_

Subsection (1) of the amendment repeals and substitutes subsection (1) of section 71 of the principal Act. The amending subsection provides, for the purposes of section 71. new definitions of the expressions "exchange variation" and "loan".

The definition of "EXCHANGE VARIATION" sets out the method of determining whether an exchange fluctuation to which the section applies has occurred in relation to the repayment of certain loans (excluding interest). It defines the term as being any variation, caused by the fluctuation that occurs in the value of a currency of another country relative to New Zealand currency, between:

1.  The amount of the loan repayment, expressed in New Zealand currency at the time at which the repayment was made; and

3.  The amount, expressed in New Zealand currency, that would have been required to make that repayment on whichever is the later of 8 August 1975 or the time at which the loan was first made.

The amended definition of "LOAN" is made up of two components:

The first component, which is set out in paragraphs (a) and (b) of the definition relates to money lent to, or by, any taxpayer between 1 January 1974 and 22 January 1985 and makes specific reference to the Exchange Control Regulations 1978 which were in force during that period. These provisions are the same as those in the previous legislation.

The new component, which is set out in paragraphs (c) and (d), relates to money Lent. to or by, any taxpayer on or after 23 January 1985.

"Paragraph (c)" includes within the definition lendings to any taxpayer, on or after 23 January 1985, which are lent in an overseas currency and which are expressed to be repayable in an overseas currency. There is no requirement that the overseas currency borrowed must be an identical currency to the overseas currency in which repayment is to be made.

"Paragraph (d)" includes money lent by any taxpayer on or after 23 January 1985. The money lent must be expressed to be repayable in a currency other than New Zealand currency to come within the new definition.

_**Subsection (2)**_

Application date: The new section applies with respect to the repayment, in whole or in part, of any loan made to or by any taxpayer on or after 23 January 1985.

### Section 13 - Income Derived From Use or Occupation Of Land

Section 13 makes minor technical amendments to sections 74 and 111A of the principal Act. The effect of the two amendments is to provide that where qualifying forestry plant or machinery is transferred in accordance with a matrimonial agreement, the provisions of section 111A apply.

The amendments result from changes made to forestry taxation last year and therefore take effect from the effective date of those changes (9 November 1984).

### Section 14 - Excess Income On Sale of Livestock Where Farmer Forced To Quit Farm, or Farming Business Adversely Affected By Fire, Flood etc

This section amends section 94 of the principal Act which allows excess income from the forced sale of livestock, the forced sale occurring as a result of an adverse event, to be carried forward and set off against the purchase price of replacement livestock in the two years succeeding the year of sale. Section 94 also provides that:

*   If a further adverse event is declared before the end of the second income year the period for acquiring livestock can be extended for a third year:
*   In the event of further continuation of an adverse event, or the further occurrence of an adverse event, the Minister of Finance may by declaration extend or further extend the period in which the farmer may acquire replacement livestock.

The Amendment extends the provisions of section 94 to allow farmers affected by adverse events to offset the assessable income derived from forced sale of livestock either against the cost of certain capital assets or against the cost of replacement livestock. For this purpose, qualifying capital assets will be certain types of farming and agricultural plant and machinery, horticultural rootstock, and fodder storage buildings that are for use in farming.

This concession will be available to all farmers affected by occurrences that the Minister of Finance declares to be adverse events. It is designed to permit diversification following an adverse event.

_**Subsection (1 )**_ inserts into subsection (1) of section 94 a new definition, "qualifying expenditure".

"Qualifying expenditure" means any expenditure of a capital nature incurred by any taxpayer:

1.  In acquiring or installing any farming or agricultural plant or machinery for use wholly in a farming or agricultural business carried on by him on land in New Zealand but not including plant or machinery of the kinds referred to subsections (1)(b) and (c) and (2)(a) to (e) of section 122 of the principal Act, viz:
    1.  Plant and machinery used in performing services for a farmer on the land used by that farmer for farming or agricultural purposes, ie, agricultural contractors carrying out work on the farmer's land. (Subsection (1)(b)).
    2.  Plant and machinery used for:
        *   cartage of livestock; or
        *   cartage of fertiliser or lime to any farming property or the spreading of fertiliser or lime on the land; or
        *   loading of fertiliser or lime into agricultural aerial work aircraft; or
        *   the carrying of a vehicle designed for loading fertiliser or lime into agricultural aerial work aircraft and for carrying, in a permanently attached tank, aviation fuel for use in agricultural aerial work aircraft (and for no other purpose): or
        *   cartage of goods to and from any farming property. (Subsection (1)(c)).
    3.  Any motor car as defined in s 2(1) of the Transport Act 1962; but a utility-type four-wheeled drive vehicle used primarily and principally for farming or agricultural purposes DOES qualify; (subsection (2)(a)).
    4.  Cooking appliances; (subsection (2)(b)).
    5.  Office plant and machinery; (subsection (2)(c)).
    6.  Containers or other articles used for delivering goods; (subsection (2)(d)).
    7.  Plant for producing electric current or hydraulic power, unless for the use of qualifying plant; (subsection (2)(e)).
2.  In acquiring, erecting or extending any fodder storage building to be used wholly for the purposes of a farming business carried on by the taxpayer.
3.  In acquiring or planting any horticultural rootstock to be grown on the land in New Zealand on which the taxpayer carries on a farming or agricultural business.

_**Subsection (2)**_ repeals subsection (2)(d) of section 94 (except the provisos) and substitutes a new subsection (2)(d). The effect of this amendment is to extend the application of the section to include "qualifying expenditure" (as defined in subsection (1) above) incurred by farmers on or after the 5th of May 1985.

_**Subsection (3)**_ amends each of the provisos to subsection (2)(d) of section 94 to include the term "qualifying expenditure". This amendment is required as a consequence of extending the application of the section to assets other than livestock (refer subsection (2) above).

_**Subsection (4)**_ again extends the application of section 94 to include reference to "qualifying expenditure". This provision inserts the words "or the income year in which qualifying expenditure is incurred" after the words "retained by the taxpayer".

_**Subsection (5)**_ inserts new subsections (7), (8), (9), (10) and (11) into section 94 of the principal Act. These new subsections provide as follows:

_**Subsection (7)**_ provides that where a taxpayer has incurred "qualifying expenditure" the Commissioner shall allow a deduction in respect of the qualifying expenditure of an amount equal to the lesser of:

1.  the qualifying expenditure; or
2.  an amount equal to the assessable excess that is deemed, under subsection (3) of section 94, to have been derived in that income year.

_**Subsection (8)**_ provides that where any taxpayer has been allowed a deduction under section 94 in respect of the cost of any farming or agricultural plant or machinery. the amount allowed as a deduction is deemed to have been a deduction allowed in respect of depreciation. For the purposes of section 108 and section 112 the cost of that farming or agricultural plant or machinery is deemed to be reduced by the amount that has been so allowed as a deduction. This provision is subject to section 117 which provides for depreciation recovery where assets are sold.

_**Subsection (9)**_ provides for the situation where a taxpayer has been allowed a deduction under section 94 in respect of the cost of any fodder storage building and that building is sold or otherwise disposed of by the taxpayer within five years of the date of acquisition, erection, or extension. Under this provision the amount derived from the sale or disposition of the building is deemed to be assessable income derived by the taxpayer in the income year in which the building is sold or disposed of. The amount deemed to be assessable income is the lesser of:

1.  the sale price of the building;
2.  the amount of the deduction allowed under section 94 in respect of the cost of that building.

The second proviso to subsection (9) provides that the subsection has no application in any case where the building is transferred in accordance with a matrimonial agreement.

_**Subsection (10)**_ makes provision for those situations where "qualifying expenditure" is incurred in acquiring, erecting, or extending a fodder storage building and that building is subsequently transferred in accordance with a matrimonial agreement.

The subsection provides that the same rules apply as are set out in section 125(4B) and 125(4C).

The effect of paragraph (a) of subsection (10) is that where a person (the transferor) incurs expenditure of a capital nature in acquiring, erecting or extending any fodder storage building, and that asset is transferred to that person's spouse (the transferee) under a matrimonial agreement in the same year that the expenditure is incurred:

1.  The transferee is deemed to have acquired, erected or extended that building on the date on which it was acquired, erected or extended by the transferor.
2.  The transferee is deemed to have incurred expenditure of a capital nature in acquiring erecting or extending that building of an amount equal to that incurred by the transferor.
3.  The transferor will not be allowed a deduction in respect of the expenditure so incurred.

In other words, the new subsection 10(a) provides that in those cases where the fodder storage building is transferred by any person under a matrimonial agreement in the year in which that person incurs expenditure of a capital nature in acquiring, erecting or extending that building, that expenditure is deemed to have been incurred by the person to whom it is transferred on the date it was incurred by the transferor. Any deduction under section 94 is therefore available to the transferee only, the transferor being deemed not to have incurred the expenditure.

Paragraph (b) of the new subsection (10) caters for the situation where a deduction has been allowed to any person (the transferor) under section 94 in respect of a fodder storage building, and that building is subsequently transferred to a spouse (the transferee) under a matrimonial agreement. It provides that if the building is sold by the transferee within 5 years of the date of acquisition, erection or extension in respect of which a deduction was allowed to the transferor, the lesser of -

*   the sale price of the building, or
*   the amount allowed as a deduction to the transferor in respect of the cost of the building

is deemed to be assessable income of the transferee in the year of sale.

_**Subsection (11)**_ provides that every reference to an income year, in relation to those taxpayers who furnish returns of income under section 15 (balance dates other than 31 March), shall be deemed to be a reference to the accounting year corresponding to that income year, and in every such case section 94 shall, with any necessary modifications, apply accordingly.

_**Subsection (6)**_ of section 14 provides the application date. This amendment applies in respect of "qualifying expenditure" incurred on or after the 8th day of May 1985.

### Section 15 - Deduction For Expenditure or Loss Incurred In Providing Fringe Benefits To Minority Shareholders

This section inserts a new section, 105A, into the principal Act.

This new section permits a private company to claim a deduction of expenditure or loss incurred in respect of the costs of providing a benefit (whether or not that benefit constitutes a fringe benefit) to any employee of that company who is a shareholder of the company but is not a "major shareholder". (The term "major shareholder" has been inserted in section 336N(1) by section 34 of this Amendment Act.)

Section 105A has the effect of allowing a private company to claim an income tax deduction in respect of all expenditure incurred in providing benefits to shareholder-employees who are not "major shareholders", irrespective of whether or not the expenditure is incurred to provide a private benefit to the shareholder. It treats the expenditure incurred in providing a private benefit to these shareholder-employees in the same manner as if the benefit were provided to an employee who holds no shares. Such payments will in future be also exposed to fringe benefit tax.

It should be noted that the provision does not apply to benefits provided to shareholders who are not employees of the company. This is because its application is limited to expenditure or loss incurred in providing a benefit "that is or that would, but for the provisions of any of paragraphs (f) to (n) of the definition of the expression "fringe benefit" in section 336N(1) of this Act, be a fringe benefit within the meaning of that definition". To be such a fringe benefit, the benefit must be provided to an "employee" as defined in section 336N for fringe benefit tax purposes. If the shareholder in receipt of the benefit is not an "employee" as so defined, section 105A cannot apply.

The new section has effect from the income year that commenced on 1 April 1986.

A full commentary on the treatment of shareholder-employees for fringe benefit tax purposes follows the commentary on section 34.

### Section 16 - Certain Deductions Not Permitted

This section amends section 106(1)(j) of the principal Act which debars certain amounts from being deductible for income tax purposes. This amendment ensures that where a benefit (that is or that would have been a fringe benefit but for certain exemptions within the fringe benefit tax provisions) is provided to a "major shareholder", that expenditure is deemed to be expenditure of a private or domestic nature and not deductible for income tax purposes. This provision removes the argument that would otherwise exist, in certain cases where the shareholder is an employee, that such expenditure should be deductible to the company on the grounds that similar expenditure incurred in relation to employees who are not shareholders is deductible.

This section is one of a number of provisions that deal with the fringe benefit tax treatment of shareholders of private companies. It will have effect from the income year that commenced on 1 April 1986.

For a full commentary on the treatment of shareholder-employees for fringe benefit tax purposes, please refer to the notes following those on section 34.

### Section 17- Limitation of Deduction For Motor Vehicles Where Insufficient Records Kept

Section 17 introduces a new section, 106B, into the principal Act to limit the deduction allowable for motor vehicle expenditure and depreciation where the taxpayer does not maintain complete and accurate records of distances travelled for business purposes in a road vehicle that is also used for private purposes.

_**Subsection (1)**_ of section 17 inserts this new section 106B, discussed fully below.

_**Subsection (2)**_ provides that this section will apply with respect to the tax on income derived in the 1986/87 income year and every subsequent year. For practical purposes this means that as from 1 April 1986 taxpayers will be required to comply with the new record keeping obligations in order to be able to deduct fully the expenditure and depreciation applicable to the business use of the vehicle. (See later, under "Application of Section 106B" regarding taxpayers with early balance dates).

#### The New Section 106B:

_**Subsection (2)**_ of the new section 106B provides effectively that the section applies to the following "taxpayers" only:

*   Self employed persons (including partnerships); and
*   Private companies, where at any time during the income year any shareholder of the private company is deemed to be a major shareholder within the meaning of "major shareholder" in section 336N(1) of the principal Act.

**Note:** For details on which shareholders are deemed to be "major shareholders" of a private company, refer to the commentary on section 34 of this Amendment Act.

(Only self-employed persons and such private companies referred to above are "taxpayers" for the purposes of section 106B).

This section does not apply to employees in respect of their travelling expenses. They are covered by sections 73 and 105 of the principal Act and the Fourth Schedule to that Act.

_**Subsection (1)**_ of section 106B details the requirements of the new record keeping/deduction scheme. Claims for deduction of motor vehicle expenditure and depreciation must in future be capable of substantiation by both expenditure records and records of distances travelled.

#### The vehicles to which the "distances travelled" recording requirements apply:

*   The vehicles concerned are: Every motor vehicle that is a road vehicle, no matter where or how it is used, of the kind ordinarily used for:
    *   The carriage of persons; or
    *   The transport or delivery of goods or animals, of whatever class or kind.
*   Vehicles EXCLUDED are:
    *   Trailers
    *   Vehicles operated by persons who are not "taxpayers" within the meaning of subsection (2) - see above.
    *   Vehicles which, the Commissioner is satisfied, are used in the income year 100 percent for business purposes. (See below, for fuller explanation of this exclusion).

**Note:** Use for business purposes includes use in providing fringe benefits for employees.

#### The exclusion of a "100 percent business use" vehicle

Where the vehicle is to be used during the income year wholly for business purposes the taxpayer will not be required to maintain records of distances travelled in that vehicle. However, where there is a possibility that a vehicle will be used for non-business purposes at some time in an income year, complete distance records will need to be maintained at all times in that year. Failure in this regard will expose the taxpayer to the risk of the 25 percent maximum deduction applying in relation to that vehicle.

A vehicle satisfies the "100 percent business use" test where the only "private" use in the income year is by an employee in circumstances which render that use a fringe benefit provided by the employer.

This relief from the obligation to keep records of distances travelled in a 100 percent business use vehicle does not, of course, relieve the taxpayer from his or her obligation to maintain, in the normal course, full detail. Is of the motor vehicle expenditure in respect of which a deduction is claimed.

#### The nature of the distance records required to be maintained

For every separate vehicle that is subject to the distance recording requirement the records must be in sufficient detail to establish:

*   The distance travelled during the year (in each vehicle) in business use; and
*   The total distance (miles or kilometres) travelled by that vehicle in the year.

This necessitates the recording, by every driver of the vehicle, in a log book or similar record, of the following details in respect of each business trip:

*   The distance travelled on that trip.
*   The reason for the trip. (Because private use by an employee is business use in relation to the business, a record of the identity of the driver on each trip should also be maintained).

In the event that a trip has more than one purpose, the predominant purpose should be recorded, except where that predominant purpose is non-business. Details of non-business travel are not required to be maintained.

The record of TOTAL distance travelled in the vehicle on both business and non-business trips during the income year (or, as appropriate, the taxpayer's accounting year) will consist of the odometer reading at the commencement of the income year (eg 1 April in the case of a 31 March balance date) and again at the end of that income year ie at balance date (or at date of purchase and date of sale as appropriate). The total distance travelled will then be self-evident from those two readings.

#### The effect of failure to keep the required records

Commencing with the 1986/87 income year claims for deduction of motor vehicle expenses and depreciation cannot be based on ESTIMATES of business/private use.

Failure to maintain the records that are required under section 106B will have the following consequence (in respect of every vehicle that is used for non-business purposes) in relation to which that failure occurs:

*   The deduction for income tax purposes will be limited to a maximum of 25 percent of the expenditure and depreciation relating to that vehicle. In this context "expenditure" includes the cost of registration, fuel, repairs, insurance, and interest on money borrowed to acquire the vehicle.
*   In any case where the Commissioner is of the opinion, based on the facts of the case, that "business" travel in the vehicle was less than 25 percent of total distance travelled in the vehicle in the income year, the deduction will be limited to such percentage (lower than 25 percent) as the Commissioner determines. That percentage could be as low as 1 percent. In this regard, remember that section 106B sets the requirements in respect of vehicles that ARE used, to whatever extent, in the carrying on of the taxpayer's business. In the case of a vehicle that is NOT so used, deduction of expenditure or depreciation is simply NOT permissible in terms of section 104 of the Income Tax Act.

It follows that where the business use of a vehicle in the income year is less than 25 percent of its total usage in that year, the taxpayer's claim for deduction should be based on that lower percentage.

**Note:** In any event, compliance with the record-keeping requirements of section 106B does NOT automatically guarantee a deduction of MORE than 25 percent of expenditure and depreciation. If the records revealed, for example, that "business" distances travelled in a vehicle in the year totalled only 20 percent of the total distances of all kinds travelled in that vehicle in that year, the deduction would be limited to 20 percent.

#### Application of Section 106B

Section 106B first applies in respect of the 1986/87 income year. In the case of taxpayers with balance dates other than 31 March, the position is therefore:

*   **Accounting years commencing after 1 October 1985 and prior to 1 April 1986** As the new section 106B was not enacted until 27 March 1986 a taxpayer whose 1986/87 accounting year commenced prior to 1 April 1986, is not be expected to have maintained the required records in respect of travel undertaken prior to 1 April 1986. In this case records maintained for the period from 1 April 1986 to the taxpayer's balance date will be used as a basis for the apportionment of expenditure and depreciation for the whole year.
*   **Accounting years commencing after 31 March 1986 and before 2 October 1986** Taxpayers with accounting years that commence at any time between these dates must comply with the new requirements for the whole of their 1986/87 income year. A taxpayer with, for example, a 31 July balance date will be required to comply with this provision as from 1 August 1986 in respect of the accounting year ending 31 July 1987 and subsequent accounting years.

#### Production and retention of records

The records required to be kept under this section will not have to be forwarded with the annual returns of income. Those records are to be retained by the taxpayer with his or her other business records, including documentation of the motor vehicle expenditure, and to be presented to this Department if requested. The requirements of section 428 of the principal Act regarding the retention of business records apply equally to records kept under section 106B.

It is intended that the annual return of income form will include a panel, to be completed and certified by the taxpayer, identifying those "business" vehicles that are used also for non-business purposes, and stating whether records have been kept in conformity with section 106B.

### Section 18 - Repairs, Maintenance and Depreciation

Section 18 amends section 108 of the principal Act to provide that no deduction will be allowed in respect of any repairs, maintenance or any asset to the extent that the asset on which that expenditure or loss was incurred is used in the providing of a benefit (being a benefit that is or that would be a fringe benefit but for the exemptions provided within the fringe benefit tax provisions) to a "major shareholder". Where such an asset is used in providing a benefit to a "major shareholder" the claim for any repairs, maintenance and depreciation must be adjusted accordingly. No deduction will be allowed in respect of the proportion of use relating to that benefit. This amendment harmonises with the amendment effected by section 16 of this Amendment Act. It removes doubts concerning deductibility where the benefit of the expenditure is enjoyed by an employee who is a "major shareholder".

This amendment applies as from the income year that commenced on April 1986 and is consequential to the amendments relating to the treatment of shareholder-employees for fringe benefit tax purposes. A full commentary on this new treatment follows section 34.

### Section 19 - Allocation of Expenditure Incurred In the Repair of Flood Damage To Certain Land Used For Farming or Agricultural Purposes

This section inserts a new section 133A in the principal Act.

This section allows to those farmers adversely affected by storm or flood during July 1985, that was declared by the Minister of Finance to be an adverse event, an optional facility for claiming a deduction, for income tax purposes, for the expenditure incurred on restoration work.

This section provides that expenditure incurred on restoration work (as a consequence of the July storm or flood) in any one or more of the 3 income years succeeding the 1984-85 income year may be claimed retrospectively as a deduction in the 1984-85 income year, instead of in the income year in which it is incurred.

Details of the application of the legislation are as follows.

#### Section 133A

**Subsection (1)**

This subsection contains the following definitions.

Specified adverse event means the event, being storm or flood that occurred during the month of July 1985 and that for the purposes of section 94 of the Income Tax Act, the Minister declared on 27 August 1985 to be an adverse event.

Specified area means the localities within New Zealand to which the specified adverse event relates. The following areas are affected:

*   Cook County; the Kanakanaia, Waipoa, Karaka, Ngatapa and Waihuka Ridings of the Waikohu County: the Waiau, Mangahopai and Mohaka Survey Districts of the Wairoa County; the Waikare, Petane and Puketapu Ridings of the Hawkes Bay County.

"Specified income year" means the income year that ended on 31 March 1985.

**Subsection (2)**

Provides relief to those farmers whose farms were affected by the July storm and floods, and whose farms are located in the areas set out in subsection (1) above. They will have the option of claiming a retrospective deduction in respect of any restoration expenditure incurred.

If a taxpayer wishes to claim a deduction in the "specified income year" instead of the income year in which the expenditure is incurred the taxpayer is required to forward a written election. The taxpayer's election, which shall be irrevocable, must specify the extent to which the expenditure should be deducted in calculating the assessable income from farming derived by him in the year ended 31 March 1985.

Upon receipt of such an election the Commissioner will allow that deduction and accordingly make or amend any assessment.

**Subsection (3)**

Provides that every notice of election shall be in writing and shall be given to the Commissioner before the taxpayer is required to furnish his or her return of income for the income year in which the expenditure is incurred, or within such extended time at the Commissioner may allow.

**Subsection (4)**

Ensures that the provisions of this new section do not overlap with the development expenditure provisions contained in sections 126 and 127 of the Income Tax Act. If an election is made under section 133A the provisions of sections 126 and 127 have no application in relation to that expenditure.

Subsection (5)

Contains provisions to enable the settlement of any dispute arising as to whether;

1.  any land is located within the "specified area"; or
2.  any damage was caused by the "specified adverse event".

A certificate prepared by a duly authorised officer of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries as to the situation of that land or the cause of the damage shall be final and conclusive evidence for the purpose of the section.

**Subsection (6)**

Provides that every reference to an income year, in relation to those taxpayers who furnish returns of income under section 15 (balance dates other than 31 March), shall be deemed to be a reference to the accounting year corresponding with that income year, and in every case section 133A shall, with any necessary modifications, apply accordingly.

### Section 20 - Expenditure On Scientific Research

This section repeals section 144 of the Income Tax Act and substitutes a new section.

The old section 144 provided that the Commissioner could allow such deduction as he thought fit in respect of any expenditure incurred by a taxpayer during the income year in connection with SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE TRADE OR BUSINESS CARRIED ON BY THE TAXPAYER, except so far as the expenditure related to an asset in respect of which a deduction for depreciation was allowable.

The new section 144 provides that eligible expenditure consists of that incurred in connection with scientific research carried on FOR THE PURPOSE OF DERIVING ASSESSABLE INCOME by the taxpayer, except so far as the expenditure relates to an asset in respect of which a deduction for depreciation is allowable.

The former requirement that the expenditure be directly related to the taxpayer's existing business has thus been eliminated, the new test being that the expenditure must be incurred "for the purpose of deriving assessable income" by the taxpayer. The effect of this change is that subject to the "purpose" test, explained below, any taxpayer may claim a deduction of expenditure incurred in connection with scientific research irrespective of whether the research is in connection with an existing business or a prospective new business activity outside the taxpayer's existing business or employment.

#### The "purpose" test:

To qualify for a deduction the taxpayer must show that the research is carried out for the express purpose of deriving his or her assessable income. The scientific research would have to be undertaken in a sufficiently competent and professional manner to justify an expectation of income and/or profit resulting from the research. The research programme would need to be arranged, financed, and carried out on a business-like basis and there should be not only the expectation of deriving assessable income but also the prospect of doing so. The "purpose" test, as it will apply in relation to section 144, is a fairly stringent test, and is designed to exclude deductions being allowed to persons indulging in hobbies. (In this regard it is to be noted that the amended section 144 will apply to taxpayers in general, not just to those who are already carrying on a business.)

A consequence of a taxpayer meeting the "purpose" test is that where the cost of research has been allowed as a deduction under the new section 144, ALL receipts derived by the taxpayer from the sale of the fruits of the research will be fully assessable to the taxpayer. The reason for this is that by claiming under section 144 the taxpayer is expressing his intention and the purpose for which the expenditure was incurred.

#### Development expenditure:

The amendment to section 144 extends the deductibility of expenditure incurred on scientific research but the position in relation to the deductibility of development expenditure relating to scientific development remains unchanged. The amendment does not widen the scope of the allowance to include the costs of developing the results of the research.

#### Scientific Research

The amendment does not change the nature of the expenditure which is deductible under section 144. There is no definition of scientific research in the Income Tax Act and all expenditure of a scientific nature, which includes industrial research, is deductible if it is incurred for the purpose of deriving assessable income.

#### Application:

The new section 144 applies from and including the income year that commenced on 1 April 1985 and every subsequent year.

### Section 21- Export-Market Development and Tourist-Promotion Incentive

This section makes amendments to section 156F of the principal Act which allows a credit of tax in respect of export-market development expenditure and tourist-promotion expenditure. The effect of the amendments is to extend the incentive to the 1987 year and to phase it out over the 1988, 1989 and 1990 income years as announced by the Minister of Finance in the 1985 Budget and in the August 1985 Statement on Taxation and Benefit Reform.

Without these amendments the terminating date of section 156F would have been 31 March 1986 (see the Third Schedule to the Income Tax Act 1976 as inserted by the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 2) 1985). The rate of tax credit for the 1985/86 income year was 67.5 percent representing 150 percent of the resident company tax rate of 45 percent. The rates of tax credit for the 1987 to 1990 phase-out years reflect the increased resident company tax rate of 48 cents in the dollar, which applies from and including the 1986/87 income year.

#### Subsection (1) of section 21:

This subsection amends subsection (2) of section 156F by firstly omitting the reference to "terminating date" and substituting a reference to 31 March 1987 and secondly by substituting "69 percent" for "67.5 percent". In other words, for the income year ending 31 March 1987, the rate of tax credit will be 69 percent.

_**Subsection (2)**_ inserts three new subsections, (2A), (2B), and (2C) in section 156F. The effect of these subsections is to phase out the export market development and tourist-promotion incentives on the following basis:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Income Year Ending** | **Tax Credit** |
|     | %   |
| 31 March 1988 | 64  |
| 31 March 1989 | 58  |
| 31 March 1990 | 53  |

_**Subsection (3)**_ makes a consequential amendment to section 156F(6) to ensure that a deduction in calculating assessable income is NOT allowed in respect of any expenditure for which a credit of tax is given during the phase-down period.

_**Subsection (4)**_ provides that the amendment made by subsection (3) is to apply on and from the first day of the income year commencing on 1 April 1987.

### Section 22 - Export-Market Development Activities Incentive For Self-Employed Taxpayers

This section makes two amendments to section 156G of the principal Act, which allows a credit of tax in relation to the value of the time spent by a self-employed person in export-market development activities relating to the supply of certain types of services. (For the 1985/86 income year the credit of tax was 67.5 percent of the value of time).

_**Subsection 1**_ amends the definition of "export-market development activities" in subsection (1) of section 156G. As it stood before this amendment, the lead-in to the definition of "export-market development activities" specified that the activities concerned had to be "personally performed by the taxpayer...". Consequent on this amendment, the lead-in reads "personally performed by the taxpayer ON HIS OWN BEHALF OR ON BEHALF OF ANY PARTNERSHIP OF WHICH THE TAXPAYER IS A MEMBER".

The amendment was required because the previous definition allowed a taxpayer to take advantage of the incentive even on those occasions when the promotion concerned the supply of services on behalf of another person with whom the taxpayer was not in business and in relation to whom he or she was no more than an agent. It was never the intention that the incentive should be available in those situations and this amendment restores the original intent of the section by restricting its application to instances where the taxpayer promotes the supply of his or her own services (or the services of a partnership of which he or she is a member) outside New Zealand. This amendment has effect from and including the 1985/86 income year (see subsection (4) below).

_**Subsections (2) and (3)**_ provide for an extension and phase-out of the incentive on the same basis as for the export-market development and tourist-promotion incentive (explained fully under section 21 above). The phase-out is as follows:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Income Year Ending** | **Tax Credit** |
|     | %   |
| 31 March 1987 | 69  |
| 31 March 1988 | 64  |
| 31 March 1989 | 58  |
| 31 March 1990 | 53  |

_**Subsection (4)**_ provides that the amendment to subsection (1) applies on and from the first day of the income year that commenced on 1 April 1985.

### Section 23 - Refunds From Income Equalisation Reserve Accounts

This section amends section 179 of the principal Act which provides for refunds of the whole or any part of any amounts deposited under the income equalisation reserve scheme (section 176). The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the particular situations in which the Commissioner may exercise the discretion given to him in relation to an EARLY refund from the income equalisation reserve scheme.

#### Subsection (1)

Repeals subsection (2) of section 179 of the principal Act and substitutes new subsections (2), (2A) and (2B).

The new subsections to section 119 provide as follows:

#### Subsection (2)

Provides that subject to sections 180 and 185 no refunds shall be made of any amount that has been on deposit in the income equalisation reserve scheme for a period less than 12 months. This is, however, qualified by the new subsections (2A) and (2B) below.

#### Subsection (2A)

Qualifies subsection (2) and permits the Commissioner to make a refund of any amount which has been on deposit under section 176 for a period of MORE THAN 6 MONTHS BEFORE THE DATE OF APPLICATION for a refund. The Commissioner may make a refund in these early withdrawal cases where he is satisfied that the refund is required for any of the following purposes:

1.  to enable the taxpayer to undertake, immediately after the refund is made, planned development or maintenance work in relation to his or her business (farming, agricultural or fishing) or forestry operation. The work must be undertaken immediately after the refund is made.
2.  to enable the taxpayer to purchase, immediately after the refund is made, livestock for use in his or her farming business.
3.  to avoid the suffering by the taxpayer of serious hardship.
4.  for any other purpose which in the opinion of the Commissioner warrants an early refund.

#### Subsection (2B)

Further qualifies subsection (2) and permits the Commissioner to make a refund of any amount which has been deposited under section 176, irrespective of the period of time the money has been held on deposit prior to the date of application for a refund. The Commissioner may make a refund where he is satisfied that the refund is required for any of the following purposes:

1.  to enable the taxpayer to undertake, immediately after the refund has been made, development or repair work, in relation to his or her business (being a farming, agricultural or fishing business) or forestry operations, where the need to undertake that work was unforseen at the time the deposit was made and resulted from an event that has been declared an adverse event for the purpose of section 94 of the Income Tax Act.
2.  to enable the taxpayer to purchase, immediately after the refund is made, livestock for use in his or her farming business, that livestock being purchased for the replacement of livestock lost, sold, or otherwise disposed of as the result of the occurrence of an event that has been declared by the Minister to be an adverse event for the purposes of section 94 of the Income Tax Act.
3.  to avoid the suffering by the taxpayer of serious hardship.
4.  For any other purpose which in the opinion of the Commissioner warrants an early refund.

#### Subsection (2)

Deems this section to have come into force on 1 April 1985 and provides that it shall apply on and from that date.

### Section 24 - Airport Operators

This section gives effect to the Government's decision that airport authorities are to be taxed, as if they were companies, on their income from airport operations.

Airports are operated by local bodies under joint venture agreements with the Crown. In general there will be an airport authority (the local body which is authorised to operate the airport. The local body will have entered into a joint venture agreement with the Crown (possibly decades ago) on the operation, funding and distribution of profits from the airports. As there will be no one entity that can be said to be the airport, the legislation "creates" an entity, an "airport operator", for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 1976. This is the entity which will be subject to income tax under the new section 197A inserted into the principal Act by section 24 of the Amendment Act.

#### Section 197A(1)

This subsection provides that section 197A applies notwithstanding anything else in the Income Tax Act. However, to the extent that the remainder of the principal Act does not conflict with section 197A, an "airport operator" (as defined in section 197A(2)) will be subject to income tax as if it were a company (see section 197A(3)(a))

#### Section 197A(2)

The subsection provides definitions for section 197A.

"Activities as an airport operator" are the activities involved in running an airport under a "joint venture agreement" (an expression defined later in section 197A(2)).

"Airport" has the same meaning as in section 2 of the Airport Authorities Act 1966.

"Airport asset" means, essentially, an asset which:

1.  Is used for airport operations and is owned by one or more of the parties to the particular airport's joint-venture agreement (except a hired or rented asset unless leased under a specified lease).
2.  Is owned for the purposes of a depreciation sinking fund relating to an airport asset.
3.  Is owned for the purposes of a loan redemption sinking fund in relation to the particular "airport operator" (a term defined later in section 197A(1)), but not any loan redemption sinking fund which relates to a loan repayable by only one party to the "joint venture agreement".
4.  Has been purchased out of the joint funds of the parties to the joint venture agreement under which the particular airport is operated.

"Airport authority" has the same meaning as in section 2 of the Airport Authorities Act 1966, reproduced below:

'"Airport authority" means a local authority for the time being authorised under section 3 of the Act to establish, maintain, operate, or manage an airport; and includes any person or association of persons authorised under subsection (3) of that section to exercise the powers of a local authority:' "

"'Airport Operator' means the Crown and an airport authority acting as parties to an airport 'Joint venture agreement'. This will usually be the Crown and a local body Council, but only in their capacities as parties to the joint venture agreement under which the airport is operated. No part of the council's other activities is included in this artificial entity, and no part of the Crown's other activities (in particular no part of its activities in relation to other airport joint ventures) is included, but see also the explanation of section 197A(3)(b) below.

"'Joint venture agreement' means the joint venture agreement, between the Crown and the airport authority, and under which the particular airport is operated. Airport joint venture agreements have been made under section 12 of the Civil Aviation Act 1964 and under other legislation. For the purposes of section 197A it does not matter what legislation the particular joint venture agreement was made under."

#### Section 197A(3)

This subsection contains a number of deeming provisions that are intended to ensure that an "airport operator" shall be subject to income tax as a "company" in the business of operating an airport.

**Paragraph (a)** deems "airport operators" to be companies.

**Paragraph (b)** deems the parties to a joint venture agreement to hold shares in the relevant "airport operator". The shares are deemed to be held in the same proportion that profits from the airport, after taking into account any adjustments in respect of previous years, are to be shared between those parties. Thus if the joint venture agreement provides that airport profits, after adjustments in respect of previous years, are to be shared in the proportions 50 percent to the airport authority and 50 percent to the Crown, the shares in the "airport operator" are deemed to be held in the proportions 50 percent by the airport authority and 50 percent by the Crown.

**Paragraph (c)** deems activities as an airport operator to be a business. This is intended to ensure that sections 65(2)(a), 104(b) and 112, inter alia, apply to airport operators.

**Paragraph (d)** deems an airport operator to own all assets which are airport assets in relation to the airport.

**Paragraph (e)** deems airport operators to be separate persons.

**Paragraph (f)** deems airport operators not to be public or local authorities. This is intended to ensure that section 61(2) will not apply to exempt the income of airport operators from income tax.

**Paragraph (h)** provides that where:

1.  An airport operator has the use of funds provided by one of the parties to the joint venture agreement under which the airport is operated; AND
2.  It was expressly agreed (ie, agreed in writing) that those funds are advanced for the purpose of activities as an airport operator; AND
3.  The funds are provided in consideration for some provision in the nature of interest -

those funds are deemed to have been borrowed capital employed by the airport operator and the provision in the nature of interest is deemed to be expenditure or a loss in the nature of interest. This paragraph is intended to ensure that section 106(1)(h) will apply to such loans and provisions.

#### Section 197(4)

This subsection provides that where an airport operator is deemed to own an asset, it is deemed to have incurred expenditure, in acquiring that asset, equal to the amount of the market value of the asset when the airport operator acquired or agreed to use or commenced to have the power to use the asset.

#### Section 197(5)

This subsection provides that all assets owned by an airport authority on 1 April 1986 are to be accounted for, for income tax purposes, on the basis of the written down book value (or tax purposes that would have applied had the assets been subject to depreciation under section 108 since the date of their purchase.

#### Section 197A(6)

This subsection provides for the deemed sale of assets which are deemed to be airport assets. If an airport operator has not acquired an asset, but is deemed to have acquired it, the airport operator is deemed to have sold the asset when it ceases to be an airport asset. The sale price is deemed to be the market value of the asset on the day on which it is deemed to be sold.

#### Section 197(7)

This subsection provides that no deduction is available for any expenditure or loss incurred, or deemed to have been incurred, by an airport authority and chargeable against profits that have been distributed to the joint venture parties.

In simple terms, profits from airport operations under joint ventures are accounted for as follows:

**\[CCH note:** flow chart not reproduced.**\]**

The intention of this subsection is to ensure that no deduction is available for expenditure chargeable against the Airport Authority Appropriation Account or the Crown Appropriation Account.

#### Section 197(8)

This subsection provides that section 10 of the principal Act will not apply to an airport operator in respect of its activities as an airport operator. This is intended to ensure that the Crown and the airport authority are not required to file a joint or partnership income tax return. An airport operator, being deemed for income tax purposes to be a company and a separate person, is required under section 9 of the principal Act to file a separate IR 4 income tax return. Income tax files for airport operators are to be held on Special Companies section, Wellington District Office.

#### Application

This section applies from the income year which commenced on 1 April 1986. The first income tax returns will be required from airport operators for the 1987 income year.

### Section 25 - Co-operative Dairy, Milk Marketing, and Pig Marketing Companies

Section 25 amends sections 201 to 203 to remove the Secretary to the Treasury from the membership of the Appeal Authorities in respect of the taxation of co-operative dairy, milk marketing, and pig marketing companies.

This amendment takes effect from 1 April 1986.

### Section 26 - Trustees of Non-Exempt Superannuation Schemes

In terms of section 225 of the principal Act, where a non-exempt superannuation scheme invests in -

1.  a superannuation policy, or
2.  another non exempt scheme

double taxation could arise. This is because the income would be taxed when derived by the "investee" trustees and again when distributed to the "investor" trustees. Clause 25 amends section 225 of the principal Act to ensure that any investment income so derived and which has been taxed to the "investee" trustees will not be subject to further tax when distributed. The income derived will now be exempt from income tax when derived by the "investor" superannuation scheme.

Thus if X Company non-exempt superannuation scheme invests in Z non-exempt superannuation scheme, which in turn places the money so received on deposit, -

1.  The interest remains assessable when derived by the trustees of Z superannuation scheme; and
2.  Amounts distributed by the trustees of Z superannuation scheme to the trustees of X Company superannuation scheme will be exempt from income tax when derived by the trustees of X Company superannuation scheme.

This amendment first applies to income derived in the income year that commenced on 1 April 1983.

### Section 27 - Statements To Be Delivered to the Commissioner

Persons who make deductions of non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) are required to file monthly reconciliations of non-resident withholding income paid and NRWT deductions. While this has been a long standing requirement there was no legislative authority for this practice.

Section 27 amends section 316 of the principal Act to require monthly reconciliations for NRWT purposes, but gives the Commissioner a discretion to require an annual reconciliation if he considers it appropriate to do so.

This amendment applies to every deduction of NRWT made on or after 1 April 1986. It also applies to every payment of an amount in respect of NRWT in relation to dividends made in accordance with section 313 of the principal Act on or after l April 1986.

### Sections 28 to 33 - National Superannuitant Surcharge

These sections make a series of minor amendments to some of the national superannuitant surcharge provisions in Part XA of the Income Tax Act.

The sections amend (in Part XA) sections 336A, 336B, 336F, 336H, 336I, and 336L of the principal Act. Each of the amendments will apply to the national superannuitant surcharge in respect of other income derived in the 1985/86 income year and subsequent income years (ie from the date the surcharge first applied).

Each section is detailed below:

### Section 28 - Interpretation

This section amends section 336A of the Income Tax Act which provides the interpretation provisions of the national superannuitant surcharge.

#### Subsection (1)

Paragraph (a) amends the definition of the expression "net national superannuation'. Net national superannuation was previously calculated under the following formula:

a - (b - c)

a is gross national superannuation received

b is the tax on all income received

c is the tax on income other than national superannuation and any specified foreign social security pensions received IN RESPECT OF THE INCOME YEAR.

As item "c" above referred to specified foreign social security pensions received in respect of the income year it effectively meant that any BACKPAYMENT of a specified foreign social security pension which spanned two income years was required to be included, in the calculation of item c of net national superannuation, in the EARLIER rather than the later income year.

This was not the original intention of the legislation and this amendment corrects the position by removing the "respect of" from item "c" to require the inclusion of amounts received IN the income year only. It ensures that the liability of such backpayments of foreign social security pensions will be liable for the national superannuitant surcharge in the year of receipt.

Paragraph b amends the definition of the expression "specified income" in section 336A of the principal act to ensure that it refers to a national superannuitant's assessable income other than from source deduction payments. Prior to this amendment the definition referred to "all the income" other than income consisting of source deduction payments of the national superannuitant. The expression "all the income" has a very wide meaning, which includes exempt income and could be considered to include gross receipts (to the extent to which they would be reduced by allowable deductions) - both of which are not income subject to the surcharge. This amendment clarifies the meaning of "specified income" by specifically referring to "ASSESSABLE" income.

Paragraph (c) is a minor drafting amendment. It provides that the definition of "standard deduction entitlement" in relation to a national superannuitant refers to $52 or 2 percent of the GROSS national superannuation, thus removing any doubt as to whether the legislation referred to gross or net superannuation.

_**Subsection (2)**_ of section 28 adds a proviso to the definition of "standard deduction entitlement", the "standard deduction entitlement" represents that part of the standard deduction which is treated as deductible from a national superannuitant's national superannuation. It is used in section 336B when calculating the amount of a national superannuitant's "other income".

Previously the "standard deduction entitlement" definition did not cater for a national superannuitant who claimed actual employment-related expenses instead of the $52/2% standard deduction.

While employment related expenses cannot be applicable to national superannuation (they would be applicable to other employment-related income), the standard deduction entitlement definition in section 336A treats part of these expenses as relating to the national superannuation payment whenever the other employment-related income is less than $2,600 pa. The definition of "standard deduction entitlement" is therefore amended to ensure that where there is a claim for employment-related expenses under section 105 of the Income Tax Act the standard deduction entitlement is to be treated as nil.

_**Subsection (3)**_ of this section provides that section 28 is to apply to the national superannuitant surcharge in respect of other income derived in the 1985/86 income year and subsequent income years.

### Section 29 - Determination of "Other Income"

This section amends section 336B of the principal Act which determines the amount of "other income" for the purposes of the National Superannuitant Surcharge.

_**Subsection (1)**_ of section 29 makes a similar amendment to that contained in section 28(1)(a) of this Amendment Act in that it clarifies the treatment of back payments of national superannuation and specified foreign social security pensions. References to gross national superannuation and specified foreign social security pensions in the formula for calculating a national superannuitants "other income" are amended by this subsection to refer to amounts received IN the income year and, NOT the amounts RECEIVED IN RESPECT of the income year. This ensures that the liability of such backpayments for both income tax and surcharge purposes is the same. (ie In the year in which such back payments of national superannuation and specified foreign security pensions are received they are deemed to be "other income" and therefore liable for the national superannuitant surcharge).

_**Subsection (2)**_

Paragraph (a) amends section 336B(2)(a) of the principal Act which provides for the calculation of "other income" where national superannuation is received for part only of an income year.

The apportionment of "other income" that is provided under section 336B(2) for those national superannuitants who receive national superannuation for part of an income year was originally designed to be available only to those who permanently departed New Zealand and those who commenced to receive national superannuation. This was intended to prevent national superannuitants from arranging their affairs so that they ceased to receive national superannuation when a large amount of other income was expected and then recommenced to receive national superannuation after the receipt of that income so that the other income would not be subject to the surcharge.

It became apparent, however, that section 336B(2) could have applied to any national superannuitant who, for whatever reason, recommenced to receive national superannuation, not just those who began to receive it for the first time.

The wording in section 336B(2)(a) has therefore been amended to read "... by reason of - (a) His national superannuation commencing FOR THE FIRST TIME after the beginning of the income year ...", thus confirming the application of the provision to the situations for which it was originally intended.

Paragraph (b) of subsection (2) of section 29 amends section 336B(2) of the Tax Act in a manner similar to that in which subsection (1) of this section amended section 336B(1). It clarifies the treatment to be given to backpayments of national superannuation and specified foreign social security pensions by ensuring that these components of the formula for calculating the apportionment of the "other income" of a national superannuitant receiving national superannuation for part only of an income yearare the amounts received IN the income year and not the amounts received IN RESPECT OF the income year.

This amendment reflects the original intention of the legislation in that the treatment of such backpayments for both income tax and surcharge purposes is the same. The effect is that any backpayment of either national superannuation or specified foreign social security pensions does not increase the level of "other income" liable to the surcharge when applying the formulae in section 336B.

_**Subsection (3)**_ of this section repeals and substitutes section 336B(3). Subsection (3) provides that where any OTHER income of a national superannuitant was received after the date on which the person first commenced to receive national superannuation, and the Commissioner is satisfied it should have been received before that date, the Commissioner may treat it as having been received before that date.

The new subsection provides the Commissioner with the power to determine any payment that is "other income" to be received at a time other than the time at which it was received where he is satisfied that in the normal course of events it would not have been received at that other time. Thus, payment of "other income" that is received after the time the national superannuitant has commenced to receive national superannuation may be deemed to have been received after that time. This discretion can be applied only when the Commissioner is satisfied that:

1.  The income would normally have been received on that later or earlier date.
2.  The national superannuitant was not party to any arrangement that had the effect of making subsection (3) apply more favourably than would otherwise have been the case.
3.  It is in the national superannuitant's interest for the adjustment to be made.

For example, if a national superannuitant who is about to go overseas to take up employment received an advance payment of income from that employment before he had ceased to receive national superannuation that income may be treated as having been received after he ceased to receive national superannuation. A further example would be where the superannuitant was to receive a lump sum retiring allowance from his employer before reaching age 60 but the payment was in fact made shortly after the date of the retirement and commencement of national superannuation. That income may be treated as having been received before he started to receive national superannuation.

_**Subsection (4)**_ of this section provides that section 29 is to apply the national superannuitant surcharge in respect of other income derived in the 1985/86 income year and subsequent income years.

### Section 30 - Election By National Superannuitant In Respect of Payment of Surcharge

This section makes minor drafting amendments to section 336F of the principal Act which relates to the election by a national superannuitant in respect of payment of the surcharge.

_**Subsection (1)**_ of section 30 which amends section 336F(a)(i), simply corrects the words "gross superannuation" to read, "gross national superannuation".

_**Subsection (2)**_ repeals and substitutes section 336F(2)(b)(ii). This paragraph gives national superannuitant who estimate that their other income will consist of only source deduction payments the option of paying the national superannuitant surcharge by way of deductions from those source deduction payments.

The amendment re-positions the phrase "in accordance with section 336J of this Act", from the end of section 336F(2)(b)(ii), to appear after the word "deductions". This simply clarifies the meaning of subparagraph (ii) of section 374F(2)(b).

_**Subsection (3)**_ of this section provides that section 30 is to apply to the national superannuitant surcharge in respect of other income derived in the 1985/86 income year and subsequent income years.

### Section 31 - National Superannuitant To Estimate Other Income

Section 31 makes minor amendments to section 336H of the principal Act which provides for a national superannuitant to estimate their other income for the purposes of calculating the amount of national superannuitant surcharge payable.

_**Subsection (1)**_ amends section 336H(2) which requires a national superannuitant, who has elected (under the provisions of section 336F(2)) to have the surcharge paid by way of deductions from payments of national superannuation, to deliver a form showing an estimate of other income TOGETHER WITH A TAX CODE DECLARATION. As the amount of the deductions is determined on the basis on the estimate of other income when electing to have the surcharge deducted from national superannuation the requirement to furnish a tax code declaration is unnecessary.

The subsection amends section 336H(2) by omitting the expression "together with his tax code declaration".

_**Subsection (2)**_ makes two amendments to section 336H(3).

Paragraph (a), in line with subsection (1) above, omits the expression "and the tax code declaration" from section 336H(3), thereby empowering the commissioner to determine the amount of surcharge deduction to be made without having to receive a tax code declaration from the national superannuitant.

Paragraph (b) of subsection (2) inserts in section 336H(3) the phrase "in accordance with the tenor of this part of this Act" after the words "the Commissioner shall determine". This requires that the determination, by the Commissioner, of the amount of a national superannuitant's surcharge deductions must be made on a basis consistent with the provisions of the national superannuitant surcharge legislation, as set out in Part XA of the Income Tax Act.

_**Subsection (3)**_ of this section provides that section 31 is to apply to the national superannuitant surcharge in respect of other income derived in the 1985/86 income year and subsequent income years.

### Section 32 - Surcharge Paid As Provisional Tax

Section 336I of the principal Act applies to national superannuitants who elect to pay the national superannuitant surcharge by way of payments of provisional tax in accordance with section 336F(2)(a)(ii). It provides that Part XII of the principal Act - which sets out the requirement for taxpayers to pay provisional tax-applies (with any necessary modifications) to national superannuitants who elect to pay the surcharge by way of PROVISIONAL tax.

_**Subsection (1):**_

Paragraph (a) amends section 336I(2) to provide that the amounts of surcharge payable by way of PAYE deductions are to be taken into account when calculating the amount of the surcharge payable as provisional tax. Prior to this amendment section 336I provided that Part XII applied on the basis that the expression "provisional tax" included the amount or surcharge payable and the expression "provisional income" was a reference to the expected specified income of the national superannuitant reduced by his/her specified exemption. This ignored the situation where some of that surcharge was paid by way of PAYE deductions. Thus the national superannuitant could have been required to pay part of her/his surcharge liability twice: once by way of PAYE deductions and again by way of provisional tax.

By inserting, in subsection (2) of section 336I, after the words "any amount payable as the surcharge", the words "(other than deductions from source deduction payments)" the amendment limits theamount of surcharge payable by way of provisional tax to the amount of surcharge that is not paid by way of PAYE deductions.

Paragraph (b) of subsection (1) corrects an incorrect income year reference in section 336I(2). In general, provisional tax is calculated on he basis of the taxpayer's income tax liability in the preceding year. To bring section 336I(2), which requires the national superannuitant to estimate his/her "expected specified income", into line with the payment of provisional tax on account of income tax, the words "expected specified income of that national superannuitant for that income year reduced by his specified exemption" have been amended to read "specified income of that national superannuitant for the IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING INCOME YEAR reduced by his specified exemption for that year.

Paragraph (c) of subsection (1) remedies a minor drafting omission. It inserts into the proviso to section 336I(2), before the word "expected", the word "his".

_**Subsection (2)**_ of this section provides that section 32 is to apply to the national superannuitant surcharge in respect of other income derived in the 1985/86 income year and subsequent income years.

### Section 33 - Application of Surcharge Codes Specified In Tax Code Declarations

Section 33 of this Amendment Act amends Section 336L of the principal Act which provides the circumstances in which the tax codes "MAJ", "SAJ" and "MIN" are to be used. Section 336L provides that the surcharge code "MIN" is to apply to all source deduction payments made to a national superannuitant other than the "largest" source deduction payment, to which the surcharge code "MAJ" or "SAJ" applies.

However, section 336K(2)(b)(i) specifies that the "MIN" surcharge code is to apply to ALL source deduction payments to a superannuitant where:

1.  that superannuitant's "other income" comprises both source deduction payments and specified income, (specified income is income other than source deduction payments), and
2.  the specified income exceeds the source deduction payments, and
3.  the national superannuitant has elected to pay the surcharge against his other income.

Prior to this amendment there was a degree of conflict between sections 336L and 336K(2)(b)(i). When the national superannuitant surcharge provisions were enacted in 1985 it was intended that section 336L would apply to only those national superannuitants to whom section 336K did not apply. To remove any apparent conflict and to reinforce the original intention of the legislation, section 336L of the principal Act is now expressed (following this amendment) as being "Subject to section 336K of this Act". The amendment ensures that the "MIN" code will apply not only to a national superannuitant who has another source deduction payment to which the surcharge code "MAJ" or "SAJ" applies, but also in the limited case where section 336K(2)(b)(i) applies.

_**Subsection (2)**_ of this section provides that section 33 is to apply to the national superannuitant surcharge in respect of other income derived in the 1985-86 income year and subsequent income year.

### Section 34 - Interpretation - Fringe Benefit Tax

Section 34 of this Amendment Act is concerned with the taxation of fringe benefits. A number of amendments have been made to section 336N of the principal Act, which is the interpretation section for Part XB of the Act, that part dealing exclusively with fringe benefit tax.

The major amendment being made in relation to fringe benefit tax is the treatment of shareholders who are employed by a private company. All amendments made by this Amendment Act relating to the treatment of employees for fringe benefit tax purposes, and the resulting change in income tax treatment, are discussed separately at the conclusion of this commentary on section 34.

_**Subsection (1)**_ of section 34 makes four minor drafting amendments to the definition of the expression "fringe benefit" in section 336N of the principal Act with effect from the commencement of the fringe benefit tax provisions, being 1 April 1985.

**Charitable Bodies**

_Paragraph (a)_ amends paragraph (h) of the definition of "fringe benefit" to ensure that the exemption from fringe benefit tax applying to non-business activities of certain charitable bodies does not extend to the activities of any local or public authority. This amendment will ensure that bodies such as hospital boards and education boards will not be classified as charitable bodies for fringe benefit tax purposes and will therefore be liable for fringe benefit tax when that board provides a "fringe benefit", as defined, to an employee. This amendment simply clarifies existing treatment and will therefore apply from 1 April 1985.

**Minor Amendments**

_Paragraph (b)_ makes a grammatical amendment to paragraph (i) of the definition of the term "fringe benefit". This amendment is merely grammatical and accordingly applies from 1 April 1985.

_Paragraph (c)_ amends paragraph (j)(vii) of the term "fringe benefit"

The words "it is a" have been deleted and substituted by the word "any". The amendment is purely grammatical and accordingly applies from 1 April 1985.

_Paragraph (d)_ is also a grammatical amendment. It amends paragraph (j)(x) of the definition of "fringe benefit" by inserting a missing word. As it does not alter the effect of the legislation this amendment also applies from 1 April 1985.

_**Subsection (2)**_ of section 34 is discussed at the conclusion to this commentary on the amendments being made by section 34. This subsection is concerned with the treatment of shareholders for fringe benefit tax purposes.

**Reimbursing Benefits**

_**Subsection (3)**_ amends paragraphs (j)(ii), (iii) and (iv) of the definition of the expression "fringe benefit" in section 336N of the principal Act. These paragraphs provide an exemption from fringe benefit tax in respect of benefits which, if paid in cash, would be exempt from income tax as a reimbursing allowance under Section 73. This amendment ensures that an employer will not be exempt from fringe benefit tax to the extent that a benefit, or an allowance, is provided to an employee on the condition that the benefit or that allowance be used in a particular way so as to provide a benefit to any other employee or employees, or relatives of any employee, of that employer. For example, an employer could provide a divisional manager with an entertainment allowance of $3,000 to enable the manager to put on a Christmas function for the division's staff at a restaurant. Previously this allowance (apart from the portion relating to entertainment of the divisional manager) would have been exempt from fringe benefit tax through the operation of paragraph (j)(ii) of the definition of "Fringe Benefit" in section 336N. Under the amendment, the portion of the allowance that relates to the entertainment of the division's employees will no longer be exempted under that provision. (The part relating to the entertainment of the employee to whom the entertainment allowance was made was never exempt under that provision). However, should that function have been held at the employer's place of business, the benefit to all employees would be exempt from fringe benefit tax through the operation of paragraph (n) of the definition of a "fringe benefit" in section 336N.

This amendment first applies for the quarter that commenced on 1 April 1986.

**Definition of "MINIBUS"**

_**Subsection (4)**_ inserts a further three definitions into section 336N(1). The definitions of the expressions "major shareholder" and "private company" are explained in the commentary on the treatment of shareholders for fringe benefit tax purposes at the conclusion to this commentary on section 34.

The term "minibus", used in section 336N, has now been defined to clearly identify those vehicles which may qualify as a "minibus" for fringe benefit tax purposes. Where a vehicle meets the description of a "minibus" it is excluded from the definition of a "motor car" and as a result may come within the scope of the exemption relating to "work related vehicles" (the definition of which is being changed by subsection (5) of this section).

For a vehicle to qualify as a "minibus", as defined, the vehicle must have been designed for the carriage of persons and the interior of that vehicle must contain:

*   3 permanently fixed seats, each of which is designed to seat at least 2 adults; or
*   more than 3 seats, of which at least 3 are permanently fixed and designed to seat at least 2 adults.

To meet the "firmly fixed" criterion the seats must be firmly fixed to the vehicle and must be neither collapsible nor capable of being folded down.

(It must be remembered that for an employer to be exempted from fringe benefit tax when a minibus is provided to, or available for the private use of, an employee, all the tests of a "work related vehicle" must be satisfied. If those tests are not completely met, the availability for private use of an employee of the minibus is deemed to be a fringe benefit and the employer is liable for fringe benefit tax on the value of that benefit.)

The definition applies from the quarter that commenced on l April 1986.

*   Definition of Work Related Vehicle

_**Subsection (5)**_ repeals and substitutes the definition of the expression "work related vehicle" with effect from the commencement date of the legislation (1 April 1985).

The purpose of this amendment is to give effect to the Government's announcement earlier this year relating to the placement of the employer's name on the vehicle and the use of logos for the purpose of the work related vehicle exemption.

The new definition requires that a "work related vehicle" must prominently display, on the exterior of the vehicle, the employer's name or other means of identification. Where the vehicle is owned by the employer, the name, logo, or acronym, or other similar identification of the employer which is regularly used in his or her business, must be displayed. Where the vehicle is rented from any person the vehicle must display the name, logo or acronym of either the employer or the person from whom the vehicle is being rented, provided it is identification which is regularly used by the employer or that person in his or her business.

A reasonable approach will be taken to the expression "prominent display on the exterior of the motor vehicle". A sign should be able to be seen and recognised and must not be obscured or hidden.

_**Subsections (6), (7) and (8)**_ are explained in the commentary on the changes to the treatment to shareholders for fringe benefit tax purposes, which follows the commentary on section 34.

*   Goods Sold to Employees

_**Subsection (9)**_ amends section 336N(5) of the principal Act which provides an exemption from fringe benefit tax when goods, which are "on special" to the public at a price less than the normal retail price (not exceeding $200), are sold to an employee at a staff discount which reduces the price paid below the cost of the goods to the employer.

This amendment limits that exemption to those sales to an employee (or an employee's relative) where:

*   the sale price to the employee is not less than the lesser of:
    1.  95 percent of the cost of the goods to the employer:
    2.  95 percent of the "on special" price to members of the public AND
*   either immediately before or immediately after that sale to the employee there was a reasonable quantity of identical goods available for purchase by members of the public.

What constitutes a "reasonable quantity" will depend on the facts of the particular case. In determining this, regard is to be given to the type of goods and the size of the business. It will not be satisfactory for the item of goods purchased by the employee to have been the only one of its kind "on special" on that day. What is required is that members of the public must have had a reasonable opportunity to purchase the item that is sold to the employee.

This amendment does not limit the rate of staff discount that an employer may allow but ensures that for the exemption from fringe benefit tax to apply, the price at which the goods are sold to the employee must not fall below the lesser of 95 percent of the cost to the employer or 95 percent of the "on special" price. This means that an employer may provide a staff discount of up to 5 percent on the price paid by the public, where the goods are on sale to the public at less than cost, without attracting liability for fringe benefit tax. Previously, such a sale may have attracted an FBT liability.

This amendment applies from the quarter that commenced on 1 April 1986.

_**Subsection (10)**_ inserts a new subsection (6) into section 336N. This new subsection provides an exemption from fringe benefit tax for employers when goods (other than goods "on special" to which section 336N(5) applies) are sold to employees for less than the cost of the goods to the employer.

This new exemption is similar to that provided by subsection (5) of section 336N (as amended by section 34(9) explained above) but differs in that it is not limited to goods which are "on special" to the public. This exemption applies when goods are sold at a staff discount to employees, at below cost to the employer.

Before the subsection can apply:

*   the goods must be sold in the normal course of the employer's business. (Where, for example, a butcher purchases an electrical product for sale to an employee the exemption would not apply because the butcher's normal business is the sale of meat, not electrical items.)
*   the normal retail price at which those goods are sold by the employer must not exceed $200.
*   the discount granted by the employer to the staff member must be that which is normally allowed to staff members.
*   the amount of the staff discount must not exceed five percent of the price at which those goods are offered to the public.

_**Subsection (10)**_ also inserts a new subsection (7) into section 336N. This section deems that the exemptions provided by subsections (5) and (6) of section 336N will apply where an employee of one company in a group of companies (as defined in section 2 of the principal Act) purchases goods from another company in that group. Subsections (5) and (6) will apply to that purchase as if the other company was the employee's employer.

These amendments will apply to all purchases made by employees from employers on or after 1 April 1985.

### Amendments dealing with the Treatment of Shareholder-Employees for Fringe Benefit Tax and Income Tax purposes

Where an employer provides a benefit to an employee, that employer is subject to the provisions providing for the taxation of fringe benefits contained in Part XB of the Act.

Under the legislation that existed prior to the amendments contained in this Amendment Act, where the employer was a private company and the employee a shareholder in that company, problems arose because of the fact that only benefits provided to an employee by reason of employment are subject to fringe benefit tax. Where a benefit was provided by reason of the person's position as a shareholder in the company that benefit was not subject to fringe benefit tax and the shareholder and the company were subject to an income tax adjustment. The problem with this situation was that it was not always possible to clearly identify the reason for providing the benefit to the shareholder.

To overcome this problem the Amendment Act sets out specific rules regarding the income tax and fringe benefit tax treatment that is to apply to shareholders of private companies. Essentially the income tax and fringe benefit tax treatment of fringe benefits provided to shareholders of private companies on or after 1 April 1986 will be dependent upon the extent of their shareholding in the company. Those who hold or control less than 10 percent of the shares or voting rights will be treated in the same manner as though they held no shares at all. For those who hold 10 percent or more of the shares or voting rights, the private company will be subject to income tax "add back" adjustments and will not be liable for fringe benefit tax.

#### Private Companies

This new policy will apply in relation to benefits provided to shareholders in private companies only. A definition of the term "private company" has been inserted into section 336N(1) by section 34(4) of this Amendment Act, giving it the same meaning as that contained in the Companies Act 1955.

#### How the new legislation will operate

Where a private company provides a benefit to any employee who owns, or has the power to control, or has the right to acquire, less than ten percent of any shares or voting rights in that private company, the company will be subject to fringe benefit tax on the same basis as for benefits provided to any other employee. The company will in that instance be able to deduct the expenditure incurred in providing that benefit and the shareholder will NOT be subject to any income tax adjustment under section 4 of the Act in relation to the value of the benefit received. The reason for providing the benefit is no longer a relevant consideration.

Where an employee owns, or has the power to control, or has the right to acquire, ten percent or more of the company's shares or voting rights, he or she is deemed to be a "major shareholder" and the company will NOT be subject to fringe benefit tax in respect of any benefit provided to that employee. Instead the cost of providing that benefit will not be deductible to the company and the benefit, as and where appropriate, will be subject to the dividend provisions of section 4 of the Act.

The treatment of shareholders who are not employees remains unchanged, irrespective of the percentage shareholding in the company. Expenditure incurred in providing private benefits to shareholders who are not employees will continue to be non-deductible to the company for income tax purposes.

#### Determination of a "major shareholder"

A person who owns, has the power to control (whether directly or indirectly), or has the right to acquire, ten percent or more of the shares in the private company is deemed to be a "major shareholder". A definition of this term has been inserted into the principal Act by section 34(4) of this Amendment Act. The term "major shareholder" is now used in other parts of the principal Act as a result of insertions and amendments made by this Amendment Act.

To determine the percentage of shares or voting rights which a shareholder owns, controls or may acquire, consideration must be given to the interest in that same company held by any relative or nominee of the shareholder. _**Subsection (6)**_ of section 34 inserts a new subsection (2A) into section 336N of the principal Act. Paragraph (a) of this new subsection provides that any shares or voting rights held by

1.  any relative of the shareholder;
2.  any nominee of that relative; or
3.  any nominee of the shareholder

are deemed to be held by the shareholder along with the shares or voting rights held by the shareholder.

This means that where a benefit is provided to a person who has any interest (shares or voting rights) in the company, the interest (shares or voting rights) held by relatives and nominees will be added to that person's holdings when determining whether or not he or she is a major shareholder in the company.

For example:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Smith & White Ltd** |     |
| Joe Smith | 50% |
| Joanne Smith | 5%  |
| Susan White (wife of Sam) | 35% |
| Sam White (husband of Susan) | 5%  |
| Don White (son) | 0%  |
| Jan Brown (nominee for Sally White, daughter of Susan and Sam) | 5%  |

*   If Joanne Smith was employed by the company and was in receipt of a benefit, the company would not be subject to fringe benefit tax but the employee and company would be subject to an income tax adjustment. This is because when Joanne Smith's interest of 5% is combined with that of Joe Smith (her husband) she holds more than ten percent of the shares in the company.
*   Don White could not be deemed a major shareholder of the company. To be deemed a major shareholder the employee must own, have the power to control, or the right to acquire, any of the shares in that company, and only then can any interest held by any relative or nominee be deemed to be held by that person.
*   Sally, however, if employed in the company, would be deemed a major shareholder as she indirectly controls 5 percent of the shares in the company (as held by her nominee) and the interest held by her relatives, when combined with that held by her nominee, exceeds ten percent.

Paragraph (b) inserts a tracing provision to deem shares held by subsidiary companies to be held by the individuals who are the beneficial owners of the shares.

Paragraph (c) provides that the term "nominee" includes any person who

*   directly acts on behalf of the shareholder in the exercising of his or her voting rights; or
*   directly or indirectly holds the shares of the shareholder.

The percentage of shares or voting rights owned, under the control of, or able to be acquired by a person is determined at the end of each quarter. The shares or voting rights which have been owned, controlled or which have been available for purchase at any other time during the quarter are not taken into consideration, unless that shareholder had temporarily disposed of his or her interest for the purposes of defeating the fringe benefit tax legislation. If that occurs the Commissioner may ignore that temporary disposition when determining the percentage of shares or voting rights held by that person.

#### Treatment of benefits provided to employees who are not major shareholders

Where a benefit is provided to an employee who is not a major shareholder (ie he or she is deemed to have less than a 10 percent interest in the company) the company is subject to fringe benefit tax on the same basis as if the benefit was provided to an employee who is not a shareholder. The cost of providing the benefit is not assessable to the shareholder as a dividend and is deductible to the company.

The amendments to the principal Act which facilitate this treatment are:

**Section 336N(3A):** This new subsection has been inserted by section 34(8) of the Amendment Act. It provides that benefits granted by a private company to an employee who holds shares in the company, or is deemed to hold shares in the company because of the operation of the new section 336N(2A), are deemed to have been granted to that employee as part of the employee's remuneration and not by reason of his or her shareholding.

This is necessary because the definition of "fringe benefit" in section 336N provides that only benefits granted to employees by reason of employment are subject to the fringe benefit tax provisions. The amendment removes any argument that a benefit is not subject to fringe benefit tax because it was provided to a shareholder-employee by reason of his or her shareholding (rather than as part of his or her remuneration).

(It should be noted that although the new section 336N(3A) deems all benefits provided to shareholder-employees to have been granted by reason of their employment, benefits provided to "major shareholders" are specifically exempted from fringe benefit tax through the operation of the new paragraph (f) of the definition of "fringe benefit" in section 336N(1) of the principal Act (as inserted by section 34(2) of this Amendment Act).)

**Section 105A** This is a new section which has been inserted by section 15 of the Amendment Act. It permits a deduction to the company in respect of the costs of providing a benefit (whether or not that benefit constitutes a fringe benefit) to any employee who is a shareholder, but is not a "major shareholder", in the company.

This section in effect deems such costs NOT to be costs of a private or domestic nature and permits deductibility as if they were expenditure allowable under section 104 of the principal Act. It removes any argument that the expenditure was not incurred in the production of the company's assessable income because it was incurred in providing a private benefit to a shareholder.

**Section 4(1)** has been amended by section 3 of this Amendment Act. The amendment ensures that the expenditure incurred by a proprietary company in the providing of a benefit that is a fringe benefit (or that would be a fringe benefit but for the operation of paragraphs (f) to (n) of the definition of a "fringe benefit") to an employee who is NOT a major shareholder cannot be assessed to that shareholder as a dividend. It should be noted that the reference to "fringe benefits" limits the application of this exemption to shareholders who are also employees.

**Section 6** has been amended by section 4 of the Amendment Act. This amendment ensures that although certain payments made to a shareholder throughout the income year are deemed not to be "source deduction payments" and PAYE is not required to be deducted therefrom, those payments will still be deemed to be source deduction payments to an "employee" for fringe benefit tax purposes. The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that benefits provided to shareholder-employees are subject to the fringe benefit tax provisions when that shareholder is in receipt of any salary or wages from the company, even though the income in terms of Section 6 is deemed to be income derived otherwise than from source deduction payments for income tax purposes.

#### Treatment of benefits provided to employees who are major shareholders

Benefits provided to employees who are major shareholders are deemed not to be fringe benefits and are therefore not subject to fringe benefit tax. The costs involved with the provision of the benefit are deemed to be costs of a private or domestic nature and are not deductible to the company. Where the private company is a proprietary company, as defined in section 2 of the principal Act, the costs incurred by the company are treated as a dividend in the hands of the shareholder unless that expenditure is subsequently repaid to the company.

The provisions of the principal Act which facilitate this treatment are:

**Section 336N** Paragraph (f) of the definition of the term "fringe benefit" has been amended to exclude all benefits granted to a "major shareholder" of a private company. Because these benefits are deemed not to be fringe benefits, they cannot be subject to fringe benefit tax.

**Section 106(1)(j)** of the principal Act has been amended by section 16 of this Amendment Act. Previously paragraph (j) excluded any deduction to the extent that the expenditure or loss was of a private or domestic nature. The amended paragraph (j) continues to prohibit any deduction of expenditure or loss which is of a private or domestic nature but extends this by deeming any expenditure or loss incurred in the providing of a benefit to a "major shareholder" to be expenditure or loss of a private or domestic nature and therefore not deductible to the company. This extends to include benefits that would, but for the operation of paragraphs (f) to (n) of section 336N(1), be deemed fringe benefits. Benefits that constitute "monetary remuneration", or that are deductible under section 150 (contributions to employee superannuation schemes), are NOT deemed to be private or domestic expenditure and therefore continue to be deductible for income tax purposes.

**Section 105A**, which has been inserted by section 15 of the Amendment Act, has been explained previously. This section deems expenditure incurred by a private company in the providing of a benefit to an employee who is a shareholder to be deductible expenditure except where that employee is a "major shareholder". It does not, therefore, permit a deduction for expenditure incurred by the company in providing a benefit to a "major shareholder".

**Section 4(2)** of the principal Act deems expenditure incurred by a proprietary company in providing a benefit to a shareholder to be a dividend to that shareholder, unless that expenditure is subsequently repaid to the company. This "deemed dividend" provision does not apply where the expenditure is deductible to the company. Only expenditure incurred by a company in providing a benefit to an employee who is not a "major shareholder" is deductible to the company. Therefore expenditure incurred in providing a benefit to a "major shareholder" can still come within the provisions of section 4.

**Section 2** of the principal Act, which contains the definition of the term "EXPENDITURE ON ACCOUNT OF AN EMPLOYEE", has been amended by section 2 of the Amendment Act. Subsection (2) of the amending section ensures that where a private company incurs expenditure in providing a benefit to an employee who is a "major shareholder", that expenditure cannot also be treated as monetary remuneration of the shareholder.

**Section 108** has been amended by section 18 of the Amendment Act and provides that NO deduction for depreciation or repairs and maintenance shall be allowed to the extent that the asset is used in providing a benefit to a "major shareholder".

The extent of use is relevant in determining whether any adjustment should be made. To establish this the type of asset should be considered and the amount of time it has been used in providing a benefit to an employee. Where that asset is used only incidentally in the providing of a benefit (for example a hairdryer when providing an occasional haircut) no adjustment will be required.

Special provisions exist in relation to the private use of motor vehicles by major shareholders of private companies - please refer to the commentary on the new section 106B. (Section 17 of this Amendment Act).

#### Benefits to which this new legislation relates

The new legislation regarding the treatment of benefits provided to shareholder-employees is to apply to all benefits which come within the definition of the expression "fringe benefit" in section 336N of the principal Act.

Where a benefit in the form of

*   the private use or enjoyment of a motor vehicle;
*   the availability for private use or enjoyment of a motor vehicle;
*   a low interest loan;
*   subsidised transport;
*   discounted goods and services; or
*   any other benefit;

is provided to an employee, who is not a "major shareholder", the employer will be subject to fringe benefit tax on the value of that benefit.

The costs incurred by a private company in providing any of these "benefits" to an employee who is a "major shareholder" will not be subject to fringe benefit tax but will be subject to the income tax adjustments outlined above.

#### When does this legislation apply

For fringe benefit tax purposes, the application is to the quarter that commenced on 1 April 1986. The income tax amendments first apply to the income year that commenced on 1 April 1986 (or equivalent accounting year).

### Section 35 - Value of Fringe Benefit; and Section 44 - Fringe Benefit Values

The fringe benefit tax provisions of the principal Act (Part XB) relating to the valuation of fringe benefits have been amended by sections 35 and 44 of this Amendment Act. These two sections are interrelated and amend the provisions under which a benefit, in the form of a motor vehicle provided to or available for the private use of an employee, is to be valued for fringe benefit tax purposes. This commentary combines the explanation on these sections.

**Section 44** replaces the Tenth Schedule to the principal Act with a new Tenth Schedule which is set out in the Second Schedule to this Amendment Act. This Schedule outlines how a benefit in the form of a motor vehicle is to be valued for the purposes of fringe benefit tax.

Paragraph (a) of the new Schedule provides that where the motor vehicle is owned by the employer, the value of the fringe benefit for the purposes of item "Z" of the formula in section 336O(1) of the principal Act is 6 percent of the COST PRICE of that motor vehicle.

Sale and Buy Back Arrangements

A new subsection, (1A), which has been inserted in section 336O by subsection (1) of section 35 of this Amendment Act, specifies the manner in which, for the purposes of the Tenth Schedule, the "cost price" of a motor vehicle is to be determined in certain circumstances.

Those circumstances are:

1.  Where the motor vehicle is acquired by a person on or after 23 September 1985 and has within the period of 24 months prior to that acquisition been owned by that person, or by an associated person, the cost price to be used in calculating the value of any fringe benefit consisting of the use or availability of that motor vehicle is the HIGHEST cost for which the motor vehicle has been acquired, by the person or the associated person, at any time since the vehicle was manufactured.  
      
    **Example**  
      
    
    |     |     |     |     |     |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | **Vehicle A** |     |     |     |     |
    | (1) | Z Ltd purchases | 1.8.82 | $15,000 |     |
    | (2) | Sold (under arrangement) to J Motors Ltd | 31.3.85 | $ 8,000 | market value |
    | (3) | XY Ltd (associate of A Ltd) purchases | 1.4.85 | $ 8,000 |     |
    | (4) | Sold to Z Ltd | 1.4.86 | $ 6,000 |     |
    
      
      
    In transaction (3) the vehicle was acquired prior to 23 September 1985 and therefore subsection (1A) of section 336O does not apply. The cost price for the purpose of paragraph (a) of the Tenth Schedule is, therefore, $8,000. In transaction (4) the vehicle was acquired after 23 September 1985 and had within a period of 24 months been owned by that same person. Subsection (1A) of section 336O deems the "cost price" for the purposes of paragraph (a) of the Tenth Schedule to be the highest cost of that vehicle to that person (or to an associated person) at any time since the vehicle's manufacture. Therefore the cost is deemed to be $15,000. (The significance of the date the 23 September 1985 is that it is the date on which the Government announced that the "sale and buy back" arrangements being entered into by employers to reduce their liability for fringe benefit tax would no longer be accepted).
2.  Where the motor vehicle was acquired-
    1.  At no cost (for example, by way of gift); or
    2.  At less than market value, pursuant to an arrangement entered into for the purpose of defeating the intent and application of the fringe benefit tax provisions; or
    3.  In circumstances where, for whatever reason, the cost price (under that acquisition) is unable to be established to the Commissioner's satisfaction;- The cost price for the purposes of valuing the fringe benefit attaching to the vehicle will be based on the VALUE that the Commissioner is satisfied was the market value of the vehicle on the date on which it was acquired. The "market" value will be based on the retail price at which the motor vehicle could have been purchased by the employer in an arms length transaction, from a licensed motor vehicle dealer.
        *   Lease by an Associated Person Paragraph (b) of the new Tenth Schedule provides the rules for determining the value of the fringe benefit where the employer leases or rents the motor vehicle from AN ASSOCIATED PERSON. Subparagraph (i) - Where the period of leasing or renting commenced before 23 September 1985, the value of the fringe benefit is equal to 6 percent of the MARKET VALUE of the motor vehicle on the date on which the leasing or renting commenced. Subparagraph (ii) - where the period of renting or leasing commences on or after 23 September 1985 the value of the fringe benefit is equal to 6 percent of the COST PRICE of the motor vehicle to whoever is the owner of the vehicle at the time the period of leasing or renting commenced. The provisions of the new subsection (1A) of section 336O concerning the interpretation of the term cost price, as explained above under paragraph (a), will also apply for the purposes of determining the cost price referred to in this subparagraph.
        *   Other Provisions for Determining Value Paragraph (c) of the new Tenth Schedule specifies the value to be used when the motor vehicle is leased or rented under an ARMS LENGTH TRANSACTION, IE, NOT BETWEEN ASSOCIATED PERSONS. In this situation the value to be adopted is 6 percent of the MARKET VALUE of the motor vehicle at the time at which the period of leasing or renting commences. Paragraph (d) gives the Commissioner authority to determine the market value of the motor vehicle where he is not satisfied that the value used by the employer under paragraphs (b)(i) or (c) (explained above) is the true market value. A market value that would be acceptable to the Commissioner would be that described under paragraph (a) above, being the retail price at which the motor vehicle could have been purchased, in an arms length purchase from a licensed motor vehicle dealer, on the date on which the period of leasing or renting of the vehicle commenced. Paragraph (e) provides that where the motor vehicle is one of a pool of vehicles which are available for the private use or enjoyment of an employee the value of the fringe benefit is equal to 6 percent of the average of the cost prices or market values of the motor vehicles as determined in accordance with paragraphs (a) to (d) of the Tenth Schedule as explained above. _**Subsection (2)**_ of section 35 corrects a minor drafting fault in section 336O(6) of the principal Act by replacing the word "subsection" with the word "section". The amendment applies as from 1 April 1985. _**Subsection (3)**_ provides that the amendments effected by subsection (1) are to apply to fringe benefits provided on or after 23 September 1985.

### Section 36 - Taxable Value of Fringe Benefit

Section 36 amends section 336P(2) of the principal Act which provides an exemption from fringe benefit tax for incidental benefits which arise during business travel by the employee.

When the legislation was originally introduced, the exemption extended only to those benefits to which paragraph (d) of the definition of "fringe benefit" applied (being benefits in the form of subsidised transport). However the intention of the exemption was that it also apply to benefits to which paragraph (e) of that definition applies.

The Department has interpreted section 336P as providing an exemption to those benefits deemed to be "fringe benefits" under paragraphs (d) AND (e) of that definition as that was clearly intended. Section 36 gives effect to this intention and applies from 1 April 1985, being the original application date of section 336P(2).

### Section 37 - Payment of Fringe Benefit Tax Every Quarter

Section 37 repeals and substitutes section 336T of the principal Act.

Prior to this amendment, Section 336T required the furnishing to the Commissioner of a fringe benefit return (and payment of the fringe benefit tax) by every employer every quarter.

The new section 336T, which applies with respect to fringe benefits, provided on or after 1 April 1986, provides as follows:

#### Subsection (1) of section 336T:

Subsection (1) effectively repeats the provisions of section 336T as they were before this substitution. that is, it requires a fringe benefit return to be furnished (and payment of the fringe benefit tax to be made) for every quarter in which a person is an employer.

#### Subsection (2) of section 336T:

This subsection reinforces the former section 336T, by specifically requiring that, SUBJECT TO SUBSECTION (3), a fringe benefit return must be furnished in respect of every quarter in which the employer has not provided a fringe benefit.

This return will be in fact a "NIL" return. It will apply where fringe benefits are provided in some quarters but not in others.

#### Subsection (3) of section 336T - Nil Returns

Gives the Commissioner the authority to dispense with the furnishing quarterly of "NIL" fringe benefit returns -

1.  the purposes of meeting the special circumstances of any case or class of cases; and
2.  Upon or subject to such terms and conditions as the Commissioner requires.

In terms of this provision, the Commissioner will relieve, from the QUARTERLY return furnishing obligation, any employer who satisfies the Commissioner that he or she does not provide any fringe benefits during any year. This relief will be subject to the requirement that the employer furnish a fringe benefit return, at year end, in respect of the full year. It will be subject also to any variation that the Commissioner finds necessary during the year.

_**Subsection (2) of section 37**_ provides that this substituted section 336T applies with respect to fringe benefit tax on fringe benefits provided on or after 1 April 1986.

Those taxpayers who may be eligible for relief under subsection (3) of the new section 336T must furnish quarterly returns up to and including the March 1986 quarter. The furnishing of an annual "NIL" fringe benefit return cannot commence until the taxpayer has been given formal notification to that effect by the Department.

### Section 38 - Additional Tax To Be Charged If Default Made In Payment of Tax

_**Subsection (1)**_ of section 38 of this Amendment Act amends an incorrect cross reference in section 398 (Section 398 of the principal Act imposes additional tax and incremental additional tax on amounts of tax that are outstanding after the last date for their payment.) This amendment simply substitutes, for the previous reference to "section **34**" in the definition of "specified rate of interest" in subsection (1) of section 398, the correct reference which is "section **34A**".

_**Subsection (2)**_ repeals and substitutes paragraph (b) of the definition of "period of deferral" in subsection (1) of section 398.

Where there is an amount of tax in dispute, that amount is determined by the Commissioner and notified to the taxpayer pursuant to section 34 of the principal Act and the taxpayer is then able to defer payment of one-half of that amount (that half being the "deferrable tax") up until such time as the dispute is finally resolved. The start of that "period of deferral" was intended, when the legislation was introduced by the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 2) 1985, to commence on the later of:

1.  The date of the notice of assessment; or
2.  The day FOLLOWING the last day for payment.

However, in the 1985 legislation that starting date was expressed as being the later of:

1.  The date of the notice of assessment; or
2.  The LAST DAY FOR PAYMENT.

This meant that the "period of deferral" could commence on the last day for payment, with the result that where the dispute is found in the Commissioner's favour, "interest based" additional tax would be charged from the date of the commencement of the "period of deferral", that is, from **7** March (in the case of a 31 March balance date) instead of (as should be the case) **8** March.

The amendment made by subsection (2) of section 38 remedies this situation, and ensures that in such circumstances interest can be charged only from the DAY FOLLOWING the last day for payment (eg 8 March) rather than from the last day for payment (eg 7 March).

Subsection (3) specifies the application date of these two amendments. They apply from the commencement of section 40 of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 2) 1985; that is, with respect to the tax on income derived in the income year that commenced on 1 April 1985.

### Section 39 - Deduction of Tax From Payment Due To Defaulters

Section 400 of the principal Act enables the Commissioner to issue, to a person who is in possession of funds which are payable to a taxpayer who owes money to the Department, a notice requiring that person to pay to the Department sufficient of those funds to extinguish the arrears of tax. Such notices to deduct may be issued in respect of various categories of money payable to a taxpayer, including money held in bank accounts.

This section makes several amendments to section 400.

**Deduction may be a lump sum or by instalments**

_**Subsection (1)**_ repeals and substitutes subsection (2) of section 400. Subsection (2) is the operative subsection which ensures that where any taxpayer has made a default in the payment of tax, the Commissioner may, from time to time, by notice in writing, require any person to deduct or extract an amount payable in relation to the taxpayer.

Recently, some doubt was expressed about whether the subsection enables the Commissioner to require that deductions be made from a bank account by way of instalments. In the past it was thought that the legislation had always permitted such deductions and notices issued over many years have hitherto been complied with. Recently this practice has been challenged and this amendment is designed to clarify the ambit of the subsection and ensure that a deduction or extraction by way of instalment may be made.

The new subsection (2) is essentially the same as the subsection that it replaces except that it allows two categories of deduction to be made.

Paragraph (a) permits the Commissioner to require a deduction to be made IN ONE SUM from any amount that is an amount payable in relation to the taxpayer while paragraph (b) permits him to require that the deduction be made by way of INSTALMENTS. In all other respects, the subsection is unchanged.

_**Subsections (2), (4) and (6)**_ of section 39 amend subsections (7), (8) and (9) of section 400 by inserting, after the word "deduction" wherever it occurs, the words "or extraction". These amendments are necessary in order to be consistent with the scheme of subsection (2) which refers to both a "deduction" and "an extraction".

**Indemnity**

_**Subsection (3)**_ inserts a new subsection (7A) in section 400. The new subsection provides that any person, acting pursuant to a notice issued under section 400, shall be deemed to be acting on the authority of the taxpayer. It indemnifies any such person in respect of any deduction, extraction or payment made in accordance with a section 400 notice.

This subsection will also overcome any inherent problems caused by conflicting statutory provisions - for example, section 89 of the Law Practitioners Act 1982. These provisions require a solicitor to hold all money received for or on behalf of the client exclusively for the client. The Law Practitioners Act can no longer be cited as a reason for not complying when a Section 400 notices.

The amendment applies to all notices issued by the Commissioner under section 400, whether issued in the current year or in previous or future years.

**Bank Accounts - Deductions Held in Trust for the Crown**

Subsection (5) inserts a new subsection (8A) into section 400. The new subsection provides that where a section 400 notice requires a bank to deduct money from a taxpayer's bank account, any amount that is payable by the bank to the taxpayer shall, to the extent of the amount required to be deducted, be deemed to be an amount held in trust for the Crown and be recoverable in the same manner in all respects as if it were income tax payable by the bank.

The subsection applies to any notice issued under section 400 that relates to a bank account. It provides that where a deduction is required to be made under such a notice, any money held in the account at the commencement of an instalment period, or deposited in that account during that period, shall be deemed to be held in trust for the Commissioner until the deduction is made. The amount deemed to be held in trust is limited to a maximum of the amount of the instalment required to be deducted at the end of this period.

The instalment period referred to above is defined in paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection (8A).

Paragraph (a) relates to a notice that requires a bank to deduct or extract an amount in one sum. The period in these cases, commences on the day on which the section 400 notice is given to the person and expires with the day on which the deduction or extraction is required to be made in compliance with the notice.

Paragraph (b) specifies the relevant period in relation to a notice that requires a bank to deduct or extract an amount by way of instalments.

For the sum required to be deducted or extracted in the first instalment, the period in which the money is deemed to be held in trust for the Commissioner is the same as in paragraph (a). For each ensuing instalment the period commences on the day succeeding the day on which the previous deduction or extraction was required to be made and ends on the day on which the relevant instalment is required to be deducted or extracted.

The subsection (8A) is complementary to subsection (8) of section 400. Subsection (8) secures sums deducted or extracted from any amount pursuant to a section 400 notice by deeming such sums to be held in trust for the Crown. Subsection (8A), on the other hand, secures the amount of any instalment (or lump sum) that is required to be deducted or extracted from a bank account at the expiry of a specified period to be held in trust for the Crown until the date on which that deduction or extraction is required to be made.

**Offences for Failure to Comply**

_**Subsection (7)**_ inserts a new paragraph (c) in subsection (9) of Section 400. Subsection (9) sets out specific offences against section 400 and this subsection adds a new offence of failure to comply with the new subsection (8A) in section 400.

The subsection is self-explanatory. However it is to be noted that section 42 of this Amendment Act has amended subsection (9), as from 1 April 1986, in such a way that every person who commits an offence specified in subsection 9 of section 400 will in future:

"on the first occasion on which he is convicted of any such offence or more than one such offence, be liable, in respect of that offence or, as the case may be, each of those offences, to a fine not exceeding $15,000."

On every other occasion on which a person is convicted of any such offence or more than one such offence, that person will be liable in respect of that offence, or each of those offences, to a fine not exceeding $25,000.

_**Subsection (8)**_ consequentially repeals section 40(2) of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 3) 1983.

**Application**

_**Subsections (9) and (10)**_ relate to the APPLICATION DATE:

Subsections (1), (2), (4), (5), (6), (7) and (8) of section 39 shall apply in relation to section 400 notices issued on or after 27 March 1986. (The date on which the legislation received the Governor-General's assent).

Subsection (3) applies in relation to section 400 notices issued at any time, whether before, on, or after the coming into force of the Amendment Act.

### Section 40 - Relief From Additional Tax

Section 40 extends the additional tax RELIEF provisions in section 413 of the principal Act by inserting a new subsection, (2A). This new subsection gives the Commissioner the authority to remit additional tax charged for late payment or non-payment of provisional tax in those cases where the income tax payable for an income year, as determined after the end of the income year, is less than the provisional tax that was payable in respect of that year.

This amendment confirms the Department's previous administrative practice of remitting part or all of the additional tax incurred on provisional tax to the extent that the additional tax was calculated on an amount by which the provisional tax exceeded the income tax for that year.

_**Subsection (1)**_

The maximum relief that the Commissioner will allow under the new subsection (2A) of section 413 will be equal to the difference between the additional tax charged on the provisional tax payable and that which would have been charged had the provisional tax payable for the year been equal to the income tax for that year as ultimately assessed by the Commissioner. Where there is NO income tax payable for a year, all additional tax on provisional tax for that year will be remitted. Where income tax IS payable for a year, the amounts of the instalments of provisional tax for that year will, for the purpose of recalculating the additional tax thereon, be recalculated, by the Commissioner, to represent the amounts equal to the appropriate proportions (eg 1/3 and 2/3) of the income tax as ultimately assessed.

#### Example

|     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Income year ending 31.3.87** |     |     |     |     |     |

|     |     |     | $   | $   |     |
| 7.8.86 | 1st instalment due not paid by 7.9.86 |     | 3000 | 2600 | (1/3 of $7800) |
| 8.9.86 | Additional tax of 10% for non-payment |     | 300\* | 260 | +   |
|     |     |     | 3300 | 2860 |     |
| 7.2.87 | 2nd instalment due |     | 6000 | 5200 |     |
|     | Total due but not paid by 7.3.87 |     | 9300 | 8060 |     |
| 8.3.87 | Additional tax for non-payment |     | 930\* | 806 | +   |
|     |     |     | 10230 | 8866 |     |
| 2.4.87 | Provisional tax paid |     | 9000 | 9000 |     |
|     | Balance (additional tax) owing |     | 1230 | 134(Cr) |     |
| 1.8.87 | 1987 Assessment Issued |     | 7800 | 7800 |     |
|     | Add: Additional Tax already assessed |     | 1230 | 1066 |     |
|     |     |     | 9030 | 8866 |     |
|     | Prev Tax Paid |     | 9000 | 9000 |     |
|     | Credit (refund) |     |     | 134 |     |
|     | Debit (cancelled) |     | 30  |     |     |
|     | \*Additional tax incurred | 1230 | +Additional tax recalculated |     |     |
|     |     |     | $l,066 |     |     |

In this example the effect of applying the new relief provision of section 413(2A) is that the amount of additional tax charged is reduced from $1,230 to $1,066.

_**Subsection (2)**_ of section 40 of this Amendment Act provides effectively that where the amount of additional tax to be remitted under this new relief provision exceeds $1000 the approval of the Minister of Finance must be obtained.

_**Subsection (3)**_ provides that the amendments made by section 39 apply with respect to the tax on income derived in the income year that commenced on 1 April 1985 and in every subsequent year. Therefore this section applies to 1986 and future years' provisional tax. In those circumstances where this section does not have application ie 1985 and previous years' provisional tax, the Department's previous administrative practice remains in force.

#### The Basis of Calculating Additional Tax on Provisional Tax

In amplification of the above it is appropriate to comment briefly on the provision which imposes additional tax on provisional tax.

Section 40 of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 2) 1985 substituted the previous section 398 of the principal Act with a provision that imposes 10% additional tax on any amount of tax outstanding after the last day for payment, and also imposes further additional tax of 10% on balances (including additional tax) that remain outstanding thereafter at six monthly intervals. _**Subsection (7)**_ of section 398, as so substituted, ensures that further incremental additional tax for late payment of provisional tax cannot be charged on any amount of outstanding provisional tax, or on additional tax charged on that provisional tax, after the day immediately preceding the due date for payment of the income tax that is payable for the income year in relation to which the amount by way of provisional tax was payable. This means that once the income tax for the income year for which the provisional tax was payable becomes due and payable there cannot be any further additional tax charged on the provisional tax in respect of any period ending on or after that due date.

Where the Commissioner allows a taxpayer further time, by way of new due date, to pay an amount of income tax, that new due date will apply only to the payment of that income tax and the calculation of any additional tax thereon. It will not affect the termination date for the charging of additional tax on provisional tax, which remains at the original due date.

### Section 41 - Officers And Employees of Corporate Bodies

This section inserts in the principal Act a new section 416A which provides that an officer or employee of a corporate body responsible for furnishing information or income tax returns to the Commissioner commits an offence if he or she fails to do so. The expression "officer" is defined, for the purposes of section 416A, in section 416A(1). The definition is simple and self-explanatory.

The penalty for this new offence is provided in section 416(3) of the principal Act.

The new section 416A applies to offences committed on or after 1 April 1986.

### Section 42 - Penalties For Offences

This section gives effect to the Government's decision to increase the maximum penalties for offences against the Income Tax Act. The penalties for all offences are also consolidated in a new section 416B. The maximum penalties provided for offences against the other inland Revenue Acts are not affected by this section.

#### Section 42(1)

This subsection inserts the new section 416B into the principal Act, increasing the maximum penalties for offences against the principal Act and consolidating them in one section. The new penalties are set out in Appendix 1 to this bulletin.

A feature of the new penalties is that the maximum penalties are increased for persons who have been convicted of offences or an offence against the principal Act on a previous occasion. The maximum penalties do not increase each time a taxpayer commits or is convicted of a single offence. The increase occurs on each occasion on which the taxpayer is convicted of one or more offences against the principal Act.

#### Example

#### Example

1.  Taxpayer fails to furnish income tax returns for the years ending 31 March 1985, 1986 and 1987. He is prosecuted and convicted of these offences on one occasion. The maximum penalties are:  
      
    
    |     |     |
    | --- | --- |
    | 1985 | $  500 |
    | 1986 | $2000 |
    | 1987 | $2000 |
    
2.    
      
    
3.  The same taxpayer later fails to furnish income tax returns for the years ending 31 March 1988 and 1989. He is prosecuted and convicted of these offences on one occasion. The maximum penalties are:  
      
    
    |     |     |
    | --- | --- |
    | 1988 | $4000 |
    | 1989 | $4000 |
    
4.    
      
    
5.  The same taxpayer later fails to furnish income tax returns for the years ending 31 March 1990 and 1991. He is prosecuted and convicted of these offences on one occasion. The maximum penalties are:  
      
    
    |     |     |
    | --- | --- |
    | 1990 | $6000 |
    | 1991 | $6000 |
    

#### Section 42(2)

This subsection removes from the principal Act all other references to penalties.

#### Section 42(3)

This subsection repeals amendments to legislation repealed by section 42(2) of this Amendment Act.

#### Section 42(4)

This subsection provides that the new penalties apply to offences committed on or after 1 April 1986.

#### Section 42(5)

This subsection provides that the maximum penalties for offences committed before 1 April 1986 are to be those provided in the principal Act prior to the enactment of this Amendment Act.

### Section 43 - Terminating Dates of Taxation Incentives

This section repeals the Third Schedule to the principal Act and substitutes a new schedule. The amendment has a two fold effect, it removes references to those export incentives available in terms of sections 156F, 156G and 158A of the principal Act and it extends the terminating date of sections 127, 127A and 128 from 31 March 1986 to 31 March 1987.

Sections 19 and 20 of this Amendment Act insert provisions for the phase out of the export-market development incentives contained in sections 156F and 156G of the principal Act. As the amendments effected by sections 19 and 20 remove the references to the "terminating date" in sections 156F and 156G and substitute specific phase-out provisions, it is necessary to remove the reference to those incentives in the Third Schedule.

Section 158A of the principal Act was repealed by section 26(1) of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 2) 1985 with effect from the income year that commenced on 1 April 1985. Accordingly the present amendment removes the reference to this incentive in the Third Schedule.

### Section 44 - Fringe Benefit Values

This section inserts a new Tenth Schedule into the Act with effect from 23 September 1985.

For the explanation on section 44 refer to the commentary on section 35 of this Amendment Act.

### Section 45 - Miscellaneous Amendments

This section makes a series of minor drafting amendments to the principal Act.

_**Subsection (1)**_ amends section 312(4) of the principal Act by deleting the reference to "paragraph (d)" of section 4(1) of the principal Act. The Income Tax Amendment Act (No 2) 1985 amended section 4 of the principal Act (meaning of term "dividends") by amalgamating paragraphs (b) and (d) of section 4 into a new paragraph (b). Paragraph (d) was thus repealed and the reference to it in section 312 is no longer valid.

_**Subsection (2)**_ of this section makes similar consequential amendments to section 313 as those made to section 312 by subsection (1). This subsection deletes the reference to "paragraph (d)" of section 4(1) of the principal Act in both places it occurs in section 313 (in subsections (1)(a) and (2)(a).)

_**Subsections (3), (4) and (5)**_ simply repeal spent provisions in various Amendment Acts from previous years.

_**Subsection (6)**_ corrects a drafting error in section 2(8)(a) of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 3) 1985. Paragraph 2(8)(a) should have referred to section 7(1)(c) of the Finance Act (No 2) 1981, NOT section 7(1).

Subsection (6) corrects that error.

Trading Stock and Accrual Expenditure
-------------------------------------

### Scope

1\. This item deals with the amendments made to the Income Tax Act by sections 8, 9, 10, 11 and 18 of the Income Tax Amendment Act 1987 and section 25 of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No.2) 1987. Those provisions enact the accrual tax accounting regime so far as it relates to trading stock and "accrual expenditure". They do not deal with the new tax accounting regime for financial arrangements.

### Trading Stock

2\. Amendments relating to the trading stock provisions of the Income Tax Act 1976 (the principal Act) are made by sections 8, 9, 10 and 18 of the Income Tax Amendment Act 1987. The most important of these is section 8, which amends the definition of "trading stock" in section 85(1) of the principal Act. The amendments made by sections 9, 10 and 18 provide consistency in the definitions of "trading stock" in other provisions of the principal Act.

### Section 8

3\. Section 8 amends the definition of "trading stock" in section 85(1) of the principal Act to -

1.  Include trading stock purchased but not on hand;
2.  Exclude financial arrangements dealt with under sections 64B to 64M of the principal Act; and
3.  Alter the layout of the section, although this last change is purely consequential and is intended simply to make section 85(1) easier to read following the other changes.

### Trading Stock Not On Hand

4\. The new section 85(1)(d) includes within the meaning of "trading stock" "anything in respect of which expenditure is incurred after the 23rd day of October 1986 and which, if possession of that thing were taken, would be trading stock ...".

5\. The reference to expenditure incurred after 23 October establishes the application date of the change: it relates only to expenditure incurred after 23 October 1986.

6\. The words "Anything .... which, if possession of that thing were taken, would be trading stock ..." is intended to deal with a gap that previously existed in the treatment of expenditure incurred on trading stock.

7\. Expenditure on trading stock is deductible under section 104 as it is incurred. To obtain the correct accrual tax accounting treatment of trading stock, section 85 provides that in calculating assessable income allowance must be made for the value of the taxpayer's trading stock at the beginning and end of the income year. Goods purchased for sale, manufacture, etc., of which possession has not yet been taken, may not, however, be trading stock, even though the taxpayer has obtained a deduction for the cost of those goods under section 104.

8\. Thus, until section 85(1)(d) was enacted a taxpayer might -

1.  Incur expenditure on goods acquired for resale, manufacture, etc., and be entitled to a deduction for the expenditure under section 104; and
2.  Not be required to bring the goods to account as trading stock if the goods were not delivered into the taxpayer's possession at balance date.

Section 85(1)(d) ensures that whether or not possession is taken of the goods they must be included in trading stock for the purposes of section 85. This will be the case if the goods have not yet been manufactured or ascertained (i.e., separately identified for delivery).

### Financial Arrangements

9\. The new section 85(1)(f) excludes financial arrangements dealt with under sections 64B to 64M from the definition of "trading stock".

10\. It is intended that sections 64B and 64M should provide a complete code for the income tax treatment of financial arrangements, including financial arrangements held as trading stock. It was therefore necessary to provide that section 85 shall not apply in relation to financial arrangements.

11\. The exclusion applies only to financial arrangements the tax treatment of which is governed by sections 64B to 64M. The exclusion does not apply to -

1.  An excepted financial arrangement, except to the extent that -
    1.  It is part of a financial arrangement; and
    2.  The gain or loss on the excepted financial arrangement is treated as income deemed to be derived or expenditure deemed to be incurred in respect of the financial arrangement:
2.  A financial arrangement issued or acquired by the taxpayer before the "implementation date" (as defined in section 64B(1)) for the financial arrangement:
3.  A financial arrangement held by a non-resident if the financial arrangement is not held for the purposes of a business carried on by the non-resident through a fixed establishment in New Zealand.

### Sections 9, 10 and 18

12\. Sections 9, 10 and 18 of the Amendment Act amend sections 90(1), 91(1), and 197(1), respectively, of the principal Act. Each of the amended provisions is a definition of "trading stock", and each is amended consistent with the amendment to section 85(1).

### Accrual Expenditure

13\. The new section 104A, as inserted by section 11 of the Income Tax Amendment Act 1987 and amended by section 25 of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No.2) 1987, provides an accrual regime for expenditure complementary to the accrual rules for financial arrangements. The new section is not included in sections 64B to section 64M as it is concerned with expenditure other than expenditure relating to financial arrangements and represents a significant qualification of section 104 (the principal deductions provision).

### Mischief

14\. As noted in the 1986 Budget many tax avoidance schemes depend upon deficiencies in the rules governing the timing of tax deductions and the derivation of income. Under section 104 of the Act a deduction is allowed for expenditure as it is incurred, i.e., when the taxpayer is under a legal obligation to make payment, not when payment is actually made. Given that a deduction could be taken in advance of actual payment there were obvious cashflow advantages in advancing the point in time at which an obligation to make payment was assumed. The new section 104A removes such timing anomalies by introducing a regime similar to the treatment of trading stock for expenditure that is wholly or partly attributable to income years other than the year in which the expenditure is incurred.

### General Structure

15\. The definitions for this provision are provided in section 104A(1) and (2). The operative provisions, setting out the required tax accounting treatment of accrual expenditure, are in section 104A(3) and (4). Section 104A(5) and (6) provides a mechanism under which the Commissioner may exempt taxpayers from the tax accrual requirements of section 104A.

### Definitions

**"Accrual Expenditure"**

16\. The definition of "accrual expenditure" defines the types of expenditure to which the provision applies and fixes the effective application date of the provision.

17\. The effective application date of section 104A is fixed in the definition of "accrual expenditure" by -

1.  The reference to "expenditure incurred on or after the 1st day of August 1986"; and
2.  The exclusion, in paragraph (d) of the definition, or expenditure incurred pursuant to a binding contract entered into before 8.30 pm New Zealand Standard Time on 31 July 1986.

Thus section 104A applies to all accrual expenditure incurred on or after 1 August 1986, except expenditure incurred under a binding contract entered into before 8.30 pm on 31 July 1986. Persons having a 1986 balance date between 31 July 1986 to 30 September 1986 may be affected in relation to their 1986 income tax returns.

18\. "Accrual expenditure" is expenditure that is deductible under the Income Tax Act other than expenditure incurred -

1.  In the purchase of trading stock;
2.  In respect of any financial arrangement;
3.  In respect of a lease to which sections 222A and 222E of the Act apply; or
4.  Pursuant to a binding contract entered into before 8.30 pm New Zealand Standard Time on 31 July 1986.

19\. Accrual expenditure does not include expenditure which, though it has been incurred, is not deductible -

1.  Under any other provision in the Income Tax Act;
2.  By virtue of an express prohibition on the deductibility of that expenditure (e.g., capital expenditure, section 106(1)(a) refers; expenditure for private or domestic purposes, section 106(1)(j) refers).

20\. Expenditure incurred in the purchase of trading stock is excluded because there is a general accrual tax accounting provision for trading stock in section 85 of the Act. "Trading stock" is defined in section 104A(1) as having the same meaning as in section 85 of the Act, so the exclusion does not cover land that is trading stock. This means that a person who buys or develops land (including buildings and other fixtures to land) must account for that land for income tax purposes according to section 104A.

21\. Expenditure in respect of a financial arrangement is excluded because an accrual tax accounting regime is provided for financial arrangements in sections 64B to 64M of the Act. "Financial arrangement" is defined in section 104A(1) as having the same meaning as in section 64B(1) of the Act.

22\. Leases to which sections 222A to 222E of the Act apply are excluded because those sections provide an accrual tax accounting regime for such leases. The exclusion does not cover leases of real property, livestock or bloodstock.

23\. Paragraph (d) of the definition, which refers to binding contracts entered into on or before 8.30 pm New Zealand Standard Time on 31 July 1986, is discussed at paragraph 17 above. It is intended to ensure that no one is disadvantaged by the enactment of section 104A because they are bound to incur expenditure after 31 July 1986 due to the terms of a contract that was binding upon them before the 1986 Budget announcement of the new policy.

24\. The intention in enacting paragraph (d) of the definition requires that it be interpreted reasonably liberally. Where a contract is binding on one party before 8.30 pm on 31 July 1986 but not on others, the person on whom it was binding before 8.30 pm on 31 July 1986 should be given the advantage of the exclusion, but not the other parties.

**"Goods"**

25\. For the purposes of section 104A "goods" means all real or personal property but does not include money or a chose in action. The classes of goods that are of most significance will be consumable aids generally and real property.

26\. Consumable aids are goods, other than capital goods, that are consumed in the manufacturing or sales process but are not part of what is delivered to the customer. In an engineering process, for example, welding rods (which become part of the finished product) are to be treated as trading stock, while welding flux (which does not become part of the finished product) is a consumable aid.

27\. Real property is immovable property: land and things (such as buildings, dams, roads, etc) that are so fixed to the land that they are a part of it. In general this will affect only persons whose business is dealing in land or developing land for sale. Expenditure incurred otherwise in relation to the purchase of land is generally not deductible, being either capital expenditure or expenditure of a private or domestic nature.

**"Services"**

28\. For the purposes of section 104A, "services" means anything that is not goods or money or a chose in action. It includes repairs and maintenance work (but not the goods supplied in carrying out repairs or maintenance), telecommunications services, transport services, and advice and the application of labour, skills, knowledge, or equipment generally.

**"Chose in Action"**

29\. The expression "chose in action" is not defined for section 104A and therefore is to be given its generally accepted meaning. A "chose in action" is a right enforceable by legal action. Examples are leases of land and royalty agreements. (See also paragraphs 41 to 44 below).

### The Unexpired Portion

30\. Section 104A(2) defines the unexpired portion of any accrual expenditure. Separate definitions are provided for the unexpired portion of accrual expenditure-

1.  Relating to the purchase of goods,
2.  Incurred on services, and
3.  Relating to payment for, or in relation to, a chose in action.

### In Relation to Goods

31\. The unexpired portion of accrual expenditure that relates to the purchase of goods is the amount of expenditure incurred on goods not used in the production of assessable income. At each balance date therefore it is necessary to determine how much of the original expenditure incurred on goods relates to goods not yet used in producing assessable income. The residue of the original expenditure attributable of such goods is the unexpired portion of that expenditure.

32\. Accrual expenditure that relates to the purchase of goods includes -

1.  The price paid for the goods, and
2.  The costs associated with the purchase, such as any brokerage, government imposts, solicitors' and agents' fees and delivery costs. It therefore includes the cost of certain services.

33\. Where a taxpayer holds goods purchased before 1 August 1986 or purchased pursuant to a binding contract entered into before 8.30 pm New Zealand Standard Time on 31 July 1986, as well as goods that do not fall within those classes, it will be necessary to distinguish them. The cost of goods purchased prior to the effective application date is not accrual expenditure, and therefore is not to be treated as or including an unexpired portion if the goods are still held at balance date.

34\. In distinguishing expenditure that is excluded by the effective application date or by paragraph (d) of the definition of "accrual expenditure", taxpayers should give consideration to actual usage wherever reasonably possible. If the actual usage cannot be determined with reasonable accuracy a first-in-first-out accounting method is to be used.

### Meaning of "Used"

35\. A good is used in the production of assessable income when it is applied, consumed, put into operation, or otherwise employed, in the process that produces assessable income. It is not sufficient that it be available for use, and in particular it is not sufficient that the goods be available for examination or sale.

### In Relation to Services

36\. The unexpired portion of accrual expenditure that relates to payment of services is the amount incurred on services not performed.

### Meaning of "Performed"

37\. Services are performed where and to the extent that they are executed, carried out, or otherwise rendered. Where they are to be performed over a period of time there must be an apportionment if the time period includes a balance date. The reference to "services not yet performed" indicates clearly that the apportionment must be on the basis of the services yet to be performed in relation to the total services to be performed in consideration for the expenditure, rather than on a simple time basis.

38\. Accrual expenditure that relates to services includes -

1.  The price paid for the services; and
2.  Costs related to the services, such as any solicitors' fees or government or local body levies.

### In Relation to a Chose in Action

39\. The unexpired portion of accrual expenditure that relates to a payment for, or in relation to, a chose in action is the amount that relates to the unexpired part of the period in relation to which the chose is enforceable.

40\. A "chose in action" is literally a thing recoverable by (legal) action. Its modern use is to describe all personal rights of property that may be claimed or enforced by legal action including rights in relation to real property.

41\. In determining the amount of expenditure that relates to the unexpired part of the period in relation to which rights under the chose in action are enforceable, one must consider the rights that may be exercised in relation to the part period. For example where an agreement provides for use of patent rights and it is expected with reasonable certainty (or is provided in the agreement) that the use of the patent rights will be -

1.  15,000 units produced in the 6 months prior to balance date, and
2.  85,000 units produced in the 6 months after balance date, -

The apportionment to calculate the unexpired portion will be on an output basis (85 percent of the accrual expenditure) rather than a simple time basis.

### Operative Provisions

42\. The operative provisions of section 104A are subsections (3) and (4). They require that the unexpired portion of accrual expenditure be -

1.  Deducted in the income year in which it is incurred (section 104A(3));
2.  Added back to assessable income for that year (section 104A)); and
3.  Deducted in the following income year (section 104A(4)).

The deduction in the following income year is subject to the same accrual provisions (section 104A(3)). The treatment is based on the income tax treatment of trading stock (section 85 refers ).

**_Example: Goods_**

43\. Company X purchases lubricating oil which is stored in a tank. It is not possible to tell which lot of oil is being consumed at any time.

**Purchases**

| Date | Price | Quantity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 31 March 1986 | $2/litre | 100 litres |
| 30 June 1986 | $2.10/litre | 20 litres |
| 30 August 1986 | $2.05/litre | 30 litres |
| 31 October 1986 | $2.08/litre | 20 litres |
| 13 January 1987 | $2.15/litre | 20 litres |
| 15 March 1987 | $2.15/litre | 20 litres |

Stock on hand at balance date (31 March 1987): 45 litres.

Amount deductible for year ended 31 March 1987

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 20 litres @ $2.10 | $42.00 |
| 30 litres @ $2.05 | 61.50 |
| 20 litres @ $2.08 | 41.60 |
| 20 litres @ $2.15 | 43.00 |
| 20 litres @ $2.15 | 43.00 |
|     | $231.10 |

Amount to be added back to income for the year ended 31 March 1987

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 20 litres @ $2.15 | $43.00 |
| 20 litres @ $2.15 | 43.00 |
| 5 litres @ $2.08 | 10.04 |
|     | $96.04 |

Example: Services

44\. Company Y engages the services of an advertising agency. Payment of $44,000 is made on 30 September 1987 for services to be performed over the following twelve months. Half of the total service is performed in the first month (October 1987) with even performance thereafter.

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (a) | Income Year ended 31 March 1988 |     |     |
|     | Deduction under section 104 |     | $44,000 |
|     | Unexpired portion | $12,000 |     |
|     | Included in assessable income |     | $12,000 |
|     | Net deduction |     | $32,000 |
| (b) | Income Year ended 31 March 1989 |     |     |
|     | Deduction under section 104A(4) |     | $12,000 |

**_Example: Chose in Action_**

45\. Company Z enters into a three year lease commencing on 1 April 1987 for a building at an annual rent of $20,000. On 31 March 1987 the company pays all of the rental payable under the lease. The company claims a deduction for $60,000 in its 1987 tax return. The building is to be wholly used in the production of assessable income so the $60,000 payment is deductible under section 104. Section 104A would apply to the payment as follows:

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (a) | Income Year ended 31 March 1987 |     |     |
|     | Deduction under section 104 |     | $60,000 |
|     | Unexpired portion (Section 104A(2)) | $60,000 |     |
|     | Included in assessable income |     |     |
|     | (Section 104A(4)) |     | $60,000 |
|     | Net deduction |     | Nil |
| (b) | Income Year ended 31 March 1988 |     |     |
|     | Deduction under section 104A(4) |     | $60,000 |
|     | Unexpired portion | $40,000 |     |
|     | Included in assessable income |     | $40,000 |
|     | Net deduction |     | $20,000 |
| (c) | Income Year ended 31 March 1989 |     |     |
|     | Deduction under section 104A(4) |     | $40,000 |
|     | Unexpired portion | $20,000 |     |
|     | Included in assessable income |     | $20,000 |
|     | Net deduction |     | $20,000 |
| (d) | Income Year ended 31 March 1990 |     |     |
|     | Deduction under section 104A(4) |     | $20,000 |
|     | Unexpired portion | Nil |     |
|     | Included in assessable income |     | Nil |
|     | Net deduction |     | $20,000 |

By this mechanism the $60,000 payment made on 31 March 1987 is spread evenly over the period to which it relates. In each year the unexpired portion included in assessable income is that part of the original amount of accrual expenditure that relates to future income years.

### Commissioner's Power to Exempt

46\. In view of the cost of complying with section 104A provision has been made for the Commissioner to determine whether and to what extent a person or class of persons may be exempted from the requirements of section 104A. The legislation granting this power is section 104A(5) and (6).

47\. Sections 104(5) and (6) are not in themselves an exemption. A taxpayer may not rely on them in claiming an exemption from the requirements of section 104A. It is necessary to rely on a determination made by the Commissioner.

48\. At the time of writing this item the Commissioner had made one determination, which taxpayers generally may apply where the requirements of the determination are satisfied, and two applications had been received for determinations relating to the affairs of particular taxpayers. It is not intended to issue any further general determinations under section 104A(5) in the immediate future unless applications reveal a need to do so.

49\. Section 104A(5) provides as follows:

*   "(5) For the purposes of this section the Commissioner may determine whether and to what extent any person or class of persons shall not be required to comply with this section in relation to any accrual expenditure incurred by the person, having regard to -
    *   "(a) The nature and amount of the kinds of accrual expenditure regularly incurred by the person or class of persons:
    *   "(b) The nature and size of the activity giving rise to the item or items of accrual expenditure incurred by the person or class of persons:
    *   "(c) The costs of the person or class of persons in complying with this section in relation to the accrual expenditure incurred by the person or persons:
    *   "(d) Whether, in respect of that person or class of persons and the item or items of accrual expenditure, the difference between expenditure that is determined under this section (other than this subsection) and expenditure that would be deductible if the discretion given to the Commissioner under this subsection were exercised, is not a material amount."

50\. Any request for a determination to be made under section 104A(5) should be referred to the Accruals Unit, Inland Revenue Head Office. It should identify the person making the determination and should be justified by reference to one or more of the provisions of section 104A(5). Where it relates to the affairs of a particular taxpayer the application should be supported by copies of the last three years' income tax and financial accounts, budgets for the current year, and an explanation of usage and purchasing policy in relation to the accrual expenditure for which exemption is sought.

51\. Section 104A(6) allows the Commissioner to cancel any determination made under section 104A(5).

Income Tax Amendment Act 1987
=============================

Archived legislative commentary on the Income Tax Amendment Act 1987 from PIB vol 167 Dec 1987.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 167, December 1987

[More information about _Public Information Bulletins_.](/about/about-our-publications)
 

Procedure for Applying for and Making Determinations Under Section 64E(1) Income Tax Act 1976
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Income Tax Amendment Act 1987, together with the amendments made in the Income Tax Amendment (No.2) Act 1987, inserts into the Income Tax Act 1976 new sections 64B to 64M which provide for the accrual tax treatment of income and expenditure relating to financial arrangements. The scheme of the new sections relies upon the Commissioner making and publishing binding determinations stating how the accruals regime will apply in particular circumstances. The procedure for making determinations is contained in the Income Tax (Determinations) Regulations 1987 which came into force on 16 April 1987.

**1\. Background**

In summary, section 64C of the Income Tax Act 1976 provides -

1.1 The yield to maturity method is to be the basic method of calculating income or expenditure in relation to a financial arrangement so that an amount that is "flair and reasonable" is allocated to each income year:

1.2 Where it is not possible to calculate income or expenditure using the yield to maturity method, a method prescribed by the Commissioner in a determination may be used (section 64C(3)).

1.3 However, the Commissioner must accept an alternative method to the methods referred to 1.1 and 1.2 above if the alternative method:

*   Has regard to the principles of accrual accounting;
*   Conforms with commercially acceptable practice;
*   Is consistently applied by a taxpayer in respect of all such financial arrangements for financial reporting purposes; and
*   Results in the allocation to each income year of amounts not materially different from the amounts that would be calculated under the methods referred to in 1.1 and 1.2 above. (Provisos to section 64C(2) and 64C(3)(a)). It is not necessary for a taxpayer to seek a determination from the Commissioner in order to apply such an alternative method.

1.4 Finally, the Commissioner must accept a method that has regard to market valuation in the circumstances outlined in section 64C(4).

**2\. Determinations**

Section 64E of the Income Tax Act and the Income Tax (Determinations) Regulations 1987 made under the Act outline a procedure for the Commissioner at his discretion to make determinations in relation to the matters set out in section 64E(1). Such determinations may be-made:

2.1 In response to an application for a determination by a person who issues or holds or intends to issue or hold a financial arrangement; or

2.2 At the Commissioner's own instigation. The procedure is outlined below.

### Application for Determination

**3\. Commissioner may Make Determination on Matters in Section 64E(1)**

The Income Tax (Determinations) Regulations 1987 prescribe the procedure to be followed when a person issuing or holding (or intending to issue or hold) a financial arrangement seeks a determination from the Commissioner on one of the matters referred to in section 64E(1), i.e., -

3.1 How the yield to Maturity method is to be applied to a particular financial arrangement;

3.2 The method for determining income or expenditure where it is not possible to calculate income or expenditure using the yield to Maturity method;

3.3 The method for determining income or expenditure where a person opts for an alternative method to

1.  the yield to Maturity method (under the proviso to subsection 64C(2); or
2.  the method outlined by the Commissioner in a determination referred to in 3.2 above (under the proviso to section 64C(3)(a));

3.4 The market, the method, and the sources of information to be used to determine market values where a market valuation method of calculating income or expenditure is used;

3.5 The method for determining the part of the income or expenditure, acquisition price, or consideration that is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement where that is part of a financial arrangement (both terms are defined in section 64B);

3.6 The method for determining the discounted value of amounts payable for goods or services under trade credits.

**4\. Fees Payable on Application (Regulations 3 and 11)**

A person applying for a determination is required to pay the fees prescribed pursuant to Regulations 3 and 11. A schedule of fees payable in respect of applications will be published (Reg. 10). The fee payable under Regulations 3 (the application fee) must accompany the application form.

The fee payable under Regulation 11 (prior to the Commissioner publishing the determination) is to cover costs which are additional to the fixed costs of the Department in administering the determinations process and which were incurred by the Department in considering the individual application. These would include for instance the fee charged by a consultant making submissions on the application.

A schedule of fees is being prepared.

**5\. Documents to Accompany Application (Regulation 3(1))**

The form for an application for a determination (form IR 430) should be completed and the following documents should be attached to that application form -

5.1 A draft determination - the form of which is outlined in 5.6 below

5.2 Copies of documents relevant to the application

5.3 Written submissions in support of the application

5.4 Any other particulars necessary for understanding the effect of the determination; and

5.5 Where an anonymity notification is given, an anonymous version of the draft determination (refer to paragraph 10 below).

5.6 Form of Draft Determination (Schedule) The draft determination to be attached to the application for a determination is to be in the form set out in the Schedule to the Regulations, i.e., it should contain the following:

1.  Explanation: a preamble describing the financial arrangement and outlining the determination applied for;
2.  Reference: a section of the Income Tax Act under which the determination is sought and the relationship of the determination to other determinations;
3.  Scope of determination: relevant details of the financial arrangement or class of financial arrangements to which the determination is to apply;
4.  Principle: a description of the accrual and mathematical concepts that are applied to the financial arrangement;
5.  Interpretation: definitions of any specialised term in the draft determination;
6.  Method: the application of the Principle in (d) above to the financial arrangement outlined in the Scope of Determination in (c) above;
7.  Example: one or more examples of the application of the method.

5.7 **Compliance with Requirements on Form of Application (Regulation 3(2))** If the application has the attachments referred to in paragraph 5, in the form required, the Commissioner will record the application in a register and advise the applicant of the date of registration. If an application does not comply with the requirements of Regulation 3(1) the Commissioner may accept and register it or return it to the applicant outlining the respects in which it fails to comply.

**6\. Withdrawal or Amendment of Application (Regulation 3(6) and (7))**

An application may be amended or withdrawn at any time by written notice from the applicant.

**7\. Authority of Commissioner to Make Determinations is Discretionary (Regulation 4(1)(b))**

The Commissioner is not required to make a determination under section 64E(1) : he exercises a discretion in doing so. He may therefore decline to make a determination.

**8\. Consultant(s) may be Invited to Consider Application (Regulation 9)**

In considering an application, the Commissioner may invite submissions from any person. It is proposed that the Department will select a number of highly qualified and experienced consultants to form a panel, any member of which the Commissioner may consult on a particular application. At the Commissioner's request, the consultant may advise on the application, and may attend a conference with the applicant (see paragraph 9.1 below).

There is provision on the application form for the consent of the applicant to the disclosure to a consultant of information in, and attached to, the application.

**9\. Commissioner to Prepare Draft Determination (Regulation 5)**

Prior to making a determination, the Commissioner will prepare a draft determination in relation to the application and send to the applicant a copy of the draft determination and his reasons for the determination.

9.1 Conference on Draft Determination May be Held Provision is made at this stage for the Commissioner to hold a conference to discuss the draft determination should he or an applicant wish to do so. The applicant must notify the Commissioner within 10 working days after a date set by the Commissioner that he wishes the Commissioner to hold a conference. If a conference is to be held the Commissioner will appoint a date (not later than 20 days after the expiration of that 10 day period), time, and place for the conference and will notify the application. At the conference, the Commissioner, applicant and anyone nominated by them are entitled to be present. It is intended that the conference be informal and provide the taxpayer and Commissioner with a reasonable opportunity to express their views on the draft determination. The Commissioner may make a determination at any time following the conference. If the applicant does not notify the Commissioner that they wish the Commissioner to hold a conference, or if advise the Commissioner that they do not wish the Commissioner to hold a conference, the Commissioner may then make the determination.

9.2 The Commissioner may make a determination without following the procedure outlined in paragraph 9 and 9.1 above, where his determination complies with the draft determination submitted by the applicant, or where the applicant waives the requirements to follow that procedure or where the Commissioner issues independently a determination incorporating the matter for which the application is made.

**10\. Anonymity Notification (Regulation 8)**

There is provision on the application form for an applicant to notify the Commissioner that they do not wish their identity to become publicly known.

In this case, in addition to the draft determination accompanying the application, the applicant submits an anonymous version of the draft determination edited to remove identifying references. The Commissioner then prepares for publication an anonymous version of the determination removing any identifying particulars which can be omitted from the published version of the determination without affecting its value.

Commissioner may make a Determination Independently

In addition to his discretion to make a determination in response to an application under section 64E(3), the Commissioner may independently make a determination in relation to the matters outlined in paragraph 3 above.

The following paragraphs are applicable to determinations made under section 64E(1) whether independently by the Commissioner or in response to an application from a taxpayer.

**11\. Publication of Determinations (Section 64E(7) and Regulation 10)**

Determinations are to be published in the _Gazette_ within 30 days after they are made.

**12\. Determinations to be Binding Section 64E(2) and (9))**

Where the Commissioner has made a determination which is applied by a person, the Commissioner must assess that person in accordance with the determination.

Determinations made in relation to the matters referred to in paragraphs 3.1, 3.2, 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6 above are binding upon taxpayers for the purposes of the new sections 64B to 64M of the Act. Determinations made in relation to the matters referred to in paragraph 3.3 above are binding upon the Commissioner only.

**13\. Right of Appeal (Section 64E(4) and (5))**

A person issuing or holding a financial arrangement in respect of which the Commissioner has made a determination and who is dissatisfied with the determination may object to it. A notice of objection must -

*   be in writing,
*   identify the determination objected to,
*   state shortly the grounds of objection,
*   be given to the Commissioner within one month after the date on which notice of the determination was published.

An objection is treated in the same way as an objection to an assessment under Part III of the Income Tax Act 1976. However, sections 3 and 4 of the Amendment Act amend sections 32 and 33 of the Income Tax Act to restrict the powers of the Taxation Review Authority and High Court in relation to determinations. The TRA and High Court have no power to make a determination or alter the determination but are limited to directing the Commissioner to issue a fresh determination under section 64E(6) which conforms to the decision of the TRA or High Court.

Section 30(2) of the Income Tax Act 1976 also applies to an objection to a determination. The Commissioner may in his discretion accept a late objection and notify the objector accordingly.

**14\. Variation of Determinations (Section 64E(6))**

The Commissioner has power to make a fresh determination which varies an existing determination, rescinds it, or restricts or extends it in scope. The Commissioner shall not require a person to apply that fresh determination in relation to financial arrangements acquired or issued by him before publication of the fresh determination until four years after publication of the fresh determination.

For example, a taxpayer may apply for a determination on the treatment of a swap arrangement and the Commissioner in response may make a determination on that arrangement. The taxpayer has the right then to apply that determination. If, after two years, the Commissioner makes a fresh determination which varies the original determination, the taxpayer may continue to apply the original determination in relation to his existing swap arrangements for a further four years.

Determinations Made Under Sections 64C(6) and 104A(5)

The procedures outlined above only apply to determinations made under section 64E(1) of the Income Tax Act 1976. There are quite separate powers in sections 64C(6) and 104A(5) for the Commissioner to determine the matters referred to there.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Section 64C(6) | The Commissioner may determine whether and to what extent an issuer (or class of issuers) of a financial arrangement is not required to comply with that section. |
| Section 104A(5) | The Commissioner may determine whether and to what extent any person (or class) is not required to comply with section 104A. |

Such determinations may be cancelled at any time (sections 64C(7) and 104A(6)) and the objection procedures under Part III of the Income Tax Act do not apply in respect of them.

Any persons seeking a determination under either section should apply in writing to the Commissioner outlining the reasons for exemption from the requirements to comply with that section and providing a draft of the determination that is sought.

[Relationships (Statutory References) Bill](/new-legislation/act-articles/relationships-statutory-references-bill "Relationships (Statutory References) Bill")

Income Tax Amendment Act 2005
=============================

2005 amendments to the Income Tax Act give recognition to civil unions, some de facto relationships and defer the recognition of same sex relationships to Apr 2007.

The amendments to this Act are in two parts. Part 1 came into force on 26 April 2005, and Part 2 takes effect from 1 April 2007.

Most changes in Part 1 give recognition to civil unions, while those in Part 2 extend recognition to de facto relationships. However, where the defined term "spouse" already applied, especially in the family assistance provisions in subpart KD, the amendments preserve the recognition of de facto relationships between a man and a woman. For those provisions, it is only the recognition of same-sex de facto relationships that is deferred until 1 April 2007, to give those couples time to adjust their personal and financial affairs, if necessary.

Although in Part 1 the defined term "de facto relationship" in section OB 1 takes its meaning from the new section 29A of the Interpretation Act 1999, it is limited for the purposes of the Income Tax Act to relationships between a man and a woman. That term and the related "de facto partner" are omitted in Part 2, with effect from 1 April 2007, when they take their full meaning from the Interpretation Act and include same-sex relationships and partners.

#### Replacement of "spouse" with "spouse or civil union partner"

Amendments to replace "spouse" with "spouse or civil union partner" from 26 April 2005 and to also include "de facto partner" from 1 April 2007 are in sections CB 19 (1), CB 20(1), CD 5(1), CD 14(9), CD 19(1), CD 33 (16), CE 5(2) and (3), the definition of "pension" in CF 1, CW 26, CW 38, CX 15, DB 34, DC 2, DC 3, FF 1, GD 4, KC 4, LD 1, OB 1 (the definition "separated person"), and OD 8.

#### Replacement of "spouse" with "spouse, civil union partner, or de facto partner" in Part 1

Some amendments in Part 1 include de facto partners as well as civil union partners because they take up the previous definition of spouse that included people in a relationship in the nature of marriage. They are, however, limited to relationships between a man and a woman until 1 April 2007. They are: KC 3, KD 1A, KD 2, KD 2AAA, KD 2AA, KD 2AB, KD 3, KD 3A, KD 4, KD 5, KD 5B, KD 6, KD 7, and OB 1 (replacement paragraph (b) of the definition "eligible period", the definition "full-time earner", and the definition "fully employed person").

#### Replacement of "matrimonial agreement" with "relationship agreement"

Amendments to replace "matrimonial agreement" with "relationship agreement", all in Part 1, are to sections CE 3(4), CZ 6, DZ 1, EE 34, EE 38, EW 10, EZ 11, EZ 20, EZ 42, FB 4, FC 5, FF 1, FF 2, FF 3, FF 4, FF 5, FF 6, FF 7, FF 8, FF 9, FF 10, FF 11, FF 12, FF 13, FF 14, FF 15, FF 16, FF 18, FF 19, GD 1, and OB 1 (the definitions "date of transfer", "income year of transfer", "transferee", "transferor", and "type").

#### Inserting references to civil unions and de facto relationships

Amendments to insert a reference to civil union where there are existing references to marriage are in DC 2, DC 3, and OB 3. The provisions are further amended from 1 April 2007 to insert references to de facto relationships. However, the reference to "marriage" in section HH 3F(3) is replaced with "marriage or partnership" because the provision already recognises de facto relationships and is being extended to include civil unions. The meaning of "marriage or partnership" is clarified in new paragraph HH 3F(4)(b).

Section CS 4 is replaced in Part 1 to include reference to civil union and the new section 2AB(2) of the Property (Relationships) Act 1976.

#### Unmarried persons

In the definition of "child" in section OB 1, the words "an unmarried person who" are replaced in Part 1 with "a person who is not in a marriage, civil union, or de facto relationship between a man and a woman, and who". The words "between a man and a woman" are omitted in Part 2, when the term "de facto relationship" takes its full meaning from the Interpretation Act 1999 on 1 April 2007.

#### Housekeeper rebate

The definitions in section KC 4 are instrumental in determining entitlement to the tax rebate. The limitation to people who are married has had a two-way effect, with the definition of "communal home" creating a disadvantage for married persons, the definition of "housekeeper" creating a disadvantage for de facto partners, and the definition of "separated person" creating a disadvantage for those who have been in a de facto relationship. Civil union partners are to be included through the amendments in Part 1, while de facto partners are included in the Part 2 amendments.

#### Other definitions in section OB 1

There is a new definition of "civil union partner" to make it clear that when the term is used in the specified provisions it does not include a separated person. The definition of "spouse" is also replaced to have the same effect.

The definition "matrimonial agreement" is omitted in Part 1 and the new definition "relationship agreement" is inserted with reference to relevant provisions in the Property (Relationships) Act 1976.

The definition "relative" is amended to include references to civil unions in Part 1 and de facto relationships in Part 2. The most significant effect of the amendment is to broaden the scope of the associated persons" rules.

Income Tax Amendment Act (No 2) 1985
====================================

Archived legislative commentary on the Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 2) 1985 from PIB vol 136 May 1985.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 136, May 1985

[More information about _Public Information Bulletins_.](/about/about-our-publications)
 

### Section 1: Short Title

This provides for the Amendment Act to be read with and form part of the Income Tax Act 1976.

### Section 2: Application

The provisions of this Amendment Act apply to tax on income derived in the income year which commenced on the 1st day of April 1984, unless otherwise stated in the Amendment Act. Some provisions in the Amendment Act have effect from the date on which it received the Governor-General's assent. The Amendment Act was assented to on 23 March 1985.

It is important to check the commencement date when applying any of the amending sections. The commentary which follows will bring this out.

### Section 3: Interpretation

Subsection (1) of this section repeals the definition of "basic rates" and substitutes a new definition. This substituted definition omits all reference to bonus issue tax which was repealed in the 1982 legislation.

Subsection (2) - Definition of the expression "money lent".

In 1983 definitions of the expressions "interest" and "money lent" were introduced to the Income Tax Act 1976 by the Income Tax Amendment Act 1983 (refer TPC 84/2, Part I for explanation).

This subsection amends the definition of "money lent" to make it clear, in respect the types of transaction covered by paragraph (d) of the definition, that where the money lent is applied for the benefit of or on behalf of a person rather than directly to him, there is nevertheless "money lent" from which "interest" arises.

**Example:**

*   A person has a debt of $100,000.
*   He goes to a financier to whom he sells a promise to pay $120,000 in six months, for $100,000.
*   He uses the $100,000, received from the financier for his promise, to pay his debt.
*   Six months later he pays the financier $120,000 in accordance with his promise.

In terms of the definition of "money lent" as it was immediately before this amendment and as it is under the new paragraph (d), the $100,000 is clearly "money lent" and consequently the $20,000 received by the financier at the end of the six months over and above the $100,000 originally provided, is "interest".

However, if the example is changed so that instead of the financier paying the $100,000 to the person giving the promise to pay, the person arranges for the financier to pay the $100,000 directly to the person's creditor in return for the same promise, the old paragraph (d) of "money lent" did not catch such a transaction. The amended paragraph (d) of the definition of "money lent" ensures that even where, as in this example, the person giving the promise to pay a greater amount in the future does not receive the amount paid for the promise but the amount is paid "for the benefit of, or on behalf of, or dealt with in the interest of or on behalf of" that person giving the promise, that amount is nevertheless "money lent" and the "profit" ($20,000 in the example) to the person who paid for the promise and received its proceeds, is "interest".

Subsection (3) of section 3 provides that the amendment to the definition of "money lent" made under subsection (2) is to apply with respect to income which is interest that is derived from money lent under a binding contract entered into on or after 29 July 1983. This date is the original application date for the definition of "money lent" and accordingly the new form of paragraph (d) applies from the beginning of the interest regime and the definition of money lent as introduced by the Income Tax Amendment Act 1983.

### Section 4: Dividends

(a) **Amalgamation of Two Existing Paragraphs**

_Subsection (1)_ amends the definition of dividends in section 4 of the . principal Act.

Paragraph (b) of section 4(1) of the principal Act which dealt with company distributions of property to shareholders, and paragraph (d) of the same section, concerning the sale of company property to shareholders for inadequate consideration, have been repealed and replaced by a new paragraph (b). The new paragraph clarifies the position of non-cash distributions.

Where property is distributed to shareholders in any manner the market price of the property, on the day it is distributed, is deemed to be a dividend. Where company property is distributed to a shareholder for inadequate consideration, the difference between the market price and any consideration provided will be deemed to be a dividend in the shareholder's hands. If, for any reason the market price is not available, a determination will be made by the Department.

This subsection applies on and from the date of assent of this Amendment Act by the Governor-General, (23 March 1985).

(b) **"In Specie" Distributions**

_Subsections (2), (3), (5) and (6)_ provide that the capital gain content of an "in specie" distribution to shareholders in the winding up of a company is exempt from tax.

Prior to the amendment where an "in specie" distribution of assets was made to shareholders on the winding up of a private company, the distribution was taxed as a dividend to the shareholders to the extent that the current value of assets distributed exceeded the amount of the company's paid up capital. This treatment was considered to be anomalous compared with the situation where assets were realised on winding up. In those circumstances the excess selling price over cost would not be treated as a dividend, in terms of the proviso to section 4(5A).

_Subsection (2)_ adds a proviso to paragraph (c) of section 4(1). The amendment provides that the portion of the market price of the asset transferred to the shareholder which exceeds:

*   The cost price of the asset, plus
*   Any capital losses incurred in the year in which the distribution is made -

will not be deemed to be a dividend.

**Example:**

Paid up capital of X Ltd (500 shares of $1)  $500

Shares held by:

**Mr A:** 499

**Mrs A:** 1

| Assets | Cost Price | Market Price |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Building 1 | 30,000 | 50,000 |
| Building 2 | 40,000 | 30,000 |

On 1 April 1985 Building 2 is sold for $30,000, ie, a capital loss of $10,000 is incurred. On 30 June 1985 the company is wound up. Mr A receives Building 1 in return for his shares. The amount deemed to be a dividend is calculated as follows:

|     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Market Price of Building 1 |     |     |     |     | $ 50,000 |
| Less paid up value of shares |     |     |     |     |     |
| (Allowable under section 4(1)(c)) |     |     |     |     | 499 |
|     |     |     |     |     | $49,501 |
| Less adjustment in terms of |     |     |     |     |     |
| provisio to section 4(1)(c) Market Price: |     |     | 50,000 |     |     |
| Less Cost Price: | 30,000 |     |     |     |     |
| Capital Losses: |     | 10,000 | 40,000 | 10,000 (Capital Profit) |     |
| Dividend taxable in Mr A's hands |     |     |     |     | 39,501 |

**Note:**

If a loss is deductible for income tax purposes, or against capital profit in terms of sections 4(5) or 3(3) it should be ignored in the above example.

_**Subsection (3)**_ adds a third proviso to section 4(1). Where a non-taxable bonus issue has previously been made from an asset revaluation reserve the "cost price" of the asset for the purposes of section 4(1)(c) is deemed to be increased by the amount of the revaluation.

_**Subsections (5) and (6)**_ amend sections 4(5) and 3(3) respectively to provide that where a capital loss is offset against the market price in terms of section 4(1)(c), it should not also be offset against other capital profits.

_Application_ - Subsections (2), (3), (5) and (6) apply for the income year that commenced on 1 April 1982 and subsequent income years.

(c) **Deemed Dividends**

_Subsection 4_ concerns "deemed dividends" arising by virtue of section 4(2) of the principal Act. The wording of the Act prior to this amendment meant that the department had no alternative, where any type of private expenditure was paid for by a company, other than to treat the amount as a dividend in the shareholders' hands unless it was not claimed as a deduction by the company and was charged to the shareholders current account with the company. As the expenditure was disallowed to the company, it was also effectively taxed at the company rate, and in some cases could bear tax combined at a rate in excess of 100 percent.

This treatment was considered to be particularly harsh where an adjustment was necessary because a company had incorrectly apportioned dual purpose expenditure, or had made some other technical error. These situations were not generally viewed as attempts at tax evasion, and it was decided to amend section 4(2) to allow the shareholder and the company the opportunity to make good the error without incurring any penalty by way of "double" taxation.

The amendment provides that where the deemed dividend arose through innocent error on the part of all of the shareholders in believing that the expenditure was not private expenditure of any person other than the company, and the amount of the deemed dividend has been repaid to the company, an amended assessment may be issued to the shareholder excluding the dividend.

**NOTE:** That failure in the first place to conscientiously consider the question of apportionment of expenditure will not constitute an "innocent error".

In many cases the necessary adjustments may be made before an assessment is issued.

The amendment is effective from the income year that commenced on 1 April 1984.

### Section 5: Extension of Time Arrangements

This section amends section 17 of the principal Act, which deals with the dates by which annual income tax returns are required to be furnished. The amendment resulted from recommendations made by a Joint Working Party of Inland Revenue Department officials and members of the New Zealand Society of Accountants on extension of time arrangements.

The amendment provides that where:

*   a person carrying on a professional public practice; or
*   a person carrying on a business which includes preparing annual income tax returns; or
*   the Maori Trustee -
*   prepares income tax returns for 10 or more persons the Commissioner may allow an extension of time for furnishing any of those returns if it is not possible or not reasonable to furnish them at the times required by the Act. However, the Commissioner may not allow an extension of time beyond the 31st of March immediately following the end of the income tax year for which the return is being furnished. In other words:
*   The date for furnishing the income tax return of a taxpayer with an early balance date (1 October to 30 March) may not be extended beyond the _second_ 31 March which follows the end of the taxpayer's accounting year.
*   The date for furnishing the income tax return of a taxpayer with a 31 March balance date may not be extended beyond the next 31 March which follows the end of the taxpayer's accounting year.
*   The date for furnishing the income tax return of a taxpayer with a late balance date (1 April to 30 September) may not be extended beyond the next 31 March which follows the end of the taxpayer's accounting year.

For example, the Commissioner may not extend the time for furnishing any 1985 income tax return beyond 31 March 1986. Thus the return of a taxpayer whose balance date is 1 October 1984 may be furnished, with approval, as late as 31 March 1986 (up to 18 months after balance date), and the return of a taxpayer whose balance date is 30 September 1985 must also be furnished no later than 31 March 1986 (no more than six months after balance date) even if an extension of time is granted.

The extension of time arrangements for income tax practitioners are explained in the booklet IR 271 _Tax Practitioner's Handbook for 1985_. TPC 85/95 sets out the Commissioner's policy and the details of extension of time arrangements.

This section applies to income tax returns for 1985 and for all subsequent income years.

### Section 6: Commissioner To Make Assessments, Determinations of Loss, and Other Determinations

Section 6 amends section 19 of the principal Act which authorises the Commissioner to make an assessment, a determination of loss, and other determinations.

This amendment repeals and substitutes subsection (2) of section 19 and enables the Commissioner to make a determination of loss in all instances where a loss for an income year has been ascertained.

Prior to this amendment, where a taxpayer had furnished a return of income showing either a profit or nil income, and the result for the income year had been ascertained by the Commissioner to be in fact a loss, the Commissioner had no authority under section 19 to make a determination of that loss, and therefore had no authority under section 29 to issue a notice of determination of loss. As there was no authority to issue such notice the taxpayer had no right to object to the ascertained loss.

This amendment has rectified this situation and now enables the Commissioner to make a determination of loss where a loss has been ascertained, regardless of the position shown in the return of income furnished.

This section of the Amendment Act has effect as from the income year that commenced on 1 April 1984.

### Section 7: Obligation to Pay Tax not Suspended by Objection or Appeal

Comments on this section are contained in Part II of Appendix A.

### Section 8: Interest on Certain Excess Tax

Comments on this section are contained in Part II of Appendix A.

### Section 9: Rebate in Respect of Gifts of Money and Payment of School Fees

The effect of this section is three-fold.

_Examination Fees_

First, subsection (1) of this section amends the definition of the expression "fees" in section 56A(1) of the principal Act to make it clear that external examination fees (such as School Certificate, University Entrance) paid in respect of pupils at private or integrated schools _do not_ qualify for the school fees rebate.

The original purpose of the school fees rebate was to provide some assistance to those parents who meet the costs of educating their children outside the State school system. The rebate was intended to apply to tuition fees payable to private and integrated private schools.

However, in Taxation Review Authority cases (Nos 82/104 and 82/105) the Authority determined that School Certificate fees paid in respect of pupils at private or integrated schools qualified for the school fees rebate. The Authority decided that under the wording of section 56A(3) the rebate for school fees was not limited merely to attendance fees and noted that the dictionary definition of "fees" included "entrance money for examinations". This meant that contrary to the original intention of the legislation all external examination fees paid in respect of any child attending a private or integrated school would qualify for the school fees rebate, while at the same time external examination fees paid in respect of any child attending a State school did not qualify.

The purpose of this amendment is, therefore, to merely clarify and confirm the original intent of the legislation, so that in no circumstances will external examination fees qualify for the section 56A rebate in the future.

The amendment applies with respect to the income year that commenced on 1 April 1984 and subsequent income years. This means that within the rebate limits specified in section 56A external examination fees paid in the 1983/84 income year in respectof any pupil attending a private or an integrated private school _were eligible_ for the rebate but that eligibility will not apply in relation to the **1985** income year and future years. Any rebate claims made for examination fees paid during an income year _earlier_ than the 1984/85 income year will not be allowed unless it is the initial claim, in a return of income furnished late, or the previous disallowance of such claims was the subject of a live objection at the time the Authority gave its decision. Late objections based on the Authority's decision will not be accepted.

**CORSO**

_Secondly_, subsection (2) reincludes _Corso_ in the section 56A(2) list of donee overseas aid organisations for the purposes of the charitable donations rebate. By virtue of its reinclusion in section 56A(2), donations made by public companies to _Corso_ will also qualify for the deduction provided by section 147(2).

The reinclusion of CORSO as a qualifying donee organisation applies with respect to the tax on income derived in the income year commencing on the _1st day of April_ _1985_ and in every subsequent year.

**OPERATION HOPE**

_Thirdly_, subsection (3) of this section adds "Operation Hope" (Aid Ship to Africa) to the list of qualifying donee organisations in section 56A(2) of the principal Act. This subsection has no specific application date and therefore applies from the general application date in section 2 of this Act being the income year commencing _1 April 1984_. All donations to Operation Hope will be eligible for the charitable donations rebate under section 56A or the deduction from assessable income allowable to donor public companies under section 147, subject to the limits set out in those sections.

Refer also to section 44 of this Amendment Act which sets out the requirements which approved overseas aid organisations must meet in terms of record keeping and the furnishing of returns showing the sources and application of their funds.

### Section 10: Incomes Wholly Exempt from Tax - Charitable Organisations and Thalidomide Trusts

This section makes a number of amendments to section 61 of the principal Act which is the main provision listing the categories of income which are exempt from income tax.

The amendments made in subsections (1) to (3) relate to the exemption afforded to the income of charitable organisations, whereas that in subsection (4) relates to the income derived by trustees of trusts set up for the benefit of thalidomide victims. Each subsection is discussed below.

_**Subsection (1):**_

_Non-Business Income_

This subsection repeals and substitutes paragraph 61(25) of the principal Act which deals with the exemption afforded to the non-business income of charitable organisations.

The effect of the rewarding in that paragraph is to clarify the interaction between paragraphs 61(25) and 61(27). In the past these two paragraphs have simply dealt with non-business and business income respectively. However, since the introduction of the second proviso to section 61(27) in 1982, it was not clear which paragraph applied in the case of rental income in particular.

This is because, on the one band, as the scale of rental activities may not be sufficient to constitute a "business" (as defined in section 2) in many cases, this would indicate that the exemption of the rental income should be considered under section 61(25). On the other hand, the operation of paragraph (f) of the second proviso to section 61(27) indicates that the exemption of rental income should be considered under that section. In the absence of an amendment, it was not clear which section took precedence.

The effect of this amendment is to ensure that the provisions of section 61(27) take precedence thereby restoring the original intention of the 1982 legislation. Thus the exemption of the rental income of charitable organisations from income tax should be considered under section 61(27).

_**Subsection (2):**_

_Business Income_

This subsection remedies an anomaly which had arisen in the operation of the second proviso to section 61(27) which deals with the exemption afforded to the _business_ income (and rental income - see the commentary above) of charitable organisations.

The intention of the second proviso to that section, when it was introduced in 1982, was to restrict the use of charitable organisations for tax avoidance purposes. Of particular concern was the practice of the setting up of "one man charities" which could then be used to circumvent the limitations of the charitable donations tax rebate.

While the provisions appear to have been effective in relation to charitable companies, this is not necessarily the case with charitable trusts. This is because the tax legislation which applies to trusts generally can override the provisions of section 61(27).

In particular, income derived by a trust which is paid or applied to or for the benefit of the charitable beneficiaries during, or within six months after the end of, the income year (or corresponding accounting year) in which it is earned, becomes "beneficiaries' income" for tax purposes. Where the beneficiary is a recognised charity (which is normally the case with one man charities) there is no tax payable by the beneficiary in respect of the income received from the trust, as that income is specifically exempted by section 61(25). The second proviso to section 61(27) thus effectively applied only to the income of a trust to the extent that income was retained within the charitable trust and not distributed or that there was no beneficiary entitled in possession to receipt of the income.

This amendment ensures that where the second proviso to section 61(27) applies to a charitable trust, the whole of its income, not just the portion that is retained as undistributed income of the trustees, will be liable to income tax and will be taxed as if it were trustees income. Thus the section 61(27) provision will now effectively override the general trust taxation provisions.

It should also be noted that the new wording added to the legislation refers to the provisions of section 230 (which relates to non-specified trusts) only. This is because, by virtue of the definition in section 226(1)(b), charitable trusts cannot be specified trusts.

This amendment applies with effect from the income year which commenced on 1 April 1984 by virtue of the general application provision in the Amendment Act. This means that for the 1983/84 income year, being the year in which the second proviso to section 61(27) first applied, that proviso can only be applied to the income:

*   (a)Which was not distributed, and
*   (b)To which no charitable beneficiary was entitled in possession.

_**Subsection (3):**_

_Disposition of Assets_

This section amends paragraphs (e) and (f) of the second proviso to section 61(27). These paragraphs specify the consequence for a charitable trust in respect of the exemption of its _business_ income (and rental income - see the commentary on subsection (1) above) where a person disposes of an asset to the trust and retains an interest in that asset.

When these paragraphs (and the rest of the second proviso) were introduced in 1982, it was the intention that they apply from the commencement of the 1983/84 income year to all charitable trusts irrespective of the date on which the assets were so disposed of to the trust. The use in the 1982 legislation in paragraphs (e) and (f) - "_disposes_ of, to the trust, any asset" - of the present tense suggested that the provisions may only apply where the assets have been disposed of since the commencement of the 1983/84 income year.

This amendment, by introducing the words "has disposed of or", makes it clear that paragraphs (e) and (f) apply irrespective of the date on which the asset was disposed of to the trust.

It applies, by virtue of subsection (5), from the income year which commenced on 1 April 1983, the same date from which the entire second proviso to section 61(27) applied.

_**Subsection (4):**_

• _Thalidomide Trusts_

Section 61(49) of the Income Tax Act provides an exemption from income tax for income derived by, or distributed to beneficiaries by, the trustees of any trust created under an order of Court under the Minors Contracts Act 1969 for the benefit of "Thalidomide" victims. This section was specifically designed to aid the beneficiaries of a trust _set up in New Zealand_ with funds paid in compensation by the manufacturers of the drug "Thalidomide".

However the section did not cover the situation of a person resident in New Zealand and who was a beneficiary of a thalidomide trust established overseas.

Section 61(49) has been amended to allow the exemption in respect of any thalidomide compensation trust set up overseas on a similar basis and for the same purpose as the trust to which the section was previously applicable.

This subsection applies with respect to the tax on income derived in _any_ income year.

_**Subsections (5) and (6):**_

These subsections simply provide for the application dates of subsections (3) and (4) which are different than the general application date of the Amendment Act.

### Section 11: Exemption from Tax for Certain International Aircraft Operators

This section has introduced into the principal Act a new section, 64A, which gives the Commissioner the power to exempt from income tax income derived from air transport from New Zealand by non-resident aircraft operators. This exemption applies only where the Commissioner is satisfied that in corresponding circumstances a New Zealand resident aircraft operator would similarly be not liable for, or would be exempt from, income tax under the laws of the overseas country.

Only income derived from air transport from New Zealand can be exempted. The term "air transport from New Zealand" has been defined to mean the carriage outside New Zealand, by any aircraft, of merchandise, goods, livestock, mails or passengers emplaned or embarked in New Zealand. The definition deems carriage on the whole journey to be "carriage outside New Zealand" notwithstanding that the aircraft calls at any one or more other airports in New Zealand before finally leaving New Zealand on that flight.

_Reciprocal Arrangements_

To be eligible for the exemption it is necessary that the laws of the country, in which the aircraft operator is resident, provide that if corresponding circumstances existed, any New Zealand resident aircraft operator would be not liable for, or would be exempted from, income tax, (being any tax which is substantially of the same nature as income tax in New Zealand) in that country or territory. Based upon those laws the Commissioner may, if satisfied, exempt either in whole or in part that operator or operators from income tax in New Zealand.

A copy of the relevant overseas legislation, together with a suitable declaration from the Taxation Authorities in the overseas country, would need to be provided in support of any submission that reciprocal exemption exists in that overseas country.

_Double Tax Agreements_

It should be noted that if there is a Double Taxation Agreement between New Zealand and the country in which airline company is resident, and this agreement extends to air transport, then section 64A gives no additional benefits. It is only where there is no Double Taxation Agreement or where such an agreement does not cover income from air transport that section 64A needs to be considered.

### Section 12: Items Included in Assessable Income

_Ex-gratia Pensions_

_Subsection (1)_ of this section extends section 65 of the principal Act by adding a new subsection, (1B) which includes as a "pension";

"any ex-gratia payment (not being a payment to which any of subsections (2) to (4A) and (6) of section 68 of this Act applies) received by any taxpayer from any person for whom the taxpayer or a spouse or a parent or a child or a dependant of the taxpayer has rendered past services, being a payment which, in the opinion of the Commissioner, would not have been made by that person if those past services had not been rendered by, as the case may be, the taxpayer or the said spouse or parent or child or dependant."

In order to adjust for the effects of inflation on the current value of pensions many companies pay annual supplements to the pensions paid to former employees or relatives of former employees. Where these supplements are received as of right by the taxpayer they are taxable as "pensions" under section 65(2)(j). However, where such supplements are paid on a _voluntary_ basis it has been established that because the company is under no legal obligation to make such payments those payments may not be "pensions" and thus may not be subject to tax under section 65(2)(j).

This amendment now clarifies the position by providing that any ex-gratia payment made to a former employee (or a relative of that former employee) by reason of that person's past employment is a "pension" for the purposes of section 65(2)(j) and is thus taxable in the hands of the recipient.

_**Subsection (2)**_ of this section extends the definition of "salary and wages" to include any ex-gratia payments that are treated as "pensions" under section 65(1B). This amendment is necessary to ensure that such payments are subject to PAYE tax.

_**Subsection (3)**_ extends section 243 of the principal Act so that any ex-gratia payments that are treated as "pensions" under section 65 are deemed to have been derived from New Zealand.

_**Subsection (4)**_ provides that the section came into force on the day on which the Act received the Governor-General's assent (23 March 1985) and applies with respect to payments received on or after that day.

### Section 13: Taxation of Retirement Allowances

This section makes minor amendments to section 68 of the principal Act. Under section 68 only 5 percent of any bonus, gratuity or retiring allowance paid on the retirement (or redundancy) of a taxpayer is subject to income tax.

_A Resignation is Not a Retirement_

Subsection (2) of section 68 has been amended to ensure that the tax concession applies only to _true_ retirements and not to resignations other than those that are part and parcel of the process of true retirement. Although this has been the Department's longstanding policy, amendments made in 1983 to the section (those amendments applying from 1 April 1984) may have enabled a different interpretation to be given to the wording in subsection (2). Basically, the 1983 amendments removed the requirement that the employee must have attained the "appropriate retiring age" (55 for women, 60 for men). This meant that, from 1 April 1984, the only principal requirement was that the employee must have "retired from that employment or service". It had been argued that those words effectively afforded the 5 percent concessionary treatment to persons who received lump sum payments on resigning from a particular employment (as opposed to retiring). This is because it could be said that a resignation is a "retirement from _that_ employment or service".

The matter has now been clarified by providing that, to qualify for the tax concession, the payment must be made "on the termination of that employment or service, that _termination_ being the _occasion_ of his _retirement_". This means therefore that, subject to the other provisions of section 68, the concessionary treatment can apply to a taxpayer on only one occasion of true retirement, although, as explained below it may apply also on the occasion of termination of a post-retirement employment.

_More than one Retirement_

Subsection (3) of section 68 has been amended to make it consistent with the amendment made in subsection (2). Subsection (3), in effect, allows what could be classed as "post-retirement retirements" to qualify for the tax concession, an example being an army officer who retires at the appropriate military retirement age, takes up further employment and then subsequently retires from that further employment. The problem was that the subsection as it previously existed referred to retirements and "subsequent retirements" and this wording would have been inconsistent with the now amended subsection (2) which reflects that retirement is an event that does not occur more than once. Although the effect of subsection (3) is the same, the wording has now been amended to provide that where a taxpayer retires and then takes up further employment, any retiring allowance received on the termination of that further employment is deemed to be a payment to which subsection (2) applies subject to the service-recognition limitation imposed on subsection (2).

_Redundancy/Death Deemed to be a Retirement_

Subsections (4) and (4A) of section 68 allow lump sum payments made on the occasion of the redundancy or death of a taxpayer to qualify for the tax concession. Those subsections have now been amended to provide that the date of redundancy or death is the deemed date of retirement of the taxpayer. Such a provision was inadvertently omitted from each subsection when amendments to those subsections were made in 1982.

All amendments to section 68 have effect with respect to any payments made on or after 1 April 1984.

### Section 14: Excess Income on Sale of Livestock Due to an Adverse Event

This section amends section 94 of the principal Act which allows excess income from the forced sale of livestock, as a result of an adverse event, to be carried forward and set off against the purchase price of replacement livestock in the two succeeding years after the year of sale. The section also provides that, if before the end of the second income year a further adverse event is declared, the period for acquiring livestock can be extended for a third year after the forced sale.

Section 14 of this Amendment Act new provides that in the event of still further prolongation of an adverse event or the further occurrence of an adverse event the Minister of Finance may by declaration extend or further extend the period in which the farmer must acquire replacement livestock. The extension will be to the end of such later income year as the Minister specifies.

The Ministry Agriculture and Fisheries will identify any cases where it is considered the adverse event relief period requires extension and advise the Commissioner. A recommendation will then be made to the Minister of Finance.

As with the declaration of an adverse event, any declaration of an extension to the relief period under section 94 will be publicised in a Public Information Bulletin as well as in a Technical Policy Circular.

### Section 15: Deduction for Expenditure or Loss Incurred in Production of Income from Employment

This section repeals and substitutes section 105 of the principal Act. The purpose of this amendment is two-fold:

(a) To make it clear that the _only_ deductible expenditure or loss incurred in deriving "income from employment", allowable to a person deriving such income, is the expenditure that is specified in section 105 as being the "qualifying amount" (and, as appropriate, in conjunction with the Fourth Schedule to the Act):

(b) To make clear what evidence is necessary to support a claim to deduct any expenditure or loss.

Prior to this new version of section 105, it was possible to argue that a person deriving "income from employment" as defined in section 105(1) could be allowed deductions other than those which were allowable under section 104 and also other than those limited to the extent provided in section 105 and the Fourth Schedule. For example, it could have been argued that a person could claim depreciation, in respect of an item of equipment used in the production of income from employment, under section 108 because that section allows a deduction for depreciation in calculating assessable income independently of section 104 and consequently is not subject to the limitations of section 105 and the Fourth Schedule.

_Allowable Deductions Limited to Section 105_

The new section 105 ensures that where a person derives "income from employment" the only deductions allowable in respect of that income from employment are those provided in the section and the Fourth Schedule to the Act. This has been achieved by amending subsection (2) in two ways and by adding a new subsection (4).

_First_, subsection (2) now applies notwithstanding the _whole_ of section 106, rather than just subsection (1)(d) of that section as in the former section 105. The effect of making section 105 operate notwithstanding section 106 is to prevent taxpayers being able to claim deductions under any of the tests of deductibility which appear in various paragraphs in section 106(1), eg, interest, and which are independent of the section 104 tests.

_Secondly_, it has been made explicit that section 105 and the Fourth Schedule limit the breadth of the deductions that may be allowed pursuant to the tests of section 104 in respect of the income from employment derived by the taxpayer. Section 105 now applies notwithstanding section 106 - previously section 106 contained (in subsection (l)(i)) the provision which limited income from employment-related deductions to those provided in section 105 and the Fourth Schedule. Consequently, for expenditure or loss incurred in relation to income from employment to be deductible it must meet the tests of section 104 _and_ the relevant tests in section 105 and the Fourth Schedule. To the extent to which items of expenditure in respect of income from employment meet the tests of section 104 but do not come within section 105 and the Fourth Schedule, this amendment ensures that those items are not deductible.

_Depreciation_

Similarly, the new subsection (4) prevents a taxpayer from claiming depreciation in respect of an asset used in the production of income from employment _except_ where the asset is one used in and for the purpose of travel, where the expenditure on that travel is deductible to the taxpayer in terms of Clause 6 of the Fourth Schedule.

_Application_

The above amendments apply from and including the income year which commenced on 1 April 1984 (1985 tax returns).

_Evidence in Support of Expenditure_

The Other main change to section 105 (in subsection (3)) is to ensure that evidence supporting a claim for a deduction under the provisions of the Fourth Schedule is in writing - either by way of A _receipt_ or some other _written_ evidence - and that the written evidence documents _the incuring of the expenditure_ rather than just the existence of the item in respect of which the claim is made. This change follows Taxation Review Authority decisions in which it was held effectively that where an objector produced the actual asset acquired in support of his claim to deducting then the requirements of the former subsection (3) as to evidence, were satisfied.

_Application of Subsection (3)_

Unlike the other subsections of the new section 105, the new subsection (3) _does not_ apply to the 1985 income year, ie, that beginning 1 April 1984. For that income year subsection (3) of the old section 105 will to continue to apply. The new subsection (3) will apply for income years beginning on or after 1 April 1985 (1986 and subsequent tax returns).

_Consequential amendments_

_**Subsection (2)**_ of section 15 repeals section 106(1)(i) of the principal Act and is consequential on the changes made to subsection (2) of section 105 as explained above.

_**Subsection (3)**_ of this section of the Amendment Act is consequential upon the repeal of section 106(1)(i), and the amendments to section 105. Subsection (3) repeals and substitutes clause 8 of the Fourth Schedule to specify that any expenditure which a taxpayer seeks to claim under that clause cannot be expenditure of any of the kinds referred to in section 106. This will mean, for example, that even if a taxpayer incurs expenditure which has been incurred as a condition of and for the purpose of his employment it will not be deductible if it is of a private or domestic nature.

_**Subsection (4)**_ of this section makes minor consequential repeals.

### Section 16: Amendments Consequential upon Enactment of Fisheries Act 1983

Various sections of the principal Act have been amended so as to make reference to the Fisheries Act 1983 which came into force on 1 October 1983. All amendments which this section of the Amendment Act makes to the principal Act are deemed to have come into force on that date.

**Section 109**, which allows for certain repairs to fishing boats to be claimed as a deduction, has been amended by replacing the definition of the expression "fishing boat". The substituted definition makes reference to a boat that is registered as a fishing boat under the Fisheries Amendment Act 1963, and also to a boat that is registered as a fishing vessel under Part IV of the Fisheries Act 1983.

The general provisions relating to investment allowances, in **section 118**, have been amended by also including, in the definition of "fishing boat", reference to a boat that is registered as a fishing vessel under Part IV of the Fisheries Act 1983.

**Section 156A**, which provides for export performance incentives for qualifying goods, has been similarly amended by the inclusion of a reference to Part IV of the Fisheries Act 1983 in the definition of the expression "foreign owned fishing vessel".

The above amendments are of a consequential nature only.

### Section 17: Depreciation Allowances, etc, on Motor Cars

Section 17 rectifies a drafting error made when section 110 of the principal Act was amended in 1982 to ensure that depreciation could be claimed on both the "specified cost" of a motor car and the cost of an assembly line installation to burn (CNG) or LPG.

In the making of that amendment to section 110, the word "and" was inadvertently inserted between paragraphs (b) and (c) of the definition of "expenditure", and this resulted in the virtual impossibility of both of those paragraphs having to apply, rather than each standing alone.

Section 17 repeals (b) and (c), and substitutes one paragraph, (a), to make it clear that "expenditure" for the purposes of section 110 is the amount of capital expenditure incurred in the purchase of the motor car, less any energy conservation expenditure that in relation to the motorcar has been allowed as a deduction under section 125 or the cost of any assembly line CNG or LPG installation, in relation to the motorcar, that is depreciable under section 114B.

_**Application**_

The amendment applies from and including the income year that commenced on 1 April 1982.

### Section 18: First Year Depreciation Allowance on Plant and Machinery and on Certain Buildings

Section 112 of the principal Act previously provided for a First Year Depreciation Allowance where expenditure was incurred on buildings in the meat export industry. That allowance ceased to apply where such expenditure was incurred after 30 September 1981.

Section 18 of the Amendment Act removes from section 112 and the Fifth Schedule to the principal Act all references to that former allowance.

### Section 19: Investment Allowance on New Plant and Machinery Used in High Priority Activity

This section repeals section 121A of the principal Act, the allowance pursuant to which terminated on 31 March 1984. Section 121A provided an allowance where new assets were used in an approved high priority activity.

Because high priority activity approvals had effect in respect of the expenditure incurred during the following twelve months, and, as the allowance is claimed in the year in which the asset is first used, it is possible that the high priority activity allowance could be claimed in 1985 returns of income by those qualifying taxpayers with early balance dates. Accordingly, the repeal of this spent provision does not apply until the 1986 income year.

Sections 121(3)(a) and 122(5) of the principal Act have also been amended to remove reference to the repealed section 121A, as has section 19 of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 2) 1977.

The amendments apply with effect from the income year that commenced on 1 April 1985.

### Section 20: Farming and Agricultural Investment Allowance

This section contains transitional provisions in relation to the phasing out of the Farming and Agricultural Investment Allowance(section 122 of the principal Act) which expired on _31 March 1985_.

_Binding Contracts_

Provision is made as announced in the 1984 Budget to allow the investment allowance in respect of qualifying expenditure incurred after 31 March 1985 providing certain conditions are met. These conditions are:

1.  The taxpayer must have entered into, _on or before 8 November 1984_, a binding contract to purchase, or a binding agreement to lease, qualifying plant and machinery, and
2.  The qualifying expenditure pursuant to that binding contract must be incurred within a _reasonable_ time after 31 March 1985.

The determining of what constitutes a reasonable time after 31 March 1985 will involve some discretion having regard to the nature of the undertaking involved in the performance of the contract or agreement.

There are therefore, two categories of taxpayers that will be affected by the termination of the investment allowance:

1.  _Taxpayers who have entered into binding contracts prior to 8 November 1984_. The transitional provisions will apply, ie, expenditure must be incurred within a reasonable time after 31 March 1985.
2.  _Taxpayers who have NOT entered into a binding contract prior to 8 November 1984_. The expenditure must be _incurred_ on or before 31 March 1985.

**When Expenditure is Incurred**

As the date the expenditure is _incurred_ is all important to taxpayers in the second category it is appropriate that the Department's interpretation of the word "incurred" be restated:

The expenditure will be incurred at the point(s) at which, in the course of the fulfilment of the contract, the purchaser becomes _firmly liable_ to pay the supplier. This timing of the incurring of the expenditure would not be affected by the fact that _payment_ by the purchaser may be made by instalments in the period _subsequent_ to that firm liability arising. Further, the expenditure may be incurred prior to the terminating date notwithstanding that the asset is delivered subsequent to the terminating date. However a mere order of plant prior to 31 March would not be sufficient as generally the obligation to pay would not arise until fulfilment of the order by the supplier, ie, delivery.

The question of when expenditure is incurred is therefore one of fact, and details of the contract may need to be considered.

The investment allowance will be allowable, as at present, in the year of _first use_ of the qualifying plant or machinery, notwithstanding that this first use may be after the terminating date.

### Section 21: Year in Which Accident Compensation Levy is Deductible

This amendment inserts a new section, 140A, in the principal Act. The purpose of the new section is to make it clear that Accident Compensation levy paid by employers and self-employed persons is deductible for income tax purposes in the year in which it becomes due and payable (generally also the year in which it is in fact paid).

The amendment standardises the income tax treatment of Accident Compensation levies.

_**Background**_

When the Accident Compensation scheme was introduced in 1974 the Accident Compensation Act 1972 provided, amongst other things, for the payment of levies by employers (on the basis of their payrolls) and self-employed persons (on the basis of their income).

Although the Accident Compensation legislation contained no provisions relating levy payments to specific cover years, there was a widespread belief among levy payers, based on the factors below, that levies were payable during the year for which cover was provided:

1.  In respect of established employers and self-employed persons, the first payment of Accident Compensation levy was paid in the first year in which the Accident Compensation scheme was in existence. The levy was however calculated using payroll information (in the case of employers) and income information (in the case of self-employed persons) from the previous year.
2.  In respect of new employers and persons commencing self-employment, there was a system of "start-up" levies payable (initially) on a provisional basis.
3.  In respect of all employers and self-employed persons, a provision existed for the granting of levy adjustments on the occasion of an employer ceasing to employ or a self-employed person ceasing business (cessation adjustments).
4.  The forms that required completion by the levy payer, indicated that levy was being paid in respect of the year of the levy payment.

Accordingly, there was a general acceptance that levies were payable in the year in respect of which Accident Compensation cover was obtained and that the levies were deductible for income tax purposes in the year in which the levy became due and payable (which was generally also the year in which the levy payment was made).

Subsequent developments in the form of amendments to the Accident Compensation Act effectively created two categories of employer and self-employed persons, each of which was subject to differing Accident Compensation levy treatment.

(1) **Category One**

In the first category, are those _employers who had commenced employing prior to 1 April 1980_ and _those self-employed persons who had commenced business prior to 1 October 1979._

These employers and self-employed persons had, until 1982, continued to deduct their levies, for income tax purposes, in the year in which they became due and payable.

In December 1982, arising from the amalgamation of the employer Accident Compensation levy and IR 68 annual tax deduction reconciliation systems and the enactment of the consolidated Accident Compensation Act 1982, the Accident Compensation Corporation advised that cessation adjustments for these levy payers could no longer be made.

During the course of 1983, as levy payers became aware of this change, many submissions were received which maintained that because they (the levy payers) had either initially paid start-up levies or had paid a levy in respect of a year in which the Accident Compensation scheme had not been in existence, those levy payers were being penalised.

After reviewing the many submissions received, the Government decided to re-introduce cessation adjustments in respect of levy payers in this category.

However, the initial removal of cessation adjustments in December 1982 was seen as indicating a change in philosophy from a "payment in advance" to a "payment relating back" basis. Accordingly many levy payers took the opportunity to change their basis of deduction for income tax purposes from the cash basis to an accruals basis. For the majority of these levy payers this change was made in the 1983 income year (or corresponding accounting year) thereby effectively entitling them to a "double" deduction of levy in that year.

(2) **Category Two**

In this category are all _employers who commenced employing on or after 1 April 1980 and self-employed persons who commenced business on or after 1 October 1979_.

As a result of changes made in recent years, levy payers in this category have not been required to pay start-up levies. Similarly, they are not entitled to levy adjustments on cessation. Instead, levy payers in this category pay their levies on a "relating back" basis, (ie, on the basis of the past year's payroll (in the case of employers) or past year's income (in the case of self-employed persons)). Accordingly it is possible that an employer can be in business for up to 14 months before he is required to pay a levy. Similarly, in the case of self-employed persons (with 31 March balance dates) the period can be up to 23 months.

In these circumstances, the liability for levy was clearly seen, from an _accounting_ viewpoint, as constituting an accrual. That is, the liability was seen as arising as wage payments were made or as income was earned, particularly since there is no possibility of the liability being extinguished at a later date (as is the case where cessation adjustments are involved).

_**Comment**_

As the background to the levy treatment of employers and the self-employed is somewhat complex and has been subject to many changes over the years, there has grown a diversity of practices among levy payers as to the timing of the deductions of levies in their annual accounts. Those practices range from the deducting of levies on an accruals basis by making provision in the accounts before levies became due and payable, to claiming the levies in the year they are paid.

In 1983 a review was undertaken of the current income tax treatment of Accident Compensation levies with a view to clarifying the position and ensuring that all levy payers adopted a common basis of approach in the claiming of levies as a deductible expense item.

The new basis for deducting Accident Compensation levies is contained in the new section 140A as inserted by section 21 of this Amendment Act. The section provides that any amount of Accident Compensation levy that becomes due and payable in any income year is deemed to be expenditure incurred in that income year and in no other income year.

The following example illustrates the correct treatment in the case of an employer with a 31 March balance date.

The levy on wages paid to 31 March 1985 is due and payable by 31 May 1985. Section 140A states that the levy is deductible in terms of section 104 of the Income Tax Act 1976, in the year ended 31 March 1986 (the year which includes the date 31 May 1985).

The proviso to subsection (2) ensures that those levy payers who have previously obtained a deduction advantage, either when changing from a cash to an accruals basis or in first adopting an accruals basis, will lose that advantage in the year of change back. It also validates the varying income tax treatment practices adopted by employers and self-employed persons prior to the application of the new section.

_**Application Date**_

The new section 140A will apply in respect of levies that become due from, and payable by, any taxpayer on or after 1 April 1985 irrespective of a taxpayer's accounting year. The 1 April 1985 application date gives an early warning to those levy payers who have previously changed to the accruals basis (and received a "double" deduction in the year of changeover) of the future requirements for the deduction of levy payments, which will generally mean that they will not receive a deduction in the year which the new basis commences.

### Sections 22-25: Phase Out of Export Incentives

These sections make amendments to sections 156A, 156B, 156D and 156E of the principal Act. The effect of the amendments is to phase out the export performance incentives for qualifying goods, services, overseas projects and tourist services.

Briefly the position will be as follows:

| PHASE OUT OF EXPORT PERFORMANCE INCENTIVES |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

Other amendments are as follows.

### Section 22: Qualifying Goods

_**Subsection (3)**_ makes an amendment to section 156A(4) and provides that taxpayers will not be able to apply to the Development Finance Corporation for an assigned percentage after the end of the income year ending on 31 March 1985.

_**Subsection (4)**_ deletes the reference in section 156A(4)(d) to a period of five years for the application of an assigned percentage. Assigned percentages in force as at 31 March 1985 will continue to apply until the effect of the legislation expires.

_**Subsection (5)**_ adds an anti-avoidance subsection, (9A), to section 156A. The Commissioner has discretion, where goods are acquired by an export merchant with a late balance date, from a taxpayer with an earlier balance date, to limit any tax credit for the year ending 31 March 1985, or subsequent years, to an amount which would have been allowed if the goods had been exported by the original owner.

The subsection will apply when, during an income year commencing on or after 1 April 1984, the export merchant has exported goods acquired from a person who:

1.  Was engaged in the business of selling or otherwise disposing of goods during the income years ending on or prior to 31 March 1984, or
2.  Acquired a business during the income year ending 31 March 1985 or subsequent years, which was engaged in selling or disposing of goods during the income years ending on or prior to 31 March 1984.

However, transactions have been exempted from this provision where:

1.  The goods are of a kind that the export merchant had acquired, for export by himself, from the same person in any income year commencing on or prior to 1 April 1983, or
2.  The goods were acquired by the export merchant, for export by himself, from a manufacturer, producer or processor, and goods had been acquired from the same source for export, in any income year which commenced on or before 1 April 1983.

**Year in Which Goods Incentive will Apply**

It should be noted that for the purposes of section 156A an export sale is made when the contract of sale is finalised and becomes binding on both parties. This means that the tax credit will be allowed to the export merchant in the income year in which the contract of sale becomes binding, irrespective of when:

*   the goods are physically exported (provided they are at some stage exported), or
*   the consideration for the sale is received by the exporter.

### Section 23: Qualifying Services

In addition to phasing out the incentive, the amendment provides that payment of fees in New Zealand currency will qualify for the incentive if the funds held in New Zealand would otherwise be remittable from this country in terms of the Exchange Control Regulations 1985 (in the same way as funds remittable in terms of the Exchange Control Regulations 1978 qualify).

### Section 24: Qualifying Overseas Projects

_Subsection (1)_ makes amendments to the definition of "qualifying project". The effect of the amendments is that only projects commencing to be performed between 1 April 1980 and 31 March 1987 will qualify for the tax incentive, and certain non-qualifying services are excluded.

"Non-qualifying services" are defined in _subsection (2)_. The definition includes any services, the fees for which would qualify in terms of section 156B, or would have qualified if the fees had been derived prior to 31 March 1987.

_Subsection (3)_ makes amendments to subsection (3) of section 156D. The effects of the amendments are:

1.  Only projects commencing to be performed during the income year ending on 31 March 1985 or a prior year will qualify for a tax credit of 11.9 percent of the amount of foreign currency earnings.
2.  Where projects commence to be performed during the income year ending 31 March 1985, the Commissioner must be satisfied that the project is performed with expedition for the whole duration of the contract. Similar provisions are included in _subsection (4)_ concerning contracts which commence during the income years ending 31 March 1986 and 1987.
3.  Fees paid in New Zealand currency from funds which would otherwise be remittable from this country in terms of the Exchange Control Regulations 1985 will qualify for the incentive.

**Years During Which the Incentive can be Claimed**

It is important to note that all projects which commence prior to 31 March 1985 will qualify for an incentive equal to 11.9 percent of net foreign currency earnings until the project is completed. Likewise projects commencing during the 1986 and 1987 income years will qualify for an incentive equal to 5.95 percent, or 2.975 percent respectively, of net foreign currency earnings until those projects are completed. This means that projects can qualify for the overseas projects incentives during the income year commencing on 1 April 1987 or subsequent years.

### Section 25: Qualifying Tourist Services

Similar amendments to those made in section 23 and 24 regarding the Exchange Control Regulations 1985 have been made in respect of this incentive.

_**Exchange Control Regulations 1985**_

As mentioned above, amendments have been made to sections 156B, 156D and 156E as a result of the Exchange Control Regulations 1978 having been replaced by the Exchange Control Regulations 1985.

The 1978 Regulations required that income from the export of goods be remitted to New Zealand through the banking system. They did not contain the same requirement in respect of fees or foreign currency earnings for services or projects performed and undertaken outside New Zealand. For this reason, and to maintain consistency, the export performance taxation incentives for services, overseas projects and tourist services were brought into line with the Exchange Control Regulations requirement for goods, by requiring the remittance of earnings back to New Zealand.

The Exchange Control Regulations 1985 do not require that income derived from the export of goods be remitted to New Zealand through the banking system. There is no longer any requirement for anyone to return funds to New Zealand where they are earned overseas from any of these sources. However, in order to qualify for the tax credits for services, overseas projects, or tourist services, it will continue to be necessary for the foreign currency earnings to be transferred to the credit of the taxpayer:

1.  By the transfer of foreign currency to New Zealand through the New Zealand banking system, or
2.  By payment in New Zealand, in New Zealand currency, from funds held in New Zealand which would otherwise be remittable from New Zealand in terms of the Exchange Control Regulations 1978, or the Exchange Control Regulations 1985.

This requirement will continue, even though, from 22 January 1985 in order for a taxpayer to qualify for the export performance incentive for qualifying goods (in terms of section 156A) there will not be any requirement under the Exchange Control Regulations for funds to be remitted to New Zealand.

### Section 26: Export Earnings from Qualifying Overseas Projects

This section repeals section 158A of the principal Act which provided for an incentive for qualifying overseas projects. The termination date for entering into a qualifying overseas project was 31 March 1980 with the incentive continuing to apply until contractors' obligations under existing qualifying projects were completed

It has now been established that all qualifying projects have been completed and therefore the incentive no longer has any application. It has accordingly been repealed.

Various sections of Amendment Acts, which either inserted section 158A into the principal Act or amended that section, have also been repealed. These sections are:

1.  section 26, Income Tax Amendment Act (No 2) 1977;
2.  section 23, Income Tax Amendment Act 1979;
3.  section 26, Income Tax Amendment Act (No 3) 1983;

The repeal of section 158A and the consequential amendments to other provisions have effect from the income year that commenced on 1 April 1985.

### Section 27: Payments to Partners for Services Performed for the Partnership

Section 167B of the principal Act was inserted by section 28 of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 3) 1983. It enabled payments akin to salary and wages made by a partnership to a working partner under a written contract of service to be allowable as a deduction in calculating the assessable income derived, or losses incurred, by the partners in a partnership.

_Section 27_ of this amendment Act relaxes some of the conditions which have to be satisfied before a deduction can be allowed.

**Bonus Payments**

_Subsections (1) and (3)_ amend the existing provision whereby any deduction for qualifying payments to be partner would be limited to the amount of a payment specified in the "contract of service".

The legislation enacted in 1983 permits the deduction only where the amount of remuneration to be paid is specified in the contract of service and then only for payments to the extent that they do not exceed the amount specified in the contract. End of year bonuses could be deductible but only if the dollar amount of the bonus had been specified in the contract.

It has since been submitted that these provisions did not recognise the payment of end of year bonuses to working partners based on the results of the partnership for the year. This amendment provides that such bonuses will be deductible and subsections (1) and (3) ensure that provided the contract of service provides authority for the payment of a bonus, the full amount of any bonus paid will be deductible if the other conditions of the legislation are met.

_Subsection (1)_ repeals the former definition of "contract of service" and substitutes a new definition. The new definition qualifies the requirement that the contract must specify the amount payable to the partner by providing that the amount so specified can include a bonus, or that a bonus can be provided for in addition to the remuneration specified in the contract.

_Subsection (3)_ then inserts a new subsection (2) into section 167B to provide that where the payment of a bonus is provided for in a contract of service, the maximum deduction allowable is the sum of:

*   the remuneration specified in the contract; and
*   any bonus or additional bonus paid.

Effectively, where the payment of a bonus is provided for in the contract, any amount paid as a bonus will be deductible in terms of section 167B.

**Definition of Working Partner**

_Subsection (2)_ of this amendment Act relaxes another condition. The amendment provides that the words "as his principal occupation" be omitted from the definition of "working partner". This means that payments made to part-time employees or to a working partner who is engaged by more than one partnership are deductible, provided the other requirements of section 167B are met.

**Application**

_Subsection (4)_ provides that this section shall apply with respect to the tax on income derived in the income year that commenced on the 1st day of April 1984 and in every subsequent year insofar as the payment by the partnership was or is made on or after the 16th day of December 1983, being the date on which the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 3) 1983 received the Governor-General's assent.

### Section 28: Specified Suspensory Loans

Section 28 of the Amendment Act amends section 172 of the principal Act which deals with specified suspensory loans made for various purposes by Public Authorities. Specified suspensory loans are loans which are remitted only if certain conditions are attained within some specified period after the loan is made. A specified suspensory loan has income tax consequences only when the loan (or part of the loan) is remitted, with the amount so remitted being deemed to be assessable income. The various types of loans that are treated as specified suspensory loans are listed in section 172.

Section 28 of the Amendment Act adds two paragraphs to the definition of "specified suspensory loan" in section 172:

_Paragraph (c)_ adds a new "Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) Distribution Suspensory Loan" which is to be administered by the Ministry of Energy and must be designated as being an LPG Distribution Suspensory Loan for the provisions of section 172 to be applied.

_Paragraph (d)_ provides that a "specified suspensory loan" includes:

"any other loan made by a Public Authority and designated by that Public Authority as a specified suspensory loan."

This amendment means that, in future, it will not be necessary to amend section 172 each time a new specified suspensory loan is created. However, as with the loans already listed, it will be necessary for the loan to be designated as a "specified suspensory loan" by the lender for the provisions of section 172 to be applied.

**Application**

This section applies to tax on income derived in the income year that commenced on 1 April 1984 and every subsequent year.

### Section 29: Grant-Related Suspensory Loans

Section 29 of the Amendment Act amends section 173 of the principal Act which deals with grant-related suspensory loans made for various purposes by Public Authorities. Grant-related suspensory loans are loans where the conditions which will entitle the loan to be converted eventually to a grant have been achieved at the time the loan is made and those conditions merely have to be sustained for a specified period to fulfil conversion entitlement. A grant-related suspensory loan has immediate tax implications as any amount otherwise deductible in calculating assessable income in respect of expenditure incurred is reduced by the amount of the loan. Provisions exist for the restoration of the full deductions in the event the loan is required to be repaid. The various types of loans that are treated as a grant-related suspensory loan are listed in section 173 and, as in section 172, the loans must be designated as being one of those particular loans before the provisions of section 173 can be applied.

Section 29 of the Amendment Act adds a further paragraph to the definition of a "grant-related suspensory loan" to provide that it includes:

*   "(d) Any other loan, made by a Public Authority, (not being a loan to which section 172 of this Act applies) pursuant to the terms of which the liability of the borrower in respect of that loan may be remitted in whole or in part."

This amendment is necessary to ensure that a suspensory loan does not escape all income tax consequences simply by the lender inadvertently failing to designate the loan as being one of those listed in either section 172 or section 173. In future, any suspensory loan that is not designated as either a "specified suspensory loan" (section 172) or a "grant-related suspensory loan" (section 173) will be subject to the provisions of section 173.

### Application

This section applies to tax on income derived in the income year that commenced on 1 April 1984 and every subsequent year.

### Section 30: Loss Incurred in specified Activities (section 188A)

This section makes two amendments to section 188A (loss containment provisions) of the principal Act.

Three subsections of section 188A (subsections 4(b)(i), 5A and 7(g)) contain a provision which allows the taxpayer to make an election, within a specified time limit, for certain provisions of the section to apply.

_**Subsection 1**_ of this amendment now brings section 188A into line with other sections of the Act by giving the Commissioner discretion to extend the time limit for the making of such an election. Generally such an extension would be granted in order to coincide with any extension of time granted for the furnishing of the annual return of income.

_**Subsection 2**_ amends the proviso to subsection 5A of section 189A. Subsection 5A allows a taxpayer to offset against any income arising, on the sale of land, from the application of section 129 (interest and development expenditure recovery provisions) any loss arising from the conduct of a specified activity on the land sold, to the extent that the loss has not already been offset against other income "_derived by the taxpayer_".

A problem arose where losses from a specified activity of a company had been offset against income of another company in the same group of companies (section 191(5)). As the losses so offset had not been offset against the assessable income "_derived by the taxpayer_", such a company could have had the unintended ability to offset against the section 129 recovery an amount of loss that had already been set off against that other company in the group.

This problem has now been rectified by providing that the offset of any losses against income arising from a section 129 recovery is restricted to so much of those losses as has not been, and will not be offset against the taxpayer's income _or the income of any other taxpayer_.

**Application**

This section applies to tax on income derived in the income year that commenced on 1 April 1984 and every subsequent year.

### Section 31: Companies Engaged in Exploring, or Searching for, or Mining Petroleum

Section 31 corrects a minor error. It amends section 214B(9)(1)(i) of the principal Act to correct a minor drafting error. Prior to the amendment that section read "paragraph (c)(i) of this _paragraph_ ". The amendment now corrects this to read "paragraph (c)(i) of this _subsection_".

This Amendment applies with effect from the income year that commenced on 1 April 1979, which was the original application of section 214B.

### Section 32: Non-Resident Withholding Tax Imposed

Section 32 corrects a minor error. It amends section 311(b) of the principal Act, by altering the words "paragraph (a) of this _subsection_" to read "paragraph (a) of this _section_".

This amendment applies with respect to non-resident withholding income derived on or after 1 April 1982 which was the application of section 311 as substituted in 1980.

### Section 33: Additional tax for default in making or paying deductions non-resident withholding tax

Comments on this section are contained in _Part I of Appendix A_.

### Section 34: Fringe Benefit Tax

This section introduces the new fringe benefit tax, with effect from 1 April 1985. The tax, which is assessed at the rate of 45 percent of the value of fringe benefits provided to employees, is payable quarterly, the date for filing quarterly returns and paying the tax being the 20th of the month following the end of the quarters ending June, September, December and March. Fringe benefit tax not paid, or returns not filed, by that date will be subject to the same penalty and other provisions as apply to the payment of income tax and the filing of income tax returns.

Details of the tax are set out in the preliminary booklet to employers which was followed by the distribution of a more detailed explanatory guide in late May (IR 409A). A full explanation of the new tax is set out in _Appendix B_ to this TPC.

### Section 35: PAYE Deductions Where the Employee Contributes to a Superannuation Scheme

This section amends section 341 of the principal Act, which provides for the annual special exemption for superannuation contributions to be taken into account on a pay period basis by means of reduced tax deductions.

Section 341 previously required that where an employee made contributions to a qualifying superannuation fund the employer should, for the purpose of determining the amount liable for PAYE deductions, deduct from the employee's gross pay, the lesser of the amount of the superannuation contributions or the portion of the maximum special exemption that related to that pay period, (eg, $23.07 per week, $46.14 per fortnight, etc) It was discovered that some employees who expected substantial end-of-year debits preferred not to take the special exemption on a pay period basis so that their expected end-of-year debit would be reduced by the amount of the special exemption claimed in the income tax return but not allowed for in PAYE deductions. Employees of a large employing organisation had adopted such a practice over a period of years .

The section has been amended to authorise the Commissioner to allow such a practice in any case or class of cases in which it is the wish of the employee not to take advantage of the special exemption on a pay period basis. Written request must be made to the Commissioner by the employee, or by the employer on behalf of named employees.

In addition the amendments state, explicitly and in terms similar to those used in section 59 of the principal Act, the types of superannuation funds to which contributions qualifying for the special exemption on a pay period basis may be made.

This amendment has effect from the date of the Governor General's assent, 23 March 1985, in relation to superannuation contributions for pay periods ending on or after that date.

### Section 36: Application of Tax Codes Specified in Tax Code Declaration and Tax Code Certificates

(a) _PAYE Deductions - Taxation of Shearers and Shearing Shed Hands_

(Subsections 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6)

Two new tax codes have been added to the codes listed in section 344(1)(b) of the principal Act. These will enable shearers and shearing shed hands to have PAYE tax deductions made at the new flat rates of tax that apply to their earnings from 1 April 1985. The new rates were introduced in the Income Tax Amendment Act 1984.

The effect of _subsection (1)_ of this section is two-fold. First, it adds the "SHR" and "SSH" tax deduction codes to the codes listed in section 344(1)(b).

The new tax codes are as follows:

"SHR" signifying employment as a shearer;

"SSH" signifying employment as a shearing shed hand.

Secondly, it clarifies the position regarding the use of the "S" tax code by shearers and shearing shed hands. While all relevant publicity and forms issued by the Department in the past have stressed that shearers and shed hands are not to use a "S" code in respect of their shearing or shed hand income it has never been embodied in legislation. The "S" tax code in section 344(1)(b) has therefore been amended to provide that it is to apply to secondary employment earnings, but not to a source deduction payment in respect of employment as a shearer or shearing shed hand notwithstanding that this may in fact be a taxpayer's secondary source of income.

As a consequence of these new tax codes and the flat rates of PAYE deductions, shearers and shearing shed hands will only receive the benefit of the family or principal income earner rebate in the annual return of income unless they obtain a special tax code from the Department incorporating those rebates for PAYE purposes.

_**Subsections (3) and (4)**_ add the "SHR" and "SSH" tax deduction codes to the codes listed in section 344(9), 344(10), and 379 respectively.

_**Subsection (6)**_ ensures that the amendments made by subsections (1), (3), (4) and (5) of this section apply to every source deduction payment made for any pay period ending on or after the 1st day of April 1985, the date on which the new basis for determining PAYE tax deductions for shearers and shearing shed hands came into force.

(b) Consequent on the housekeeper rebate (section 54 of the principal Act) being no longer available on a pay period basis subsection (4) of section 344 was repealed in 1983.

A reference to that subsection still existed, however, in section 344(3).

_**Subsection (2)**_ of this section now removes the reference in subsection 344(3) to a tax code determined by the Commissioner under the repealed subsection (4). That removal has effect from and including the 1984/85 income year.

### Section 37: Tax of Pay Period Taxpayers to be Determined by Amount of Tax Deduction

This section amends section 357 of the principal Act to provide that where pay period taxpayers furnish a return of income the amount of their liability shall be the _smaller_ of the following amounts:

1.  The total amount of tax deducted under PAYE deductions made in the proper amount for each pay period.
2.  The amount of income tax assessed under Part IV of the principal Act, on an annual basis.

The pay period taxpayer concept provides that a return is not required from a salary or wage earner where, in the income year concerned:

*   The taxpayer's total income does not exceed $11,500 per annum, and
*   the taxpayer's interest and dividend income does not exceed $200, and
*   the taxpayer has no rental, business, or partnership income, and
*   the taxpayer has no income from withholding payments, and
*   the taxpayer did not earn income as a shearer or shearing shedhand, and
*   the taxpayer is not an absentee, and
*   neither the taxpayer nor his or her spouse has claimed the family rebate introduced from 1 October 1982, and
*   the taxpayer has operated a correct tax code in respect of his salary and wage income, and
*   the taxpayer has not operated a Special Tax Code issued by the Inland Revenue Department, and
*   the taxpayer has been continuously employed throughout the year.

At present section 357 provides that the amount of income tax for which a pay period taxpayer is liable is determined exclusively and finally by the total amount of tax deductions required to have been deducted under PAYE, _except_ that where a pay period taxpayer unnecessarily furnishes a return even though he is not required to do so, his liability is required to be determined under Part IV of the principal Act.

The amendment which this section of the Amendment Act makes to section 357 is designed to protect pay period taxpayers who unnecessarily furnish returns of income when they are not obliged under current law to do so. They may have a small amount of tax to pay simply as a consequence of furnishing that return. This situation is clearly anomalous when compared with a pay period taxpayer in the same position who, correctly, does not furnish a return. (In such cases the liability is established by the amount of PAYE actually properly, deducted.)

It is expected that the major group of taxpayers to benefit from this amendment will be national superannuitants who have no income other than National Superannuation, who claim no rebates, and who have used the correct tax code.

The amendment applies to the tax on income derived during the 1983/84 income year and succeeding years.

### Section 38: Recovery of Tax Deductions from Employers

Section 370 of the principal Act provides for a 10 percent penalty for the late or non payment of tax deductions. Section 369 provides for the imposition of penal tax in respect of tax deductions. Both sections provide that any penalty or penal tax imposed shall be of the same nature as the deficient tax deduction.

The effect (prior to this Amendment) of those provisions, in conjunction with section 365 of the principal Act, was that where a company went into liquidation, or an individual employer became bankrupt or made an assignment for the benefit of creditors, any tax deductions unpaid (including penalty and penal tax) were to rank as debts second in priority only to salary or wages owed to employees.

Penalty and penal tax imposed in respect of late-paid or now-paid tax deductions are a penalty on the _employer_ for failing to comply with the requirements of the Income Tax Act. Those penalties are not in respect of any act or omission of the employee and they are not money held in trust for the Crown by the employer. It was considered that the former penalties ranking of the penalty and penal tax was inappropriate.

Section 38 of the Amendment Act therefore introduces amendments to section 365 of the principal Act to alter the position.

_**Subsection (1)**_ repeals the existing subsection (1) of section 365 of the principal Act and substitutes a new subsection (1A). The effects are:

*   The definition of a floating charge (previously section 365(4)) is now set out in section 365(1)(8). The old section 365(4) is repealed by _Subsection 2_ of section 38 of the Amendment Act. No change in interpretation is involved.
*   Section 365(1)(b) provides that for the purposes of section 365 "tax deductions" shall not include penalty or penal tax.
*   The old section 365(1) now becomes subsection (1A).

The overall effect is that only the actual tax deduction will be given priority ranking above other debts apart from any salary or wages which may be owing.

Penalty and penal tax will rank "pari passu" along with other debts according to whether the penalty taxes are secured or unsecured.

_**Subsection (3)**_ makes a consequential amendment to the Income Tax Amendment Act 1981 by repealing section 27 of that Amendment Act.

### Application

_**Subsection (4)**_ provides that section 38 applies from the date this Amendment Act has assented to by the Governor-General, ie, 23 March 1985.

### Section 39: Additional tax for default in making tax deductions or in paying any amount due to the Commissioner

A full commentary on this section is contained in _Part 1 of Appendix A_ to this TPC.

### Section 40: Additional tax to be charged if default made in payment of tax

A full commentary on this section is contained in _both Parts I and II of Appendix A_ to this TPC.

### Section 41: Deduction of Tax from Payment Due to Defaulters

Section 400(1) of the principal Act has been amended to update two references in the definition of "bank", consequent on the enactment of the Trustee Banks Act 1983, and the Private Savings Banks Act 1983.

Paragraph (b) of the definition of the expression "bank" now refers to "any trustee bank established under the Trustee Banks Act 1983:" while paragraph (b) refers to "any private savings bank carried on under the Private Savings Banks Act 1983:". These replace the former references to the Trustee Banks Act 1948 and the Private Savings Banks Act 1964, with effect from the 1984/85 income year.

### Section 42: Relief from Additional Tax

A full commentary on this section is contained in _Part 1 of Appendix A_ to this TPC.

### Section 43: Publication of Names of Tax Evaders

This section extends section 427 of the principal Act to permit the Commissioner to include for publication in the Gazette, the names of those persons charged with penal tax for default in making or paying deductions of non-resident withholding tax under section 323.

This amendment ensures that those persons who have been charged with penal tax under section 323 are treated in the same manner as those persons charged under any of the other penal provisions of the Act, as regards the publication of names.

This section takes effect from the date on which the Governor-General gave his assent to this Amendment Act (23 March 1985), and applies with respect to persons charged with penal tax on or after that date.

### Section 44: Records and Returns for Certain Charitable Organisations

This section adds a new section 432A to the principal Act and is a corollary to section 9 of this Amendment Act which amends section 56A of the principal Act.

Subsection 2 of this section requires those organisations specifically _named_ in section 56A(2) of the Act to keep in New Zealand and in the English language records sufficient to enable the Commissioner to ascertain the sources of its funds and the application of those funds within New Zealand or any other country.

Subsection (3) of this section gives the Commissioner the power to require any of these organisations to furnish a return, of its funds derived or received in any income year and the source and application of those funds. Subsection (4) gives the Commissioner the power to notify the Minister if such organisations are applying funds for purposes other than the charitable etc purposes outlined in section 56A(2) of the Act. That notification must not however name any donor to the organisation.

These provisions apply with effect from the 1984/85 income year.

### Sections 45 and 46: Payments to Shearers and Shearing Shed Hands

These sections amend, by the repeal and substitution of clauses 7 and 7A, the basic tax deduction provisions for the Second Schedule to the principal Act, for shearers and shearing shed hands respectively in recognition of the new tax deduction codes introduced for them in section 36 of this Amendment Act.

Clause 7 has been amended to provide that the basic tax deduction in respect of a 'SHR' tax code shall be calculated on the amount of the payment at the rate of 25c per $1.

Clause 7A has been amended to provide that the basic tax deduction in respect of a "SSH' tax code shall be calculated on the amount of the payment at the rate of 20c per $1.

These sections are to apply to every source deduction payment made for any pay period ending on or after the 1st day of April 1985.

### Section 47: Termination Dates of Taxation Incentives

The Third Schedule of the principal Act, which outlines the terminating dates of various taxation incentives has been repealed and replaced by the new Third Schedule as contained in the Second Schedule to this Amendment Act.

| NEW THIRD SCHEDULE |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Section of Act | General Description | Terminating Date |
| 119 | Regional Investment Allowance | 31 March 1983 |
| 120 | Export Investment Allowance | 31 March 1983 |
| 121 | Industrial Development Plan Investment Allowance | 31 March 1986 |
| 121A | High Priority Activity Investment Allowance | 31 March 1984 |
| 122 | Farming and Agriculture Investment Allowance | 31 March 1985 |
| 123 | Fishing Investment Allowance | 31 March 1983 |
| 127 | Development Expenditure on Farming or Agricultural Land | 31 March 1986 |
| 127A | Development Expenditure on Forestry | 31 March 1986 |
| 128 | Development Expenditure on Aquaculture | 31 March 1986 |
| 156F | Export-Market Development and Tourist Promotion Incentive | 31 March 1986 |
| 156G | Export-Market Development (Self-Employed Taxpayers) Incentive | 31 March 1986 |
| 158A | Export Earnings from Qualifying Overseas Projects | 31 March 1980 |

The reference in the second column of this Schedule to the nature of the deduction is by way of general description only and is not to be construed as limiting or extending the deduction under the section referred to in the first column of this Schedule.

### Section 48: Travel in the Course of Employment

Clause 6 of the Fourth Schedule to the principal Act allows a deduction in calculating the assessable income of an employee taxpayer, of expenditure incurred by him on travel in the course of his employment. The deductible expenditure does not include travel from home to work _except_ where the taxpayer's base of work is his home or he has no fixed place of work.

The positioning of the commas in Clause 6, prior to this amendment gave rise to ambiguity of meaning. Clause 6 has therefore been repealed and substituted by section 48 of this Amendment Act, in a manner which removes that ambiguity, with effect from the 1984/85 income year.

### Section 49: Increased Export of Goods

Part C of the Seventh Schedule (now repealed) was amended by Order in Council 1979/269. The effect of the amendment was to delete "cereals" from the qualifying scheduled goods and replace it with "milled cereals".

This amendment now confirms that Order in Council. It applies from the income year which commenced on 1 April 1980 to the date of effect of the repeal of section 156 of the principal Act (income year commencing on 1 April 1984). As the amendment has the same period of application as the Order in Council, it does not affect on past or present practice in giving effect to the Order in Council as it stood since 1979.

### Appendix A - Part I

### Additional Tax/Penalty for Late Payment of Tax

This Part of this Appendix comments on the following sections of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 2) 1985.

*   **Section 33** - Additional tax for default in making or paying deductions of non-resident withholding tax (amends section 322 of the principal Act).
*   **Section 39** - Additional tax for default in making tax deduction or in paying any amount due to Commissioner (amends section 370 of the principal Act).
*   **Section 40** - Additional tax to be charged if default made in payment of tax (amends section 398 of the principal Act).
*   **Section 42** - Relief from additional tax (amends section 413 of the principal Act).

_**1 Introduction**_

The above sections of this Amendment Act amend the provisions contained in the Income Tax Act 1976 relating to additional tax for default in payment of income tax and penalty for default in payment of tax deductions and non-resident withholding tax. Also amended is the provision allowing relief from the additional tax incurred.

The amendments result from the announcement made in the 1984 Budget, which stated that commencing 1 April 1985, the penalty for the late payment of tax and Accident Compensation employer and self-employed levies will be increased.

The effect of the announcement is to increase the late payment additional tax/penalty from a 10 percent flat additional tax/penalty to a 10 percent flat additional tax/penalty plus an incremental additional compounding 10 percent additional tax/penalty for each six months on the balance outstanding, ie, additional tax will be added to so much of both the tax and any additional tax previously as remains unpaid at the expiry of the relevant six months period.

The new additional tax/penalty provisions will apply where payment is late in respect of:

1.  Income Tax
2.  Provisional Tax
3.  PAYE Tax Deductions
4.  Excess Retention Tax
5.  Non-Resident Withholding Tax
6.  Withdrawal Tax
7.  Penal Tax
8.  National Superannuitant Surcharge
9.  Fringe Benefit Tax
10.  Land Tax
11.  Accident Compensation Employer and Self-Employed Levies

A_dditional tax_, as distinct from a penalty, accrues by law for late payment of all the above revenues except PAYE tax deductions, non-resident withholding tax and AC levies, in which cases a _penalty_ is imposed. This difference is referred to throughout this Appendix.

As a result of the amendments made to the additional tax provisions, section 413 of the Act, the provisions of which relate to the remission of additional tax, has been amended. Under the new provisions the first accrual of 10 percent additional tax will still require written application before remission can be considered, but the subsequent imposition of additional tax (referred to in this Appendix as incremental tax) will be remitted automatically where the outstanding tax is payable in accordance with an arrangement entered into with the Department, where the arrangement has been faithfully adhered to. The incremental tax will also be remitted automatically where the outstanding tax is payable in accordance with a section 400 notice and the terms of the notice are faithfully adhered to.

_**2 Application**_

The application of the new additional tax/penalty provisions along with the first _possible_ application of the "incremental" additional tax/penalty in respect of each revenue, ie, the 10 percent additional tax charged on the balance unpaid six months after the last day for payment, is listed below.

The provisions will first apply in respect of outstanding:

(1) _**Income Tax**_ \- on income derived during the income year commencing 1 April 1985 (1985/1986 accounting year). The effect for a taxpayer with a 31 March balance date is:

_**Terminal Income Tax for 1985/86**_ - due and payable 7 February 1987

*   10 percent additional tax on the amount unpaid by 7 March 1987.
*   10 percent additional tax imposed on the amount, including additional tax previously imposed that is unpaid by 7 September 1987.
*   10 percent additional tax on so much of the balance, including additional tax previously imposed, as remains unpaid at the end of each successive six months period, ie, 7 March 1986, 7 September 1968, and so on.
*   The first possible application of the new additional tax is in respect of tax assessed for an October 1965 balance date (1965/86 accounting year) where the terminal tax is due and payable 7 September 1986. Additional tax would be imposed on the tax unpaid by 7 October 1986 with "incremental" additional tax being imposed on the amount unpaid by 7 April 1987, 7 September 1987, and so on.

(2) _**Provisional Tax**_ - relating to the income year commencing 1 April 1985, that is, 1986 provisional tax. The effect for a taxpayer with 31 March 1986 balance date who is liable to pay 1986 provisional tax, is:

_**First Instalment 1966 Provisional Tax**_

Due and payable 7 August 1985.

*   10 percent additional tax on any amount unpaid by 7 September 1985.
*   10 percent "incremental" additional tax on any amount of first instalment and first 10 percent additional tax thereon that is unpaid by 7 March 1986; and
*   10 percent "incremental" additional tax on any balance of the foregoing provisional tax and additional tax that is unpaid by 7 September 1986.

_**Second Instalment 1986 Provisional Tax**_

Due and payable 7 February 1986.

*   10 percent additional tax on any amount unpaid by 7 March 1986.
*   10 percent "incremental" additional tax on any amount of second instalment and first 10 percent additional tax thereon that is unpaid by 7 September 1986.

Under this new scheme, the six months "incremental" periods in relation to _provisional_ tax unpaid can be only such six months periods as end on or before the day preceding the day the _income_ tax for the year concerned becomes due and payable. In other words, in the case of the above example, further additional tax on provisional tax unpaid cannot be added after 7 September 1986, as that is the last six months sequential period that can end _before_ 7 February 1987. For further comment refer to comment on subsection (7) of section 40.

*   Under this new scheme, the first possible imposition of "incremental" additional tax for provisional tax payable will be in respect of an October 1985 balance date (1985/86 accounting year). In this case the first instalment of provisional tax was due and payable 7 February 1985. 10 percent additional tax would have been imposed on that instalment of provisional tax unpaid by 7 March 1985 with the first "incremental" additional tax arising on 7 September 1985, ie, seven months after the due date for payment of the first instalment.

(3) _**PAYE Tax Deductions**_ - made or required to be made on or after April 1985:

*   First possible application of the "incremental" penalty would be in respect of April 1985 tax deductions, due and payable on 20 May 1985, the incremental penalty being imposed on the amount of those deductions, and the 10 percent penalty first imposed, remaining unpaid on 20 November 1985, ie, _six_ months after the due date for payment. Section 370 of the Act, which imposes the penalty for late payment of tax deductions, does not allow one month between the due date and the day the first 10 percent penalty is imposed. Therefore the first incremental penalty is imposed _six_ months after the due date as distinct from seven months in the case of income tax.

(4) _**Excess Retention Tax**_ - for the year of assessment ending 31 March 1986 (excess retention tax is deemed to be income tax therefore subject to the provisions of section 398 of the Act).

*   First possible application of the "incremental" additional tax would be in reset of a private investment company with an October 1985 balance date. The earliest possible due date for excess retention tax would be 7 December 1986, with "incremental" additional tax being imposed on the amount of excess retention tax, and the 10 percent additional tax first imposed, remaining unpaid on 7 July 1987.

Although the earliest possible application of the incremental tax is as given above, in practice it is more than likely that the due date will be subsequent to that given.

(5) _**Non-Resident Withholding Tax**_ \- imposed on non-resident withholding income derived on or after 1 April 1985.

*   First possible application of "incremental" penalty would be in respect of non-resident withholding income derived in April 1985 with the due date for payment being 20 May 1985. Same 10 percent penalty application as for PAYE tax deductions - refer (3) above.

(6) _**Withdrawal Tax**_ - on withdrawal income derived during the income year commencing 1 April 1985 (under section 336 of the Income Tax Act, the additional tax provisions in section 398 apply as if withdrawal tax were income tax).

*   First possible application of "incremental" additional tax would be in respect of withdrawal income derived in April 1985, due and payable 20 May 1985, where the withdrawal tax and/or the 10 percent additional tax imposed on the 20 May 1985, is not paid by 20 November 1985.

(7) _**Penal Tax**_ - assessed on tax imposed on income derived during the income year commencing 1 April 1965. (Penal tax is deemed to be tax of the same nature as the deficient tax in relation to which it is assessed. It is deemed to be payable in and for the same year of assessment as the deficient tax.)

*   First possible application of "incremental" additional tax in relation to penal tax would be in respect of an assessment of penal tax in relation to an October 1985 balance date.

(8) _**National Superannuitant Surcharge**_ \- on income derived in the income year commencing 1 April 1985.

*   First possible application of "incremental" additional tax would be in respect of an October 1985 balance date, the due date for payment of the surcharge being 7 September 1966. "Incremental" additional tax would be incurred, on the surcharge and the 10 percent additional tax imposed on 7 October 1986, on 7 April 1987.

(9) _**Fringe Benefit Tax**_ - on any fringe benefit provided to any employee on or after 1 April 1985.

*   First possible application of "incremental" additional tax would be in respect of the quarter ending 30 June 1985, due date for payment 20 July 1985. "Incremental" additional tax would be incurred on any fringe benefit tax unpaid at 20 January 1986.

**Note:** The additional tax provisions in relation to fringe benefit tax are contained in section 336U of the Act, as introduced by section 34 of this Amendment Act.

(10) _**Land Tax**_ assessed in the year of assessment beginning 1 April 1985 (on land value of land held at noon on 31 March 1965).

*   First "incremental" additional tax in respect of 1985 land tax due and payable 7 October 1985, with the last day for payment 7 November 1985, would be incurred on the amount of land tax, including additional tax previously imposed, that is unpaid by 7 May 1986.

(11) _**Accident Compensation levies**_ where:

1.  Earnings as an employee are paid by the employer on or after 1 April 1985:
    *   First "incremental" penalty in respect of 1986 employer levy, due and to be paid by 31 May 1986, would be 30 November 1986.
2.  Earnings as a self-employed person derived in the income year commencing 1 April 1985:
    *   first "incremental" penalty on AC self-employed levy, due 7 February 1987 and to be paid by 7 March 1987, would be 7 September 1987.

_**3 Implementation**_

Full details of the amendments to the sections covered in this Appendix are given below. Details of the amendments made to the Land Tax Act 1976 and the Accident Compensation Act 1982 relating to the new additional tax/penalty provisions are included in separate parts of this TPC.

### Section 33: Additional Tax for Default in Making or Paying Deductions of Non-Residential Withholding Tax

This section amends section 322 of the principal Act which imposes a penalty for default in making or paying non-resident withholding tax. This amendment provides that the new incremental penalty, as announced in the Budget, is to be imposed in respect of non-resident withholding tax.

_**Subsection (1)**_

This subsection repeals and substitutes subsection (1) of section 322.

It provides for a penalty to be imposed under this section for default in making or paying non-resident withholding tax.

Paragraphs (a) to (c) of this subsection effectively remain unchanged. They determine for the purposes of imposing a penalty under this section when a default in the making or paying of non-resident withholding tax occurs.

If a default occurs the person is liable, unless the Commissioner is satisfied that the person has not been guilty of wilful neglect or default, to a penalty which is calculated in accordance with paragraphs (d) to (f) of this subsection.

The penalty is imposed on the expiry of the day on which the failure occurs, this day being the due date for payment. In most instances the due date is the 20th of the month immediately following the month in which the deductions have been made. There is not a period of grace, as there is in the case of income tax, of one month after the due date before the imposition of the penalty.

*   Paragraph (d) imposes a penalty equal to 10 percent of the amount in respect of which default has been made, on the expiry of the day on which the failure occurs.
*   Paragraph (e) adds a 10 percent penalty on the amount in default, plus any penalty added under paragraph (d) of this subsection, which remains unpaid six months after the day on which the original failure occurred.
*   Paragraph (f) adds a further 10 percent penalty on the amount in default, plus any penalty added to that amount under paragraphs (d) and (e) of this subsection and penalty added under this paragraph, which remains unpaid for any of the periods of six months that consecutively succeed the period of six months referred to in paragraph (e).

**Example:**

Non-resident withholding increase derived July 1986.

Non-resident withholding tax on the above income due and payable 20 August 1986, amounting to $500

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|     | CR  | DR  | Balance of Account |
|     | $   | $   | $   |
| NRWT due and payable 20.8.86 |     |     | 500 |
| Penalty imposed if not paid by20.8.86 (pursuant to paragraph (d)) |     | 50  | 550 |
| Penalty imposed if not paid by 20.2.87 (pursuant to paragraph (e)) |     | 55  | 605 |
| and so on, on the amount remaining unpaid. |     |     |     |

_**Subsection (2)**_

Application - This section will apply with respect to non-resident withholding tax payable in respect of non-resident withholding income derived on or after 1 April 1985; refer paragraph 2(5) of this circular.

### Section 39: Additional Tax for Default in Making Tax Deduction or in Paying Any Amount Due to Commissioner

This section amends section 370 of the principal Act which imposes a penalty for default in making or paying PAYE tax deductions to the Commissioner.

The section provides that the incremental penalty is to apply in respect of tax deductions. It also removes the provision that the Commissioner cannot impose the penalty unless he is satisfied that the taxpayer has been guilty of wilful neglect or default, and adds to the section the right for taxpayers to have recourse under the provisions of section 413 of the Act to request relief from the penalty imposed under this section.

_**Subsection (1)**_

Paragraphs (a) to (c) of this subsection determine when a default occurs in making or paying PAYE tax deductions to the Commissioner.

When a default has occurred pursuant to any of paragraphs (a) to (c), on the day the failure occurs the employer or the person who failed to make or pay the tax deductions is liable to the penalty imposed pursuant to paragraphs (d) to (f) of this subsection.

Tax deductions are due and payable on the 20th day of the month immediately following the month in which the tax deductions are made. Each month is treated separately and penalties will accrue for each month there is default in making or paying the tax deductions.

Paragraph (d) imposes a penalty equal to 10 percent of the amount in respect of which default has been made, on the expiry of the day on which the failure occurs.

Paragraph (e) adds a 10 percent penalty on the amount in default, and on any penalty added under paragraph (d) of this subsection, which remains unpaid _six months_ after the day on which the failure occurs.

Paragraph (f) adds a further 10 percent penalty on the amount in default, and on any penalty added to that amount under paragraphs (d) and (e) of this subsection and on penalty added under this paragraph, which remains unpaid for any of the periods of six months that consecutively succeed the period of six months referred to in paragraph (e) of this subsection.

_**Subsection (2)**_

This subsection amends subsection (4) of section 370 by omitting the words "section 398" and substituting the words "section 398(2)(a)".

The effect of this amendment, by deeming the penalty imposed under this section to be additional tax imposed under section 398(2)(a) of the Act, is to give the employer or person who has incurred the penalty or additional penalty the right to request relief in terms of section 413(2) of the Act. Section 413(2) (as amended) requires the taxpayer to apply for relief from additional tax in writing. The provisions in section 413(3) relating to the automatic remission of additional tax where the taxpayer makes and adheres to an arrangement with the Commissioner for the payment of tax arrears, will not apply to the penalty imposed under section 370.

_**Subsection (3)**_

Application - This section will apply with respect to tax deductions made or required to be made in respect of the tax on income derived in the income year commencing 1 April 1985. Refer paragraph 2(3) of this circular.

### Section 40: Additional Tax To Be Charged If Default Made In Payment of Tax

Section 40 amends section 398 of the principal Act, which imposes additional tax if a default is made in the payment of income tax. The amendment repeals section 398 and substitutes a new section 398.

The new section can be broken down into two areas:

1.  The inclusion of new "incremental" additional tax provisions along with a continuation of the provisions as they existed in section 398 relating to due dates for payment - subsections (2), (5), (6), (7) and (8) of the substituted section 398.
2.  The inclusion of an "in lieu" additional tax calculated at an annual interest rate in respect of "deferrable tax", as defined in the new section 34 of the principal Act (as substituted by section 7 of this Amendment Act) - subsections (1), (3) and (4) of the substituted section 398.

The comment on section 40 in this Part of this Appendix is limited to the first area, ie, subsections (2), (5), (6), (7), and (8). Comment on the second area, ie, subsections (1), (3), and (4), is included in Part II of this Appendix, which covers the collection and payment of tax in dispute.

_**Subsection (2) of the new section 398**_

**Introduction**

This subsection sets out the amount of additional tax to be imposed for default in payment of income tax and the recurring six monthly liability for further "incremental" additional tax.

It should be noted that subsection (2) does not impose additional tax in respect of "deferrable tax" during the period of deferral, the additional tax for deferrable tax being imposed under subsection (4) of this section.

If a taxpayer has incurred additional tax for late payment of tax, that tax not being "deferrable tax", the additional tax will be added under subsection (2).

If at the same time the taxpayer has an amount of "deferrable tax", additional tax will be added to the "deferrable tax" under subsection (4), thus a taxpayer could have additional tax being imposed under both subsections (2) and (4).

As already mentioned, full details of the additional tax to be imposed in respect of "deferrable tax" are included in Part II of this Appendix.

Subsection (2) of section 398 applies to income tax and the revenues which are deemed to be income tax for the collection and recovery purposes of the principal Act. The provisions which impose penalty for late payment of non-resident withholding tax and tax deductions have already been commented on - refer to the explanations under sections 33 and 39 respectively. Additional tax in respect of default in payment of Fringe Benefit Tax is imposed in accordance with the provisions of section 336U of the principal Act, as enacted by section 34 of this Amendment Act.

**Implementation**

Subsection (2) deems any additional tax calculated in accordance with this section to be added to the tax remaining unpaid, and to be payable accordingly. (Note that the additional tax is incurred and imposed automatically, by operation of the law, immediately the time for payment has expired.)

Additional tax imposed becomes automatically income tax, and additional tax is to be recovered accordingly as income tax.

**Paragraph (a) of Subsection (2 )**

Provides that additional tax of 10 percent will be added to any tax remaining unpaid on the expiry of _one month_ immediately following either the due date for payment or the date of demand of the tax, whichever is applicable.

"Date of demand" relates to special assessments issued pursuant to section 12 of the principal Act and to assessments of penal tax, where the tax assessed is payable to the Commissioner on demand.

**Paragraph (b) of Subsection (2)**

Provides that additional tax of 10 percent will be added to so much of the tax, including the additional tax added under paragraph (a), as remains unpaid on the expiry of _seven months_ immediately following either the due date for payment or the date of demand of the tax, whichever is applicable.

**Paragraph (c) of Subsection (2)**

Provides that additional tax of 10 percent will be added to so much tax, including additional tax added under paragraphs (a) and (b), as remains unpaid on the expiry of the six months immediately the end of the period of seven months referred to in paragraph (b).

**Paragraph (d) of Subsection (2)**

Provides that additional tax of 10 percent will be added to so much of the tax, including any additional tax added under paragraphs (a), (b) and (c), and under this paragraph, as remains unpaid at the expiry of any of the periods of six months that, consecutively, succeed the six months period referred to in paragraph (c).

This paragraph provides for the continuing imposition of 10 percent additional tax for each six months period that the tax remains unpaid.

**Example**

|     |     | CR  | DR  | Balance of Account |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|     |     | $   | $   | $   |
|     | 1986 Income Tax due and payable 7.2.87 |     |     | 1,000 |
| 1.  | 10 percent additional tax added if unpaid by 7.3.87 (pursuant to paragraph (a)) |     | 100 | 1,100 |
| 2.  | 10 percent additional tax added if unpaid by 7.9.87 (pursuant to paragraph (b)) |     | 110 | 1,210 |
| 3.  | 10 percent additional tax added if unpaid by 7.3.88 (pursuant to paragraph (c)) |     | 121 | 1,331 |
| 4.  | 10 percent additional tax added if unpaid by 7.9.86 (pursuant to paragraph (d)) |     | 133.10 | 1,464.10 |
| 5.  | 10 percent additional tax added if unpaid by 7.3.85 (pursuant to paragraph (d)) |     | 146.41 | 1,610.51 |

(and so on, at the expiry of each subsequent period of six months.)

When a payment is made against tax in arrears the incremental additional tax is calculated on the balance that remains unpaid at the date the incremental additional tax accrues by law pursuant to subsection (2) of section 398.

**Example:**

|     |     | CR  | DR  | Balance of Account |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|     |     | $   | $   | $   |
|     | 1986 Income Tax due and payable 7.2.87 |     |     | 1,000 |
| 1.  | 10 percent additional tax added if unpaid by 7.3.87 (pursuant to paragraph (a)) |     | 100 | 1,100 |
|     | Payment received 20.7.87 | 500 |     | 600 |
| 2.  | 10 percent additional tax added if unpaid by 7.9.87 (pursuant to paragraph (b)) |     | 60  | 660 |
|     | Payment received 20.11.87 | 500 |     | 160 |
| 3.  | 10 percent additional tax added if unpaid by 7.3.88 (pursuant to paragraph (c)) |     | 16  | 176 |
|     | Payment received 4.9.88 | 176 |     | Nil |

_**Subsection (3) and Subsection (4)**_

For comment on these two subsections refer to Part II of this Appendix.

_**Subsection (5) of the new section 398**_

This is merely a repeat of the provision which was previously contained in subsection (2) of section 398. It allows the Commissioner, when an assessment is not made until after the due date for payment or the tax is increased after the due date for payment, to fix a new due date for the tax or the increase. A new due date can be fixed only when the Commissioner is satisfied that the taxpayer has not been guilty of wilful neglect or default in completing his return of income, in respect of which the tax is payable.

Any due date fixed under this section is deemed to be the due date for purposes of calculating the additional tax under subsections (2) and (4).

_**Subsection (6) of the new section 398**_

This repeats the provision which was previously subsection (2A) of section 398. It provides that additional tax for late payment will be incurred if the tax is not paid in time, irrespective of whether the return of income has been furnished.

_**Subsection (7) of the new section 398**_

This is a new provision.

This subsection ensures that further incremental additional tax for late payment of provisional tax cannot be charged on any amount of the provisional tax that is still outstanding after the due date for of the terminal tax for the income year in respect of which the provisional tax is payable.

This provision has become necessary only as a result of the introduction of the "incremental" additional tax. The previous legislation made no provision for the additional tax on outstanding provisional tax to cease to be imposed when the due date for payment of the terminal tax had been reached, because the former additional tax of a flat and final 10 percent meant that such a provision was unnecessary.

Provisional tax is _not_ income tax; it is an _amount_ payable under Part XII of the principal Act and, if paid, is allowed as a credit against the income tax payable for the year concerned. The new provision, referred to above, will ensure that further incremental additional tax on provisional tax will not be incurred after the day immediately preceding the due date for payment of the _income tax_ that is payable for the income year in relation to which the _amount_ by way provisional tax was payable. Any outstanding additional tax already incurred in respect of an unpaid or late paid amount by way of provisional tax will of course _still_ be payable.

Commencing with the expiry of one month after the due date for payment of the _income tax_ for the incline year concerned, the "10 percent flat, plus 10 percent incremental" system of additional tax will apply to any of that _income tax_ that is not paid in time.

**Example:**

To show how the new provision will operate:

_**1987 income year.**_

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1st instalment of provisional tax due and payable 7.8.86 |     |     | $300 |
| 2nd instalment of provisional tax due and payable 7.2.87 |     |     | $60 |
| Income tax due and payable 7.2.88 |     |     | $1,000 |
|     | 1st Instalment of Provisional Tax: |     | **Balance** |
|     |     |     | $   |
|     | **not paid by** |     |     |
|     | 7.9.86 10 percent additional tax incurred: | $30 | 300 |
|     | 7.3.87 10 percent additional tax incurred: | $33 | 363 |
|     | 7.9.87 10 percent additional tax incurred: | $36.30 | 399.30 |
|     |     | $99.30 |     |
|     | 2nd Instalment of Provisional Tax: |     | **Balance** |
|     |     |     | $   |
|     | **not paid by** |     |     |
|     | 7.3.87 10 percent additional tax incurred: | $60 | 600 |
|     | 7.9.87 10 percent additional tax incurred: | $66 | 660 |
|     |     | $126 | 726 |
|     | Total additional tax | $225.30 |     |

In this example the provisional tax has not been paid and additional tax of $225.30 has been incurred. The unpaid provisional tax and unpaid additional tax will not attract further additional tax at any time beyond 7 September 1987, ie, the last day of the final full six months incremental period that precedes the due date for payment of the terminal tax, 7 February 1988.

|     | 7.3.88 10 percent additional tax | $100 | $1,100 |

(and so on, at the expiry of each subsequent period of six months.)

As provisional tax has not been paid no credit is given, in the assessment, against the amount of terminal tax assessed. The $1,000 terminal tax will have additional tax imposed on the full amount if not paid by 7 March 1988, and incremental additional tax will be added for each six months period the tax remains unpaid. The additional tax of $225.30, incurred for non payment of the provisional tax, is still payable.

_**Subsection (8) of the new section 398**_

This subsection rewrites the former subsection (3) of section 398 of the Act.

It provides that the Commissioner shall extend the due date for tax payable by non-residents by up to six months after the due date.

The subsection deems the extended due date to be the due date for the purposes of subsection (2)(a) of this section, thus ensuring that additional tax on tax unpaid will not commence to accrue by law until the expiry of one month after the extended due date.

### Application

This section of the Amendment Act applies with respect to the tax on income derived in the income year commencing on 1 April 1985, and in every subsequent year. Refer to paragraph 2 of this Appendix for further details.

### Section 42: Relief From Additional Tax

This section repeals section 413 of the principal Act and substitutes a new section 413. Section 413 provides for remission by the Commissioner, in specified circumstances, of additional tax incurred under section 398 of the principal Act, as substituted by section 40 of this Amendment Act.

Section 413 has been amended to require that the Commissioner remit the additional tax added to the tax remaining unpaid seven months onwards after the due date for payment, where the outstanding tax is payable by instalments in accordance with an arrangement entered into between the Commissioner and the taxpayer, or in accordance with a section 400 notice, and where that arrangement, or notice _has been faithfully adhered to in every respect_. Taxpayers will NOT need to make an application for the remission of additional tax in such cases.

The provisions of section 413 will not apply to additional tax imposed pursuant to subsection (4) of section 398, ie, the additional tax calculation in respect of "deferrable tax" as defined in section 34 of the Act, (as now amended). Taxpayers will not have the right to request remission of this additional tax. For further details refer to Part II of this Appendix.

_**Subsection (1):**_

This subsection defines, for the purposes of section 413 only, the term "incremental tax". "Incremental tax" means the additional tax added to unpaid tax in accordance with the provisions of section 398(2)(b) or 398(2)(c) or 398(2)(d) of the Act, ie, the additional tax incurred 7 months and onwards after the due date for payment, not the additional tax incurred 1 month after the due date.

The purpose of this definition is to distinguish between the 10 percent additional tax incurred in respect of unpaid tax one month after the due date for payment and the additional tax incurred thereafter .

_**Subsection (2):**_

Provides that the Commissioner may grant relief to the taxpayer by way of remission of additional tax added to unpaid tax under section 398(2)(a) of the Act, ie, the 10 percent additional tax added one month after the due date, and "incremental tax", as defined.

This subsection merely extends the former provisions, to incorporate "incremental tax" and extends the right of taxpayers to apply for the remission of "incremental tax" where the "incremental tax" is not subject to the automatic remission provisions contained in subsection (3) of this section (refer below).

The other provisions of the section remain unchanged in that the taxpayer or his agent must apply for relief from the additional tax or incremental tax in writing, and the Commissioner if, having regard to the circumstances of the case, thinks it is equitable, may grant relief to the taxpayer by the remission of the whole or a part of the additional tax or the "incremental tax" and, if appropriate, make refund accordingly.

_**Subsection (3):**_

This subsection introduces a new provision whereby the Commissioner is required, in specified circumstances, to remit the "incremental tax" without written application from the taxpayer. This provision will apply only where the taxpayer has entered into an arrangement with the Commissioner to pay the tax, or the tax is paid pursuant to a notice under section 460 of the Act.

The provision has been introduced with the view to encouraging taxpayers who find that they cannot pay their tax in time to enter into an instalment arrangement with the Commissioner and thus avoid incurring the "incremental" additional tax. For this automatic remission to apply it is essential that _every payment_ pursuant to the instalment arrangement or the section 400 notice be made within the time specified. (Fuller notes on this automatic remission are given below. )

It will apply only to the incremental tax which accrues _during_ the period of the instalment arrangement or the duration of the section 400 notice. It does not apply to the first imposition of additional tax, ie, the 10 percent additional tax imposed one month after the due date for payment, that additional tax being subject to the right to request remission under subsection (2) of this section.

**Example:**

|     |     | Balance of Account |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.  | Tax due and payable 7.2.86 | 200 |
| 2.  | Tax not paid by 7.3.86 10 percent tax added $20 | 220 |
| 3.  | Tax not paid by 7.9.86 10 percent incremental tax added $22 | 242 |

4\. Taxpayer enters an arrangement to pay the arrears of tax on 1.12.86. Arrangement is to pay $50 per month from 1.1.87 to 1.4.87 with the balance of $42 payable on 1.5.87.

In this example the "incremental" additional tax to be charged on 7 March 1987 will be remitted without written application from the taxpayer if the instalments are paid by the taxpayer pursuant to the terms of the arrangement. The additional tax charged on 7 March 1986 and the incremental tax charged on 7 September 1987 will not be remitted under subsection (3). However, the taxpayer will have recourse under the provisions of subsection (2) of section 413 to request, in writing to the Commissioner, relief from the additional tax and incremental tax that does not qualify for the automatic remission resulting from "instalment compliance".

This automatic remission provision will apply where the incremental tax in relation to which the taxpayer has incurred liability for payment during the term of the instalment arrangement is:

1.  Tax that is payable in two or more instalments pursuant to an arrangement entered into between the taxpayer and the Commissioner; or
2.  Tax in respect of which deductions are required to be made, and paid to the Commissioner, pursuant to a notice issued under section 406(2) of the principal Act;

and where every one of the instalments has been faithfully adhered to pursuant to the terms of the arrangement or where every one of the deductions and payments has been adhered to pursuant to the section 406 notice.

The subsection provides that where these provisions are complied with, the Commissioner _shall_ remit the incremental tax. If that incremental tax has been paid, the Commissioner will refund it, so far as may be appropriate.

_**Subsection (4):**_

This subsection provides that for any case or class of cases, additional tax or incremental tax in respect of which the taxpayer has applied for remission under _subsection (2)_ of this section, cannot be remitted or refunded, if the amount exceeds $1,000, without the Minister's approval.

By the reference to subsection (2) in this subsection, incremental tax remitted automatically under subsection (3) of this section does not fall within this restriction and amounts in excess of $1,000 can be remitted without the Minister's approval.

_**Application**_

This section (as amended) will apply with respect to the tax on income derived in the income year commencing on the 1st day of April 1985, and in every subsequent year.

### Appendix A - Part II

### Payment and Collection of Tax In Dispute

This Part of this Appendix comments on the following sections of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 2) 1985.

*   _Section 7 - Obligation to pay tax where objection lodged (amends section 34 of the principal Act)._
*   _Section 8 - interest on certain excess tax (inserts a new section 34A to the principal Act)._
*   _Section 40 - Additional tax to be charged if default made in payment of tax (amends section 398 of the principal Act)._

_**Introduction**_

It was announced in the 1984 Budget that new provisions were to be introduced for tax payable which is the subject of a dispute. The original intention was to require the objector to pay the whole of the tax assessed by the ordinary due date, and that where a dispute was resolved in the taxpayer's favour interest would be paid on any tax overpayment which was refunded.

As a result of the deliberations on the Income Tax Amendment Bill (No 2) 1984 by the Parliamentary Select Committee, the procedures for the collection and payment of tax in dispute were amended.

The new procedures are:

*   Taxpayers who have lodged a qualifying ("competent") objection or an appeal in relation to an assessment of tax will be able to defer payment of _one half_ of the amount of tax which is in dispute, until the date of final resolution of the case - section 7 of this Amendment Act.
*   The amount of tax which is not in dispute and the remaining half amount of tax in dispute which is not able to be deferred, will be payable by the ordinary due date and subject to the normal recovery procedures for the late or non-payment of tax - section 7 of this Amendment Act.
*   The right to defer payment of tax in dispute will not be available in relation to objections to assessments which have been lodged on the grounds that the taxpayer has omitted to claim a rebate, or a work related expense, or other similar circumstances - section 7 of this Amendment Act.
*   The Commissioner will have the right to seek and enforce judgment for the recovery of the amount of tax not in dispute and the amount of tax in dispute not able to be deferred, as separate debts, and also in due course to seek and enforce judgment for the amount of tax which has been deferred and which is ultimately determined to be payable - section 7 of this Amendment Act.
*   Where the objection is resolved in the taxpayer's favour and an overpayment of tax is established, interest will be paid by the Commissioner on the amount of the overpayment - section 8 of this Amendment Act.
*   Where and to the extent that the objection is resolved in the Commissioner's favour, the additional tax incurred during the period of deferral in respect of the amount of tax which has been deferred (and which is determined ultimately to be payable) will be remitted, but will be replaced by an additional tax calculated on a daily basis during the period of deferral, at the same rate of interest as that which will be paid by the Commissioner where an overpayment of disputed tax is established - section 40 of this Amendment Act.
*   This "interest-based" additional tax, plus the amount of tax which has been deferred will, if not paid within one month after the resolution of the case, incur the 10 percent additional tax plus the subsequent incremental additional tax for late or non-payment - section 40 of this Amendment Act.
*   The rate of interest to be used by the Commissioner for the payment of interest, and for the calculation of additional tax has been set for the period of 12 consecutive months commencing 1 April 1985 at _20 percent per annum_, as specified in the Income Tax (Specified Rate of Interest) Notice 1985, notified in the Gazette on 28 March 1985.

The comment included in this Part of the Appendix relating to section 40 of the Amendment Act is only in respect of subsections (1), (3) and (4) of section 40. These subsections provide for the imposition of the "interest-based" additional tax in respect of the deferred amount of tax.

Comment on the other provisions of section 40 are included in Part I of this Appendix - Additional Tax/Penalty for Late Payment of Tax.

### APPLICATION

### A. Right to Defer Payment of One Half of Tax in Dispute

The right to defer payment of one half of the amount of tax in dispute is contained in section 7 of the Amendment Act (amends section 34 of the principal Act).

Section 7 will apply in respect of objections to assessments, notices of which are issued on or after the 1st day of April 1985, ie, it will apply to _any_ income year where an objection has been lodged in respect of an assessment the notice of which is issued on or after 1 April 1985 in respect of that income year. This includes an amended assessment the notice of which is issued after 1 April 1985.

The right to defer payment of one half of the amount of tax in dispute will apply to:

*   Income tax, including excess retention tax, withdrawal tax, penal tax, National Superannuitant surcharge, fringe benefit tax.
*   Land tax, by virtue of section 45 of the Land Tax Act 1976 which by reference, adopts the same deferral provisions.

The ability to defer payment of one-half of the amount of tax in dispute will not apply to taxpayers who have objected to an assessment of Non-Resident Withholding Tax. The full amount of non-resident withholding tax in dispute will be required to be paid by the original due date.

The ability to defer will also not apply to provisional tax assessments by virtue of the fact that a notice of assessment is not issued for provisional tax (which, by law, is not "income tax").

Provisional tax will still be required to be based on the tax payable, on the provisional income, that would have been payable had there not been a 50 percent deferral, with the taxpayer also having the right to estimate and re-estimate provisional tax in the normal course.

PAYE tax deductions cannot be objected to until an assessment of income tax was been made and a notice of assessment given to the taxpayer. The tax deductions form part of the assessment to which the taxpayer can object; a taxpayer cannot object to the tax deductions made.

### B. Commissioner to Pay Interest on Overpaid Tax in Dispute

The provision whereby the Commissioner is to pay interest on any overpaid amount of tax in dispute is in section 8 of the Amendment Act (inserts section 34A into the principal Act).

Section 8 has the same application date as section 7, ie, it will apply in respect of objections to assessments, notices of which are issued on or after the 1st day of April 1985.

This section differs from the application of section 7 in that interest will be paid on overpaid tax, where the objection has been found in the taxpayer's favour, in respect of:

*   Income tax, including excess retention tax, withdrawal tax, penal tax, National Superannuitant surcharge, fringe benefit tax, and non-resident withholding tax.
*   Land tax by virtue of section 45 of the Land Tax Act 1976 (as amended ).
*   Provisional tax by virtue of the definition of "qualifying tax in dispute" in section 8.

### C. Imposition of "Interest Based" Additional Tax in Respect of Deferrable Tax

Section 40 of the Amendment Act (amends section 398 of the principal Act) provides that any additional tax imposed during the period of deferral in respect of the deferrable tax shall be calculated at a daily interest rate, equivalent to the interest rate per annum which will be used to calculate interest paid by the Commissioner for overpaid tax in dispute, pursuant to section 34A of the Act, as inserted by section 8 of the Amendment Act.

Section 40 applies with respect to the tax on income derived in the income year commencing on the 1st day of April 1985 and in every subsequent year, ie, 1985/86 income year or equivalent accounting year.

This application date differs from the application date that applies to sections 7 and 8 of this Amendment Act.

The effect of the differing application dates is to have three different systems, determined by reference to time, for the collection and payment of tax in dispute. The application of each system, outlined below, will depend on when the notice of assessment, in respect of which the taxpayer has objected, was given or issued to the taxpayer.

This provision will apply to the same revenues as those to which section 7 of this Amendment Act applies.

### D. Rules Operating for the Collection and Payment of Tax in Dispute

**System 1: Objections to assessments, notices of which were given prior to 1 April 1985**

The collection and payment of tax in dispute for objections to assessments, notices of which were issued _prior to 1 April 1985_ will follow the rules promulgated in PIB 109, issued in February 1981, viz:

In the case of objections to be determined by the Taxation Review Authority or the High Court the Department will approve deferments of tax on the following basis:

Except where the objection is frivolous the tax on the income in dispute may be deferred for a limited period, in accordance with the following rules:

*   Deferment of the tax in dispute will be approved for a period of twelve months after the original last day for payment or until the objection is decided, whichever occurs first.
*   If the objection has still not been disposed of by the end of the twelve months deferment period then one half of the tax in dispute must be paid. Payment of the balance of the tax will continue to be deferred until the objection has been decided.
*   Where only some of the income is in dispute a notional assessment will be made and the tax on the income not in dispute must be paid by the original last day for payment.

If the Department's assessment is upheld, the additional tax accrued for late payment of the tax assessed will be reduced to an amount equal to interest at 5 percent per annum, calculated on a daily basis from the last day for payment of tax. Payment of the balance of the tax owing is required immediately on determination of the objection.

If the objection is decided in the taxpayer's favour any tax paid is to be refunded promptly.

**System 2: Objections to assessments, notices of which are given on or after 1 April 1985, relating to the 1985 or a prior income year**

The provisions of both sections 34 and 34A (as amended and inserted by sections 7 and 8 of this Amendment Act) will apply to objections to assessments, _notices_ of which are _given_ on or after 1 April 1985.

However, as the new provisions of section 398 (as amended by section 40 of this Amendment Act) will apply with respect to _tax_ on _income derived_ in the income year commencing on 1 April 1985, ie, the 1986 income year, section 40 will not apply to objections to assessments where the assessments relate to the 1985 or a prior income year, regardless of when notice of those assessments is given.

There is therefore a different system for the collection and payment of tax in dispute, where the notice of assessment is given on or _after 1 April 1985_, but the assessment relates to the 1985 or a prior income year.

The effect is:

*   Taxpayers will have the right to defer one-half of the amount of tax in dispute in respect of a competent objection.
*   If the taxpayer succeeds with his objection the Commissioner will pay interest on the amount of tax to be refunded.
*   If the taxpayer does not succeed with his objection, additional tax for late payment will be imposed on the amount of tax deferred. The additional tax will accrue on the expiry of the period of one month after the due date for payment of the tax, and will be the amount of additional tax which applies to the tax on income derived in pre-1985/86 income years, ie, a flat 10 percent on the amount of tax paid late, with no subsequent incremental penalty.
*   Any amount of the tax, not able to be deferred, which is not paid within one month after the due date for payment will likewise be subject to an impost of additional tax at 10 percent flat and final.

**System 3: Objections to assessments, notices of which are given on or after 1 April 1985, relating to the 1986 or subsequent income years**

The essential difference between the rules of System 3 and those outlined in System 2 is that the new provisions of section 398 (as amended by section 40 of this Amendment Act) will apply under System 3.

The effect in respect of objections to assessments where those assessments relate to the 1986 or subsequent income years is:

*   Taxpayers will have the right to defer one-half of the amount of tax in dispute in respect of a competent objection - that half is the "deferrable tax".
*   If the taxpayer succeeds with his objection the Commissioner will pay interest on the amount of tax to be refunded.
*   If the taxpayer does not succeed with his objection additional tax will accrue on:
    *   the amount of the deferrable tax, for the periods of deferral (as defined), calculated at a daily interest rate (the "interest-based" additional tax),
    *   the amount of the deferrable tax, plus the "interest-based" additional tax, which remains unpaid one month after the resolution of the case, at the new rate of additional tax, ie, 10 percent flat, followed by 10 percent incremental for each six months period the tax remains unpaid,
    *   the amount of tax not in dispute plus the amount of tax in dispute not able to be deferred, that is not paid within one month after the due date for payment, on the new 10 percent flat plus incremental basis.

### IMPLEMENTATION

**Section 7: Obligation to Pay Tax Where Objection Lodged**

Section 7 repeals section 34 of the principal Act and substitutes a new section 34.

This section provides the rules for the payment and collection of tax under dispute, where the taxpayer has lodged an objection in respect of an assessment of tax.

The section applies to objections to assessments notices of which are issued on or after 1 April 1985.

_**Subsection (1): Definitions**_

_**"Competent objection"**_

This definition defines the type of objection which qualifies a taxpayer to defer one-half of the tax in dispute, and the type of objection where, if the taxpayer succeeds with his case, the (Commissioner will pay interest on the amount of the tax refunded. The points to note are:

*   The objection must be made by the person to an assessment made under the Act

**Note:** There is no provision to issue a notice of assessment for provisional tax or for PAYE tax deductions, which means that provisional tax and PAYE tax deductions are not within the scope of section 34.

*   The objection must be made in accordance with the provisions of section 30 of the Act, ie,
    1.  The taxpayer may object to the assessment by delivering or posting to the Commissioner a written notice of objection within one month after the date of the notice of assessment.
    2.  The Commissioner can accept late objections depending on the circumstances of the case.
    3.  Where an amended assessment has been issued taxpayers have a further right of objection where a fresh liability is imposed or an existing liability is increased.
*   Competent objection does not include any "non-qualifying objection". This is a defined term and is referred to below.

_**"Day of determination of final liability"**_

This definition defines the cessation of the period of deferral (period of deferral is defined in section 40 of this Amendment Act) in respect of the one-half of the tax in dispute which has been deferred. The day of determination of final liability is the day on which the right of the taxpayer to suspend payment of the amount of deferrable tax expires. The definition relates only to _deferrable tax_ and is defined as being the day on which:

1.  The Commissioner receives from the taxpayer a notice in writing of the taxpayer's withdrawal of his objection.
2.  The Taxation Review Authority determines the objection, where the objection is determined by the Taxation review Authority and not by the Courts. Where a determination by the Taxation Review Authority is taken to appeal, paragraph (c) of this definition will apply.
3.  The objection is determined by the Courts, either by proceedings taken in any Court or by way of appeal, such as to the Court of Appeal or the Privy Council.

The Commissioner cannot take action to recover any amount of _deferrable tax_ until after the day of determination of final liability.

The day of determination of final liability cannot be determined until the expiry of the period allowed by law in which to lodge an appeal to a higher authority.

**Example 1:**

1.  Taxpayer receives a formal notice of disallowance from the Commissioner on 31 May 1986.
2.  Taxpayer accepts that the Commissioner is correct and decides not to appeal the Commissioner's decision. Taxpayer does not advise the Commissioner that he has decided not to appeal further.

In this case the day of determination of final liability would be 31 July 1986, the day on which the two months period in which to appeal further to either the Taxation Review Authority or the High Court expires.

**Example 2:**

1.  Taxpayer has requested that his case be heard by the High Court.
2.  The High Court decides the case in the Commissioner's favour, 19 February 1987.
3.  Taxpayer decides to appeal the High Court decision, to the Court of Appeal.
4.  Taxpayer withdraws his appeal before the case is heard by the Court of Appeal.

In this case the day of determination of final liability is 19 February 1987, the day on which the High Court decision was made. If the taxpayer had taken his appeal, the day of determination of final liability would have been the day on which the Court of Appeal made its decision.

_**"Deferrable tax"**_

This definition defines the amount of tax in dispute which may be deferred as being:

*   An amount equal to _one-half_ of the amount, of the tax assessed, by which if the taxpayer succeeded in a hearing with the Taxation Review Authority or the Courts with the whole or part of his objection, his assessment would be reduced, eg,
    1.  Taxpayer objects to an item of income, amounting to $2,000 being included in his assessment. His marginal tax rate is 66 cents in the dollar.
    2.  If the taxpayer succeeded with his objection, in a hearing or determination by either the Taxation Review Authority or the High Court, the assessment would be reduced by $1,320.
    3.  $1,320 is the total amount of tax in dispute, the deferrable tax being one-half of that amount, $660.

Points to note are:

*   Deferrable tax cannot be determined unless a taxpayer has lodged an objection which is a competent objection, as defined - refer above.
*   Deferrable tax cannot relate to an assessment made in accordance with section 321 of the Act. (Section 321 allows the Commissioner to make an assessment in relation to Part IX of the Act in respect of non-resident withholding tax.)
*   The amount of deferrable tax cannot be determined by the Commissioner until the Commissioner has formally disallowed the taxpayer's objection, in whole or in part.
*   The amount of deferrable tax is to be determined by the Commissioner and notified to the taxpayer by the Commissioner in writing.
*   The amount of deferrable tax can be an amount of tax already paid and held in credit, eg, the assessment, to which the taxpayer has lodged an objection, resulted in a lesser amount of refund of tax to the taxpayer than he would otherwise have received.

This reduction in the amount of tax in credit will be the amount of tax in dispute, one-half of which will be deferrable tax.

Where the deferrable tax has been paid to the Commissioner either direct by the taxpayer or through the PAYE system, before the formal disallowance of the objection, the taxpayer will have the right to request that the amount of deferrable tax be refunded.

**NB:** Deferrable tax _cannot_ consist of a credit of tax that results from a determination made by the Commissioner under section 19(4) of the Tax Act, for example, an export tax credit.

The deferrable tax will be calculated as follows:

**Example One: Debit Assessment**

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Step 1 |     |
| Assessable income $11,000 |     |
| Tax payable on assessable income | $2,762.50 |
| Less rebates | $1,000.00 |
| Tax payable per assessment | $1,762.50 |
| Step 2 |     |
| Assessable income | $11,000 |
| less amount of income |     |
| under dispute | $1,000 |
|     | $10,000 |
| Tax payable on income not under dispute | $2,450 |
| less rebates | $1,000 |
| Tax payable not in dispute | $1,450 |
| Step 3 |     |
| Tax in dispute = tax payable in Step 1 | $1,762.50 |
| less tax payable in Step 2 | $1,450.00 |
|     | $ 312.50 |
| Deferrable tax = 1/2 $312.50 = $156.25 |     |
| Step 4 |     |
| Tax assessed by Commissioner | $1,762.50 |
| less PAYE deductions | $1,262.50 |
| Tax payable | $ 500.00 |
| less deferrable tax | $156.25 |
| Tax payable by due date for payment | $ 343.75 |
| Payment of deferrable tax and the right of the Commissioner to recover the deferrable tax is suspended until expiry of the day of determination of final liability. |     |     |
| **Example Two: Credit Assessment** |     |     |
| Step 1 |     |
| Assessable income | $11,000 |
| Tax payable on assessable |     |
| income | $2,762.50 |
| less rebates allowed by |     |
| Commissioner | $1,000.00 |
| Tax payable per assessment | $1,762.50 |
| Step 2 |     |
| Assessable income | $11,000 |
| less amount of income |     |
| under dispute | $ 1,000 |
|     | $10,000 |
| Tax payable on income not under dispute | $2,450 |
| less rebates claimed by taxpayer | $1,500 |
| Tax payable not in dispute | $ 950 |
| Step 3 |     |
| Tax in dispute = | $1,762.50 |
|     | \-$ 950.00 |
|     | $ 812.50 |
| Deferrable tax = $406.25 |     |
| Step 4 |     |
| Tax assessed by Commissioner | $1,762.50 |
| less PAYE deductions | $2,183.50 |
| Amount of tax in credit | $ 421.00 |
| plus amount of deferrable tax | $ 406.25 |
| Total tax refundable (before hearing of case stated) | $ 827.25 |
| less amount already refunded | $ 421.00 |
| Deferrable tax to be refunded to the taxpayer at the taxpayer's request | $ 406.25 |

_**"Non-qualifying objection"**_

This defines the grounds of objection, to assessments, which cannot be "competent objections" and in respect of which the Commissioner cannot therefore determine an amount of deferrable tax.

(Note that by definition a "competent objection" cannot include a non-qualifying objection.)

A non-qualifying objection is an objection to an assessment, made in accordance with the provisions of section 30 of the Act, where and to the extent that any ground of objection stated by the taxpayer is:

1.  That the taxpayer's return of income or the particulars supplied with that return, in respect of which an assessment has been made by the Commissioner, were deficient or insufficient. This will exclude objections such as those made by taxpayers where;
    1.  They have omitted a claim in their return of income such as a rebate or an employment related expense;
    2.  The Commissioner has disallowed a donation claim made in the return of income in the absence of a receipt for that donation and the taxpayer then forwards the receipt to the Commissioner;
2.  The assessment was issued pursuant to section 21 of the Act, in the absence of the return or the particulars on which had it or they been furnished, the assessment would have been based. (Section 21 is the section which empowers the Commissioner to make "estimated" assessments in certain circumstances.)

*   For example:
*   The Commissioner has requested further information and has disallowed a claim in the absence of a reply, and the taxpayer then forwards the requested information upon receipt of the assessment.

3.  That the determination of a credit of tax made under section 19(4) of the Act, is incorrect.

*   This excludes from the definition, credits of tax claimed pursuant to sections 156A through to 156G of the Act relating to export incentives, and also sections 74A and 157A relating respectively to forestry and export losses.
*   It means that taxpayers who have objected to a determination of a credit of tax, cannot obtain a _refund_ of the one-half of the amount of the credit of tax in dispute which is, of course, money that the taxpayer has _not in fact paid_ to the Commissioner, notwithstanding that in the ordinary course any excess credit of tax is refundable AS IF IT WERE tax paid in excess.

_**Subsection (2):**_

This is the operative subsection of this section. It ensures the right of the Commissioner to receive and recover the tax not able to be deferred, and suspends the obligation to pay and the right of the Commissioner to receive and recover deferrable tax until the day of determination of final liability.

**Paragraph (a)**

Relates to deferrable tax and provides that the right of the Commissioner to recover the amount of deferrable tax and the liability of the taxpayer to pay the amount of deferrable tax shall be suspended until the expiry of the day of determination of final liability (as defined).

This paragraph has the effect of suspending all action to recover the amount of deferrable tax until the day of determination of final liability, thus allowing a taxpayer to request in the interim a refund of the amount of deferrable tax if that amount has already been paid. The matter of additional tax on deferrable tax is discussed later in this Part of this Appendix, in the comments on section 40 of this Amendment Act.

**Paragraph (b)**

Relates to the amount of tax in dispute that is not able to be deferred and to the amount of tax not in dispute. It provides that the right of the Commissioner to receive and recover this tax shall not be suspended by any objection, case stated, or appeal.

This obliges the taxpayer to pay this tax by the due date for payment and gives the Commissioner the right to commence recovery proceedings on this tax if it is not paid by the last day for payment.

_**Subsection (3):**_

This provision allows the Commissioner to pursue legal proceedings in respect of the amount of deferrable tax and the amount of non-deferrable tax as if they were separate debts arising from separate causes of action.

This will allow the Commissioner to take proceedings to obtain judgment in respect of the amount of tax not in dispute and the amount of tax in dispute not able to be deferred, as separate causes of action. If and when it transpires that the deferrable tax is payable by the taxpayer, the Commissioner can then take proceedings to obtain judgment for the amount of deferrable tax, as another cause of action.

_**Subsection (4):**_

This subsection provides that where the taxpayer succeeds with his objection, case stated, or appeal, the Commissioner shall refund immediately any amount of tax received by the Commissioner, which according to the decision on the hearing of the objection, case stated, or appeal was paid in excess of the amount which was properly payable by the taxpayer.

The amount refunded in accordance with this subsection will not include any amount of the deferrable tax which has been refunded to the taxpayer prior to the making of the decision.

The proviso to subsection (4) provides that the amount to be refunded under this subsection will not be refunded until the final resolution of the case. The final resolution is defined as being the _latest_ of:

1.  The day on which the objection is determined by the Commissioner.
2.  The day the decision of a Taxation Review Authority is given in relation to the objection.
3.  The day judgment is given, in relation to an objection, by the High Court, Court of Appeal, or Privy Council, whichever judgment finally determines the objection.

_**Application**_

Section 7 of the No 2 Amendment Act applies with respect to any objection made to an assessment, the notice of which is given on or after the 1st day of April 1985. For further details refer to paragraph (2), of this Part of the Appendix.

### Section 8: Interest On Certain Excess Tax

Section 8 introduces a new section 34A to the principal Act.

Section 34A provides for the Commissioner to pay interest on the amount of tax refunded pursuant to subsection (4) of section 34, as amended by section 7 of this Amendment Act.

The interest paid under this section will be taxable income in the taxpayer's hands in the year of receipt.

_**Subsection (1): Definitions**_

_**"Competent objection"**_

Has the same meaning as that given to it in section 34(1) of the Act.

_**"Instalment portion"**_

This defines the amount of "qualifying tax in dispute" (as defined) on which the interest is calculated. It is defined as meaning either:

1.  the amount of qualifying tax in dispute paid to the Commissioner in one sum and required to be refunded to the taxpayer; or
2.  the aggregate of the amounts of qualifying tax in dispute paid to the Commissioner in two or more instalments and required to be refunded to the taxpayer.

_**"Qualifying tax in dispute"**_

This definition defines the amount of tax which would qualify for an interest payment by the Commissioner if that amount were to be refunded to the taxpayer pursuant to subsection (4) of section 34.

Qualifying tax in dispute, in relation to a taxpayer and to an assessment, is:

1.  The amount of tax, assessed in the assessment, in respect of which the taxpayer has lodged a competent objection.
2.  The amount of a credit of tax determined pursuant to section 19(4) of the Act, to the extent that the taxpayer has objected validly to that determination. This paragraph, in addition, deems the amount of the credit of tax to be, for the purposes of section 34A, an amount of tax paid to the Commissioner by the taxpayer on the date of the determination of the credit of tax.

1.  This deeming of payment is necessary in order to give a date from which to calculate the interest to which the taxpayer is entitled if he succeeds in his objection.

3.  Qualifying tax in dispute also includes any amount of provisional tax payable in relation to the year next succeeding the year in respect of which the taxpayer has lodged an objection, to the extent that that provisional tax has been increased as a result of the assessment of tax or a determination of a credit of tax, made by the Commissioner, being less than the credit of tax claimed by the taxpayer.

This will not apply if the provisional tax has been subject to any adjustment by the taxpayer by way of estimation pursuant to section 387 of the Act.

If the taxpayer has paid the increased amount of provisional tax and he succeeds with his objection, the amount the provisional tax has been increased by, and which would not normally have been payable, will be refunded to the taxpayer and interest will be paid in respect of the amount refunded.

If it happens that the provisional tax has been credited against tax assessed to the taxpayer, pursuant to section 393(1) of the Act, interest will be paid by the Commissioner up to the date the amount of provisional tax is so credited.

_**"Specified rate of interest"**_

This definition defines the specified rate of interest for the purposes of the calculation in subsection (3). The rate of interest is that for a consecutive period of 12 months, commencing on any 1st day of April, determined and notified under subsections (7) and (8) of this section.

For the 12 months period commencing on 1 April 1985 the specified rate of interest has been set at 20 percent. The rate of interest will be re-determined for the 12 months period commencing on 1 April 1986.

_**Subsection (2):**_

This subsection provides for the Commissioner to pay interest on qualifying tax in dispute.

Points to note are:

*   The qualifying tax in dispute was to have been paid to the Commissioner, either in whole or in part, _before_ the making of the decision on the objection, to which the qualifying tax in dispute relates.
*   The Commissioner _shall_ pay interest on so much of the qualifying tax in dispute, that has been paid by the taxpayer, as is required to be refunded to the taxpayer pursuant to section 34(4) of the Act.

This will exclude any amount of deferrable tax which was already been refunded to the taxpayer at the taxpayer's request (being an amount of deferrable tax paid by the taxpayer before the determination by the Commissioner of the amount of the deferrable

*   The proviso to this subsection provides that interest will not be paid by the Commissioner in relation to an objection to an assessment found in the taxpayer's favour if the interest amounts to _less than $5.00_.

_**Subsection (3):**_

This subsection provides the method of calculation of interest, on the amount of tax to be refunded, that is required to be paid to the taxpayer pursuant to subsection (2).

Subsection (3) provides that:

*   Interest payable by the Commissioner shall be payable for any period of 12 months commencing on any 1st day of April, in relation to each instalment portion of the qualifying tax in dispute.
*   If the period for which interest is payable spans any 31 March April date, two calculations will be required, one for the period up to 31 March and one for the period after 31 March.
*   Where the instalment portion is paid in two or more instalments interest will be calculated in relation to each instalment.

*   Interest will be calculated in relation to any amount of qualifying tax in dispute that is applied to, or standing to, the credit of the account of the taxpayer with the Commissioner.

This will allow the Commissioner to calculate and pay interest where the amount to be refunded pursuant to section 34 is, instead of being refunded, credited against the taxpayer's arrears of tax or is credited with his authority against another account.

*   Interest will be calculated in accordance with the following formula:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| (X x Y) | x Z |
| 365 |

where "_X_" is the number of days in the period that _commences_ on whichever of the following days is the _latest_:

1.  The day on which the notice of assessment was given to the taxpayer, ie the date of the notice of assessment.
2.  The day on which the instalment portion was paid to the Commissioner.
3.  The first day of the relevant period of 12 consecutive months commencing on 1 April.
4.  1 April 1985.

and _ends_ on whichever of the days as ascertained under (e) and (f) below is the _earlier:_

1.  The day on which the instalment portion of the qualifying tax in dispute is refunded by the Commissioner or, where the instalment portion relates to an amount of provisional tax, the earlier of:
    1.  that day (as just referred to); or
    2.  the day on which the provisional tax is credited or refunded pursuant to section 393(1) of the Act.
2.  The last day of the relevant period of 12 consecutive months that convinced on 1 April.

Y - is the amount of the instalment portion in relation to the qualifying tax in dispute.

Z - is the specified rate of interest.

_**Examples of the Effect of Subsection (3)**_

_CREDIT ASSESSMENT_

1\. 1985 notice of assessment issued by Commissioner on 2.7.85. Assessment reduces taxpayer's claimed refund, from $1,000 to $500.

2\. Taxpayer objects to assessment. Commissioner accepts objection as "competent".

3\. After considering objection Commissioner concedes it and issues a notice of amended assessment allowing a further credit of $500 to the taxpayer.

4\. Refund of $500 paid to taxpayer on 7 January 1986.

_**Interest Calculation**_

X = Number of days in period commencing 2.7.85 and ending 7.1.86

\= 190 days

Y = $500

Z = 20%

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| (190 x $500) | x 20% | \= $52.05 |
| 365 |

Taxpayer will receive an additional refund of $52.05, being interest payable pursuant to section 34A.

**_Debit assessment with provisional tax payable for next year_**

1\. 1985 Assessment issued by Commissioner on 2.11.85. Assessment increases taxpayer's tax payable for 1985 year of assessment from $1,000 to $2,000. At the same time the 1986 provisional tax is also increased from $1,000 to $2,000.

2\. Taxpayer objects to the assessment, as to $1,000 of the tax assessed. Objection is accepted by the Commissioner as "competent".

3\. By 7 March 1986 taxpayer has paid the tax payable per the assessment, ie $2,000 income tax

Provisional tax aggregating to $2,000.

4\. Objection is decided in the taxpayer's favour, by the High Court, on 4 April 1987.

5\. Notice of amended assessment is issued, and $1,000 refunded to taxpayer on 30 April 1987. The $1,000 overpaid 1986 provisional tax has been credited against the 1986 income tax (which has been assessed in the interim) pursuant to section 393(1) of the Act, on 12 December 1986.

_**Interest Calculation**_ (the interest rate for the purposes of this example, will remain the same for each consecutive period of 12 months commencing on 1 April)

(A) _**Income Tax**_

1.  1st calculation X = Number of days in period commencing 7.3.86 and ending 31.3.8 = 25 days Y = $1,000 Z = 20%
2.  |     |     |     |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | (25 x $1000) | x 20% | \= $13.70 |
    | 365 |
    
3.  2nd calculation X=Number of days in period commencing 1.4.86 and ending 31.3.87 =365 days Y=$1,000 Z=20%
4.  |     |     |     |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | (365 x $1000) | x 20% | \= $200.00 |
    | 365 |
    
5.  3rd calculation X=Number of days in period commencing 1.4.87 and ending 30.4.87 =30 days Z=20%
6.  |     |     |     |

    | (30 x $1,000) | x 20% | \= $16.44 |
    | 365 |
    
    Total interest payable on income tax = $230.14

(B) _**Provisional Tax**_

1.  1st calculation X=Number of days in period commencing 7.3.86 and ending 31.3.86 =25 days Y=$1,000 Z=20%
2.  |     |     |     |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | (25 x $1,000) | x 20% | \= $13.70 |

    | --- | --- | --- |
    | (256 x $1,000) | x 20% | \= $140.27 |
    | 365 |
    
    Total interest payable on provisional tax = $153.97. In this example, total interest of $384.11 will be paid to the taxpayer by the Commissioner. It will be assessable income of the taxpayer for the income year in which the interest is received by the taxpayer.

_**Subsection (4):**_

This subsection provides that for the purposes of the calculation of interest under subsection (3), tax paid in 2 or more instalments is deemed to have been _received by_ the Commissioner in the sequence that is the _converse_ of the sequence in which those amounts were _paid_ to the Commissioner, ie,

where qualifying tax in dispute has been paid by instalments and part only of the qualifying tax in dispute is refunded to the taxpayer, payment to the Commissioner of the tax that is to be refunded will, for the purposes of ascertaining the time of payment of the instalment(s) and/or part instalments that are equal in the aggregate to the amount of that refundable tax, be deemed to have been comprised in the most _recent_ instalments received by the Commissioner.

_**Subsection (5):**_

This subsection provides that where the taxpayer is paid an excess amount of interest the Commissioner shall recover the excess as if that of excess were an amount of income tax payable.

If the taxpayer contends that the Commissioner has underpaid the interest, the Commissioner would be obliged to consider this question as a matter of administration and, if necessary, rectify to ensure Departmental compliance with the obligation in terms of section 34A.

_**Subsection (6):**_

This subsection provides that interest paid under section 34A is to be paid out of the Consolidated Account, without further appropriation than the Income Tax Act 1976.

_**Subsection (7):**_

This subsection provides for the Secretary to the Treasury to determine, prior to 31 March 1985, the interest rate at which interest shall be payable under this section, and to notify the rate in the Gazette.

The rate of interest for the period of 12 consecutive months commencing on 1 April 1985 was notified in the Gazette on 28 March 1985 (The Income Tax (Specified Rate of Interest) Notice 1965). The rate of interest was set at 20%.

_**Subsection (8):**_

This subsection provides that the specified rate of interest may determine from time to time, after 31 March 1985, by the Secretary to the Treasury. (This discretionary power of determination is distinct from the mandatory determination made pursuit to subsection (7)).

Subsection (8) provides also that the rate of interest will apply, for the purposes of this section, to any period or periods of 12 consecutive months commencing on any 1st day of April, and that the specified rate shall be notified in the Gazette.

_**Application**_

Section 8 of this No 2 Amendment Act applies with respect to any objection made to an assessment the notice of which was given on or after the 1st day of April 1985.

### Section 40: Additional Tax To Be Charged if Default Made in Payment of Tax

The comment in this Part of this Appendix, relating to section 40, is limited to subsections (1), (3), and (4) which relate to additional tax payable in respect of _deferrable tax_.

Comment on the other provisions of section 40 is contained in Part 1 of this Appendix - Additional tax/penalty for late payment of tax.

### 1\. INTRODUCTION

Section 34, as amended, of the principal Act provides for taxpayers who have lodged an objection to an assessment, that objection being a competent objection, to defer payment of one-half of the amount of tax in dispute.

Where the objection is found in the taxpayer's favour and the excess tax is refunded, the new section 34A of the Income Tax Act provides that interest is to be paid on the amount refunded.

Where the objection is not found in the taxpayer's favour, any amount of the deferrable tax that was not paid before the expiry of one month after the due date applicable to that tax will have incurred additional tax on the new 10 percent plus incremental basis.

As part of the new system for the collection and payment of tax in dispute, any additional tax incurred on deferrable tax calculated on the new 10 percent plus incremental basis during the period of deferral will be remitted and the additional tax will be recalculated at an interest rate on a daily basis.

The amendments to section 398 of the Act that are commented on in this Part of this Appendix are limited to this new, substitute, "interest-based" additional tax that applies to deferrable tax.

### 2\. APPLICATION

It has already been mentioned in paragraph (2) of this Part of this Appendix that the application date for section 40 of the No 2 Amendment Act (section 398 of the principal Act) differs from the application date for sections 7 and 8 of this Amendment Act (sections 34 and 34A of the principal Act), and in so doing giving 3 different systems for the treatment of tax in dispute.

The comments on this section are presented in a manner which shows separately the effects of the provisions for;

1.  Objections lodged for assessments, made on or after 1 April 1985, which relate to the 1985 or prior income years.
2.  Objections lodged for assessments made on or after 1 April 1985 which relate to the 1986 or subsequent income years.

**Application of section 398 in respect of competent objections lodged against assessments, the notices of which are given on or after 1 April 1985, relating to 1985 or prior income years**

The additional tax provisions of section 398 as they apply to the 1985 and prior income years, will apply to tax in dispute in respect of objections lodged for assessments, made on or after 1 April 1985, relating to 1985 or prior income years; ie the additional tax is a 10 percent flat and final rate of additional tax.

**Example 1**

_**Debit Assessment - Taxpayer loses objection**_

1.  1985 income year. Notice of assessment issued 23 November 1985. Tax payable per assessment, due date 7 February 1986, last day for payment 7 March 1986, amounts to $20,000.
2.  Taxpayer lodges an objection on 22 December 1985, which is accepted as a competent objection.
3.  Commissioner disallows objection on 1 February 1986 and advises taxpayer that the amount of deferrable tax is $2,500.
4.  Tax payable by due date is $17,500.
5.  Tax payable paid late. Additional tax incurred on 8 March 1986 amounting to $1,750.
6.  Objection determined by a Taxation Review Authority, in the Commissioner's favour, on 12 December 1986. Taxpayer does not appeal. The day of determination of final liability is thus, 12 December 1986.
7.  Deferrable tax of $2,500 thus becomes payable from the last day for payment, being 7 March 1986. Additional tax of 10 percent, amounting to $250, added to deferrable tax as not paid by 7 March 1986.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Tax payable | $20,000 |
| Additional tax incurred | $2,000 |
| Total tax payable | $22,000 |

If in the above example the taxpayer had succeeded with his objection in full, so that the tax payable was reduced from $20,000 to $15,000:

1.  The Commissioner would refund the amount of tax in dispute paid, ie, $2,500, with interest calculated in accordance with section 34A of the Act.
2.  Additional tax incurred on the late payment of the tax payable would be recalculated and reduced to $1,500.

**Example 2**

_**Debit Assessment - Taxpayer obtains refund of deferrable tax and subsequently fails in his objection**_

1.  1985 Income year. Notice of assessment issued 23 November 1985. Tax payable per assessment, due date 7 February 1986, last day for payment 7 March 1986, amounts to $20,000.
2.  Taxpayer lodges an objection on 22 December 1985, which is accepted as a competent objection.
3.  Tax due and payable 7 February 1986 = $20,000
4.  Taxpayer pays by 7.3.86 the full amount of tax payable, $20,000.
5.  Commissioner formally disallows objection 27 March 1986 and, after calculating that the tax in dispute amounts to $5,000, advises taxpayer that the amount of deferrable tax is $2,500.
6.  Taxpayer requests that the amount of deferrable tax be refunded. $2,500 refunded to taxpayer on 5 April 1986.
7.  Objection determined by the High Court, in the Commissioner's favour on 12 December 1986. Taxpayer does not appeal. The day of determination of final liability is 12 December 1986.
8.  Deferrable tax of $2,500 becomes payable therefore on 12 December 1986. Note, that deferrable tax was paid by the last day for payment, 7 March 1986, irrespective of the fact the the deferrable tax was refunded on 5 April 1986.
9.  Deferrable tax not paid by 12 January 1987. 10 percent flat and final additional tax incurred on 13 January 1987, amounting to $250.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Tax payable | $20,000 |
| Additional tax incurred | $250 |
| Total tax payable | $20,250 |

**Application of section 398 in respect of competent objections lodged against assessments the notices of which are given on or after 1 April 1985, relating to 1986 and subsequent income years**

The provisions of section 398, as amended by section 40 of this Amendment Act, will apply in respect of tax payable for assessments the notices of which are given after 31 March 1985, and in respect of which competent objections have been lodged, relating to the 1986 and subsequent income years.

The essential difference in the area of additional tax for late payment, between assessments for 1985 and earlier income years, and assessments for 1986 and subsequent years is that in the case of the latter assessments -

*   the additional tax for late payment will, in the normal course, be 10% flat additional tax plus an incremental compounding 10% additional tax for each 6 months on the balance outstanding.
*   any additional tax that has been incurred in respect of tax that the Commissioner has notified is deferrable tax, is _replaced_ from the commencement of the period of deferral, by an "interest-based" additional tax calculated on a daily basis.

### IMPLEMENTATION

The following is an explanation of the implementation of section 40 of the No 2 Amendment Act, subsections (1), (3), (4).

_Subsection (1): Definitions_

_**"Competent objection"**_

has the same meaning as that given to it in section 34 of the Act.

_**"Day of determination of. final liability"**_

has the same meaning as that given to it in section 34 of the Act.

_**"Deferrable tax"**_

has the same meaning as that given to it in section 34 of the Act.

_**"Period of deferral"**_

This definition specifies the period the Commissioner shall calculate the interest based additional tax in respect of an amount of deferrable tax, determined by the Commissioner in accordance with section 34 of the Act. The period of deferral also determines the period the deferrable tax can be suspended from payment by the taxpayer and action to recover by the Commissioner.

It should be noted that this period of "suspension" does not have the effect of preventing the incurring of additional tax for late payment (where the taxpayer avails himself of this facility to defer payment), although the "penalty" for late-paid deferrable tax will, in relation to the period of deferral, be calculated at a rate of interest, on a daily basis.

The period of deferral in relation to an amount of deferrable tax is defined as being the period which commences on the _later_ of -

1.  The day on which the notice of the assessment in respect of which the taxpayer has made a competent objection is given to the taxpayer, (ie, the date of the notice of assessment); or
2.  The day on which there expires the period of 1 month immediately following the due date for payment of that defer rable tax.
3.  and _ends_ at the expiry of the day that is the day of determination of final liability, (defined in section 34 of the Act) which briefly, is the day on which the objection is ultimately decided one way or the other.

**Example One**

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.  | 1986 income year. Notice of assessment given to taxpayer (due date 7 February 1987; last day for payment 7 March 1987) | 22.11.86 |
| 2.  | Taxpayer lodges competent objection | 21.12.86 |
| 3.  | Commissioner formally disallows objection Advises taxpayer of the amount of deferrable tax. | 1.2.87 |
| 4.  | Objection resolved in Commissioner's favour. Taxpayer does not appeal, the day of determination of final liability is thus 6 December 1987. | 6.22.87. |

Period of deferral = 7.3.87 to and including 6.12.87, ie, the period of deferral commences on the day on which there expires the period of 1 month immediately following the due date for payment and ends at the expiry of the day of determination of final liability.

**Example Two**

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.  | 1986 Income year. Notice of assessment given to taxpayer (due date 7 February 1987; last day for payment 7 March 1987; 10 percent additional tax incurred 8 March 1987.) | 4.4.87 |
| 2.  | Taxpayer lodges competent objection | 28.4.87 |
| 3.  | Commissioner formally disallows objection. Advises taxpayer of the amount of deferrable tax | 16.6.87 |
| 4.  | Objection resolved in the Commissioner's favour. Taxpayer does not appeal, the day of determination of final liability is thus 6 December 1987. | 6.12.87 |

Period of deferral = 4.4.87 to and including 6.12.87, ie, the period of deferral commences on the day on which the notice of assessment is given to the taxpayer and ends at the expiry of the day of determination of final liability.

In this example the additional tax incurred for late payment on 8 March 1987 is not disturbed and remains payable as such. Any additional tax incurred during the period of deferral, will be calculated at the daily interest rate, refer subsection (4) of this section.

The proviso to this definition provides that where the amount of deferrable tax has been paid in time by the taxpayer prior to the determination of the amount of deferrable tax by the Commissioner, and is subsequently refunded to the taxpayer before the day of determination of final liability, the due date for payment of that deferrable tax that has been refunded shall, _for the purposes of this definition_, be the day that immediately precedes by 1 month the date of the making of the refund.

The effect of this proviso is that the date of the refund is deemed to be "the day on which there expires the period of 1 month immediately following the due date for payment of that deferrable tax".

**Example of the effect of the proviso**

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.  | 1986 income year. Notice of assessment given to taxpayer (due date 7 February 1987; last day for payment 7 March 1987). | 22.11.86 |
| 2.  | Taxpayer lodges competent objection | 21.12.86 |
| 3.  | Taxpayer pays the amount of the tax payable shown in the notice of assessment. | 6.3.87 |
| 4.  | Commissioner formally disallows objection. Advises taxpayer of the amount of deferrable tax | 27.3.87 |
| 5.  | Taxpayer requests a refund of the amount of deferrable tax. Deferrable tax refunded to him | 20.4.87 |
| 6.  | Objection resolved in the Commissioner's favour. Taxpayer does not appeal, the day of determination of final liability is thus 6 December 1987. | 6.12.87 |

Period of deferral = 20.4.87 to 6.12.87,

ie the period of deferral commences on the date of the making of the refund and ends on the day of determination of final liability.

_**"Specified rate of additional tax"**_

This definition specifies effectively what rate of interest is to be applied in calculating the amount of additional tax payable in respect of deferrable tax, in accordance with the provisions of subsection (4) of this section.

The percent per annum for the purposes of this definition is the same as that applicable when the Commissioner pays interest to a taxpayer pursuant to section 34A of the Act on the amount of a refund of qualifying tax in dispute.

The rate of interest will apply in relation to any period of 12 consecutive months commencing on any 1st day of April, and has been set at 20 percent for the 12 months period commencing 1 April 1985. Refer to the Income Tax (Specified Rate of Interest) Notice 1985, notified in the Gazette dated 28 March 1985.

_**Subsection (2):**_

Refer to Part 1 of this Appendix - subsection 2 provides for the new system of additional tax for late payment, based on 10 percent flat plus 10 percent incremental.

_**Subsection (3):**_

This subsection requires the Commissioner to remit the additional tax, added under subsection (2) of this section, incurred on an amount of deferrable tax, where the additional tax so incurred was incurred _on or after the day on which the period of deferral commenced_.

The subsection provides also that subsection (2) - the new 10 percent flat plus 10 percent incremental additional tax - shall cease to apply to the amount of late-paid deferrable tax on the day the period of deferral, in relation to that deferrable tax, commences.

The effect of this subsection is to prevent additional tax being incurred in respect of deferrable tax under both subsections (2) and (4) of this section during the period of deferral, that is, only subsection (4) will apply in relation to the "period of deferral" additional tax.

_**Subsection (4):**_

This is the operative subsection. It provides for the calculation of the additional tax payable in respect of deferrable tax.

The subsection firstly deems the additional tax _added_ to an amount of deferrable tax, to _be_ deferrable tax, and to be payable accordingly. The additional tax incurred becomes automatically deferrable tax and is recovered accordingly as deferrable tax.

**Paragraph (a) of Subsection 4:**

This paragraph provides for the situation where a taxpayer pays an amount of the deferrable tax to the Commissioner _during the period of deferral_, the amount being referred to as the "specified payment" for the purposes of this subsection.

The additional tax will be calculated in such cases from the commencement of the period of deferral up to the date of payment in that period of deferral.

Formula to be used when calculating the additional tax is:

|     |
| --- |
| (X x Y x Z) |
| 365 |

X is the number of days in the period which commences on whichever of the following days is the _latest_:

1.  The day on which the period of deferral commenced.
2.  The first day of the period of 12 consecutive months, commencing 1 April, during which the deferrable tax has remaine unpaid:
3.  The 1st day of April 1985; and _ends_ on whichever of the following days is the _earlier_:
4.  The day on which the "specified payment" is received by the Commissioner:
5.  The last day of the period of 12 consecutive months, commencing 1 April, during which the deferrable tax has remained unpaid.

Y is the amount of the specified payment.

Z is the specified rate of additional tax.

The additional tax will be calculated in relation to each period of 12 consecutive months, commencing 1 April, during which the deferrable tax has remained unpaid, ie if the period of deferral spans 31 March/1 April, two calculations will be required:

*   1st calculation from the commencement of the period of deferral to 31 March.
*   2nd calculation from 1 April to, in this instance, the date of payment of the deferrable tax in the period of deferral.

It could be, of course, that between these "1st" and "2nd" calculations, one or more further calculations would be required, each in respect of a full 12 months period (within the period of deferral) during which the deferrable tax has remained unpaid. This could well be the case where, for example, the objection is resolved ultimately by the Privy Council.

**Example of the effect of paragraph (a)**

Last day for payment of tax assessed: 4 April 1986.

1.  Deferrable tax = $1,000
2.  Taxpayer pays $400 of the deferrable tax, on 20 September 1986 received by Commissioner 21 September 1986.
3.  Objection resolved 6 December 1986 - taxpayer does not appeal, period of deferral thus ends 6 December 1986.
4.  Period of deferral = 4 April 1986 to 6 December 1986

Additional tax calculations are required to be made:

1.  "Interest-based" additional tax on $400 deferrable tax _paid during_ the period of deferral (a "specified payment").
2.  |     |     |
    | --- | --- |
    | (171 x $400 x 20%) | \= $37.48 |
    | 365 |
    

*   X=Number of days in period commencing 4.4.86 and ending on 21.9.86= 171 days
*   Y= $400
*   Z= 20%

The above calculation will be made upon receipt of the payment of $400. This amount of additional tax, being itself an amount of deferrable tax and payable accordingly, need not be paid until expiry of the period of deferral. If, in the above case, more than one specified payment had been paid to the Commissioner, in instalments, a separate calculation would be required in respect of each instalment.

2.  "Interest-based" additional tax on $600 deferrable tax _not paid during_ the period of deferral.
3.  |     |     |
    | --- | --- |
    | (247 x $600 x 20%) | \= $81.20 |
    | 365 |
    

*   X = Number of days in period commencing 4.4.86 and ending on 6.12.86 =247 days
*   Y = $600
*   Z = 20%

This latter calculation will be made on expiry of the period of deferral, in accordance with subsection 4(b) explained hereunder. The total interest-based additional tax incurred on deferrable tax, during the period of deferral, amounts therefore to $118.68 ($37.48 + $81.20). If this interest-based additional tax is not paid within one month following the day of expiry of the deferral period, it (together with any of the deferrable tax that is likewise not paid) will then become subject to also the 10 percent flat plus 10 percent incremental basis of penalty, as explained later.

**Paragraph (b) of subsection (4)**

This paragraph provides the formula to calculate the "interest-based" additional tax on any amount of deferrable tax the payment of which is not received by the Commissioner during the period of deferral. The additional tax will be calculated using the following formula: X x Y x Z 365 X is the number of days in the period that commences on whichever of the following days is the _latest_:

1.  The day on which the period of deferral commenced:
2.  The first day of the period of 12 consecutive months, commencing 1 April, in relation to which the interest-based additional tax is to be calculated:
3.  The 1st day of April 1985; and ends on whichever of the following days is the _earlier_:
4.  The day of expiry of the period of deferral:
5.  The last day of the period of 12 consecutive months commencing 1 April, in relation to which the interest-based additional tax is to be calculated.

Y - is the amount of deferrable tax remaining unpaid at expiry of the period of deferral.

Z - the specified rate of additional tax.

**Further example of the effect of paragraph (b)** (See also example at paragraph (b) above)

1.  Deferrable tax = $1,000 (No payment made during period of deferral.)
2.  Period of deferral = 4.4.86 to 6.12.86 (Objection resolved 6 December 1986, wholly in Commissioner's favour.) "Interest-based" additional tax calculation made on expiry of the period of deferral, 6 December 1986:

*   |     |     |
    | --- | --- |
    | (247 x $1,000 x 20%) | \= $135.34 "interest-based" additional tax |
    | 365 |
    
*   X = Number of days in period commencing 4.4.86 and ending on 6.12.86 =247 days.
*   Y = $l, 000
*   Z = 20%

As explained above this "interest-based" additional tax of $135.34 will, if it remains unpaid for more than one month after the day of expiry of the period of deferral, attract additional tax on the 10 percent flat plus 10 percent incremental basis, as provided in paragraphs (c) to (e) of this subsection.

**Paragraph (c) of subsection (4)**

This paragraph provides that additional tax of 10 percent will be added to any deferrable tax, and the amount of additional tax added thereto under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection, that remains unpaid _one month_ immediately following the day on which the period of deferral expires.

**Paragraph (d) of subsection (4)**

Provides that further additional tax of 10 percent will be added to so much of the deferrable tax, and the amount of additional tax added thereto under paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this subsection, as remains unpaid _6 months_ immediately following the "penalty day" specified in paragraph (c).

**Paragraph (e) of subsection (4)**

Provides that further additional tax of 10 percent will be added to so much of the deferrable tax, and the amount of additional tax added thereto under paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) and additional tax added under this paragraph, as remains unpaid on the expiry of any of the periods of 6 months that, consecutively succeed the 6 months period referred to in paragraph (d).

**Example of the effect of paragraphs (c) to (e) of subsection (4) of section 398**

|     |     | Credit | Debit | Balance of Account |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|     |     | $   | $   | $   |
| Facts |     |     |     |     |
|     | Deferrable tax $1,000 |     |     |     |
|     | Period of deferral expired 6.12.86 |     |     |     |
|     | Deferrable tax required to be paid within 1 month after 6.12.86 |     |     | 1,000.00 |
|     | Additional tax calculated in respect of the period of deferral required to be paid within 1 month after 6.12.86 |     | 138.08 | 1,138.08 |
| Effect of paragraphs (c) to (e) |     |     |     |     |
| 1.  | 10 percent additional tax added if unpaid before 7.1.87 (pursuant to paragraph (c) of subsection (4)) |     | 113.80 | 1,251.88 |
| 2.  | 10 percent additional tax added if unpaid before 7.7.87 (pursuant to paragraph (d) of subsection (4)) |     | 125.18 | 1,377.06 |
| 3.  | 10 percent additional tax added if unpaid before 7.1.88 (pursuant to paragraph (e) of subsection (4)) |     | 137.70 | 1,514.76 |

(and so on, at the expiry of each subsequent period of 6 months)

When a payment is made against tax in arrears the incremental additional tax is calculated on the balance of the arrears that remains unpaid at the date the incremental additional tax accrues pursuant to this subsection.

### Application

Section 40 of the No 2 Amendment Act applies with respect to the tax on income derived in the income year commencing on the 1st day of April 1985 and in every subsequent year. For further details, refer to paragraph (2) of this Part of this Appendix.

Income Tax Amendment Act (No 2) 1982, Supplement 1
==================================================

Archived legislative commentary on Income Tax Amendment Act (No 2) 1982, Supplement 1 from PIB vol 120, suppl 1 Aug 1983.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 120,Supplement 1, August 1983

[More information about _Public Information Bulletins_.](/about/about-our-publications)

Section 4 - Bonus Issues and Capital Profits (Section 4 of Principal Act)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Question 1 Bonus Issues

Does section 4(1)(ca) cover the situation where a bonus issue and a return of capital are both made within the same income year?

### Answer

Section 4 of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 2) 1982 expresses the 10 year period as l0 income years, whereas it should have been expressed as 10 **calendar** years ending on the day the return of capital was made.

Theoretically, therefore, it would be possible for a company make, within the same income year, both a bonus issue and a return of capital applicable to that bonus issue without either the bonus issue or the subsequent return of capital attracting any tax.

However, since the legislation was passed, the Government has announced that legislation will be introduced this year to:

1.  Amend the legislation to remedy the defect in the period of 10 years as it is expressed at present.
2.  Apply the amendment in respect of any bonus issue made on or after 1 April 1982.

### Question

Does a return of capital include a commercial advance made to a shareholder within 10 years after a bonus issue and if so,where the shareholder subsequently repays that advance, is the liability to the tax incurred on the amount of the advance(which was deemed to be a dividend) able to be reversed?

### Answer

Any loan or advance made after a bonus issue, on terms which are not commercially supportable, eg, interest free is, in the absence of any revenue or capital reserves at the time of making the loan or advance, effectively a subsequent return of capital to the shareholder and falls to be treated as a dividend under the new paragraph (ca) of section 4(1) of the Income Tax Act.

This is because any such loan made to a shareholder must first be treated as a distribution of profits, ie, of revenue and capital reserves, and taxed as a dividend. When these reserves have been extinguished, any portion of the loan which has not been treated as a distribution of profits is a return of capital to which section 4(1)(ca) applies.

In a case where the advance (or any portion of the advance) is not a bona fide investment and is in fact a return of capital any subsequent action to repay the advance does not change the nature of the original transaction.

### Question 3 Capital Profits

Where a company disposes of an asset at a profit to a related company will that profit be available for distribution as a capital profit when the new owner sells the asset to an unrelated party outside the group?

### Answer

The profit arising from the intra-group transaction does not become available for a section 4(5) "tax free" distribution when the asset is eventually sold outside the group.

### Question 4

What will be the requirements for the identification of capital reserves existing at l April 1982, in the light of the new section 4(5A)?

### Answer

Where a specified company had, at 1 April 1982, capital reserves which comprised a combination of capital gains arising from transactions with unrelated as well as related persons, then the specified company will need to identify the respective components of the capital reserves when making a capital distribution to shareholders.

Only distributions from that part of a capital reserve which arises from transactions with unrelated persons will qualify for the purposes of a tax free distribution under section 4(5). The source of the distribution should be clearly identified in the annual accounts and in the statements which accompany the annual tax return.

### Question 5

Company B created a capital reserve from the sale, before 1 April 1982, of real property to a related Company C. Company B distributed a dividend from the capital reserve to parent Company A, **prior to** 1 April 1982. Company A distributes the dividend to its shareholders **after** 1 April 1982. What is the tax status of the distribution by parent Company A to its shareholder?

### Answer

Having regard to the decision in _Smout v CIR_ (1982) NZLR 154, it is accepted that the new section 4(5A) would not apply to a distribution received by a company prior to l April 1982 even though that distribution so received was not passed on the individual shareholders of the **recipient** company until **after** that date. The Department would, however, apply the rules set out in PIB 117 in relation to the application of the tax avoidance provisions of section 99 to the kind of situation set out in this question.

Section 14 - Standard Value of Livestock (Section 86(2A) of the Principal Act)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Question 1

Does the section apply to a taxpayer who purchased a farm in the 1981 income year if he purchases additional livestock in the 1983 income year to further stock that farm?

### Answer

No. The section applies only to a taxpayer who commences or recommences to derive income from livestock or who, being a taxpayer who derives income from livestock, acquires additional land, brings land into production, or substantially increased production,on or after the 1st day of his income year commencing l April 1982. It does not apply to other farmers who simply purchase additional livestock.

### Question 2

Does the section apply to an investor who purchases livestock during the 1982/1983 income year if that person had never previously derived income from livestock?

### Answer

The section does apply as the taxpayer commenced to derive income from livestock during the income year.

### Question 3

Does the section apply to an investor who has derived some income from livestock in previous years and who purchases a significant number of additional livestock during the 1982/1983 income year?

### Answer

The section will not apply in these circumstances. The taxpayer commenced deriving income from livestock prior to the commencement of the 1982/1983 income year, and he has not acquired additional land, or brought further land into production or substantially increased production during that year.

### Question 4

Is a taxpayer who sells his farm and is unable to purchase a suitable replacement farm for, say, 8 to 12 months, regarded as having recommenced to derive income from livestock when he purchases the new farm?

### Answer

No. The expression "recommences to derive income from livestock" contemplates a situation where a taxpayer, having derived income from livestock, evidences, such as by taking up some other occupation, that he has ceased to derive income from livestock and later decides to return to farming.

It would also not affect the taxpayer who decides to have a holiday between the sale of one farm and the purchase of the replacement.

### Question 5

How should section 86(2A) be interpreted?

### Answer

The amendment to section 86 introducing subsection (2A) is based on the Budget announcement that to remove one of the obvious avenues for tax avoidance, new farmers and those acquiring additional land would be required to **progressively** write stock purchases down to a standard value.

When interpreting the section regard must be had to this principle. In this context the criterion that "additional farming livestock" must have been purchased requires further clarification.

"Additional farming livestock" is the livestock purchased to stock the additional land or the land that is brought into substantially increased production. Additional farming livestock purchased to stock existing farm land, or land which has **not** been brought into production or substantially increased production since the commencement of the 1982/83 income year, is **not** covered by subsection (2A).

### Question 6

How is the phrase "... brings (any land) into ... substantially increased production ..." to be interpreted?

### Answer

In bringing land into "substantially increased production" a farmer is likely to be involved in significant expenditure of a capital nature incurred in breaking-in and developing that land. The claiming of significant development expenditure on existing land coupled with purchases of livestock resulting in higher numbers of livestock on hand at the end of the year will prima facie indicate that land has been brought into production or substantially increased production. In this context, "substantially" connotes an increase that is sizeable, material, not minor, in relation to former production.

### Question 7

What is the meaning of the phrase "... farming livestock (not being replacement livestock) .."?

### Answer

Two classes of taxpayer are covered under the progressive write-down provisions:

*   Those covered under paragraph (a) of subsection (2A), ie, taxpayers who **commence or recommence** to **derive income** from livestock (other than dealing) and
*   Those covered under paragraph (b) of subsection (2A), ie, taxpayers who **already** derive income from livestock and either **bring into production**, etc, any land or **acquire additional** land for the purpose of deriving income from livestock.

Where a taxpayer is covered under paragraph (a), the livestock that are subject to the progressive write-down provisions are:

*   **All** livestock purchased in the income year of commencement or recommencement (there being, in that year, no "replacement stock"), and
*   Livestock purchased in any of the 3 income years following the income year of commencement or recommencement that has **not** been purchased to simply **replace** livestock owned at the end of the previous year.

Where a taxpayer is covered under paragraph (b) and has brought into production or substantially increased production any land, the livestock that are subject to the progressive write-down provisions are:

*   All livestock purchased in the income year in which the land was brought into production, etc, for use in stocking that land, and
*   Livestock purchased in any of the three following income years for use in stocking that land but **not** including purchases to **replace** livestock owned at the end of the previous year.

Similarly, where a taxpayer is covered by paragraph (b), and has acquired additional land, stock that are purchased for use on that land in the income year of acquisition and the 3 following income years (**not** including stock purchased to **replace** livestock owned at the end of the previous year) are subject to the progressive write-down provisions.

### Question 8

Prior to the introduction of the progressive write-down provisions, farming taxpayers were able, by choice, to defer the write-down of stock to standard values to such extent as would preserve entitlement to tax rebates, etc. Are similar arrangements permissible in terms of the new provisions bearing in mind that the livestock must be written down to the standard value by the end of the second year following the year of purchase?

### Answer

If a taxpayer wishes to **defer** the writing down of livestock to standard values, by a greater degree than that provided by the progressive write-downs, he has the following options:

1.  He may fix a standard value (say, in the year of purchase) and choose not to write the livestock down to that standard value until the third income year of ownership of that stock (as required by subsection (2A)).
2.  He may fix a standard value higher than that which he would eventually wish to adopt, write-down to that value by the end of the third year of ownership, and in a later year seek the Commissioner's agreement to a lower, more appropriate, standard value which can then be adopted as soon as the taxpayer desires (after the end of the 3rd year).
3.  He may choose not to seek the fixing of a standard value until sometime after the third year of ownership of the livestock, the taxpayer then being able to write the livestock down to the standard value adopted, immediately.

Section 23 - Sale of Property Within 10 Years (Section 129 of the Principal Act)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Question 1

Does a farming company which sells a farm within 10 years of purchase (thereby invoking the interest and farm development expenditure recovery provisions in section 129) qualify for the relief measure available to farmers under section 129(5) if it purchases a replacement farm within 12 months?

### Answer

Yes. There is nothing to stop any **taxpayer**, be it a company, trust or individual, from qualifying for the "first sale" relief available under subsection (5) of section 129 in respect of the first sale after 31 March 1983 of a farm or farm land, by that taxpayer, that is caught by the 10 year rule. The taxpayer must, of course, still satisfy the requirements of subsection (5). These include the requirement that the replacement farm land acquired by the taxpayer be an "economic farm property". In this connection the capability of the property to return a livelihood (if it were farmed by an individual) is still relevant in relation to the replacement **farm land itself**.

**NB.** For the subsection (5) relief to apply the replacement farm must be purchased and farmed by the **same** taxpayer (or the same taxpayer together with someone else). Accordingly, if an individual farmer sells a farm and the replacement property is purchased by a company, of which he may be the major shareholder, the relief cannot apply.

### Question

Where the Department has applied the "dual purpose" test to a rental venture and limited the deduction for expenditure incurred to the amount of the rental income received, how does the Commissioner calculate the interest to be recovered in the event of the property being sold within the 10 year period?

### Answer

In such situations the amount of interest deemed to have been allowed, and which would be subject to recovery, will be calculated on a pro rata basis.

_**Example**_

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gross Rents |     | $4,000 |
| Rates, Insurance, etc. | $900 |     |
| Repairs and Maintenance | 800 |     |
| Interest | 2,000 |     |
| Depreciation | 1,300 | 5,000 |
| Loss |     | $1,000 |
| Therefore expenditure disallowed = $1,000. |     |     |

For section 129 purposes the interest allowed in respect of the above year is:

|     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2000 | X   | 4000 | \=  | $1,600 |
| 5000 |

In the event of an actual apportionment being made, by the taxpayer, of rented property expenditure between income **producing** purposes (deductible) and non-income producing purposes (non-deductible), recovery of interest under the 10 year rule will be based on the amount of the interest actually allowed as a deduction in calculating assessable income.

### Question 3

Is mortgage interest that has been allowed as a deduction in connection with a home study claim by a salary and wage earner subject to the new interest recovery measures if the home is sold within 10 years of purchase?

### Answer

Yes. The new interest recovery measures apply to any sale of land (or land and buildings) made within 10 years of purchase where a deduction for interest (as defined) has been allowed in calculating the assessable income of the taxpayer in respect of money borrowed to purchase that land.

The claim for home study expenses under paragraph 7 of the Fourth Schedule to the Income Tax Act 1976 by salary and wage earners is in respect of expenditure incurred in gaining or producing assessable income from employment (section 105(2)(b)(i)), and mortgage interest claimed as a deduction therefore comes within the scope of section 129(2)(b) and (f).

### Question 4

Where money has been borrowed by a taxpayer for more than one purpose or a property has been purchased from a "pool of funds" how is the amount of the recoverable interest deductions determined?

### Answer

The interest recovery provisions can be applied only to the extent that it can be established that a "deduction for interest", as defined in section 129, has been allowed in relation to the property sold.

Where the property has been purchased from a "pool of funds" and interest has been claimed in respect of some or all of the pool of funds, the Department will expect the taxpayer to make a reasonable apportionment or allocation of that interest relating to the property purchase.

It is not possible to lay down any hard and fast rules as to the basis of apportionment which will be accepted by the Department as the proportion of the interest deductions recoverable in such situations can only be arrived at on a case by case basis.

### Question 5

1.  When a new partner is admitted to a partnership which owns land and he becomes entitled to a share in the assets, or the proceeds of any sale of the assets, of the partnership, does this constitute a "sale or other disposition" of land to which section 129 applies? If so, what proportion of the land has been disposed of and what interest and farm development expenditure is subject to recovery?
2.  What is the position where an existing partner leaves the partnership and his share is taken up by the remaining partners?

### Answer

1.  The introduction of a new partner generally involves a sale or other disposition of "land" by the existing partners whose respective shares or interests in the partnership are reduced by the admission of the new partner. The word "land" is defined in section 129 as including "any estate or interest in land whether legal or equitable, corporeal or incorporeal, freehold or chattel" and the admission of a new partner involves the disposition of such an interest in land. The proportion of the land disposed of by each of the existing partners equates to the reduction of the individual partner's fractional or percentage share in the partnership.

**Example** A partnership with three partners owning equal shares introduces a new partner and thereafter each of the four partners has an equal share in the new partnership. The shares in the partnership of each of the three original partners have been reduced from one-third to one-quarter. Each of these partners has therefore disposed of a one-twelfth interest in the partnership land. The interest and farm development expenditure deductions subject to recovery in the hands of each partner will also be calculated on the basis of one-twelfth of the total of those deductions allowed.

It will, of course, also be necessary to apportion the original purchase price of the land paid by the three partners to arrive at the excess. Similarly, the price paid by the incoming partner will have to be apportioned between the land and any other partnership assets.

### Answer

2.  In this situation the partner leaving the partnership is selling or disposing of his interest in the partnership land to the remaining partners. Similarly, as in the case of answer (a) above, the land disposed of and the deductions subject to recovery are in proportion to the share of that partner in the partnership.

### Question 6

Subsection (5)(c) - Does the Commissioner have any discretion to extend the 12 month period during which the replacement "economic farm property" must be purchased?

### Answer

No. Where a replacement economic farm property is being acquired **following** the sale of the farm which is subject section 129, that replacement property must be acquired within the 12 months following the date of the sale of that previous farm, for the subsection (5) relief to apply.

Section 32 - Loss Incurred in Specified Activities (Sections 188A and 188B of Principal Act)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A) Section 188A - Loss Incurred in Specified Activity
-----------------------------------------------------

### Question 1

Subsection (7) of the new section 188A enables the taxpayer to make an election in respect of the losses to be offset from two or more specified activities. It provides that where in an income year a taxpayer conducts two or more specified activities and incurs losses in respect of each of those activities the maximum amount of the loss that may be offset against other income derived in that year is $10,000 (s 188A(7)(f)). In such cases, paragraph (g) of subsection (7) allows the taxpayer to make an (irrevocable) election determining the amount of the loss from **each** specified activity that will be comprised in the $10,000 loss offset in that income year.

What is the position if the taxpayer chooses not to make the above election?

### Answer

In this event the provisions of section 19, which empower the Commissioner to determine whether, and to what the loss from each activity is to be carried forward in accordance with the ground rules set out in s 188A(7), will apply. Therefore, in circumstances where a taxpayer incurs losses (say $15,000) in each of two specified activities, he may

1.  Take advantage of the election provision in s 188A(7)(g) and determine, with certainty, the amount of loss from each activity that will be offset against other income in the year incurred (eg that $7,000 from activity A and $3,000 from activity B be offset). The amount of loss available to be carried forward from each activity will then be determined by the amounts not so offset in accordance with paragraph (h); or
2.  Not make the election provided for in s 188A(7)(g) but claim instead that a surplus loss in respect of **each** activity be carried forward to the next income year (eg, that $8,000 be carried forward in respect of activity A, and $12,000 in respect of activity B).
3.  Not make the election provided for in s 188A(7)(g) but merely claim that the combined surplus of losses over $10,000 from the specified activities be carried forward to the next income year (eg, that a loss of $20,000 be carried forward). In such a case, the Commissioner is bound to make a determination as to how much of that total loss available to be carried forward relates to each specified activity.

### Question

How does section 188A apply in the situation where a company, being a member of a specified group, incurs a loss from a specified activity to which section 188A applies, and seeks to pass that loss to another company in the group under section 191(5)?

### Answer

Section 191(5) was amended by last year's No 2 Amendment Act and is now **subject** to section 188A. The effect is that where a company incurs losses from specified activities to which section 188A applies, the total amount of losses from those specified activities which the loss company can nominate for offset against the income of group companies in any income year cannot exceed the $10,000 limitation.

(**Note:** Losses from activities which do not come within the provisions of s 188A can be nominated for offset in the normal way.)

### Question 3

Does section 188A prohibit the payment of a subvention payment to a company whose loss was incurred in a specified activity?

### Answer

Section 188A does not prohibit the payment of subvention payments. However, in the hands of the loss company the subvention payment is not income from a specified activity; it is simply deemed by section 191(7) to be assessable income derived by the payee company. As a consequence, losses from specified activities to which section 188A applies can be offset, against both the subvention payment **and** any income from other sources, to the extent of only the $10,000 limitation.

### Question 4

What is the effect of excluding from the definition of specified activities the business of growing trees or plants (other than flowers) in respect of which the preparation of the land, and the planting and cultivation of the tree or plant, and the harvesting of the crop is accomplished within a period of 12 months?

### Answer

The exclusion will cover all annual crops such as maize, wheat, tomatoes, peas, onions, potatoes, tobacco and the majority of market garden crops. However, it will not include crops where the plant gives more than one annual crop (eg raspberries).

The rationale behind this exclusion was that where a taxpayer engaged in a specified activity which produces a profit decides to plant a crop of potatoes or some similar annual crop and the crop fails, the loss suffered will be able to be offset without limitation against the income from the specified activity. A further consideration was that in the case of cash cropping, the expenditure outlay produces revenue within a comparatively short time.

A taxpayer engaged in "annual cropping" is unable to fulfil the conditions which would bring him within the definition of "existing farmer" because his livelihood and sole or principal source of income will not consist of only a specified activity or specified activities. He will be unable to offset against his cash cropping income a loss to the extent that it exceeds $10,000, suffered in any specified activity which he commences subsequently. For example, where a market gardener diversifies into berry fruits the offset of any loss in this specified activity will be limited to $10,000.

Where in any income year a taxpayer who has in previous years qualified as an existing farmer undertakes "annual cropping", his qualification as an "existing farmer" will need to be re-examined.

Thus a specified activity that previously qualified as an "Established Activity" may, because of the taxpayer undertaking "annual cropping" and thereby no longer qualifying as an existing farmer, cease to fulfil the requirements of an Established Activity in a particular income year. Consequently the $10,000 loss limitation would apply.

### Question 5

Where a taxpayer has prior to the 1983/1984 income year incurred development expenditure under section 127 and elects under the proviso to subsection (2) to carry forward the deduction to later income years, is this subject to section 188A?

### Answer

Yes. Section 188A does not apply to any **loss** incurred prior to the 1983/1984 income year. While development expenditure incurred prior to the 1983/1984 income year (but not deducted) has been **incurred** it cannot create a loss until the year in which it is claimed as a **deduction**. If it is claimed as a deduction in the 1983/1984 or future years, then s 188A applies.

### Question 6

Is a "farmer" who enters into a sharemilking 50 percent agreement with a sharemilker who owns his own herd, an "existing farmer" for the purposes of this section?

### Answer

A 50 percent sharemilking agreement is a private contract between the two parties and there is generally no standard form of agreement as there is for some lower percentage sharemilking agreements.

The normal position under such agreements is that the land owner retains **managemant** **control** of the land and is responsible for some or all of various types of expenditure, for example:

*   Fertiliser and Lime
*   Weed and Pest Control
*   Repairs and Maintenance of Buildings, Fences, Plant, etc
*   Vehicle Maintenance
*   Rates and Insurance

In this situation the land owner, due to his retention of management and partial financial control, is conducting (holding an interest in a specified activity in association with another person) the specified activity of a business of animal husbandry. Consequently, section 188A will apply in relation to both the sharemilker and the land owner.

### Question 7

Can a specified activity that was, on 11 October 1982, operated at a loss be an "established activity"?

For example, in 1981 a taxpayer was operating a successful sheep farm in the central North Island and in December of that year he purchased 10 hectares in the Bay of Plenty for development as a kiwifruit farm.

Work undertaken on the "kiwifruit" land prior to 11 October 1982 included contouring and the planting of shelter trees.

### Answer

The definition of an "established activity" firstly requires that on 11 October 1982 the taxpayer be an "existing farmer" (as defined) and secondly, that the specified **activities** operated by the taxpayer on 11 October 1982 constituted his livelihood and sole or principal source of income at that time.

The important point is that the definition requires that (for purposes of the definition) the Commissioner look at all the specified activities operated by the taxpayer and not each specified activity separately. In this case the sheep farm and the kiwifruit development together constituted the livelihood of the taxpayer and the sole or principal source of his income at 11 October 1982. The taxpayer would be able, therefore, to satisfy the tests of an "established activity".

### Question 8

May a taxpayer delay claiming deductions by way of depreciation in order to adjust the level of profit/loss in any year so as to minimise the effects of the application of section 188A?

### Answer

Any taxpayer may, in any income year, claim an amount of ordinary depreciation lower than the amount that would normally be allowed, and consequently claim depreciation on a higher figure in a later year. In this way the taxpayer may legitimately influence the level of profit/loss from a business activity from year to year. It is of no concern to the Department that such action may reduce the amount of loss incurred in an income year and thus the amount of loss that falls to be contained under section 188A.

**Note** that first year depreciation allowances must be claimed in the year the asset is first used in the business, ie, failure to claim the first year depreciation allowance in the year the asset is first used would result in that allowance being irretrievably forfeited.

### Question 9

A number of questions have been raised in relation to the accounting problems in identifying expenditure for the purpose of quantifying the profit/loss which is fairly attributable to a specified activity.

What is this Department's policy on keeping records to separate the expenditure incurred in respect of each separate specified activity and any other business activity?

### Answer

A taxpayer is required under section 428 of the Income Tax Act to maintain adequate records to enable his assessable income to be readily ascertained. It is implicit that a record be kept of the losses and costs, not only direct costs but also an allocation or apportionment of overhead or indirect costs, on the best or most appropriate basis to ensure each business bears its correct share of that cost.

It is desirable in cases of multi-purpose expenditure that record be kept (for example, a log book to record tractor use) to enable an apportionment to be made. The apportionment basis for other expenditure may be a matter for determination in an appropriate case and can be discussed with the Department in cases of any doubt.

### Question 10

Concern has been expressed that while the $10,000 limit does not apply to an **existing** **farmer** who conducts an **established** **activity** the effects of the definitions of "existing farmer" and "established activity" can cause anomalies because of their reference to the specified activity having to be the livelihood of the taxpayer and his sole or principal source of income.

### Answer

The questions of "existing farmer" and "established activity" must be decided on the facts of each case. The important point is that the words "sole or principal", as they appear in the definitions, relate to the **source** of the taxpayer's income rather than to the outright quantum of income actually generated by any source during an income year.

It is clear from case law pertaining to comparable situations that in determining whether a taxpayer is an "existing farmer" in relation to a particular time or period of time, the question which must be asked is: Is the conduct of the specified activity (or the specified activities) at that time or throughout that period by and large the taxpayer's way of living, so that any reasonable person would say that that conduct was the primary and fundamental means by which the taxpayer strove at that time or throughout that period to make his living? In other words, what was the primary and fundamental means by which he strove to that end, as opposed to a merely incidental or accessory means?

### Question 11

Is an amount paid to a Primary Producer Co-operative for storage of fruit in its cool store facilities expenditure incurred in conducting the specified activity of the business of growing trees or plants for the production of fruit?

### Answer

All expenditure incurred while the **grower** retains ownership of the produce together with any marketing expenditure incurred by the grower is expenditure incurred in conducting the specified activity and is an item of expenditure that is to be taken into account in calculating the amount (if any) of the loss that is subject to containment under section 188A.

### Question 12

Are grape growing, and kiwifruit growing, specified activities of the same kind and thus "related activities" (as defined) for the purposes of section 188A?

### Answer

Grape growing constitutes the specified activity that is described in section 188A(1) as "the business of viticulture". This is in accordance with the dictionary, and long-understood, meaning of "viticulture".

Kiwifruit growing constitutes the specified activity that is described in section 188A(1) as "the business of growing trees or plants for the production of fruit (other than grapes)".

It follows that as grape growing and kiwifruit growing are specified activities that are **not** of the same kind (within the section 188A(1) definition of "specified activity") they cannot be "related activities" within the meaning of **paragraph (a)** of the definition of "related activity". In regard to **paragraph (b)** of the latter definition they are most unlikely to be complementary activities within the meaning of section 188A(3) (and thus would not be "related activities"), but they **may** be "related activities" pursuant to the 5 year land ownership test in section 188A(4).

(B) Section 188B - Transitional Provisions
------------------------------------------

### Question 13

How is provisional tax to be calculated by taxpayers affected by the loss containment provisions (section 188A) and transitional tax-deferral measures (section 188B) inserted by section 32 of the 1982 Income Tax Amendment Act (No 2)?

### Answer

In terms of the new section 188B, the tax liability for a tax year may not be **due and payable** for up to 3 years after the terminal tax for that year would normally be due and payable. For this reason it would not be appropriate to calculate provisional tax in accordance with the normal section 379 provisions. Nor in this situation would it be possible for the taxpayer to make use of the provisions of section 387 to estimate his liability as these relate only to a taxpayer's estimation of his assessable income for the year and not to situations where deferrals of his actual tax liability are involved.

It has therefore been decided that where a taxpayer will be taking advantage of the transitional measures contained in the new section 188B of the Act he will be permitted (under **section 383** of the Act) to base his provisional tax for that year on his estimated tax liability for that year after deducting the estimated amount of tax that he will be allowed to defer under section 188B. A taxpayer can estimate or subsequently re-estimate his provisional tax, using this method, up to the date his second instalment of provisional tax becomes due.

The taxpayer's request for a section 383 adjustment must, however, be accompanied by an estimate of his income from all sources and his losses from all sources, calculated on as factual a basis as possible.

In considering an application to adjust provisional tax for any year in accordance with section 383, consideration will be given to the accuracy of the information supplied by the taxpayer in respect of any similar application made for the previous year. If a previous substantial under-estimation of provisional tax has arisen because of inaccurate information supplied by the taxpayer the application in respect of the current year will be declined. The point is that the Department is simply not prepared to permit the use of this concession to defer payment of tax that is not entitled to be deferred under section 188B.

The following example illustrates the options for calculating provisional tax in appropriate cases.

### 1985 PROVISIONAL TAX OPTIONS

1.  1985 provisional tax would be payable in terms of section 379 based on the tax payable on 1984 taxable income - ie, $35,094 in the example above.
2.  The Department will accept an estimate of provisional in terms of section 383 provided it is based on an accurate estimate of assessable income and tax liability for that year. The following example illustrates the method of calculation:

### INFORMATION:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Estimated 1985 professional income | 85,000 |     |
| Estimated 1985 loss from specified activity | (45,000) |     |
| The offset of specified activity losses will be limited to $10,000 under section 188A. |     |     |
| Therefore: |     |     |
| Tax on estimated taxable income ($75,000) |     | 38,394 |
| Less estimated deferred tax (in respect of $35,000 loss containment) |     | 23,100 |
| Estimated 1985 provisional tax |     | 15,294 |

**Note:** The amount of any tax deferred in previous years and becoming payable during the year is **not** added to the estimated provisional tax calculation for that year.

### Question 14

How are salary and wage earners to be given the benefits of the transitional measures (contained in section 188B as inserted by section 32 of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 2) 1982)?

### Answer

A salary and wage earner is in a similar situation to a provisional taxpayer who wishes to re-estimate his provisional tax for the year, taking into account both the maximum loss which may be offset under the new section 188A and the transitional measure contained in the new section 188B of the Act.

A salary and wage earner engaged in a "specified activity" which is incurring a loss has two alternative courses of action:

1.  The first alternative is to select the appropriate primary or secondary tax code in respect of his salary and wage income and, at the end of the year, after filing his return of income, obtain a refund of PAYE tax deductions made in excess of the tax actuallyin respect of his taxable income for the year (after allowing for any deferral under the new section 188B).
2.  The second alternative is to obtain a Special Tax Code that will take into account:
    *   The taxpayer's estimated salary and wage income.
    *   The taxpayer's estimated income from other sources.
    *   Losses incurred in "specified activities" up to the maximum level of offset allowed under section 188A.
    *   The amount of tax that may be deferred under section 188B.

Any application for a Special Tax Code should be supported by a high standard of information similar to that required to support an application by a taxpayer for a recalculation of provisional tax under section 383 (as discussed earlier).

Similarly, an application for a special tax code will be **declined** where the information provided by the taxpayer in support of an application for a Special Tax Code in the previous year has proved inaccurate.

Section 37 - Specified Leases (Sections 222A-222E of Principal Act)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

### Question 1

Does a guaranteed residual value have to be expressed in a dollar amount?

### Answer

No. The guaranteed residual value is a value agreed between the lessor and the lessee to be the value of the lease asset at the expiry of the lease term. It may be expressed as **nil**, (ie, no value) or by a method by which an amount may be determined, ie, "fair market value".

### Question

**Production Based Lease Payments**

Certain specified leases provide for a minimum rental and an additional rental based on the usage of the leased asset. In such cases the total sums payable under the lease vary from period to period and are not known until termination. How is the income of the lessor calculated in such cases?

### Answer

While the leasing provisions do not specifically mention the treatment for specified leases where the rental is contingent on the future production of the lease asset, the Department will determine the income from the lease on the following basis:

1.  Any lease payment in excess of the cost price (as defined) to the lessor is deemed to be interest under section 222C(1).
2.  If the minimum payments required (excluding any overage payments) exceed the cost price then that excess will be required to be returned as income under the terms of section 222C(2). The overage payments arising from production will be income of the lessor (interest income) derived when any such payment is **due and payable**.
3.  In any case where the minimum lease payments do not exceed the cost price they will be taken as being capital repayments, averaged over the lease term, and a similar approach will be applied to overage payments to repay the remaining capital content, eg, four year lease, minimum rentals $10,000 per annum, cost price $44,000. The Department will treat $11,000 per annum as being capital repayments and any remaining payments for the same period as being interest. The capital repayments will be spread evenly over all lease payments made during the lease term.
4.  The deduction to the lessee for interest paid will correspond to the income of the lessor in respect of any particular instalment and tax depreciation allowances will be allowable to the lessee.

**Note:** The term "overage" relates to those payments over and above the minimum lease rentals payable under the lease.

### Question 3 Hire Purchase Agreements

Are hire purchase agreements considered specified leases and, if so, what will the Department's future policy be?

### Answer

The taxation treatment of income arising from genuine hire purchase contracts will continue unaltered. The definition of "specified lease" would include a hire purchase contract and the new tax regime in respect of such leases will apply. Under the provisions of section 222C(2)(a)(ii) the Department will accept the interest income arising from a genuine hire purchase contract as being applied evenly over the instalments, viz, on a straightline basis. In addition, the Department will continue to accept the "trading profit" as emerging on a similar basis as the instalments become due and payable.

### Question 4

Both the following transactions are deemed to be hire purchase transactions under the Hire Purchase and Credit Sales Stabilisation Regulations 1957.

1.  Where a finance house lends money to the purchaser of an asset upon some form of security.
2.  Where a finance house makes a loan subject to the security of an existing hire purchase agreement, ie, the vendor sells the future income stream from the hire purchase contract and receives an immediate cash payment. The hire purchase repayments are then paid the finance house.

Are such loans affected by the new legislation?

### Answer

The two examples above are considered to be loans by the finance house provided that, in example b, the assignment is only for security and not absolutely.

Under a hire purchase contract the trading profits of the vendor and the interest arising from the credit advanced are not receivable by the vendor until any particular instalment is due and payable. If the hire purchase contract is assigned absolutely to a finance house then the vendor has realised his trading profit and that income is derived at that time. The income of the finance house from the hire purchase contract continues to emerge as the instalments are due and payable.

However, when a hire purchase contract is "mortgaged" to a hire purchase company, the assignment to the finance house is merely as security to ensure the loan is repaid even though the terms of the loan may require the instalments to be paid directly to the finance house. The income of the finance house is the interest arising from the loan. The income of the vendor continues to emerge as instalments become due and payable, as should the purchaser wish to pay the contract off early the vendor is obliged to give a rebate for the interest content of instalments which were not due at the time he receives full payment for the goods.

### Question 5 Overseas Lessors

Is the deemed interest income subject to non-resident withholding tax?

### Answer

The income arising from a specified lease is deemed to be interest for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 1976. In general it would therefore be interest for the purposes of New Zealand Domestic Law in regard to the various Double Taxation Agreements between New Zealand and other countries. The payments will, therefore, be subject to non-resident withholding tax **provided** the terms of any particular Double Taxation Agreement do not deem the payments to be of a contrary nature. Any particular case must be examined on the facts and the appropriate Agreement involved.

### Question 6 Expiry/Termination of Leases

On the expiry of leases, and in particular nil residual value leases, the lease asset does not always revert to the lessor nor is it purchased by the lessee. In some cases the asset remains in the possession of the lessee and no more payments take place, and in others the lease is renewed in perpetuity for a peppercorn rent.

Is the asset deemed to be sold by the lessee to the lessor for no consideration under section 222B(5) in the above situations?

### Answer

Section 222B(5) applies to any specified lease (other than a lease terminated prior to the expiry of the lease term where section 222B(6) applies) on the expiry of the lease term. Where a lease is renewed in perpetuity for a nominal sum section 222A(2) applies and the Department would treat both leases as being one lease for income tax purposes.

If at the end of the lease term the asset remains in the possession of the lessee and the lessor does not wish to recover the asset, section 222B(5) would still apply. In this case, however, the Department would not allow any further depreciation allowances to the lessee in the nature of a "loss on sale" on the expiry of the lease term as the lessee has not suffered any loss due to fair wear and tear or obsolescence (s 108) and has continuing and unrestricted use of the lease asset. Depreciation allowances at tax rates, based on tax book value at the expiry of the lease, would be allowed to the lessee in subsequent years provided the asset is used in the production of income.

### Question 7 Motor Car Leases

Why will the Department not accept the rule of 78 for calculating interest deductible under motor car leases?

### Answer

The rule of 78 method is not appropriate for motor car leases as the interest calculation is substantially different from that arising from use of the actuarial method.

The Department will accept interest income arising in a motor car lease to be returned on a straightline basis for income tax purposes under the provisions of section 222C(2)(a)(ii).

### Question 8

When the lessor acquires the lease asset at the end of the lease term, can he claim first year depreciation allowances?

### Answer

The lessor may claim first year depreciation allowances provided:

1.  The asset is used by him in his own business (the allowance will be claimable in the year in which it is first used by him).
2.  The allowances are based on the value of the asset on the expiry of the lease term as determined by section 222B.

**Note:** The lease of the asset in the first place was, for the purposes of the Tax Act, a sale to the lessee. It follows that the leasing of the asset does not constitute **use of the asset** in the production of the lessor's assessable income.

### Question 9

Does section 222E apply to bailments of livestock and leases of bloodstock?

### Answer

No. The definition of lease asset **excludes** livestock and bloodstock for the purposes of section 222E.

Section 41 - Business Records (Section 428 of the Principal Act)
----------------------------------------------------------------

### Question 1

What is the application date for the new section and what its relationship to records retained under the previous section?

### Answer

The rewritten section applies with effect from the income (or accounting) year commencing 1 April 1983. Until 31 March this year a taxpayer was required to keep records for a period of 7 years under the previous provisions of section 428. From 1 April the new section applied, requiring records to be kept for 10 years from the end of the year to which they relate. Where more than 7 years' records were available on the first day of the income year commencing 1 April 1983 these must be retained in accordance with the new 10 year provisions. Where on the first day of the income year commencing 1 April 1983 only 7 years' records were available (in accordance with the old provisions) there will be a 3 year build up as firstly 8, then 9 and finally 10 years' records become available.

### Question 2

What situation is envisaged by the proviso to subsection (3) of the amended section 428, which authorises the Commissioner to allow records to be kept **outside** New Zealand or to be kept in a language other than English?

### Answer

This proviso is intended to provide an element of flexibility where the **major** accounting functions of the business are carried on outside New Zealand. In such cases it would be impractical to require dual record keeping both in New Zealand and abroad.

### Question 3

Why have we extended the period from 7 to 10 years?

### Answer

Investigations of taxpayers where fraud is suspected are usually investigated for a minimum of 10 years. Similarly a number of the tax provisions such as recovery of interest and land subdivisions have 10 year rules.

### Question 4

What publicity are we giving to the need to retain records and the changes made?

### Answer

A PIB is being prepared and this will be sent to all employers.

### Question 5

The change applies to the keeping of records in the income year commencing on 1 April 1983. Can a person destroy business records which are more than 7 years old in the period up until 31 March 1983?

### Answer

Yes.

Income Tax Amendment Act (No 2) 1982
====================================

Archived legislative commentary on Income Tax Amendment Act (No 2) 1982 from PIB vol 120 Mar 1983.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 120, March/August 1983

[More information about _Public Information Bulletins_.](/about/about-our-publications)

### Section 1 - Short Title

Provides that this Amendment Act is to be read with and form part of the Income Tax Act 1976.

### Section 2 - Application

Unless otherwise stated in relation to any particular section or subsection, the provisions of this Act first apply to the tax on income derived during the income year which commenced on 1 April 1982. It should be noted that there are a number of provisions in this Act which have their own commencing dates. These are pointed out during this commentary.

### Section 3 - Superannuation

This is one of a number of amendments relating to the tax treatment of superannuation funds. A consolidated commentary on the effect of these amendments is contained in Appendix A of this publication.

### Section 4 - Dividends

This section makes two changes to the meaning of the term "dividend" in section 4 of the principal Act.

The first of these changes is to ensure that with the repeal of bonus issue tax, bonus issues do not become an avenue to distribute "revenue" reserves tax free to the shareholders.

The Amendment Act inserts a new paragraph (ca) to section 4(1) of the principal Act, which amends the term "dividend" to include any return or reduction of capital where a company has, on or after 1 April 1982, made a bonus issue and subsequently within ten years from the date of that bonus issue makes a return or reduction of capital. As a general rule, a bonus issue is made on whatever date is specified by the company, in the relevant resolution, as being the date as at which the bonus issue is made.

**Bonus Issues made before 1 April 1982**

The application of the 10-year recovery rule is restricted to cases in which both the bonus issue and the return of capital are made on or after 1 April 1982. This means that a company which has, prior to 1 April 1982, converted its revenue reserves by way of bonus issue as part of the winding up of the company, will still be subject to the old three-year "further bonus issue" rule under section 263 of the Act. This is illustrated by the following example.

**Example 1**

| Date |     | Company A | Company B |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 Jan 1981 | Bonus Issue | $ 50,000 | $ 50,000 |
| 1 Jan 1983 | Return of Capital | $100,000 | Nil |
| 2 Jan 1985 | Return of Capital | Nil | $100,000 |
| 1 Jan 1983 |     |     |     |
| Section 263 | Amount liable for further bonus issue tax | $50,000 | N/A |
| Section 4(1)(ca) | Amount assessable as a dividend | Nil | N/A |
| 2 Jan 1985 |     |     |     |
| Section 263 | Amount liable for further bonus issue tax | N/A | Nil |
| Section 4(1)(ca) | Amount assessable as a dividend | N/A | Nil |

In this example Company A is liable to a further payment of bonus issue tax as it has made a further distribution within 3 years of the initial bonus issue, whereas Company B has waited 3 years and does not attract any tax under the 3 year or 10 year rules.

**Bonus Issues made on or after 1 April 1982**

The legislation uses a first in/first out (FIFO) basis to relate the return of capital to the first bonus issue and to the second and third, etc, bonus issues, made after 1 April 1982 which is or are within the 10 year period. This process is illustrated in the following examples.

**_Example 1_**

This example is to show a practical application of the proviso to section 4 which stipulates the order in which the return of capital is applied to the bonus issues.

|     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 May 1982 | A.  | Bonus Issue |     | $50,000 |
| 1 May 1984 | B.  | Bonus Issue |     | $60,000 |
| 1 May 1988 |     |     | Return of Capital | $60,000 |
| 1 May 1990 | C.  | Bonus Issue |     | $70,000 |
| 1 May 1993 |     |     | Return of Capital | $120,000 |

**1\. Period 1 April 1982 to 1 May 1988 (date of first return of capital):**

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Bonus Issues ($50,000 + $60,000) | $110,000 |
| Previous Returns of Capital | NIL |
| ASSESS AS A DIVIDEND |     |
| THE RETURN OF CAPITAL | $60,000\*1 |
| ($50,000 of bonus issue made 1.5.82 and $10,000 of bonus issue made 1.5.84) |     |

**2\. 10 year period 1 May 1983 to 1 May 1993 (date of second return of capital):**

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Bonus Issues ($60,000 + $70,000) | $130,000 |
| Previous Returns of Capital |     |
| treated as a Dividend | 10,000\*2 |
| Balance | $120,000 |
| ASSESS AS A DIVIDEND |     |
| THE RETURN OF CAPITAL | $60,000\*1 |
| ($50,000 of bonus issue made 1.5.82 and $10,000 of bonus issue made 1.5.84) |     |

**Comment**

1.  Both Bonus Issues A and B were made after 1 April 1982 and within 10 years before the return of capital. Therefore the return of capital is treated as a dividend firstly to the extent of the bonus issue A made on 1 May 1982 of $50,000 and the balance $10,000 to the bonus issue B made on 1 May 1981.
2.  Bonus issue A of 1 May 1982 is now outside the 10 year period. Bonus issue B of 1 May 1984 has been reduced by 10,000 to $50,000.
3.  The return of capital is treated as a dividend firstly to the extent of $50,000 of the balance of the bonus issue B of 1 May 1984 and the excess to the bonus issue C of 1 May 1990.

**_Example 2_**

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 June 1982 | Bonus Issue | $70,000 |
| 1 June 1987 | Return of Capital (X) | $20,000 |
| 1 June 1989 | Return of Capital (Y) | $10,000 |
| 1 June 1994 | Return of Capital (Z) | $100,000 |

**1\. Period ending 1 June 1987**

|     |     |

| Bonus Issue (after 31.3.82 and within 10 years) | $70,000 |
| Less previous Return of capital |     |
| "Unabsorbed" return of capital | $70,000 |
| Assess as a dividend the return of capital (X) | $20,000 |

**2\. Period ending 1 June 1989**

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Bonus Issue (after 31.3.82 and within 10 years) | $70,000 |
| Less previous return of Capital | $20,000 |
| "Unabsorbed" return of capital | $50,000 |
| Assess as a dividend the return of capital (Y) | $10,000 |

**3\. Period ending 1 June 1994**

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Bonus Issues (within the preceding 10 years) | Nil |
| Assess as a dividend | Nil. |

**Comments**

1.  Returns of capital (X) and (Y) are to be assessed to the shareholders as dividends.
2.  Return of capital (Z) is not assessable as a dividend as no bonus issue was made within the preceding 10 year period.
3.  Of the $70,000 bonus issue $40,000 has gone back to the shareholders but does not attract any tax in their hands.

The second series of changes to the term "dividend" are introduced by section 4(3) of the Amendment Act.

**Section 4(3) - Tax Free Dividends**

The amendments which this section make to section 4 of the principal Act apply with respect to the tax on income derived in the 1982/83 income year and every subsequent year. Previously, section 4(5) excluded from the definition of the term "dividend" any capital gain or capital profits arising on the realisation of a capital asset of the company.

The changes introduced by section 4 of the Amendment Act will prevent the growth in schemes aimed at creating artificial capital profits to facilitate the distribution of revenue reserves free of tax, in the guise of capital profits.

These changes are incorporated in the new subsections (5A) and (5B) of section 4 of the principal Act and their effect is to prevent the application of section 4(5) in these artificial cases.

From the income year which commenced on 1 April 1982 any distribution of a capital profit arising from the realisation of an asset by a company to a person deemed to be related to that company will not qualify as a capital distribution tax free in the hands of the shareholders.

A private company is excluded from this new legislation where that company "during the course of and for the purposes of the winding up of that company" sells an asset to a related person (not being a company).

Two new terms are introduced by this legislation. They are:

**_(a) Specified Company_**

For the purposes of the new subsections (5A) and (5B) of section 4, the company which realises the asset is referred to as the "specified company".

**_(b) Related Person_**

In the new subsection (5B), eight classes of person are deemed to be a "person related to the specified company". These eight classes can be summarised as follows:

*   (i) and (ii) A person who owns, controls or has the right to acquire either:
    *   20 percent or more of the voting rights, or
    *   20 percent or more of the ordinary shares,

*   of the specified company.

*   (iii) and (iv) A company of which the specified company owns, controls or has the right to acquire either:
    *   20 percent or more of the voting rights, or
    *   20 percent or more of the ordinary shares.

*   (v) A company of which 20 percent or more of the ordinary shares or 20 percent or more of the voting rights are held by the shareholders of the specified company where those shareholders own, control or have the right to acquire:
    *   20 percent or more of the voting rights,
    *   20 percent or more of the ordinary shares,

*   of the specified company.

For the purposes of this paragraph where the shares or voting rights of one company are owned or controlled by another company those shares or rights will be deemed to be owned or controlled by the shareholders of that other company and so on.

*   (vi) Any partner or co-venturer of the specified company.
*   (vii) A trustee of a trust where the specified company or a person related to the specified company can benefit directly or indirectly under the trust.
*   (viii) A partnership where any one or more partners are related to the specified company and that partner or partners either:
    *   Hold in the aggregate an entitlement to 50 percent of the assets or profits of that partnership; OR
    *   Are able to control the partnership.

For the purposes of the new subsection (5B), a person is deemed to hold any interest that is held by his or her:

*   Spouse
*   Child
*   Spouse's child
*   Nominee  
    or by:
*   Any spouse of any child referred to above.

### Section 5 - Notice of Bonus Issues

Section 5 inserts a new section, 13A, in the principal Act, which requires every company to furnish with its annual return of income details of any bonus issues made during the year. This information was previously furnished at the time bonus issue tax was payable during the year.

### Section 6 - Extensions of Time for Furnishing Returns

At present the Commissioner has the power, under section 386(3) of the principal Act, to grant extensions of time for the filing of tax returns by taxpayers who pay provisional tax.

Section 6 of this Amendment Act adds to section 17 of the principal Act, a subsection (4) which now enables the Commissioner to grant similar extensions of time for the furnishing of salary and wage earner returns.

### Section 7 - Objections to Which this Part Does Not Apply

Section 7 makes changes to section 36 of the principal Act which specifies the decisions, determinations, and other matters in respect of which a taxpayer has no right of objection under the normal objection procedures provided in Part III of that Act.

This section removes the reference in paragraph (e) of section 36 to the Government Actuary's approval of superannuation schemes for the purposes of the Income Tax Act. Such approvals and objections to them are now dealt with under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1976. The reference in paragraph (e) to decisions or determinations of the Commissioner in considering applications for approval of sick, accident or death benefit funds for the purposes of section 61 has been retained.

In addition, determinations made by the Commissioner for the purposes of section 73 (which deals with the question of whether and to what extent allowances are reimbursing allowances and thereby exempt from tax) are now specifically referred to, in a new paragraph, (ea), of section 36, as being determinations to which the Part III objection procedures do not apply. This is because in the rewritten section 73, as enacted by section 11 of this Amendment Act, there is now a self-contained code for objections to such determinations.

The amendments made by section 7 apply from the 1982/83 income year.

### Section 8 - Special Exemption for Life Insurance Premiums and Superannuation Contributions

This section, which is effective from 1 April 1983, makes three amendments to section 59 of the principal Act, firstly by incorporating the new Categories 1 and 2 Superannuation Schemes into the definition of "specified fund". It should be noted that Category 3 schemes are excluded from the definition and accordingly contributions to such schemes do not qualify for the special exemption.

The second amendment repeals the definition of the term "subsidised superannuation fund" and replaces it with the definition of "subsidised superannuation scheme". The new definition incorporates the Government Actuary's classification for the various classes of subsidised schemes.

The third amendment increases the life insurance/superannuation special exemption limit from $800 to $1,200 for taxpayers contributing to subsidised superannuation schemes and for other taxpayers, the maximum limit is increased from $1,000 to $1,400.

### Section 9 - Incomes Wholly Exempt from Tax

Section 9 makes three amendments to section 61 of the principal Act which lists the various types of exempt income. Changes, which will apply from the income year commencing 1 April 1983, are made in respect of:

*   the income of building societies,
*   the income derived by trustees of superannuation schemes,
*   the business income of charitable organisations.

**Building Societies**

Subsection (1) repeals subsection (4) of the principal Act removing the partial exemption from tax that previously applied to certain types of income derived by building societies. This change gives effect to the Budget announcement that all of the income of building societies is to be taxed at the company rate of 45 percent, commencing in the 1983-84 income year. Certain deductions have been provided in a new section 194A introduced by section 33 of this Amendment Act and are discussed later under that section.

**Trustees of Superannuation Schemes**

Subsection (2) provides that the exemption from tax which presently applies to the income derived by trustees of superannuation schemes will, from the income year commencing 1 April 1983, be restricted to income derived by trustees of superannuation Category 1 schemes (as defined in section 2 of the principal Act as amended by section 3 of this Amendment Act).

The income derived by trustees of superannuation Category 2 schemes and superannuation Category 3 schemes will now be taxed at the 31 rates of percent and 45 percent respectively (see section 42 of this Amendment Act).

**Business Income of Charitable Organisations**

Subsection (3) adds a second proviso to section 61(27) of the principal Act which deals with the exemption from tax of the business income of charitable organisations.

The proviso introduces a series of "control tests" which in general terms remove the exemption from tax which presently applies to the business income of the so-called "one-man charities" while retaining that exemption in respect of the business income of recognised charities.

Business income derived by charitable organisations will no longer be exempt from tax where a person (which includes a company) who is:

*   (a) a settlor or trustee of a trust by which the business is carried on; or
*   (b) a shareholder or director of a company by which the business is carried on; or
*   (c) a settlor or trustee of a trust that is a shareholder of a company by which the business is carried on; or
*   (d) an associated person of any of the persons referred to in (a) to (c) above, is, in the opinion of the Commissioner, able by virtue of that capacity to determine or to materially influence the nature or amount of any benefit, advantage or income (of the kinds referred to in section 65(2)) that is given or is able to be given to himself.

There are several important points which should be noted in the application of this control test. They are:

*   The decision of whether or not business income will be taxable is one that is to be made by the Commissioner, in his discretion. Each case will be considered on its merits bearing in mind the tenor of the section.
*   The benefit, advantage or income which one of the specified persons could receive need only be able to to be received for the test to operate. It is not necessary for that benefit, advantage or income to be actually given. Otherwise, it is possible that the exemption from tax might apply to business income in some years and not in others, depending on whether such benefits, advantages or income were actually given.
*   The benefits or advantages referred to above need not be convertible into cash.
*   The types of income, included in section 65(2), which could cause the test to come into effect are:
    *   salary, wages and allowances (section 65(2)(b));
    *   rents, fines and premiums (section 65(2)(g) - see also the commentary on paragraph (f) following);
    *   royalties (section 65(2)(h));
    *   interest, dividends, annuities, pensions (section 65(2)(i) - in respect of interest see also the commentary on paragraph (g) following);
    *   benefits from money advanced (section 65(2)(j)).
*   The amount of the benefit, advantage or income involved is irrelevant. No matter how small the amount, the business income could lose its exemption from tax. That is, there are no partial exemptions.

Paragraphs (e) to (h) of this section modify the application of the control tests in various ways.

Paragraph (e) expands the meaning of settlor. It deems to be a settlor any person who has not completely divested himself of an asset which he has disposed of to the trust which carries on the business.

Paragraph (f) deems the deriving of any rents, fines, premiums or other revenues by a trustee, from any asset which a person of any of the specified classes has disposed of (to the trust carrying on the business) but has not completely divested himself of, to be a business carried on by the trustee, for the purposes of the control tests.

Paragraph (g) excludes from income, for the purposes of the control tests, interest derived on money lent to the business, by a person of any of the specified classes, that is payable at not more than current commercial rates having regard to the nature and term of the loan. Current commercial rates of interest are published by the Reserve Bank.

Paragraph (h) provides that for purposes of the control tests, a professional person in public practice, who in that capacity renders his services to a charitable organisation will not, by reason only of the rendering of those services, be considered to be able to "control" the benefit, etc, that he derives from the company. For the purposes of this exclusion, the Public Trustee, the Maori Trustee and trustee companies are each deemed to be a professional person in public practice. This concession does not however allow such persons to avoid the control tests, if they receive or are able to receive, etc, income from the charitable organisation by reason separately of any other relationship, of any of the kinds specified at paragraphs (a) to (d) above, with the trust or the company concerned.

The new provisions in respect of the business income of charities apply from the income year commencing on 1 April 1983.

### Section 10 - Removal of the Dividend Exemption in Respect of Dividends Derived by Life Insurance Companies

The section amends section 63 of the principal Act by excluding from the dividend exemption, dividend income derived by a life insurance company in respect of its New Zealand life insurance business. As explained in Appendix D, from the income year commencing 1 April 1983, the business of life insurance in New Zealand will no longer be taxed on the basis of reversionary bonuses but taxed on investment income derived.

### Section 11 - Power to Exempt Employees' Allowances

Section 11(1) substitutes a rewritten section 73 in the principal Act. Section 73 deals with the power of the Commissioner to exempt from tax any allowance paid to an employee to the extent that it is a reimbursement of expenditure the employee has incurred in gaining or producing his assessable income.

While section 73 has been substantially expanded in size, there is little change to the basic concepts of the previous legislation.

The section can conveniently be divided into three parts:

*   subsections (1) to (4) - constitute the previous s 73.
*   subsections (5) to (7) - application dates of determinations made by the Commissioner.
*   subsections (8) to (16) - objection procedures.

**Subsections (1) to (4)**

Subsection (1) contains the definitions for the section. Definitions of "award", "collective agreement" and "instrument" have been added and these are relevant to subsection (6). Each of these expressions has the same meaning as in the Wage Adjustment Regulations 1974.

Subsection (2) empowers the Commissioner to make determinations as to what part (if any) of an allowance is reimbursing and thereby exempt from tax. This subsection is unchanged.

Subsection (3) deals with determinations made by the Commissioner in respect of travelling allowances. A minor drafting amendment has been made to the subsection.

Subsection (4) deals with the situations in which determinations can be made in respect of groups of employees. Prior to this year's amendment, "group determinations" could be made only on the written application of any employer or workers' union. The subsection now provides that the Commissioner also may originate such determinations where he considers it necessary to do so.

**Subsections (5) to (7)**

These subsections set down specific application dates in respect of determinations made under subsections (2), (3) and (4).

Subsection (5) specifically requires that determinations made by the Commissioner under section 73 be in writing and that, in the absence of subsection (6) applying, those determinations are to apply from a date one month after the date of the written determination.

Subsection (6) allows for a deferral of the application date that would otherwise apply under subsection (5), in certain cases. The cases are where:

*   An allowance is paid under any clause or other provision of an award, collective agreement or other instrument; and
*   A determination has been made, on or after 24 September 1981, by the Commissioner under section 73 in respect of that allowance; and
*   The Commissioner has not fully exempted that allowance from tax; and
*   No prior determination in respect of that allowance has been given effect to by the Commissioner (eg, where a determination has been made by the Commissioner but for national reasons its implementation has not been insisted on.)

In these cases, the application date of any determination under section 73 will be the date on which payment of that allowance is first made on or after the earlier of:

*   The date on which the award, collective agreement or instrument, having been first renegotiated (after the date on which notice of the determination was given) and registered with the Arbitration Court, comes into force with respect to the clause or other provision covering the payment of the allowance.
*   The later of:
    *   The date 6 months after the date on which notice of the determination in respect of that allowance was given.
    *   Any later date agreed to by the Commissioner in the circumstances of the particular case.

Subsection (7) is an anti-avoidance section designed to restrict the unfair use of the deferral provisions of subsection (6).

**Subsections (8) to (16)**

These subsections set down specific objection procedures in respect of determinations made by the Commissioner in terms of section 73. The amendments allow objections to be heard as soon as possible after determinations have been made without having to wait for the issue of a notice of assessment, so as not to adversely affect the rights of individual employees, particularly because of the PAYE deduction implications of such determinations.

Subsections (8) and (9) specify the parties who may object to a determination made under section 73 and the time for objection. Any party subject to a determination made under subsections (2) and (3) may object to that determination, within one month of the date on which notice of that determination is given by the Commissioner, by delivering to the Commissioner a written notice of objection stating the grounds of objection. A similar procedure applies in respect of determinations made under subsection (4) except that in such instances only employers or workers' unions (or their authorised representatives) may object.

Subsection (10) allows late objections to be accepted at the Commissioner's discretion.

Subsection (11) requires the Commissioner to consider each objection and authorises him to alter the determination objected to.

Subsection (12) allows the objector to require his objection to be referred to a Taxation Review Authority where that objection is not wholly allowed by the Commissioner. This is achieved by the objector giving written notice in that regard within 2 months from the date on which notice was given by the Commissioner of the disallowance of that objection.

Subsection (13) provides that the use of the objection procedures provided for in section 73 shall not affect:

*   the powers of a Taxation Review Authority on determinations of objections or cases stated (section 32 of the principal Act),
*   the obligation to pay tax, which is not suspended by objection or appeal (section 34),
*   determinations of objections not to affect other income (section 35).

Subsection (14) requires a Taxation Review Authority to consider every objection referred to him pursuant to subsection (12) and to redetermine the extent to which the allowance, subject to the objection, constitutes a reimbursement of expenditure and is thereby exempt from tax.

Subsection (15) gives a Taxation Review Authority access to the Department's records which relate directly to the remuneration concerning those employees to whom the allowance (to which the objection relates) was paid, for the purpose of considering objections.

Subsection (16) provides that every determination or decision by a Taxation Review Authority on any section 73 objection is final and conclusive. This means there is no right of appeal to the High Court.

Section 11(2) makes a consequential amendment to the Inland Revenue Department Act 1974 which also ensures that every determination or decision by a Taxation Review Authority on any section 73 objection is final and conclusive.

### Section 12 - Deduction for Forestry Expenditure

Section 12 amends section 74 of the principal Act to remove the deductibility in the year incurred of forestry establishment and maintenance expenditure currently available to companies. This change results from the Budget announcement that as from 1 April 1983 the "current year deduction" would be replaced by a new scheme of forestry encouragement grants which are to be administered and paid out by the New Zealand Forest Service.

**Situation Prior to Amendment**

The second proviso to section 74(2)(b) has allowed companies engaged in forest development to claim a deduction, in the year incurred, of the following forest establishment and maintenance expenditure:

*   (i) Expenses in planting or maintaining trees on the land or in preparing or otherwise developing the land for forestry operations.
*   (ii) Rents, rates, land tax, insurance and other like expenses.
*   (iii) Interest on money borrowed and employed as capital for the purposes of that business.

The third proviso to section 74(2)(b) allowed the forestry companies to also claim a current year deduction for depreciation on plant and machinery used primarily and principally in forest establishment and maintenance.

Since the 1980 income year a company claiming the current year deductions referred to above, and in a loss situation, could convert its loss (up to the amount of the current year deduction for the year) to a refundable credit of tax at the rate of 45 cents in the $1. The provisions relating to this tax credit scheme are contained in section 74A of the principal Act.

Taxpayers engaged in commercial afforestation, other than as companies claiming the current year deduction, had to either:

*   Capitalise their establishment and maintenance expenditures to what is known as a "cost of bush" account and deduct them on a pro rata basis at the time of deriving income on the felling of the trees; or
*   Obtain forestry encouragement grants under the old grants scheme which had certain limits both as to total qualifying annual forestry expenditure and per hectare costs.

**Situation After Amendment**

The two amendments which section 12 of this Amendment Act makes to section 74(2)(b) provide that establishment and maintenance expenditure incurred on or after 1 April 1983 by forestry companies will no longer qualify for deduction in the year incurred (or conversion to a tax credit under section 74A where a loss is involved).

A consequential amendment has also been made to section 213 of the principal Act which allowed holding companies to claim the current year deduction in respect of expenditure incurred by forestry companies under their control.

Instead of the current year deduction, these companies, along with all other commercial afforesters, may obtain forestry encouragement grants from the New Zealand Forest Service in respect of qualifying expenditure.

Briefly, the new grants will apply to all the afforestation expenditure (incurred after 31 March 1983) which up until now has qualified for the current year deduction by companies (including depreciation on plant and machinery acquired after 31 March 1983 and used primarily in establishment and maintenance). The new grants are being paid at the rate of 45 percent of the qualifying expenditure.

**Practical Effects of Amendments**

The practical effects of the changes for income tax purposes are as follows:

*   Because the amendment applies to expenditure incurred on or after a certain date (1 April 1983) and not to a particular income year, forestry companies with early balance dates will be able to claim the current deduction for some establishment and maintenance expenditure (and the forestry expenditure tax credit where appropriate) in their 1984 returns, eg

**Company A - Balance date 31 December**

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1983 return  <br>(ye 31.12.82) | All expenditure claimable on a current year basis. |
| 1984 return  <br>(ye 51.12.85) | Expenditure in period from 1.1.83 to 31.3.83 claimable on a current year basis. |
|     | Expenditure from l. 4.83 not eligible for current year deduction. |

**Company B - Balance date 30 June**

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1983 return (ye 30.6.83) | Expenditure to 31.3.83 claimable on a current year basis. |
|     | Expenditure from 1.4.83 not eligible for current year deduction. |

Plant and machinery which is acquired prior to 1 April 1983 and used by a company primarily in establishment and maintenance operations will continue to qualify for depreciation deductions on a current year basis under the third proviso to section 74(2)(b), until sold or discarded by the company. Where a loss results from the depreciation allowance deduction, the section 74A tax credit can apply.

Expenditure incurred after 31 March 1983 in respect of which forestry encouragement grant has been paid will not be deductible for tax purposes at any time, in terms of section 168 of the principal Act.

The new measure does not affect the deduction allowable to farmers under section 134 of the principal Act for expenditure incurred in planting and maintaining trees which are to provide shelter or prevent erosion in relation to the farm land.

### Section 13 - Valuation of Trading Stock Including Livestock

This section makes machinery amendments to section 85 of the principal Act, which provides the basis for valuing trading stock.

The section firstly repeals the proviso to subsection (3).

As a result of the repeal of the proviso, the deduction of the cost of trading stock acquired in any income year (including the year a business commences) will now be governed solely by section 104 of the Act.

Subsections (6) and (7) of section 85 have been repealed and substituted, to state simply that:

*   An amount equal to the value of trading stock on hand at the end of the income year is to be included in calculating assessable income.
*   An amount equal to the value of trading stock on hand at the beginning of the income year is to be allowed as a deduction in calculating assessable income.

The opportunity has been taken to include in section 85, as subsection (10), the standard provision which relates an accounting year to the April/March year where the taxpayer's balance date is other than 31 March.

### Section 14 - Standard Value and Nil Value of Livestock

Section 14 gives effect to the Budget announcement of the extension, from 2 years to 4 years, of the period for determining basic livestock numbers under the nil value scheme.

It gives effect also to the Budget announcement that in the case of new farmers and those who acquire or develop additional land, the write down from cost to standard value in respect of the new or additional livestock purchased will in future have to be effected over a period of three years.

The write down in year one cannot exceed one-third of the difference between cost and the standard value which the Commissioner has approved for ultimate adoption by the taxpayer.

The aggregate of the write downs in Years 1 and 2 cannot exceed two-thirds of the difference between cost and the standard value ultimately to be adopted.

Example

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
|     |     | $   |
| Assumptions |     |     |
|     | Cost per head of livestock | 120.00 |
|     | Approved Standard Value | 30.00 |
|     | Excess | 90.00 |
| Value - Year 1 |     |     |
|     | Cost less one-third "excess" ie, 120 - (1/3 x 90) | 90.00 |
| Value - Year 2 |     |     |
|     | Cost less one-third "excess" ie, 120 - (2/3 x 90) | 60.00 |
| Value - Year 3 |     |     |
|     | Approved standard value | 30.00 |

Points to note:

*   These provisions do not affect the approval of the adoption of an ultimate standard value.
*   The progressive write-down applies to purchases of livestock made in the income year in which the taxpayer commenced or recommenced farming or brought into production or substantially increased production or purchased any additional land, and the subsequent three (3) income years.
*   The taxpayer may write-down to a lesser extent than the maximum write-off specified above, in relation to any year.
*   The proviso to section 86(3) allows the Commissioner to deny the adoption of nil values where, for any reason whatsoever, the taxpayer would achieve an unfair advantage from the adoption of nil values. The acquisition of additional land is expressly mentioned. The proviso also enables the Commissioner to accept in any particular case that the establishment of "basic livestock" has in fact been achieved in a shorter period than the four (4) years specified in the section.
*   The acquisition of additional land or the bringing into production or substantially increased production of any land should be apparent from a perusal of the financial accounts of the business, eg, quantum of development expenditure, increased livestock numbers, increase in land cost, etc

The question of who is "caught" by the new measures has been raised. The following notes will assist in resolving the matter.

**1\. Taxpayer, not being an existing farmer**

*   Commences farming for the first time, OR
*   Recommences after a break from farming,

**AND:**

*   In the year of commencement or recommencement purchases livestock, OR
*   In the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th years purchases livestock that are not simply livestock purchased to replace livestock sold or lost since that commencement or recommencement of farming.

**2\. Taxpayer, being an existing farmer**

*   Brings land, that he already owns, into production for the first time, OR
*   Brings land that he already owns, into substantially increased production, OR
*   Acquires additional land for farming,

**AND:**

*   In the year in which that bringing into production, or that bringing into substantially increased production, or that acquiring of additional land occurs, purchases livestock that are additional to the livestock normally carried on the land farmed previously

**OR:**

*   In the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th years purchases livestock that are not simply livestock purchased to replace livestock sold or lost since the happening of the relevant event referred to in paragraph 2(i) above.

**_NOTE_**

*   The term "brings into production" means that the existing farmer develops, and thereby facilitates the farming of, land that he already owns but has not, for some reason such as the existence of native bush or lupin, farmed previously.
*   The term "brings into substantially increased production" means that the existing farmer develops, and thereby facilitates substantially more intensive farming of, land that he already owns but has previously farmed to only minimal capacity.

For example:

*   Swampland that previously was virtually waste land is drained, ploughed, and sown in grass.
*   Land that over a period of years has reverted to scrub is cleared and resown.

### Section 15 - Limitation of Deduction For Expenditure to Amount at Risk

Section 15 introduces a new section 106A into the principal Act. This new section is designed to limit the deduction which may be claimed in respect of expenditure for which the taxpayer is not personally at risk by effectively treating such investment in the same manner as if it had been financed by a specified suspensory loan. The new section 106A defers the allowance of a deduction for expenditure financed by means of limited recourse loan (as defined) until such time as the taxpayer is personally at risk for the funds invested. Limited recourse loans are defined as including non-recourse loans and loans covered by certain guarantees which protect the borrower against loss. At present, only limited recourse loans used in the film industry are covered by the legislation, and then only in respect of such loans made after 5 August 1982 in respect of films which commenced after that date (as determined by the Commissioner under section 224C of the principal Act).

Details of the application of the legislation are as follows.

**Section 106A**

Subsection (1)

This subsection contains the following definitions.

"Film" means a film as defined in section 224B of the principal Act (as inserted by section 38 of this Amendment Act) and includes any right in a film as defined in the new section 224A. The definitions contained in sections 224A and 224B are fully explained in Appendix F of this publication.

"Limited Recourse Loan" means any amount borrowed by a taxpayer where that taxpayer is protected (either wholly or partially) against loss arising from any investment of the amount borrowed by virtue of:

*   the amount borrowed being wholly or partially provided as a non-recourse loan (as defined); or
*   any guarantee provided by any person who has an interest (other than as a creditor) either in the business or activity in which the loan is invested, or in any product, consequence, effect or result of the carrying on of that business; or
*   Any other arrangement which, in the opinion of the Commissioner, is of a substantially similar nature.

This definition is largely self-explanatory. However, it should be noted that the guarantee provision set out in paragraph (b) applies only to guarantees provided by a person who has an interest either in the business itself or in its output, and then only where the guarantee protects the borrower against loss. It does not apply where a person, irrespective of his relationship to the borrower or any interest he may have in the borrower's business, provides a guarantee which protects the lender against loss.

"Non-Recourse Loan" means any loan where the liability for repayment of the principal and/or the interest is secured upon the income to be derived from any venture or the happening of any other future occurrence, and where, in the event that the proceeds from the venture are less than the sum of the principal plus interest on the loan, or where the event does not occur or for any other reason, the taxpayer is liable to repay less than the whole of the principal or the accrued interest thereon.

To fall within this definition, the following elements must be present:

*   The repayment of the principal and/or interest must be secured upon the income to be derived from a particular venture or ventures, or upon the happening of some other future event. AND
*   There must be the possibility that the taxpayer can be placed in the position where he is not liable to repay the loan and/or the interest thereon in full.

If the loan agreement or an associated arrangement does not contain these elements, then it is not a "non-recourse loan" as defined. However, it should be noted that where the conditions of the loan are substantially similar to those set out under the definition of non-recourse loan but are arranged in such a way so as to avoid falling within that definition, the arrangement may well fall within paragraph (c) of the definition of limited recourse loan.

Subsection (2) sets out the types of loan, and the expenditure, to which this section applies. The section applies to:

*   (a) Any limited recourse loan made on or after 6 August 1982 which is used by the taxpayer in any income year for the acquisition, production or marketing of any film; and
*   (b) Any expenditure incurred in any income year by any taxpayer in the acquisition, production or marketing of any film where that expenditure is financed from any limited recourse loan of the kind referred to in paragraph (a) above.

The section does not apply to a limited recourse loan, whether made before or after 6 August 1982, where that loan is used wholly in the acquisition, production or marketing of any film which the Commissioner is satisfied commenced prior to 6 August 1982. The new section 224C requires the Commissioner to determine whether a film commenced prior to 6 August 1982. A commentary on this requirement can be found in Appendix F of this publication.

Subsections (3), (4) and (5) are the subsections which deny a deduction for expenditure, depreciation and investment allowance where expenditure has been financed from a limited recourse loan.

Subsection (3) provides that where a limited recourse loan is used to finance expenditure of a revenue nature, the amount of that expenditure which is allowable as a deduction (in any income year) is reduced by the amount of the limited recourse loan which was used to finance that expenditure. Any deduction which may be allowable in respect of that expenditure may be claimed only when, and to the extent that, repayment of the loan is made (subsection (7) refers).

For example, an investor receives a limited recourse loan of $400,000 and, together with his personal contribution of $800,000, invests $1.2 million in the production of a feature film which commenced after 5 August 1982. The film is completed on 28 July 1984 and the film production partnership has a balance date of 30 September. If it were not for the provisions of this section, the investor would be entitled to write off the $1.2 million as a deduction over 24 months. However, subsection (3) of this section limits the amount which may be claimed as a deduction to the $800,000 which was not financed by means of a limited recourse loan. This amount would then be spread over the 24 month period as required by section 224A.

Subsection (4) provides that where a limited recourse loan is applied towards the purchase of any asset which is used in the acquisition, production or marketing of any film, the cost of the asset for depreciation purposes is reduced by the amount of the loan which has been applied towards its purchase. Depreciation is allowable on the reduced cost price in the normal way. If any amount of that loan is subsequently repaid, the depreciation claim in the year of repayment and future years is based on the increased cost price or, as the case may be, book value in terms of subsection (7) of this section.

For example, a taxpayer purchases an asset for $100,000 using $30,000 limited recourse loan and $70,000 of his own money. Depreciation must be based on the $70,000, so in year one the claim for depreciation on a 10 percent diminishing value basis (in the absence of first year depreciation for the purposes of simplicity) would be $7,000 leaving a book value of $63,000. If in the second year the taxpayer repays $10,000 of the limited recourse loan, then the book value is increased to $73,000 for depreciation purposes, giving a depreciation claim for that year of $7,300 and a book value of $65,700. Repayment of the balance of $20,000 in the third year would increase the book value to $85,700 for depreciation purposes, giving a depreciation claim for that year of $8,570 and an opening book value for the following year of $77,130.

Subsection (5) provides that where a limited recourse loan is applied towards the purchase of any asset which is used in the acquisition, production or marketing of any film, the cost of that asset for the purposes of calculating any investment allowance entitlement is reduced by the amount of the loan which was applied towards the purchase of that asset. It should be noted, however, that if any portion of that loan is subsequently repaid there is no provision to enable an increased deduction for investment allowance to be based on the adjusted cost price.

Subsection (6) deems any limited recourse loan to have been used in a particular manner, irrespective of the use to which the loan was actually put. The loan is deemed, for the purposes of this section, to have been used in the payment, in the following order, of

*   (a) Expenditure of a revenue nature (of the kind referred to in subsection (3)) towards which the limited recourse loan was intended to be applied, being expenditure which was incurred in a year preceding the income year under consideration and which has not been paid before the commencement of that income year.
*   (b) Expenditure of a capital nature (of the kind referred to in subsection (4)) towards which the limited recourse loan was intended to be applied, being expenditure which was incurred in a year preceding the income year under consideration and which has not been paid before the commencement of that income year.
*   (c) Any expenditure of a revenue nature of the kind referred to in subsection (3) which was incurred in the income year under consideration.
*   (d) Any expenditure of a capital nature of the kind referred to in subsection (4) which was incurred in the income year under consideration.

Subsection (7) sets out the provisions which apply where the whole or any part of a limited recourse loan is repaid. It provides that the repayment shall be matched against expenditure in the same order as that for which the limited recourse loan was deemed to have been used under subsection (6) and the repayments shall, as far as they extend, be regarded as expenditure, incurred in the year of repayment, of the type to which the provisions of that subsection were originally applied. The legislation provides that where a taxpayer repays the whole or any part of a limited recourse loan:

*   (a) The repayment shall firstly be deemed to be applied towards expenditure of the kind to which subsection 6(a) has been applied and shall be deemed to be expenditure of that type incurred in the income year of repayment.
*   (b) To the extent that the repayment exceeds the amount deemed to be expenditure of the kind to which paragraph (a) can be applied, it shall be deemed to be expenditure of the kind referred to in subsection (6)(b), incurred in the income year of repayment.
*   (c) To the extent that the repayment exceeds the aggregate of the amounts deemed to be expenditure of the kinds to which paragraphs (a) and (b) can be applied it shall be deemed to be expenditure of the kind referred to in subsection 6(c), incurred in the income year of repayment.
*   (d) To the extent that the repayment exceeds the aggregate of the amounts deemed to be expenditure of the kinds to which paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) can be applied, it shall be deemed to be expenditure of the kind referred to in subsection (6)(d), incurred in the income year of repayment.
*   (e) This paragraph provides that when the repayment of a loan is deemed to be expenditure incurred in the year of repayment under paragraph (a) and is less than the total amount available under that paragraph for such treatment on the repayment of the loan, the shortfall will, for future years, be the amount available under paragraph (a) for the next repayment to be applied against; and the same provisions shall apply in respect of paragraph (b) where the repayment, or the aggregate of repayments, exceeds the amount available under paragraph (a) but is less than the amount available under paragraph (b); and so on.

The provision to this subsection provides that where a repayment exceeds the amount which was available under any of paragraphs (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this subsection, no future repayment may be applied against the expenditure to which that paragraph referred.

Subsection (8) provides that where a limited recourse loan is used to repay an earlier limited recourse loan, that payment shall not be regarded as being a repayment for the purposes of subsection (7) of this section. Similarly, if a limited recourse loan could have been used to repay the original loan, but through any arrangement is not directly used as repayment but is used indirectly by making other funds available for repayment of the loan, that repayment will not be regarded as a repayment for the purposes of subsection (7).

Subsection (9) provides that any interest payable on a limited recourse loan is not allowable as a deduction until the year in which it is actually paid.

Subsection (10) provides that every reference in this section to an income year is deemed to be a reference to the taxpayer's equivalent accounting year.

### Section 16 - Depreciation Allowances, etc, on Motor Cars

The amendment which section 16 makes to section 110 of the principal Act affects only rental vehicles. Section 110 limits the "cost" of a motor vehicle for depreciation purposes to a maximum of $11,000. The section excludes from this limit certain vehicles, among which are rental vehicles. A "rental vehicle" is defined in subsection (1) essentially as a motor vehicle used solely or principally for hire to any person pursuant to a rental service licence. Excluded from this definition (and therefore implicitly subject to the "specified sum" restriction) is any motor vehicle hired under a lease or bailment that is for a period exceeding 3 months.

Section 16 inserts a new subsection (1A) which effectively alters the meaning of the definition of "rental vehicle". This new subsection provides that where a motor vehicle is leased (or bailed) to one person under 2 or more successive leases separated by a period of no more than one month:

*   those leases are deemed to be one lease covering the whole of the period of those leases; and
*   every motor vehicle leased under all of those leases is deemed to be one vehicle leased throughout the whole period of those successive leases.

The effect of this is that none of those vehicles will qualify for exclusion from the $11,000 "specified sum" restriction.

This amendment applies with respect to any motor vehicle acquired on or after the 16th of December (the date of assent to the Amendment Act).

**Example 1**

A motor vehicle is leased to Mr X under two leases:

*   Lease 1 - period 3-3.83 to 2.6.83
*   Lease 2 - period 1.7.83 to 30.9.83

As the leases involve the same lessee, are consecutive, and are separated by no more than one month:

*   (i) the leases are deemed to be one lease extending over the period 3.3.83 to 30.9.83, and
*   (ii) the motor vehicle is deemed to be a motor vehicle leased throughout that period of time.

Under the previous legislation, the motor vehicle would have been clanned as a "rental vehicle" (as the vehicle was not hired under a lease for a period in excess of 3 months) and therefore excluded from the provisions of section 110.

Under the amended legislation, the vehicle will not qualify as a "rental vehicle" (as, under subsection (1A) it was leased for a period exceeding 3 months) and therefore will still be subject to the $11,000 limitation.

**Example 2**

If, in Example 1, the first lease had been made in respect of car A and the second lease in respect of car B, both vehicles would be excluded from the definition of "rental vehicle" as:

*   (i) the leases are deemed to be one lease extending over the period 3 March 1983 to 30 September 1983 (as above), and
*   (ii) each vehicle is deemed to be a motor vehicle leased throughout that period of time.

### Section 17 - Packing Houses

This section omits from sections 112 and 116 of the principal Act the definition of the expression "export packing house" and substitutes the definition of the expression "packing house".

This machinery amendment is simply consequential upon a change in description made by the Meat Act 1981.

### Section 18

This section inserts a new section 114B to permit ordinary depreciation allowances to be claimed in respect of the cost of the assembly line conversion of a new business motor car to either compressed natural gas (CNG) or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). For the purposes of this section, the depreciable cost of the conversion will be limited to a maximum of:

*   (i) $1,200 for a one-cylinder CNG conversion.
*   (ii) $1,600 for a two-cylinder CNG conversion.
*   (iii) $1,400 for a conversion to LPG.

This provision will apply in respect of new business motor cars acquired during the income year that commenced on 1 April 1982 (or equivalent accounting year) and any subsequent income year.

As the equipment installed in a conversion constitutes part of the motor vehicle itself, the depreciation allowance is calculated at 20 percent DV. It is important to note that any expenditure eligible for this depreciation allowance is excluded from the amount that is subject to the "specified sum" limitation imposed by section 110 and depreciable under section 108.

### Section 19 - Regional Investment Allowance

### Section 20 - Export Investment Allowance

### Section 21 - Fishing Investment Allowance

These sections contain transitional provisions on the phasing out of the Regional, Export, and Fishing Investment Allowances due to expire on 31 March 1983.

Provision is made to allow these investment allowances in respect of qualifying expenditure incurred after 31 March 1983 provided certain conditions are met. These conditions are:

*   (a) The taxpayer must have entered into, on or before 5 August 1982, binding contract to purchase, or a binding agreement to lease, qualifying plant and machinery, **OR** the taxpayer must have taken, on or before 5 August 1982, "preliminary steps of a definite nature" for the purpose of entering into such a binding contract or agreement and that binding contract or agreement must be entered into on or before 31 March 1983.

**AND**

*   (b) The qualifying expenditure pursuant to that binding contract must be incurred within a reasonable time after 31 March 1983.

The types of "preliminary steps" required to have been taken by 5 August 1982 include:

*   Documented decisions by the Board of Directors or management to proceed with a project.
*   Near-completion of feasibility studies.
*   The calling of tenders for equipment from overseas or New Zealand suppliers.
*   Applications for financial assistance (including any approaches needed to be made to the Government).

The investment allowance will be allowable, as at present, in the year of first use of the qualifying plant or machinery, notwithstanding that this first use may be after the terminating date. It should be noted that where the "binding contract" requirements are fulfilled, the terminating date for the investment allowance concerned is the date the expenditure is incurred or the leasing commences (as appropriate).

### Section 22 - Development Expenditure for Scallop Farmers

This section amends section 128 of the principal Act to extend the development expenditure incentive deduction for fish farms to include corresponding expenditure incurred in developing scallop farms.

Any taxpayer engaged in the business of scallop farming in New Zealand will be able to deduct the following kinds of capital expenditure incurred in that business in any income year commencing on or after 1 April 1982 and ending on or before the terminating date, 31 March 1984 (see section 43):

*   (i) The acquisition, preparation, and mooring of floating structures for collecting spat; or
*   (ii) The acquisition, mooring and outfitting of long lines from which the collected spat is suspended for subsequent growth.

### Section 23 - Sale of Land, Fish Farms or Certain Assets Within 10 Years After Acquisition

This section provides that:

*   the period of farm or fish farm ownership necessary to avoid recovery of the development expenditure deduction has been extended from 5 to 10 years; and
*   interest deducted in respect of any land used in the production of income becomes assessable for income tax to the extent of the profit made on the sale of that land within 10 years of its acquisition.

A full commentary on the effect of these changes is set out in Appendix B of this publication.

### Section 24 - Apportionment of Hill-Country Topdressing Expenditure

Section 24 repeals section 132 of the principal Act.

The section allowed farmers of hill-country marginal land to apportion the deduction of topdressing expenditure over the year incurred and up to 4 subsequent years.

The repeal of section 132 will have no practical effect as all farmers will continue to be able to apportion the deduction of fertiliser expenditure under section 133.

### Section 25 - Gifts of Money by Companies to Universities, Approved Institutes and Individuals for Education or Research

The amendments which section 25 makes to section 146 of the principal Act stem from two factors.

First section 146 was found not to cater for the situation where donations were made by companies to research trusts or to Government Departments that undertake research.

The amendment remedies this situation by widening the scope of the section to encompass research trusts and Government Departments. In future, therefore, where the National Research Advisory Council or the Medical Research Advisory Council establishes the credentials of a research trust or a Government Department (in relation to its research activities) and recommends its approval for the purposes of section 146 there will be no technical obstacle to the Minister's approval of the body for section 146 purposes.

The second point which prompted amendment to section 146 was a doubt as to whether a gift qualifies under section 146 where it is made to an approved organisation on the understanding that the capital sum is not to be expended but preserved intact, and only the income resulting from its investment is to be spent on research. It has now been made clear that such "tied" gifts do qualify under section 146.

### Section 26 - Contributions to Employees' Superannuation Schemes

This section amends the provision relating to contributions by employers to employees' superannuation schemes (section 150 of the principal Act) to bring it into line with the Government Actuary's new classification of superannuation schemes.

A consolidated commentary on this and other amendments relating to superannuation schemes is contained in Appendix A of this publication.

### Sections 27 and 28 - Export Performance Incentives

These sections are best considered together as each relates to the Export Performance Incentive for Qualifying Goods. Section 28 amends section 156C of the principal Act to empower the Secretary of Trade and Industry to issue a supplement, to the Schedule of Export Goods, making changes in the rebate entitlement percentages specified in the Schedule.

Effectively, the Secretary is now empowered to reduce the rate of incentive available in respect of any goods or to exclude, from the incentive, goods exported to certain countries.

Section 27 amends section 156A of the principal Act to provide that any reduction, in the rebate entitlement percentages of any goods, made by the supplement will apply equally to any individually assigned percentages determined by the Development Finance Corporation in respect of the export goods of a particular exporter.

### Sections 29 and 31 - Export Suspensory Loans

Sections 29 and 31 make machinery amendments to the principal Act as a consequence of the Department of Trade and Industry introducing an Export Programme Suspensory Loan Scheme to replace the present Export Programme Grant Scheme (EPGS). The amendments ensure that the tax treatment of loans made under the new scheme is effectively the same as that for grants paid previously under the EPGS. Expenditure in respect of which the loan is made will not qualify for the Export Market Development Expenditure Incentive. The expenditure not met by the loan will be deductible in the normal way.

### Section 30 - Government Grants to Business

This section includes grants made by the New Zealand Film Commission within the provisions of section 169 of the principal Act.

### Section 32 - Loss Incurred in Specified Activities

This section inserts a new section 188A into the principal Act to provide that all losses, over and above $10,000 a year incurred by a taxpayer in any specified activity (as defined) are not available to be offset against income derived by the taxpayer from other activities or sources. The section also inserts a new section 188B being the section which contains the transitional provisions for payment of the income tax arising from the application of section 188A.

A full commentary on the effect of these new sections is contained in Appendix C to this publication.

### Section 33 - Allowable Deductions of Building Societies

At present Building Societies are exempted from tax on income other than of the kinds referred to in section 65(2)(g) of the principal Act, namely revenues from land.

Building societies are to be taxed as companies, commencing with the 1983/4 income year, and dividends paid on withdrawable shares are to be deductible in calculating their assessable income.

Section 33 provides for the deduction, in calculating assessable income, of the following outgoings peculiar to building societies which would in the normal course be non-deductible:

*   Dividends paid in respect of withdrawable shares (ie, fixed deposit accounts, passbook savings accounts, bonus balloting shares)
*   Interest and financial charges incurred in making interest-free loans; (ie, expenses not incurred in earning income)
*   Purchase of balloted loan rights

### Section 34 - Life Insurance and Reinsurance Companies

This section introduces a new basis of taxation for life insurance and life reinsurance companies. Features of the new regime are:

*   These companies will be taxed on net investment income, at the rate of 31 percent, instead of the present tax of 30 percent on allotted bonuses and dividends.
*   The investment income is to include profits derived and losses incurred on the sale of investments (to be ascertained in accordance with subsection (7)).
*   Premium income and costs incurred in deriving that income will not be taken into account.
*   The new basis first applies to the income year which commences on 1 April 1983.

Full details of this new basis of taxation are set out in Appendix D of this publication.

### Section 35 - Resident Mining Operators

This section amends the definition of "resident mining operator" in section 220 of the Tax Act, and inserts in that section a definition of "active miner". The amendment makes it more explicit that section 220 applies to only those taxpayers, be they companies or individuals, that are genuinely engaged in mining activities in the field. This clarification has been achieved by the inclusion of the words "personally and actively in the field" in the new definition of "active miner". Personal and active involvement has always been a criterion that the Commissioner has, pursuant to section 220, required to be fulfilled by a taxpayer seeking to qualify for the concessional tax treatment afforded under section 220. The amendment, therefore, will not affect the tax status of those taxpayers who currently qualify as "resident mining operators".

### Section 36 - Non-Resident Mining Operators

This section amends the definitions of "non-resident mining operator" and "mining venture" in section 221. The amendment achieves the same objective as for section 220 (see section 35 above), ie, making the application of the provisions of section 221 more explicit. As with the amendment contained in section 35, the qualifying criteria have not altered and, therefore, the tax status of any taxpayers that currently qualify as "non-resident mining operators" will not be affected.

### Section 37 - Specified Leases

This section provides that financial leases entered into on or after 6 August 1982 will be subject to the following provisions:

*   (a) Financial institutions and other lessors will no longer be able to treat financial leases in the same manner as short-term hire contracts for income tax purposes. Instead they will be required to account for their leasing transactions on the same basis as if they were loans.
*   (b) The lessor will be excluded from claiming depreciation on assets subject to financial leases.
*   (c) The lessee will be permitted to deduct an amount equivalent to depreciation for the leased asset.

The new provisions, which do not affect leases of land or buildings or short-term hire contracts, are fully explained in Appendix E of this publication.

### Section 38 - Film Owners

This section introduces three new sections to govern the taxation of film owners:

Section 224A sets out the basis on which the costs of producing or acquiring any film or any right in any film may be deducted against the assessable income of the film owner.

Section 224B makes it clear that all income from the sale, use, rental or other exploitation of any film or any right in any film is assessable income of the owner.

Section 224C requires the Commissioner to determine, for the purposes of section 106A and section 224A, whether a film commenced on or before 5 August 1982.

Full details of the effects of each of these sections are set out in Appendix F of this publication.

### Section 39 - Trustees of Non-Exempt Superannuation Schemes

This section amends section 225 of the principal Act, section 225 being the provision relating to non-exempt superannuation schemes. The amendments:

*   bring the section into line with the Government Actuary's new classification of superannuation schemes; and
*   provide that profits derived and losses incurred on the sale of investments are to be taken into account in calculating the assessable income of the trustees of such schemes.

A consolidated commentary on this and other amendments relating to superannuation schemes is contained in Appendix A of this publication.

### Section 40 - Bonus Issues

Section 40 repeals Part VI of the principal Act, which governs bonus issue tax. This repeal is, except as explained below, effective from and including bonus issues made on or after 1 April 1982. It is accordingly possible for a company to distribute by way of bonus issue made after 31 March 1982 its tax paid profits to shareholders without either the company or the shareholders attracting any tax, provided there is no subsequent return or reduction of capital within 10 years from the making of the bonus issue. (Refer to section 4.)

As a transitional measure, bonus issues made prior to 1 April 1982 will still be subject to the old legislation in Part VI. This includes the assessing of bonus issue tax of 17 1/2 cents in $1 on a "further" bonus issue where within 3 years of making a bonus issue (made before 1 April 1982) the company makes a distribution that in the opinion of the Commissioner is directly or indirectly a distribution of the amount capitalised by that bonus issue.

In practical terms, now that the empowering legislation has been passed, immediate steps will be taken to reasseas (to "Nil" tax payable) any bonus issue tax assessed on any bonus issue made on or after 1 April 1982, other than a "further" bonus issue referred to above.

Where the reassessment results in a credit of bonus issue tax paid, this amount will in the first instance be credited to the company's income tax account. Alternatively, where there are no income tax arrears, at the taxpayer's written request a refund up to the amount of the credit will be made.

The following points should be noted:

*   (a) If bonus issue tax has been assessed but not paid
    *   The reassessment will cancel this debit and no further action will be taken.

*   (b) Bonus Issue tax paid but the company has income tax arrears
    *   The bonus issue tax paid will first be credited against any arrears of income tax. Where the bonus issue tax paid exceeds the arrears then the excess will, at the taxpayer's written request, be refunded.

### Section 41 - Keeping of Business Records

This section substitutes a rewritten section 428 in the principal Act.

The old section 428 which has been repealed has remained virtually unchanged since 1948. Since then there have been significant changes in the commercial world in relation to the medium in which business records are maintained, in particular with the use of computers and the change in emphasis on certain aspects of business documentation, eg, the issuing of receipts.

The new section follows substantially the record retention requirements contained in section 151 of the Companies Act as amended in 1980 and applies to all taxpayers both company and non-company.

The main points of the new section are:

*   The definition of records has been expanded to include books of account contained in manual - handwritten; mechanical punch cards; and electronic - magnetic tape, disc, etc, format.
*   The types of record required to be kept have been spelled out. They are:
    *   record of assets and liabilities in relation to the business.
    *   record of cash receipts and payments, ie, till tapes, receipt books, cash and payment books, etc.
    *   record of goods purchased and sold together with identification of buyers and sellers (or agents). It will not affect such people as wholesalers who sell direct to members of the public, ie, cash wholesale sales made in exactly the same way as cash retail sales. Only wholesale sales made to other retailers will need to be recorded in detail.
    *   statements of year-end trading stock, and the stocktaking records from which those statements are compiled.
    *   record of services performed and the associated invoices.
    *   record and explanations of the accounting system. This is especially essential for large companies with computer based accounting systems.

The section will apply to every person in business in New Zealand, every person who carries on (otherwise than as an employee) any other activity for the purpose of gaining or producing assessable income, and every person who makes, holds, or disposes of an investment for the purpose of gaining or producing assessable income. This will include salary and wage earners who have investments. They will now be required to keep such records as their savings passbooks and certificates, and dividend advice notices.

As in the case of the old section 428 the records must be sufficient to enable verification of assessable income and deductions, and they must be:

*   in English; and
*   held in New Zealand; and
*   held for 10 years from the end of the year to which they relate. It should be noted that this extension does NOT apply to section 352 which covers the retention of PAYE records.

### Section 42 - Basic Rates of Income Tax

This section sets out the new rates of income tax payable by:

*   (a) Life insurance companies - 31 cents for each dollar of taxable income. (Please see Note 1.)
*   (b) Trustees of superannuation Category 2 schemes - 31 cents for each dollar of taxable income. (Please see Note 2.)
*   (c) Trustees of superannuation Category 3 schemes - 45 cents for each dollar of taxable income. (Please see Note 2.)

**Note 1:** Details of the new basis of calculating the taxable income of life insurance companies is contained in Appendix D of this publication.

**Note 2:** Details of the new basis of calculating the taxable income of superannuation funds is contained in Appendix A to this publication.

### Section 43 - Terminating Dates of Taxation Incentives

Section 43 substitutes a new Third Schedule to the principal Act which sets out the terminating dates for various tax incentives and allowances.

The terminating dates which have been extended are:

| Incentive | Section of Tax Act | Extended Terminating Date |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Investment Allowance** |     |     |
| Industrial development plan | 121 | 31 March 1986 |
| High priority activity | 121A | 31 March 1984 |
| Farming and agriculture | 122 | 31 March 1984 |
| **Development Expenditure** |     |     |
| Farming and agricultural land | 127 | 31 March 1984 |
| Rock oyster, mussel, scallop and freshwater fish farms | 128 | 31 March 1984 |

For incentives other than the above, the terminating dates remain the same as they were in the Third Schedule to the Income Tax Act, as amended last year.

### Section 3 - Categories of Superannuation Schemes

This section, which is effective from the income year commencing 1 April 1983, repeals the definition of "superannuation fund" in section 2 of the principal Act and substitutes three new definitions. This amendment was necessary because of the removal of the exempt income status of certain superannuation schemes. In terms of the two 1982 Superannuation Schemes Amendment Acts, the Government Actuary, in addition to his statutory function of approving superannuation schemes, is now required to classify each approved scheme into one of nine classifications. The new definitions incorporate these classifications. The trustees of all existing approved superannuation schemes have to apply to the Government Actuary for classification by 31 March 1983. It should be noted that the Government Actuary is not permitted to approve any more "one-man superannuation schemes" and in addition he is required to withdraw all existing approvals for such schemes.

The new classifications have been incorporated into the following sections of the principal Act:

*   Section 59 - Special exemption for life insurance premiums and superannuation contributions.
*   Section 61(21) Tax exempt status for certain superannuation schemes.
*   Section 150 - Deduction for employers' contributions to employees' superannuation schemes.
*   Section 226 - Taxation of non-exempt superannuation schemes.
*   First Schedule - New clauses 9A and 9B.

**Summary of new categories of superannuation schemes**

*   (a) Superannuation Category 1 Scheme
    *   This category comprises:
        *   (i) The three classes of approved pension superannuation schemes. Included are "deemed pension funds" which were or are in the process of converting from lump sum funds to pension funds in terms of section 150.
        *   (ii) The three classes of approved lump sum superannuation schemes' class A funds. Basically a class A fund of a lump sum superannuation scheme is made up of earnings and contributions at 5 August 1982 of members who were in the lump sum scheme on that date increased by contributions since 5 August 1982 from those members (at the same dollar level of contributions at 5 August 1982) together with the earnings of the fund since that date. This basis follows the criteria for "deemed pension funds" as set out in PIB No 92.
        *   (iii) The Government Superannuation Fund.
            *   The income derived by the trustees of a Category 1 scheme is exempt from tax in terms of the revised section 61(21) of the principal Act.

*   (b) Superannuation Category 2 Schemes
    *   This category comprises the three classes of approved lump sum superannuation schemes' Class B funds. The composition of a Class B fund is:
        *   Contributions of members who join after 5 August 1982.
        *   Increases in the level of contributions of members who were in the fund at 5 August 1982.
        *   Earnings of the Fund (ie, earnings on the above).
        *   Any superannuation scheme which has been previously approved by the Government Actuary and in respect of which the trustee has not applied for one of the new classifications will fall into this category. The income derived by the trustee of a Category 2 scheme is taxable at the rate of 31 cents in the dollar.

*   (c) Superannuation Category 3 Schemes
    *   Included in this category are all superannuation schemes which have not been approved by the Government Actuary or which have had their approvals withdrawn (such as "one-man superannuation schemes"). The income derived by the trustee of a Category 3 scheme is taxed at 45 cents in the dollar.

### Section 9(2) - Income derived by trustees of superannuation Category 1 schemes exempt

This subsection, effective from the income year commencing 1 April 1983, amends subsection (21) of section 61 of the principal Act by limiting the exempt status in respect of superannuation schemes to Category 1 schemes only.

### Section 26 - Contributions to employees' Superannuation Schemes

The section amends section 150 of the principal Act with effect from the income year commencing 1 April 1983.

Prior to the amendment the deduction allowed to an employer for contributions to an employee lump sum superannuation scheme was limited a maximum of $700 per employee, whereas the maximum deduction for employees' pension schemes was 10 percent of the earnings of the employees. The amendment removes this anomaly by allowing employers the same maximum deduction for contributions to all approved superannuation schemes, namely, 10 percent of the amount of the gross earnings paid to all employees who are members of the scheme. It should be noted that the Commissioner's discretion provided for by section 150(5)(a) has been retained. This provides that the 10 percent maximum deduction may be increased in certain circumstances.

The amendment also incorporates the new superannuation schemes classification into the provisions of section 150.

### Section 39 - Taxation of income derived by non-exempt Superannuation Schemes

This section repeals section 225 of the principal Act and substitutes a new tax regime for non-exempt superannuation schemes. The former section 225 provided the basis for taxing the income derived by the trustees of non-approved superannuation schemes referred to in the section as non-exempt superannuation schemes. In addition to non-approved superannuation schemes (now referred to in the Act as Category 3 schemes), the new section 225 incorporates superannuation Category 2 schemes into non-exempt superannuation schemes. As explained in paragraph (b) of the notes on section 3, Category 2 schemes comprise approved lump sum superannuation schemes' Class B funds.

The new section limits the assessable income to the net investment income derived by the trustees of non-exempt superannuation schemes. Included in investment income are profits/losses on sale of investments. These are calculated as follows:

1.  In respect of investments acquired after the commencement of the 1 April 1983 income year - the difference between the cost price of the investment asset and its selling price.
2.  In respect of investments acquired prior to the commencement of the 1 April 1983 income year - the difference between the market value of the investment asset on the above mentioned date and its selling price.

Contributions received from members and benefits paid to members are not taken into account in calculating trustees' assessable income. Likewise as contribution income is not taxable, no deduction is allowed for marketing type expenditure incurred in attracting new members to institutional type schemes such as MFL or SIL schemes.

It should be noted that dividends derived by a trustee which is a company do not qualify for the dividend exemption provided by section 63 of the principal Act as such a trustee is deemed not to be a company for the purposes of the Tax Act. Finally as life insurance companies are assessable in terms of the new section 204 of the principal Act in respect of the investment income derived from the premiums of all policies including superannuation policies the income generated by these last mentioned policies is deemed not to be income derived by the trustee of the non-exempt superannuation scheme.

### Section 23 - Recovery of Deductions Allowed for Interest and Farm Development Expenditure Where Property Sold Within 10 Years of Purchase

**Introduction**

Section 23 repeals with effect from 1 April 1983 the existing section 129 of the principal Act and substitutes a new section 129.

The new section 129 gives effect to the two Budget proposals relating to sales of property within 10 years of purchase.

*   The first was the proposal to extend from the present 5 to 10 years the period of farm or fish farm ownership necessary to prevent deductions allowed for farm development expenditure being treated as assessable income on the sale of the property. (The "5 year ownership rule" is contained in section 129 which is being repealed.)
*   The second was a totally new provision under which interest deducted in respect of property used in the production of assessable income will be recovered on the sale of that property at a profit within 10 years of purchase, in the same way as farm development expenditure.

Because many of the features of these two proposals were the same they have both been incorporated in the one section, the new section 129.

**Application Date (Section 23(2) of the Amendment Act)**

The new recovery provisions will apply to sales of property made on or after 1 April 1983. This differs from the Budget announcement which proposed that the provisions would apply to sales made after Budget night. However, although sales made before 1 April will not be subject to the new "10 year ownership rule" for interest and farm development expenditure recovery, sales of farms (including fish farms) may come within the present 5 year ownership rule applying to deductions for farm development expenditure only.

**Date of Sale (and Purchase)**

This date is relevant in determining both whether a sale is one which has occurred on or after 1 April 1983 (and accordingly must be considered under the new recovery provisions as opposed to the old 5 year farm development expenditure rule), and the period of ownership of a property.

The date of sale or disposition of a property (and the date of purchase or acquisition by the purchaser) is the date of execution of a specifically enforceable agreement for sale and purchase. A contract becomes enforceable when the agreement for sale and purchase becomes unconditional or absolute according to its terms.

The date of disposition is not the date of the memorandum of transfer, the date of settlement or the date of possession, nor (unless the agreement for sale and purchase is unconditional) is it the date of that agreement:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| eg  | Agreement for Sale and Purchase - dated | 13.3.83 |
|     | (the Agreement is conditional on finance being arranged) |     |
|     | Finance confirmed | 4.4.83 |
|     | Memorandum of Transfer - dated | 18.4.83 |
|     | Settlement on | 21.4.83 |
|     | Possession on | 5.5.83 |

The date of sale in this transaction is the date the finance was confirmed - 4 April 1983 (on that date the agreement became unconditional), and the sale is one which would fall to be considered under the 10 year rule.

**The New Section 129**

Before analysing the legislation in detail a brief description of each subsection of the new section follows:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| subsection (1) | contains definitions of various terms and expressions used in this legislation. |
| subsection (2) | the operative subsection - recovers the deductions where land sold within 10 years. |
| subsection (3) | liability where depreciable assets sold within 10 years. |
| subsection (4) | spread of recovered amounts over year of sale and up to 4 previous years. |
| subsection (5) | relief for farmers on first sale of a farm caught by the 10 year rule. |
| subsection (6) | notice of election to spread recovered amounts under subsection (4) |
| subsection (7) | power to determine purchase and sale prices. |
| subsection (8) | recovery provisions can apply to part only of land being sold. |
| subsection (9) | exemption for certain sales and dispositions. |
| subsection (10) | anti-avoidance provision. |

It is important to remember that the new section applies not only to sales of farm properties but also to sales of business and rental properties.

**Subsection (1) - Definitions**

Subsection (1) contains the definitions of five terms. These are outlined below:

"Deduction for interest" specifies the interest which is subject to recovery under the 10 year rule on the sale of a property. It includes interest on money borrowed for the purposes of:

*   the initial purchase of the "land" in question including any buildings or other improvements thereon (less any proportion of the interest on borrowings allocated to chattels);
*   the erection of any buildings or other capital improvements attaching to the property;
*   the financing of expenditure spent on development on, or in relation to, the property. Such expenditure, even if for example it is deductible under section 127 or 128 as farm development expenditure, would be expenditure incurred in effecting improvements of a capital nature to the land;
*   the repayment of any of the above borrowings and any subsequent refinancing of such refinanced loans or mortgages.

Although in many instances the borrowings for the above purposes will have been secured by a mortgage or loan over the property (the sale of which is caught by the 10 year rule) it is not necessary for this to be the case for the interest deduction to be recoverable. Any interest on borrowings used for the above purposes comes within the definition.

The recovery provisions do not apply to interest on money borrowed for:

*   the purchase of livestock or other trading stock;
*   the financing of the day to day running of a business either as loans for working capital or overdraft arrangements not specifically related to the purchase of land or effecting improvements to the land;
*   the purchase of any assets not attaching to the land, eg, furniture in rental accommodation, farm machinery, vehicles, etc.

**_"Disposal"_** - This definition is self-explanatory and merely ensures that assignments, etc, of leases and licences relating to marine fish farms or farming areas come within the meaning of disposal as used in the section.

**_"Economic farm property"_** - This term is used in relation to the relief provision contained in subsection (5) which provided relief for farmers on the first sale of a farm caught by the 10 year rule. This relief is subject to the farmer buying a replacement "economic farm property" within 12 months and holding it until the balance of the 10 year period from date of purchase of the previous farm has expired.

A more detailed explanation of the term is contained in the commentary on subsection (5).

**_"Land"_** - This definition is the same as that used in the new section 188A (inserted by section 32 of the Amendment Act). Land includes any estate or interest in land and any option to acquire such estate or interest, but does not include a mortgage.

A legal estate or interest in land is that proprietary interest which has been acquired with all the formalities required by common law or by statute law for conferring perfect ownership. An equitable interest is one under which there is no legal estate or interest vested in the person having the interest but he may, for example, have entered into a binding contract to purchase the property.

**_Corporeal property_** is something tangible as opposed to incorporeal property, which is the opposite. As applied to land, actual possession of it would be corporeal but an undivided interest, or a right as a remainderman in an estate, or a right to take timber from land would be incorporeal.

**_A freehold interest in land_** is that interest which gives the owner the largest rights of use and enjoyment allowed by the law together with the fullest power of alienation. A chattel interest in land is most commonly represented by a leasehold interest.

**_Land_** also includes any interest under a lease or licence of a leased or licenced area within the meaning of the Marine Farming Act 1971. Accordingly, any sale or other "disposal" of such an interest will be subject to the 10 year rule. All commercial marine farmers must obtain a lease or licence under that Act to operate a marine farm.

Freshwater fish farms which are operated on properties owned or leased by the farmer are covered by the general description of land outlined above.

**_"Lease improvements"_** - This term is self-explanatory and simply refers to the improvements made in relation to a leased or licensed area where a marine farm is situated or being established.

**Subsection (2) - Recovery of Deductions**

Subsection (2) is the operative subsection of the new section and recovers the deductions previously allowed for interest and farm development expenditure. The subsection is in an expanded format of the old section 129(1) and is made up of a series of steps or tests which are used in determining whether and to what extent the recovery measures apply. Before discussing in detail the provisions of subsection (2), it may help to briefly outline these steps.

Subsection (2) provides that where -

(a) land is sold within 10 years; and

(b) a deduction has been allowed for -

*   farm development expenditure and/or
*   interest; and

either -

(c) the sale price of the land (where sold without improvements) exceeds the purchase price; or alternatively

(d) the sale price of the land and improvements exceeds the purchase price plus cost of non-deductible improvements made since purchase, -

that profit, or excess as it is called, is assessable as income in the year of sale up to the extent of the total deductions allowed for -

(e) farm development expenditure; and

(f) interest, -

since the acquisition of the land.

The following simple examples illustrate how the excess is calculated.

**Example 1**

|     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Farm property sold in June 1983 for |     |     |     | $800,000 |     |
| Less | Purchase price (property purchased July 1977) |     | $350,000 |     |     |
|     | Cost of improvements not allowed as a deduction (new hayshed) |     | $31,000 | $381,000 |     |
|     |     | Profit (Excess) |     | $419,000 | A   |
| Deductions allowed in respect of the property since purchase: |     |     |     |     |     |
|     | Farm development expenditure |     | $90,000 |     |     |
|     | Interest |     | $120,000 | $210,000 | B   |

The amount recoverable is the lesser of A or B. In this example the total deductions allowed for interest and farm development expenditure (B) are recoverable on the sale of the property.

**Example 2**

|     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Urban rental property sold in August 1983 for |     |     |     | $70,000 |     |
| Less | Purchase price (property purchased 1978) |     | $40,000 |     |     |
|     | Non-deductible improvements made |     | Nil | $40,000 |     |
|     |     | Excess |     | $30,000 | A   |
| Deductions allowed in respect of property since purchase |     |     |     |     |     |
|     | Farm development expenditure |     | Nil |     |     |
|     | Interest |     | $31,500 | $31,500 | B   |

In this example the amount recoverable is limited to the excess arising on the sale of property (A).

The details of the steps used in determining the application of the recovery provisions are now outlined:

**Paragraph (a) - Land sold within 10 years**

This paragraph applies to any land (as defined) sold or otherwise disposed of by a taxpayer within 10 years of his acquisition of that land.

The definition of land has already been discussed in relation to subsection (1). As specified not only sales, but any other form of disposition of land by a taxpayer is included.

Disposed of has a wide meaning and would include most changes in ownership of "land". It would include for example, the assignment of a lease or licence under the Marine Farming Act (whether or not marine farming has commenced), the gifting or exchange of land, or the passing of land pursuant to a will (see exemption in subsection 9(b)).

Acquisition has the opposite meaning to disposition.

The meaning of the terms "date of sale" and "date of purchase" has already been outlined in some depth in relation to the application date of the new provisions. In general the date of acquisition in any transaction is the date of the coming into existence of an enforceable contract relating to the obtaining of the land (or interest therein).

The land may be sold with or without the improvements thereon. However, a separate sale of the land improvements whether by a lessee to a lessor on expiry of a lease, by a lessee to a third party, or otherwise by any taxpayer will be treated as a sale or disposal of an interest in land to which the recovery of deductions may apply.

There will be cases where a taxpayer has been leasing land (eg, farm land leased from the Crown under a long term renewable lease) for some time and then freeholds it. The date of acquisition for the purposes of the 10 year rule in such a case would be the date the taxpayer acquired a leasehold interest in the land rather than the date of acquisition of the freehold interest.

In a situation where for example two partners, each owning a one-third interest in partnership land, buy out the third partner's interest between them (ie a further one-sixth interest each) the date of acquisition of their original one-third interests would not be affected by the fact that the transaction may involve a transfer of the total land from the three partners to the remaining two. The newly acquired one-sixth interests would of course have a separate acquisition date, the date of the transaction referred to.

**Paragraph (b) - Deduction allowed for Certain Expenditure**

This paragraph requires that the taxpayer and/or an associated person has been allowed a deduction for farm development expenditure and/or interest in relation to the land referred to in paragraph (a).

The deductions subject to recovery include not only those allowed to the taxpayer disposing of the land but also deductions allowed to any associated person/s of that taxpayer since the acquisition of the land by the taxpayer. The associated person provision exists to ensure the recovery of deductions for farm development expenditure and interest allowed to a person associated with the taxpayer selling the land, in situations where the taxpayer has leased the land to the associated person.

This associated persons provision follows that added to the old section 129(1) in 1980, and would, for example, apply where land sold by a company had formerly been leased to a partnership (the partners in which are the shareholders in the company) and the partnership had received a deduction for farm development expenditure or interest.

The definition of associated person for the purposes of this section is the standard one contained in section 8 of the principal Act.

**Deduction for Farm Development Expenditure (sub-paragraph iv)**

The farm development expenditure deductions are referred to in paragraph (b)(iv) as deductions which, if it were not for sections 126, 127 and 128 of the principal Act, would not have been allowed. Briefly, section 127 relates to development expenditure incurred on farm or agricultural land and section 128 applies to development expenditure incurred by certain fish farmers (section 126 is effectively redundant as all expenditure formerly allowable under that section is now claimable only under section 127). Sections 127 and 128 specify in some detail the classes of expenditure which are deductible as development expenditure.

**Deduction for Interest (sub-paragraph v)**

The deduction for interest is a defined term and the explanation of this is contained in subsection (1).

**Expenditure Relates to Land Disposed of**

The deductions recoverable are those which have been allowed in respect of expenditure relating to the land disposed of. Where part only of a taxpayer's land has been disposed of, it will be necessary to establish the expenditure which has been incurred in relation to that part.

**Paragraph (c) - Land Disposed of Without Improvements**

This paragraph, which is an alternative to paragraph (d), refers to cases where the "land" is disposed of without its improvements for in excess of its purchase price.

It is thought unlikely that there will be many sales of land without the improvements thereon although they may arise where a fish farm lease or licence is sold or assigned with the removable fish farm improvements being bought by a separate purchaser.

To arrive at the actual excess of the sale price over the purchase price (profit) the purchase price is increased by non-deductible costs incurred in making the purchase. Similarly, the sale price is reduced by the non-deductible costs incurred in making the sale.

**Paragraph (d) - Land Disposed of With Improvements**

This paragraph refers to all sales of land with any improvements thereon where the value of the consideration received for the sale exceeds the total of the purchase price and the cost of any non-deductible improvements made since acquisition of the land.

The value of the consideration received for the sale and the original purchase price will in most instances be readily identifiable, although in cases where the land was either purchased or has been sold together with other land not caught by the recovery measures, apportionment will be required. See subsection (7) which gives the Commissioner power to determine purchase and sale prices.

As mentioned in paragraph (c) above, non-deductible costs incurred on purchase and sale, eg, stamp duty, legal fees, etc, are to be taken into account in determining the excess or profit arising on disposal of the land.

In arriving at the excess, the cost of certain improvements which have been made to the land by the taxpayer (and/or any associated person) since he acquired the property, are added to the purchase price. The improvements referred to are those for which no deduction (other than by way of depreciation or investment allowance) has been allowed for tax purposes, eg, buildings or extensions thereto. The associated persons test, as with paragraph (b), is to cover situations where the land has been leased by the taxpayer to an associated person who has effected improvements to the land.

**Excess Deemed Assessable Income**

The excess determined in accordance with paragraph (c) or paragraph (d) above is deemed, subject to the spread-back provisions contained in subsection (4) (see separate comments on that subsection), to be assessable income of the taxpayer in the year in which the land is sold or otherwise disposed of, up to the amount of the total deductions allowed (to the taxpayer and associated person) in respect of that land since acquisition, for:

*   farm development expenditure (paragraph (e)); and
*   interest (paragraph (f)).

In other words the amount recoverable which is deemed to be assessable income under the 10 year rule is limited to the lesser of:

*   the combined deductions allowed for interest and farm development expenditure; and
*   the excess or profit arising on the sale or other disposition.

**Paragraph (e) - Farm Development Expenditure**

This paragraph simply refers to the deductions for farm development expenditure which are recoverable, ie, deductions which have been allowed under sections 126, 127 or 128 since acquisition of the land.

To assist with the administration of section 129 a new form (an IR129) is being designed which should be completed and attached to returns by taxpayers who are subject to the recovery measures. The form will provide for the entering of full details of the land sold together with details of deductions obtained for farm development expenditure and interest in respect of the property.

**Paragraph (f) - Deduction for Interest**

This paragraph simply refers to the recoverable interest deductions as the "deduction for interest". Deduction for interest is a defined term and has been explained in detail in subsection (1).

The new IR129 referred to in paragraph (e) above will assist in providing details of the interest deductions on which to base a calculation of the amount recoverable.

**Subsection (3) - Depreciable Assets Sold Within 10 Years**

This subsection provides that where a taxpayer has been allowed a deduction under section 127 or section 128 for the cost of an asset, for which a deduction by way of depreciation would otherwise have been allowable, and the asset is sold or otherwise disposed of within 10 years of the acquisition of that asset, the amount received (up to the amount of the original cost) is deemed to be assessable income in the year of sale.

This subsection is identical to the old section 129(3) except that the ownership period has been increased from 5 to 10 years., It is important to remember that the 10 year period runs from the date of acquisition of the asset concerned and not from the date of purchase of the land in relation to which the asset is used.

Examples of assets to which this subsection applies are certain irrigation plant used by farmers, and pontoons, rafts and buoys used by mussel farmers.

**Subsection (4) - Spread-Back of Recovered Deductions**

This subsection allows taxpayers who come within the provisions of this section to elect to have the amounts deemed to be assessable under subsections (2) (sale of land) and (3) (sale of depreciable assets) spread between the year of sale or other disposition and any of the 4 immediately preceding years.

The spread-back can be made only to income years throughout the whole of which, the land or asset concerned was owned by the taxpayer. It is not a requirement however that the taxpayer must have received deductions (for the recovered amounts) in the years of spread.

**Example**

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Land purchased | 1 July 1980 |
| Land sold | 30 June 1984 |

Taxpayer has 31 March balance date.

A spread may be made involving the following income years -

1985 (Year of sale) 1984, 1983, 1982

Spread to 1981 is not permitted as the land was not owned for the full 1981 income year.

The recovered amounts are spread to give the taxpayer the maximum benefit (ie, to attract the least tax) and this may mean that the entire amount may be allocated to a single year. The spread is calculated in the same way as for section 93(3) spread-backs of excess income on the sale of livestock.

The election by a taxpayer to spread the recovered amounts must be made by written notice (see notes on subsection (6)).

**Subsection (5) - Relief for Farmers on First Sale within 10 Years**

This subsection allows relief from the recovery provisions for farmers (including stepping stone farmers) in respect of the first sale of a farm caught by the 10 year ownership rule, subject to certain conditions.

Briefly, subsection (5) provides that the first sale of a farm by each farmer which is caught by the 10 year ownership rule, will not be subject to recovery of farm development expenditure and interest deductions provided the taxpayer acquires a replacement economic farm within 12 months of that sale, and does not sell the replacement farm within 10 years of the date on which he purchased the first property.

The main features of the relief measure are as follows:

*   (a) The land or interest in land which is sold must have been used by the taxpayer (or the taxpayer and another person) primarily and principally in the carrying on of a farming, agricultural, horticultural, viticultural or aquacultural business. The sale of farm land leased by the taxpayer to another person, who was conducting the farming business, will not therefore qualify for relief.
*   (b) The sale of land involved must be the first sale by the taxpayer to which the new recovery measures apply. The relief is available to farming companies provided they meet the conditions imposed. Although it is not necessary for this first sale to be of the taxpayer's first farm (the relief is not affected by the number of previous farms owned), a taxpayer cannot save up this "once only relief" for the second or any other subsequent sale which might be subject to the new section 129. The relief applies only to the first sale which is caught under the 10 year rule.
*   (c) The taxpayer must acquire a replacement "economic farm property" within the period of 12 months commencing from the date of sale of the land. The taxpayer may apply to have this 12 month period commence on an earlier date than the date of sale of the first farm. This is to provide for situations where the taxpayer may acquire the replacement farm before the sale of the first farm is completed.Economic farm property is a defined term and it is discussed in greater detail below.
*   (d) The replacement economic farm property must be used by the taxpayer (or the taxpayer and another person) primarily and principally in the carrying on of a farming, agricultural, horticultural, viticultural or aquacultural business. Accordingly the replacement property can not be leased to another person who will conduct the farming business. It is not necessary for the type of "farming" activity conducted on the new property to be the same as that conducted on the land which has been sold.

**Economic Farm Property**

"Economic farm property" means any land (which includes any interest in land) which is of such an area and nature that it is capable of being worked by the taxpayer as an economic unit as a farming, agricultural, horticultural, viticultural or aquacultural business. Authority is given for the Commissioner to consult, for example the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries or the Rural Bank in determining whether any replacement property is a viable economic unit.

Regard will be had, in deciding whether a replacement property qualifies as an economic farm, to the following interrelated factors:

*   The size of the farm property, or interest in land, acquired by the taxpayer.
*   The nature of the property, ie, location, soil type, climate, extent of development on the property, etc.
*   The type of activity the taxpayer intends conducting and does in fact conduct on the property.
*   The capability of the property to return a livelihood to the farmer. The property need not provide the taxpayer's current or intended livelihood although it should have the potential to provide a living.

It is also not necessary for the replacement unit to be a fully paying proposition at the time of the acquisition but it must be capable, having regard to the activity the taxpayer conducts on the property, of being worked as an economic farm by the taxpayer in the future.

A reasonable approach will be adopted in interpreting the definition of economic farm property and the Department will have regard to the subsection's stated aim of providing relief for the genuine stepping stone farmer seeking to "step up" to a larger or better farm, albeit that this replacement unit may be only marginally economic.

**Contingent Tax Liability**

In spite of the relief provision, the tax payable in respect of recovered deductions on this first farm sale will still be calculated as though no relief applies. (Where elected by the farmer this calculation will also include the subsection (4) spread back.) This calculation of the tax payable is made even though the farmer may have already qualified for subsection (5) relief (by meeting the requirements in paragraphs (a) to (d) above) or intends to qualify for it.

The tax payable in respect of the first farm sale (as so calculated) becomes a contingent liability and will not be payable unless and until the replacement economic farm property is sold or otherwise disposed of by the farmer within the period of 10 years from the date he acquired the first farm. Accordingly, if the farmer sells the replacement unit within 10 years from the date of acquisition of the previous farm, the tax liability arising from that previous sale becomes payable immediately and an assessment and statement of account for the tax (which has already been calculated) will be issued.

The proviso to subsection (5) provides that where the replacement economic farm is sold, and that sale is itself exempted from the 10 year rule by subsections (9)(a), (b), (c), (d) or (e) of section 129, that sale (no matter when made) is deemed for the purposes of the subsection (5) relief not to have been made within 10 years of the acquisition of the previous farm. As an example, where a sale of a replacement farm within 10 years of purchase of the previous farm results from the farmer's death, that sale is deemed not to have been made within that 10 year period and accordingly, will not cause the contingent tax liability to become payable.

It must be remembered that subsection (5) provides relief from recovery of deductions only in respect of the first farm sale caught by the 10 year rule. Where the replacement economic farm is sold within 10 years of its purchase (even if more than 10 years after the date of acquisition of the previous farm) deductions allowed for farm development expenditure and interest incurred in relation to that replacement farm, will be subject to recovery without relief.

The following example illustrates the period of replacement farm ownership required for subsection (5) relief purposes:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Farm "A" sold on | 30.6.83 |
| Farm "A" purchased on | 1.7.79 |
| Replacement "Economic farm property" Farm "B" purchased on | 1.10.83 |
| Farm "B" must be retained until to prevent tax on recovered deductions from Farm "A" becoming payable | 1.7.89 |
| Farm "B" must be retained until to prevent recovery of deductions allowed in relation to it. | 1.10.93 |

**Subsection (6) - Notice of Election to Spread Recovered Amounts**

Subsection (6) provides that notices of election for the purpose of the spread back of the recovered amounts (subsection 4) must be in writing and be given within the time within which the taxpayer is required to furnish his return for the year of sale of the land or asset. There is discretion for this time limit for the making of elections to be extended and a reasonable approach should be adopted in this area.

It is intended that the new form (an IR129) will enable taxpayers to provide details of sales caught by the 10 year rule. This form, which should be attached to the Annual tax return, will also provide for the taxpayer to make the election for the spread back.

**Subsection (7) - Determination of Purchase and Sale Prices**

This subsection gives the Commissioner power to determine the purchase or acquisition price, or the value of the consideration for the sale or other disposition of the land, in such manner as he thinks fit. It also allows the Commissioner to apportion the purchase price, or the value of the consideration for the disposal, between the land and any other property in situations where the piece of land caught by the 10 year rule was acquired, or disposed of, together with other real or personal property.

In such cases the Department will need to be satisfied that the acquisition or disposal prices attributed to the piece of land, in respect of which the deductions are being recovered, are not being inflated (in the case of the acquisition price) or understated (in the case of the disposal price) to reduce the excess on sale.

**Subsection (8) - Recovery Apply to Part Only of Land Being Sold**

This subsection is self-explanatory and simply ensures that the recovery measures apply where the land which is subject to the recovery is sold together with other land which is not caught by the 10 year rule.

**Subsection (9) - Exemptions**

Subsection (9) sets out certain specific exemptions from the new interest and farm development expenditure deduction recovery provisions. There were no such specific exemptions from the old 5 year ownership rule.

The subsection provides that the 10 year ownership rule does not apply to sales or other dispositions of any land or assets in the following circumstances:

*   (a) Compulsory Acquisition
    *   Paragraph (a) exempts land compulsorily acquired by the Crown or any public or local authority. This exemption extends to apply where land is sold to the Crown, local or public authority in circumstances in which, if the sale had not been made, the land would have been compulsorily acquired by the purchaser. For this extended part of the exemption to apply, the alternative of compulsory acquisition must have been a certainty at the time of sale and not merely a possibility.
*   (b) Death of Taxpayer
    *   Paragraph (b) exempts sales or other dispositions of land or assets made by a trustee following the death of the taxpayer. The exemption applies only to land and assets owned by the taxpayer at his death. This exemption does not extend, for example, to sales of land by other partners in a partnership where one partner has died.
*   (c) Forced Sale by Spouse of Deceased - Joint Property
    *   This paragraph exempts certain sales of property by the widow or widower of a person to whom paragraph (a) above has applied. This exemption applies where the property sold was (at the date of death of that person) used by the deceased and the widow/widower in the carrying on of a business, and the sale has been compelled by circumstances arising from the death.
    *   This exemption would apply for example where a young married couple with pre-school children run a farm in partnership and the husband dies. The widow is forced to sell the farm because she is unable to look after the children and run the farm herself. The paragraph (c) exemption would exempt the sale of the farm by the widow in these circumstances. The sale of the deceased husband's share would, if made by his trustee, be exempted under paragraph (b).
*   (d) Forced Sale by Spouse of Deceased - Inherited Property
    *   Paragraph (d) exempts sales by a widow/widower of property inherited by that widow/widower from the deceased spouse, in cases where the sale is compelled by circumstances arising from the spouse's death.
    *   Both paragraphs (c) and (d) require that the sale by the widow or widower be compelled by circumstances arising primarily, principally, and directly from their spouse's death. This requirement contemplates more than a decision to sell based simply on the personal preference of the widow/widower.
*   (e) Court Ordered Sale
    *   This paragraph exempts sales or dispositions made in compliance with a Court order made under:
        *   Section 25 (2) of the Matrimonial Property Act 1976.
            *   Orders can be made under that provision only in cases where there has been a breakdown in the marriage or where one spouse is bankrupt. This exemption does not include any other orders made relating to any ownership, vesting or possession of property, or agreements for the purpose of contracting out of the provisions of the Matrimonial Property Act.
        *   Any other Act.
            *   To qualify for this part of the exemption the taxpayer must satisfy the Commissioner that the Court order has not come about because of any moves on the part of the taxpayer which have frustrated any sale of the property contemplated by him.
            *   This exemption would not apply for example, where the taxpayer enters into an agreement to sell a property end then, for any reason, defaults on that agreement. The purchaser then seeks an order for specific performance of the agreement and a Court orders the sale to proceed in spite of any objections the taxpayer/seller may have.
*   (f) Profit on Sale Already Taxed
    *   Exemption from the recovery provisions is provided where, and to the extent that, the profit or gain derived on the sale of a property is included as assessable income under any other section of the principal Act.
    *   Where the profit from a sale of land is assessed under section 67 for example, that same profit cannot also be taxed under this section.
    *   On the other hand if, for example, a block of forest land is sold the value of the standing timber only is taxed under section
    *   Any profit made on the land sold with the trees, will be subject to the recovery provisions of this section.

APPENDIX C
----------

### Section 32 - Loss Incurred in Specified Activities

The section 32 measures provide, in a new section 188A of the principal Act, that the amount of losses incurred in certain activities (such as horticulture, livestock or fish farming, and property owning) that may be offset against income from other sources will be limited to $10,000 per annum. This "loss containment" provision will apply in respect of all such losses incurred in the 1985/84 income year and subsequent years.

A new section 188B is inserted in the Act to complement the operation of section 188A and permits a deferral of the payment of any "extra" income tax that may become payable as a result of the loss containment provision outlined above. The deferral will apply in respect of any or all of the 3 income years commencing on 1 April 1983, 1984, and 1985. In the event of such a deferral, the new section 188B imposes interest at the rate of 1.25 percent per month on so much of the deferred tax that remains outstanding throughout any month.

**Detailed Notes on Section 188A**

These notes should be read in conjunction with the legislation.

**Subsection (1) - Definitions**

The following definitions apply only to section 188A, they are not for the purposes of any other section of the Income Tax Act 1976.

**_"To Conduct"_**

*   The term is self-explanatory; however the corresponding meanings of the words "conduct", "conducts", and "conducted" should be noted.

**_"Established Activity"_**

*   An "established activity" is any "specified activity" (or activities) conducted by an "existing farmer" on the 11th of October 1982, the conduct of which, in the opinion of the Commissioner, constituted, on that date, the livelihood and sole or principal source of income of that "existing farmer".
*   "... livelihood and sole or principal source of income" - In order for the Commissioner to be of the opinion that the conduct of a "specified activity" constitutes his livelihood and sole or principal source of income, a taxpayer must establish that:
    *   (i) he conducts that activity to the exclusion of virtually everything else, and
    *   (ii) his ability to derive income depends on the conduct of that activity to the exclusion of virtually everything else.
*   Where the taxpayer conducts more than one specified activity those activities must jointly comprise his livelihood and sole or principal source of income.
*   The taxpayer must be an "existing farmer" on 11 October 1982 and the conduct of the specified activity (or activities) must constitute his livelihood and sole or principal source of income on that date.
*   Note that the type of activity within the meaning of paragraph (i) of the definition of "specified activity" is excluded from the definition of "established activity". The activity of, say, renting properties, therefore, cannot constitute an established activity.
*   This definition is relevant for the purposes of subsection (6) of this section.

**_"Existing Farmer"_**

*   An "existing farmer" is any taxpayer who conducts any specified activity (or activities) where the conduct of that activity (or activities) constitutes the livelihood and sole or principal source of income of the taxpayer throughout the period of conduct in any income year.
*   For the Commissioner to be of the opinion that the conduct of the specified activity (or activities) constitutes the taxpayers' livelihood and sole or principal source of income, the criteria specified in the explanation of the definition of "established activity" apply.
*   Note that whereas for the purposes of the definition of "established activity" the conduct of an activity must constitute the livelihood, etc, of the taxpayer on a particular date (11 October 1982), the definition of "existing farmer" requires that the conduct of an activity constitutes the livelihood, etc, of the taxpayer at all times during the conduct of that activity in a particular income year.
*   Note also that, as with the definition of the term "established activity", a taxpayer conducting the type of activity within the meaning of paragraph (i) of the definition of "specified activity" is excluded from the definition of "existing farmer". A taxpayer who primarily conducts the activity of renting properties throughout an income year cannot, therefore, be an "existing farmer" in that income year in respect of that activity.
*   Subsections (3) and (4) of this section make reference to an activity (or activities) "by virtue of which ... (the taxpayer) ... is an "existing farmer". The activity (or activities) referred to is simply the one (or ones) in respect of which the taxpayer is an existing farmer, ie, it constitutes his livelihood, etc, throughout the conduct of the activity in any income year.
*   This definition is relevant for the purposes of subsections (3), (4) and (6) of this section.

**_"Income from Personal Exertion"_**

*   "Income from personal exertion" is any income of the types specified in section 65(2)(a) and 65(2)(b), ie, business profits and employment income, but does not include income from the businesses of renting, lending money, or making financial investments.
*   This definition is relevant for the purposes of subsection (8).

**_"Related Activity"_**

*   In relation to a particular "specified activity" conducted by a taxpayer, a "related activity" is any other specified activity, conducted by the taxpayer that is either:
    *   (a) of the same kind as that specified activity, irrespective of whether the activities are conducted on the same land, or
    *   (b) deemed to be related to that specified activity under subsection (3) or (4) of section 188A.
*   Paragraph (a)
    *   "... of the same kind as ..." - Two (or more) specified activities conducted by a taxpayer in an income year are "of the same kind" if they are categorised under the same paragraph (and subparagraph) of the definition of the term "specified activity".
    *   For example, the businesses of dairy farming and deer farming are "of the same kind" as they are both categorised under the same paragraph (a) of the definition of "specified activity", whereas the businesses of dairy farming and rock oyster farming are not "of the same kind" as they are categorised under different paragraphs (a) and (d) of that definition.
    *   Note that an activity categorised under subparagraph (i) of paragraph (b) of the definition of "specified activity" can only be related to an activity within the same subparagraph. Paragraphs (b)(i) and (b)(ii) are separate and distinct categories for the purposes of determining whether activities are related activities under paragraph (a) of this definition.
    *   For the purposes of paragraph (a) of this definition, two or more activities may be of the same kind irrespective of the location of the property or properties on which those activities are conducted.
*   Paragraph (b)
    *   This paragraph merely provides that the term "related activity" includes those activities which are deemed to be related under subsection (3) and subsection (4) of section 188A.
*   This definition is relevant for the purposes of subsection (5).

**_"Specified Activity"_**

*   An activity will constitute a "specified activity" if it falls into any one of the following 10 categories listed in this definition:
    
    *   Paragraph (a)
        *   This category covers the business of dairy, sheep, goat, deer and pig farming, etc, (ie animal husbandry), and includes poultry and bee-keeping, and the breeding of horses. The business of breeding of bloodstock is specifically excluded from this category and, as it is not included in any other category in this definition, it does not constitute a "specified activity". The term "bloodstock" includes thoroughbred and standardbred horses only.
    *   Paragraph (b)(i)
        *   This category is intended to cover all plant and tree nursery activities.
    
    *   Paragraph (b)(ii)
        *   This category includes all activities where the growing of trees or plants is for the purpose of the production of fruit, vegetables, flowers, seeds or other crops, but does not include:
            *   the growing of trees or plants for the production of grapes (this activity is categorised in paragraph (c) of this definition), or
            *   the growing of trees or plants for the production of crops (other than flowers) where the preparation of the land, the planting and cultivation of the tree or plant, and the harvesting of the crop is achieved within a period of 12 months. Such annual crops (from seed to harvest) would include potatoes, wheat, maize, pumpkins and lettuces.
    *   Paragraph (c)
        *   This category covers the business of grape growing.
    
    *   Paragraphs (d), (e), (f) and (g)
        *   These categories respectively cover the activities of rock-oyster, mussel, scallop and freshwater fish farming.
    
    *   Paragraph (h)
        *   This category covers activities whereby income is derived from livestock otherwise than in the conduct of an activity referred to in paragraph (a) of this definition. Note that the term "livestock" includes poultry, bees and horses, but does not include bloodstock.
        *   It is envisaged that the main activity that will come within this paragraph is the leasing or bailment of livestock. The activity will constitute a "specified activity" of the lessor.
    
    *   Paragraph (i)
        *   This category covers the activity of acquiring or holding land with the intention to derive rents, fines, premiums or other revenues from any lease, licence, or other agreement relating to that land. It is not necessary that the whole of the land be used to derive revenue; the leasing, etc, of only a part of the land is included in this category.
        *   As the activities covered by paragraph (i) of this definition are specifically excluded from the definitions of "established activity", "existing farmer", and from the provisions of subsection (8):
            *   A taxpayer who conducts such an activity for his livelihood cannot be an "existing farmer", and the activity cannot therefore be an "established activity".
            *   Those activities can only be "related activities" under paragraph (a) of the definition of that term (they cannot be "related activities" under paragraph (b) as that paragraph requires that the taxpayer be an existing farmer).
            *   The Commissioner may not authorise an increase in the $10,000 "loss containment" limit in respect of any taxpayer who conducts such an activity for his livelihood (such authority is provided for in subsection (8) of section 188A).
*   This definition is relevant for the purposes of subsections (1), (3), (4), (5), (7) and (8) of this section.

**Subsection (2) - Definition of "Land"**

This definition is the same as that included in section 23(1) of the Amendment Act (which substitutes the new section 129). For full details please refer to the explanation of that definition in Appendix B of this publication. Meanwhile, it should be noted that "land" includes leased and licensed areas within the meaning of the Marine Farming Act 1971, and does not include a mortgage.

**Subsection (3) - Complementary Specified Activities**

This subsection is intended to enable an "existing farmer" to diversify into an activity that is different from, but complementary to, his current activity without the two activities being subject to the $10,000 loss containment provision.

Where a taxpayer is, in any income year, an "existing farmer" and, during that income year, commences to conduct a new specified activity, both the following conditions must be met in order that the $10,000 loss containment provision will not apply in relation to the newly commenced activity and one of the taxpayer's other activities:

*   (i) The newly commenced specified activity must be different from (see "explanation of terms" below) the specified activity or, if more than one, each of the specified activities by virtue of which the taxpayer is, immediately prior to the commencement, an "existing farmer".
*   (ii) The Commissioner must be satisfied that the newly commenced specified activity is one that is usually conducted in association with, and is complementary to\\, the specified activity or, if more than one, any of the specified activities by virtue of which the taxpayer is, immediately prior to the commencement, an "existing farmer".

If both of the above conditions are met, the newly commenced specified activity is, under subsection (3), deemed to be an activity related to the (one) specified activity to which it is complementary (see (ii) above) and, further, that activity is a "related activity" in terms of paragraph (b) of the definition of that term in subsection (1).

_**Explanation of terms used in subsection (3)**_

*   "... different from ..." - This term is interpreted as being the exact opposite of the term "of the same kind", the meaning of which is explained fully in the notes on the definition of the term "related activity" (subsection (1)). It simply covers any "specified activity" that is not categorised in the same paragraph (or subparagraph) of the definition of that term.
*   Note that if the newly commenced specified activity is "of the same kind" (ie, not different) as one of the activities by virtue of which the taxpayer is an "existing farmer", that activity will simply be a "related activity" under paragraph (a) of the definition of that term. As such, there will be no need to use subsection (3) in order to deem the activity to be a related one.
*   "... the specified activity ... by virtue of which ... (the taxpayer) ... is an existing farmer" - See explanation of definition of "existing farmer" in subsection (1).
*   "... immediately before that commencement ..." - The commencement referred to is the commencement of the conduct of the new "specified activity".

**Subsection (4) - Activities conducted on land held for 5 years**

This subsection provides a further "extension" of the application of the term "related activity". It is intended to enable an "existing farmer" to diversify into a specified activity that is conducted on land that has been held by him for five years preceding the date of commencement, without that activity and one of the taxpayers's other activities being subject to the $10,000 loss containment provision.

Where a taxpayer is, in any income year, an "existing farmer" and, during that income year, commences to conduct a new specified activity, both the following conditions must be met in order that the $10,000 loss containment provision will not apply in relation to the newly commenced activity and one of the taxpayer's other activities:

*   (i) The newly commenced specified activity must be different from (see "explanation of terms" below) the specified activity or, if more than one, each of the specified activities by virtue of which the taxpayer is, immediately prior to the commencement, an "existing farmer".
*   (ii) The newly commenced specified activity must be conducted on land that the taxpayer has owned or held (under any lease, licence, or other agreement) throughout the period of five years ending on the date of commencement.
*   If both of the above conditions are met, the newly commenced specified activity is, under subsection (4), deemed to be an activity related to one other specified activity conducted by the taxpayer. The activity to which it is deemed to be related is determined as follows:
    *   (a) If there is only one specified activity by virtue of which the taxpayer is, immediately prior to the commencement, an "existing farmer" the newly commenced activity is deemed to be related to that one specified activity.
    *   (b) If there are two or more specified activities by virtue of which the taxpayer is, immediately prior to the commencement, an "existing farmer", the newly commenced activity is deemed to be related to the one specified activity that the taxpayer chooses, or, if no election is made, one activity that the Commissioner determines.
*   The taxpayer's election must be made in writing and given to the Commissioner within the time in which the tax return for the income year in which commencement occurs is due. Should the taxpayer decide not to make an election, or if the notice of election is received after the due date, the Commissioner must then determine to which specified activity the newly commenced activity is deemed to relate.
*   Once the specified activity to which the newly commenced activity is deemed to relate has been decided, the newly commenced activity is a "related activity" in terms of paragraph (b) of the definition of that term in subsection (1).

_**Explanation of terms used in subsection (4)**_

*   "... different from ..." - See "explanation of terms used in subsection (3)".
*   "... the specified activity ... by virtue of which ... (the taxpayer) ... is an existing farmer" - See explanation of existing farmer in subsection (1).
*   "... immediately before that commencement ..." - See "explanation of terms used in subsection (3)".
*   "... throughout the period of five years ending on the date of commencement ..." - The ownership or holding of any land must be continuous over the period specified. The required period, ie, 5 years ending on the date of commencement, is effectively a minimum period of 4 years and 364 days. To illustrate, for a taxpayer who has owned a block of land continuously since 11 June 1980 and wishes to commence a specified activity on that land at some time in the future, the provisions of subsection (4) apply only if the specified activity is commenced on or after 10 June 1985, that date being the end of the five year period.

Note that it is not necessary that the land held for 5 years has lain idle over that period, nor is it necessary that the land be separate from land currently used to conduct any specified activity.

**Subsection (5) - Related Activities deemed to be one specified activity**

This subsection provides that, for the purposes of subsections (6), (7) and (8), a specified activity that is a "related activity" shall be deemed to be part of the specified activity in relation to which it is a "related activity".

To illustrate, if a taxpayer currently conducts the business of growing kiwifruit plants for the production of fruit, and also conducts the business of beekeeping, the beekeeping activity is a "related activity" (paragraph (b) of the definition) to the kiwifruit activity and, under subsection (5), forms a part of that latter activity. As such, all profits and losses may be offset without limit between the related activities; any remaining loss available to be offset from other income is then subject to the containment provisions under subsections (6) to (8).

**Subsection (6) - Losses Incurred in Conduct of an "Established Activity"**

This subsection provides that the loss containment provisions contained in subsection (7) shall not apply in respect of stay loss incurred by an "existing farmer" 'in the conduct of an "established activity".

Note that this subsection exempts only those losses incurred in the conduct of the "established activity", it does not exempt losses incurred in any other activity.

**Subsection (7) - Limitation of Offset of Certain Losses**

This subsection specifies the degree to which a loss incurred in the conduct of a specified activity may be offset against other income in the income year that the loss is incurred, and also specifies the treatment of any excess of that loss that is carried forward to any future income year.

Where this subsection conflicts with any of the provisions contained in sections 19, 188, and 191 of the principal Act, this subsection overrides those sections, except where otherwise stated (paragraphs (b) and (c) of subsection (7)).

It should be borne in mind that every reference in this subsection to a specified activity may in fact relate to more than one activity if those activities are "related" activities (see note on subsection (5)).

Paragraphs (a) to (e) cover the loss containment with respect to one specified activity only. Where there are 2 or more specified activities refer to paragraphs (f) to (h).

_Paragraph (a) - Offset of loss in year incurred_

*   Where a taxpayer incurs a loss in the conduct of a specified activity, this paragraph limits the amount of that loss that may be deducted from, or offset against, income from other sources to a maximum of $10,000 in the income year the loss is incurred. Where the amount of the loss is less than $10,000, the amount of the loss will be able to be deducted or offset in total.
*   The amount of the loss that is able to be offset in the year incurred as specified in this paragraph applies notwithstanding any other provision in the principal Act.
*   The treatment of the amount of any excess loss that is not able to be offset under this paragraph is dealt with in paragraph (b).
*   Note that the income year in which the loss from the conduct of the specified activity is incurred is referred to in paragraphs (b) and (d) of this subsection as "Year 1".

_Paragraph (b) - Carry forward of Loss from Year Incurred_

*   This paragraph provides that the amount of any loss incurred in the conduct of a specified activity that cannot be deducted or offset pursuant to paragraph (a) (ie, in the income year that the loss is incurred, "Year 1") shall be carried forward without limit to the immediately succeeding income year ("Year 2").
*   Where the taxpayer has incurred a further loss from the conduct of that specified activity in "Year 2", the loss brought forward from "Year 1" in respect of that activity shall simply be added to the loss incurred in "Year 2".
*   If, on the other hand, the taxpayer derives assessable income from that specified activity in "Year 2", the loss brought forward from "Year 1" in respect of that activity may be offset without limit against the assessable income derived from the same specified activity in that income year. This offset is to be carried out in accordance with the provisions of section 188.
*   The treatment of the loss resulting from aggregation of the "Year 1" and "Year 2" losses, or any net loss resulting from the "Year 1" loss and any "Year 2" profit, is dealt with in paragraph (c) of this subsection.
*   It is important to note that the carry forward of losses specified in paragraph (b) remains subject to the provisions of sections 19(3), 188(2A) and 188(7). These sections respectively provide for the determinations of loss carried forward, the order in which losses carried forward are to be offset, and the conditions required to be satisfied in order that a loss may be carried forward by a company. With the exception of the above subsections, all other sections of the Act are subject to this section.

_Paragraph (c) - Offset of Losses in year following the year in which incurred_

*   Where a taxpayer has, pursuant to paragraph (b) of this subsection, a loss available from the conduct of a specified activity, this paragraph limits the amount of that loss that may be deducted from, or offset against, income from other sources to a MAXIMUM of $10,000 in "Year 2" (ie the year immediately following the year in which a loss is incurred).

_Paragraph (d) - Offset of losses in subsequent years_

*   This paragraph does no more than ensure the "rollover" of the provisions contained in paragraphs (b) and (c) so that they relate also to any losses incurred in the conduct of specified activities in years beyond "Year 2".

_Example of operation of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c)_

Taxpayer A is a full-time accountant who also operates a kiwifruit venture. The profit/loss position in respect of the kiwifruit venture, and the taxpayer's accounting income for a four year period is detailed below:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
|     | Kiwifruit Profit (Loss) | Accounting Income |
| Year ended 31 March 1983 | (15,000) | $25,000 |
| Year ended 31 March 1984 | (15,000) | $25,000 |
| Year ended 31 March 1985 | (22,000) | $25,000 |
| Year ended 31 March 1986 | 12,000 | $25,000 |

The taxpayer's tax position for the four years above will be as follows:

**Year ended 31 March 1983**

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1983 Accounting Income | $25,000 |
| Less Kiwifruit loss | $15,000 |
| Assessable Income | $10,000 |

The kiwifruit loss of $15,000 is able to be offset, without limit, against the accounting income as the loss containment provisions in section 188A apply only in respect of losses incurred in the income year commencing 1 April 1983 and subsequent years.

**Year ended 31 March 1984**

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1984 Accounting Income | $25,000 |
| Less 1984 kiwifruit loss (limited by s 188A(7)(a)) | $10,000 |
| Assessable income | $15,000 |
| Balance of 1984 loss carried forward | $5,000 |

The offset of the kiwifruit loss against the accounting income is, in this year, limited to a maximum of $10,000 in accordance with the provisions of section 188A(7)(a). The balance of the loss not offset is carried forward to the next income year (year ended 31.3.85).

**Year ended 31 March 1985**

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Balance of | 1984 kiwifruit loss b/f | $5,000 |
|     | 1985 kiwifruit loss | $22,000 |
| Kiwifruit loss available to be offset (calculated in accordance with s 188A(7)(b)) |     | $27,000 |
| 1985 Accounting Income |     | $25,000 |
| Less Kiwifruit loss (limited by s 188A(7)(c)) |     | $10,000 |
| Assessable Income | $15,000 |     |
| Balance of loss to be carried forward |     | $17,000 |

The kiwifruit loss brought forward from 1984 is added to the loss incurred in 1985. Of the total of these losses, only $10,000 is able to be offset against accounting income in accordance with the provisions of section 188A(7)(c). The balance of the loss not offset is carried forward to the next income year (year ended 31.3.86).

**Year ended 31 March 1986**

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Balance of 1985 kiwifruit loss b/f | $17,000 |
| 1986 kiwifruit profit | $12,000 |
| Kiwifruit loss available to be offset (calculated in accordance with s 188(2)(b)) | $5,000 |
| 1986 Accounting Income | $25,000 |
| Kiwifruit loss offset | $5,000 |
| Assessable Income | $20,000 |

The kiwifruit loss brought forward from 1985 is reduced by the profit from the kiwifruit venture derived in 1986. You will note that, in calculating the loss available to be offset, $12,000 of the 1985 loss was offset against the 1986 kiwifruit profit. The offsetting of losses brought forward within the same specified activity is not subject to the $10,000 limit. The net kiwifruit loss available to be offset against other income, $5,000, is able to be offset in full against the accounting income as that amount does not exceed the $10,000 limit. There is no further loss to be carried forward.

_Note: Losses carried forward to year ended 31.3.84_

As the provisions of the new section 188A do not apply to losses incurred PRIOR to the commencement of the income year ending 31.3.84, any loss carried forward to that year (ie, incurred in a prior income year) are NOT subject to the loss containment provisions. In the above example, if Taxpayer A had incurred a loss from the kiwifruit venture in 1983 of $38,000, that loss would have been able to be offset without limit against 1983 accounting income, and the balance carried forward to 1984 ($13,000) would have been able to be offset against 1984 accounting income without affecting the calculation of the $10,000 limit. The taxpayer's tax position for that year would have been as follows:

**Year ending 31 March 1984**

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1984 Accounting Income | $25,000 |
| Less 1983 kiwifruit loss b/f | $13,000 |
| Less 1984 kiwifruit loss of $15,000 (limited by s 188A(7)(a)) | $10,000 |
| Assessable Income | $2,000 |
| Balance of 1984 loss to be carried forward | $5,000 |

_Paragraph (e) - Partners Sharing Specified Activity Losses_

This paragraph provides that where a specified activity is conducted by 2 or more persons (ie, partners or co-venturers), every reference in paragraphs (a) to (d) to a taxpayer and to the amount of a loss incurred by him in the conduct of a specified activity shall be read as if that reference were to each of those taxpayers in partnership and to the amount of each taxpayer's share of the loss incurred in the specified activity.

The effect of this paragraph is merely to ensure that each partner in a partnership is able to offset up to $10,000 of his share of a partnership loss incurred in the conduct of a specified activity.

_Paragraphs (f),(g) and (h)_

These paragraphs cover the position where a taxpayer is conducting 2 or more specified activities. Although the legislation is drafted differently from the preceding paragraphs, their effect is the same; the losses incurred in more than one specified activity are limited to a total of $10,000 per annum.

_Paragraph (f) - Two or More Specified Activities_

Where a taxpayer conducts 2 or more (unrelated) specified activities in an income year, this paragraph limits the total amount of the losses from those activities that may be offset, either against each other or against other income, to a maximum of $10,000.

**Example 1**

Taxpayer B conducts the following three activities:

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Kiwifruit | Loss | $16,000 | ("specified activity", para (b)(ii) of definition) |
| Mussel farming | Loss | $8,000 | ("specified activity", para (e) of definition) |
| Accounting | Net income | $30,000 | (not a "specified activity") |

Under paragraph (f), the total losses from the specified activities (ie $24,000) may be offset against other income only to a combined maximum of $10,000. If it were not for this paragraph, Taxpayer A would, under the provisions of paragraph (a) of this subsection, be able to offset up to $10,000 of each of the losses incurred in the activities against other income, a maximum offset in this case of $18,000 ($10,000 kiwifruit, $8,000 mussel).

**Example 2**

In the income year ending 31 March 1985 Taxpayer C conducts the following three activities:

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Kiwifruit | Loss | $16,000 | ("specified activity", para (b)(ii) of definition) |
| Mussel farming | Loss | $8,000 | ("specified activity", para (e) of definition) |
| Viticulture | Profit | $30,000 | ("specified activity", para (c) of definition) |

As in Example 1, the total losses from the specified activities (ie $24,000) may be offset against other income (in this case from another specified activity) only to a combined maximum of $10,000 in the 1985 year.

To determine the composition of the total loss able to be offset under this paragraph, please refer to paragraph (g).

_Paragraph (g) - Composition of offset losses_

Where a taxpayer incurs losses from 2 or more specified activities, paragraph (g) gives the taxpayer the opportunity of influencing, with his foreknowledge of expected future returns, to what extent those losses are to be offset in the year incurred and in the following year. Where a taxpayer conducts two or more specified activities, and the offset of any losses from two or more of those activities is limited by paragraph (f), the taxpayer may elect how much of each or either loss will constitute the amount of offset limited under paragraph (f).

**Example**

We saw in Example 2 (paragraph (f) above) that the losses from two specified activities were able to be offset against the profit from the third activity to a combined limit of $10,000 under paragraph (f). The taxpayer may wish that the $10,000 loss able to be offset comprises $8,000 for the mussel farming loss and $2,000 of the kiwifruit loss. The reason for such a split may be that the taxpayer is expecting the kiwifruit venture to make a profit in the following year and therefore will wish to take full advantage of this ability in that year to offset the loss carried forward from that activity without limit against that profit (see paragraph (h)).

The taxpayer's election must be made in writing and given to the Commissioner within the time in which the tax return for the income year in which the activities are conducted is due.

Note that the taxpayer's notice in writing is irrevocable; under no circumstances can a change to such a notice be entertained.

_Paragraph (h) - Carry forward and offset of losses from 2 or more specified activities_

Paragraph (h) provides that, where the offset of the combined losses from two or more specified activities is limited under paragraphs (f) and (g), any excess of those losses in respect of each activity not offset may be carried forward to the income year immediately succeeding the year in which the losses are incurred. The losses so carried forward are to be treated as follows:

*   (i) Each loss carried forward into that immediately succeeding income year in respect of one of the specified activities may be offset to the extent of any assessable income derived from that specified activity in that income year.
*   (ii) Any excess not so offset is to be treated as a loss incurred in the conduct of that specified activity in that income year for the purposes of paragraphs (f) and (g).

**Example**

In Example 2, used in paragraphs (f) and (g), the $10,000 loss offset allowed in 1985 was, at the taxpayer's election, made up as follows:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Portion of kiwifruit loss | $2,000 |
| Total mussel farming loss | $8,000 |
| Total losses offset in 1985 | $10,000 |

The corresponding losses to be carried forward to the 1986 income year are:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1985 kiwifruit loss carried forward | $14,000 |
| 1985 mussel farm loss carried forward | Nil |
| Total loss carried forward | $14,000 |

If the taxpayer's kiwifruit venture makes a profit in 1986 of $10,000, the mussel farm suffers a further loss of $8,000, and the viticultural venture, a profit of $25,000, paragraph (h) specifies the following treatment:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1986 kiwifruit profit | $10,000 |     |
| Less 1985 kiwifruit loss b/f | $14,000 |     |
| Net Kiwifruit loss |     | $4,000 |
| 1986 Mussel farm loss |     | $8,000 |
| Total losses |     | $12,000 |

Paragraph (h)(ii) specifies that any excess of loss over the 1986 assessable income from kiwifruit (after the 1985 carried forward loss has been offset), is to be treated as a loss incurred in the conduct of that specified activity in the 1986 income year. Applying the provisions of paragraph (f) to this "1986" loss, the total amount of loss able to be offset against viticultural income is limited to $10,000.

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1986 viticultural profit |     | $25,000 |
| "1986" kiwifruit loss | $4,000 |     |
| 1986 Mussel farm loss | $8,000 |     |
| Total Losses | $12,000 |     |
| Loss able to be offset (limited by s 188A(7)(f)) |     | $10,000 |
| 1986 Assessable Income |     | $15,000 |

Remember, the taxpayer may elect as to how the $10,000 offset is comprised in accordance with paragraph (g).

**Subsection (8) - Hardship Provisions**

This subsection enables the Commissioner to allow, in certain circumstances, the offset of an amount of loss greater than that specified in subsection (7) of this section. It is envisaged that this subsection will be utilised to ease the loss containment provisions for those taxpayers in hardship who are compelled by circumstances to derive income from sources other than their farm in order to maintain either their family or the continued operation of the farm.

Although this subsection applies irrespective of any foregoing subsections in section 188A, it does not provide an exemption for any taxpayer from any of the provisions of section 188A; it merely enables the Commissioner to alleviate the effects of those provisions in certain cases.

This subsection does not apply where the taxpayer conducts the type of "specified activity" covered by paragraph (i) of the definition of that term.

In order that the Commissioner may, in any income year, determine a loss offset limit higher than that set by subsection (7), the following conditions must be satisfied:

*   (a) The taxpayer must be engaged, principally and personally, in the conduct of a specified activity on average over the whole year, and that activity is, in the opinion of the Commissioner, the livelihood of the taxpayer or the taxpayer is in the course of establishing it as his livelihood.
    *   To satisfy this condition the taxpayer must be personally involved in the conduct of the specified activity throughout the income year except for the time taken to derive income from the activity referred to in paragraph (b) below.
    *   To determine whether the conduct of a specified activity constitutes the taxpayer's "livelihood", the taxpayer should conduct that activity to the exclusion of virtually everything else (see explanation of definition of "livelihood", subs (1)).
    *   Note again that the specified activity which the taxpayer conducts cannot be a specified activity of the type covered in paragraph (i) of the definition of that term.
*   (b) The taxpayer is compelled to derive income from personal exertion, other than from the conduct of the specified activity, by reason of circumstances that arise in the course of and as the result of the conduct of that specified activity.
    *   The taxpayer must be compelled to derive income from personal exertion, and that compulsion must arise in the course of, and result from, the conduct of the specified activity. The reasons why a taxpayer may be compelled to derive income are covered in paragraph (c) below.
    *   By definition, the activity undertaken in order to derive the income from personal exertion should be of a temporary or short term nature.
*   (c) The taxpayer derives that income from personal exertion to enable him to meet expenditure essential either for the maintenance of himself and his dependants, or for the continuance of the specified activity.
*   (d) The application of subsection (7) of this section would, in the opinion of the Commissioner, cause hardship to the taxpayer.

In any case where a taxpayer satisfies all the above conditions, the Commissioner may specify that the amount of loss incurred in the conduct of the specified activity that may offset against the income from personal exertion will be higher than that authorised in section 188A(7) (ie $10,000).

It is important to remember that although the Commissioner may increase the offset limit specified in subsection (7), this does not mean that the taxpayer is automatically entitled to an increase in the limit sufficient to allow the full loss to be offset against income from personal exertion (although in some cases this may be deemed appropriate). The loss offset limit of $10,000 can be increased only to the extent necessary to alleviate the hardship based on fair and reasonable grounds.

**Subsection (9) - Application of section to balance dates other than 31 March**

This subsection contains the standard provisions for relating an accounting year to the 31 March income year, where the taxpayer has a balance date other than 31 March.

**Detailed Notes on Section 188B**

Section 32 of the Amendment Act also inserts a new section 188B into the principal Act allowing, as a transitional measure, certain taxpayers to defer the extra tax payable as a result of the $10,000 loss limitation measures contained in the new section 188A, and pay it, together with interest, over 3 years.

This transitional measure is designed to provide assistance for those taxpayers, affected by the provisions of section 188A, who might otherwise face liquidity problems. These may arise where the taxpayer had planned to contribute to the future development of his "specified activity" from expected tax deferrals created by the offset against other taxable income of losses in excess of $10,000.

The main points of the new section are set out below.

Determination of Application of Section 188A
--------------------------------------------

The following diagram may assist you in determining whether a particular taxpayer is covered by the provisions of section 188A. It may also assist you in gaining an understanding of how the subsections of section 188A inter-relate.

**Subsection (1) - Definitions**

The following definitions apply to section 188B only.

_"To Conduct"_

*   This has the same definition as in the new section 188A(1).

_"Specified Activity"_

*   This term has a similar meaning to that given in section 188A(1) but it should be noted that the exclusion of any "specified activity" within the meaning of section 188A(1)(i) means that the transitional measures are not available where the loss results from, for example, the activity of renting properties.

_"Specified amount of tax"_

*   This is an important term which defines what amount of tax may be the subject of the transitional arrangements.
*   The amount of tax that is to be subject to the transitional provisions is the difference between the tax that is payable in any "transitional year" as a result of the new section 188A of the Act and the tax that would be payable had section 188A (ie, the limiting of losses to a maximum offset of $10,000) not applied.
*   A "specified amount of tax" must be calculated only in respect of "specified activities" that were conducted on 11 October 1982. The transitional provisions are not available in respect of any losses in excess of $10,000 from any "specified activity" commenced after 11 October 1982 even if the losses were incurred within the transitional period.

_"Transitional year"_

*   This term effectively defines the transitional period as the three income years commencing on the first day of April 1983, 1984 and 1985 (or corresponding accounting years).

**Subsection (2) - Application**

Subsection (2) sets out when the "specified amount of tax" is to be paid and provides that the "specified amount of tax" shall be due and payable in 3 equal instalments on each of the dates on which the taxpayer is required to pay the tax (if any) on the income derived in each of the 3 income years next succeeding that transitional year.

For example

*   1984 return received by 7 September 1984. (The first "transitional year".)
*   The year ended 31.3.85 is the income year next succeeding the first transitional year.
*   The tax relating to the year ended 31.3.85 is due and payable 7.2.86. (The last date for payment being 7 March 1986.)
*   The "specified amount of tax" calculated from the 1984 return (say $9,000) would be due and payable as follows:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 7 February 1986 (one-third of $9,000) | $3,000 |
| 7 February 1987 (one-third of $9,000) | $3,000 |
| 7 February 1988 (one-third of $9,000) | $3,000 |

The "specified amount of tax" in respect of the 1985 "transitional year" (for which a return should be filed by 7 September 1985 unless an extension of time is granted) would be due and payable in 3 equal annual instalments, the first due on 7 February 1987.

The taxpayer may, of course, pay any instalment at any time up to 7 March in the year in which it is due without incurring a late payment penalty of 10 percent.

**Subsections (3) and (4) - Interest**

Subsection (3) provides for the calculation of interest on the "specified amount of tax" and subsection (4) provides for its payment conditions.

Under subsection (3) interest is calculated for the period commencing on the day after the day on which terminal tax relating to that year would normally be due (ie, the 7 February following the end of transitional year) and ending on the day each instalment becomes due and payable.

Interest is payable at the rate of 1.25 percent per month for each complete month the instalment of the "specified amount of tax" remains unpaid during this period. In cases of early payment of the "specified amount of tax" the interest payable would be adjusted accordingly.

Subsection (4) provides that the interest is deemed to be income tax for collection (and recovery) purposes and that it is to be due on the same date as the instalment to which it relates. A late payment penalty of 10 percent is charged where it is not paid by the last day for payment (ie, 7 March). Interest does not continue to accrue on the tax not paid by the due date.

For example

*   The "specified amount of tax" (say $9,000) is due and payable as follows:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 7 February 1986 - one-third of $9,000 | $3,000 |
| 7 February 1987 - one-third of $9,000 | $3,000 |
| 7 February 1988 - one-third of $9,000 | $3,000 |
| (as described in the earlier example) |     |

*   The interest would be due and payable as follows:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 7 February 1986 | $450 |
| (1.25 percent per month for 12 complete months 8.2.85 - 7.2.86 on 1st instalment of $3,000) |     |
| 7 February 1987 | $900 |
| (1.25 percent per month for 24 complete months 8.2.85 - 7.2.87 on 2nd instalment of $3,000) |     |
| 7 February 1988 | $1,350 |
| (1.25 percent per month for 36 complete months 8.2.85 - 7.2.88 on 3rd instalment of $3,000) |     |

**Subsection (5) - Election by Taxpayer**

In order to take advantage of the transitional provisions contained in the section a taxpayer must make written application by the last date for filing his return of income. The subsection contains a discretion for applications made after this date and such applications will be accepted where an extension of time for filing the return has been granted. Other later applications will be viewed on their merits but will not be accepted unless it had not been possible to make written application within the prescribed time.

**Subsection (6) - Early Payment of Tax and Interest**

Subsection (6) provides the Commissioner a discretion to require early payment of the "specified amount of tax" together with the interest thereon in 3 circumstances:

*   Where it is believed the taxpayer is about to cease carrying on business in New Zealand, or
*   Where a taxpayer has ceased to carry on business in New Zealand or to derive income, or
*   Where a taxpayer becomes bankrupt, or (being a company) is in the course of being wound up.

In the first two of those situations the due dates will be amended only where it is evident that a taxpayer has left or is about to leave New Zealand and will not derive business income (within the meaning of section 2 of the Act) from New Zealand following his departure. In these cases an amended assessment will be issued specifying that the tax is due within 1 month.

No action will be taken under this discretionary subsection to amend the due dates where:

*   A New Zealand resident disposes of his specified activity before all instalments of tax and interest have been paid.
*   A New Zealand resident ceases to derive business income but continues to derive other types of income, eg, salary and wage income.
*   A New Zealand resident ceases to derive any income.

The proviso to subsection (6) provides a further discretion in cases where the taxpayer dies during the year. It allows not only for flexibility in determining amended due dates, but also for the variation of the rate of interest to be charged.

In setting new dates for payment, the Commissioner will allow a reasonable time for the affairs of the deceased to be put in order and for probate to be issued, but only in exceptional cases of hardship will any adjustment be allowed to the rate of interest to be charged.

**Subsection (7) - Deductibility of Interest**

The interest is deemed under subsection (7) to be deductible expenditure (in the year in which it is incurred) of the specified activity to which the "specified amount of tax" is calculated. This will be taken into account in determining any future losses to which section 188A applies.

### Section 34 - Life Insurance and Reinsurance Companies

**1\. Introduction**

Section 34 repeals three sections of the principal Act, sections 204, 205 and 206 and substitutes a new section 204 (referred to in these notes as the new section), for life insurance and reinsurance companies in respect of the business of life insurance carried on in New Zealand (hereafter referred to as life offices). The repealed sections were a complete tax regime for life offices whereas the new section is not. Other provisions of the Tax Act apply except to the extent that they are amended, modified or varied by the provisions of the new section. Under the former sections the assessable income of a life office was calculated on the basis of the funds allotted by way of reversionary bonuses and dividends paid. In terms of the new section the assessable income is effectively the net investment income including profits on sale of investments derived by the life office.

As premium income is not included in assessable income, costs must be allocated between investment income and premium income. In order, therefore, to ascertain assessable income it is necessary to split expenditure firstly into two main groups:

1.  Direct expenditure.
2.  Indirect general expenditure.

Direct expenditure is further subdivided into:

1.  Direct expenditure exclusively incurred in deriving investment income, referred to in the new section as "direct investment revenue costs",
2.  Direct expenditure exclusively incurred in deriving premium income, referred to in the new section as "direct premium revenue costs".

Indirect general expenditure is the balance of expenditure after deducting all direct expenditure. It is further subdivided into:

1.  Indirect expenditure incurred in deriving investment income, referred to in the new section as "indirect investment revenue costs".
2.  Indirect expenditure incurred in deriving premium income, referred to in the new section as "indirect premium revenue costs".

In brief then the profit derived by a life office is calculated as follows:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gross investment income tax |     | xxx |
| Less direct costs incurred in producing investment income | xxx |     |
| Less proportion of indirect costs | xxx | xxx |
| Assessable Profit |     | xxx |

**2\. The following are brief notes on the subsections of the new section.**

### Subsection (1) Definitions

**(a) Direct investment revenue costs.**

These are costs which can being specifically or exclusively incurred in producing investment income. This category would include the costs of administering the investment division of the life office. However if an employee performs a dual purpose function, such as part of his time being spent in the investment area activity and the balance on non-investment activities, his salary would be treated as indirect general revenue costs and not direct investment revenue costs. This would be the case even where it was possible to estimate the approximate time spent by the employee on each activity. The definition specifically excludes costs for which the company is reimbursed. An example of such costs would be the case of investment linked superannuation policies where the company recoups from the trustees of the superannuation fund, the costs associated with the administration of the schemes investment funds. As explained in the introductory paragraph direct investment revenue costs is one group of expenditure which is allowed as a deduction in calculating assessable income.

**(b) Direct premium revenue costs.**

These are costs which can be identified as being specifically or exclusively incurred in deriving premium income. The main category of expenditure in this class is commissions paid to agents and other marketing expenses. Included would also be the costs associated with the collection of and servicing of policies. However in the case of an employee performing a dual purpose function as outlined in paragraph (a) above, his salary would be treated as indirect general revenue costs and no part as direct premium revenue costs. As premium income is not included in assessable income, direct premium revenue costs are not allowed as a deduction.

**(c) Gross Revenue.**

This definition incorporates all sources of income, both taxable and non-taxable, generated by the life office, it includes profits and losses on sale of investments. The main application for the term is to apportion indirect expenditure between taxable and non-taxable income.

**(d) Indirect general revenue costs.**

This is the balance of expenditure after the deduction of the two classes of direct expenditure. It in turn is apportioned between indirect premium revenue costs and indirect investment revenue costs.

**(e) Indirect premium revenue costs.**

As explained in the preceding paragraph indirect general revenue costs are split between indirect premium revenue costs and indirect investment revenue costs. The amount of indirect general revenue costs to be allocated to indirect premium revenue costs is according to the formula set out in the new subsection (6).

**(f) Indirect investment revenue costs.**

The balance of indirect general revenue costs after the deduction of indirect premium revenue costs.

**(g) Life insurance fund.**

The definition is self-explanatory.

**(h) Policy.**

The definition is self-explanatory.

**(i) Specified mortgage repayment insurance.**

The definition is self-explanatory. Investment income generated from this class of policy is not subject to tax.

**(j) Superannuation policy.**

The definition is self-explanatory. The reason for definition is that some trustees of superannuation schemes arrange to have their schemes managed by life insurance companies. As insurance companies are required by law to transact all their activities through the medium of policies, the companies issue superannuation life insurance policies in respect of the superannuation funds they manage. Furthermore as the income derived by the trustees of superannuation category 1 schemes is exempt from tax, it was necessary to provide that the investment income generated by superannuation life insurance policies in respect of the exempt superannuation life insurance policies in respect of the exempt superannuation category 1 schemes be exempt from tax in the hands of the insurance companies.

### Subsections (2) and (3)

The new section applies to any company engaged in the business of issuing life insurance or reinsurance policies upon human lives in New Zealand. This differs from the former section which had the additional requirement that the greater proportion of the life insurance business was to be in the form of policies with reversionary bonuses. There was also restrictions under the former section dealing with the extent that a proprietary company could pay dividends to its shareholders.

**Subsection (4)**

This deems the Government Insurance Commissioner to be a life insurance company.

**Subsection (5)**

The effect of this subsection is that other provisions of the principal Act apply except to the extent that they are modified, amended or overridden by the provisions of the new section. For example a life office could claim first year depreciation, export incentives, etc, in respect of its investment income. Likewise the loss carry forward provisions of section 188 and the grouping provisions of section 191 apply.

**Subsection (6)**

This provides the basis for apportioning indirect general revenue costs. The x / y X z formula provided for in the subsection gives the indirect general revenue costs to be allocated to the non-taxable premium income. The balance of indirect general revenue costs is then allocated to taxable investment income. The x factor in the formula contains the three sources of non-taxable income:

*   Life insurance premium income.
*   Life reinsurance premium income.
*   Annuity considerations.

The Y factor is the gross income from all sources and Z is the total of the indirect general revenue costs.

**Subsection (7)**

This subsection sets out the method for calculating the profits or losses on sale of investments which now form part of assessable income.

Paragraph (a) deals with investment assets acquired prior to the commencement of the new tax regime year, 1 April 1983. In these cases the profit or loss on sale is calculated as the difference between the selling price of the investment asset and the greater of the cost price or the market value at the end of the 31 March 1983 income year.

**Example 1**

A life office with a 31 December balance date sells an investment asset on 30 June 1983. The following are the relevant details:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 30.9.78 Cost price | $10,000 |
| 31.12.82 Market value | $15,000 |
| 30.6.83 Selling price | $20,000 |

As the market value at the end of the 31 March 1983 income year was $15,000 and as this was greater than the cost price of $10,000, the assessable profit is the difference between $20,000 and $15,000, namely $5,000. Had the cost price in this example been $15,000 and the market value $10,000, the resultant assessable income would still be $5,000.

**Example II**

Same details as in Example I except selling price is less than both cost price and market value.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 30.9.78 Cost price | $10,000 |
| 31.12.82 Market value | $9,000 |
| 30.6.83 Selling price | $8,000 |

The assessable loss is $2,000, ie, the difference between the selling price $8,000 and the cost price $10,000 (as this is greater than the market value of $9,000). Had the cost price in Example II been $9,000 and the market value $10,000, the loss would still be $2,000.

Paragraph (b) of the subsection sets out the basis of the calculation in respect of investment assets acquired after the commencement of the new tax regime. It follows the usual method of calculating capital profits on sale of assets, namely the profit is the difference between cost price and selling price.

**Subsection (8)**

In terms of the subsection a life office is deemed to derive profits from the business of life insurance in New Zealand of an amount equal to the balance of:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Total gross revenue excluding premiums and annuity considerations |     | xxx |
| Less direct investment revenue costs | xxx |     |
| Less indirect investment revenue costs | xxx | xxx |
| Assessable Profit |     | xxx |

An adjustment in terms of subsection (9) is made to the assessable profit in order to arrive at assessable income.

**Subsections (9) and (10)**

From the amount of the assessable profit as calculated in accordance with subsection (8) is deducted an adjustment for exempt investment income deemed to be derived from:

1.  Specified mortgage repayment insurance premiums.
2.  Superannuation policy premiums in respect of superannuation Category 1 Schemes.
3.  Annuities.

The calculation of this adjustment is in accordance with the formula a/b x c as set out in subsection (9) -

1.  is the amount of the liabilities in the Life Insurance Fund at balance date in respect of the abovementioned policies and annuities
2.  is the total amount of all liabilities in the Life Insurance Fund at balance date and
3.  is the amount of the assessable profits as calculated in terms of subsection (8).

The reason for exempting investment income deemed to be derived from superannuation Category 1 Scheme policies is because the amended section 61(21) of the principal Act provides exemption for income derived from this source. Some life offices may be in a position to ascertain the actual gross investment income derived from investment linked type superannuation policies. This basis cannot be accepted as there is only one statutory Life Insurance Fund for each life office and it was therefore not possible to provide for these in the legislation.

The Government decision to exempt the investment income derived from annuities in the hands of the life office is to avoid the double taxation, as annuities when paid to annuitants are assessable income in terms of section 65(2) of the principal Act.

**Subsection (11)**

Contains the usual provisions concerning the matching of the accounting year with the income year for those companies whose balance date is other than 31 March. As most life offices have a 31 December balance date, the new regime will apply to them on and from the financial year commencing on 1 January 1983. However, several companies have a 30 September balance date; they therefore would be subject to the new regime for the financial year commencing 1 October 1983.

### Consequential Amendments

Subsection (2) of section 34 provides for minor consequential amendments to the principal Act.

### Commencement Date

Subsection (3) provides that the new regime will apply on and form the income year commencing on 1 April 1983.

### Guide to the Tax Treatment of Expenditure and Income

The attached addendum to this appendix lists questions with answers on the treatment of expenditure and income for the purposes of the new tax regime.

ADDENDUM TO APPENDIX D
----------------------

| Income |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| (i) | Question | Are dividends assessable income? |
|     | Answer | Yes. The amendment to section 63 of the principal Act by section 10 of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 2) 1982 removes the dividend exemption in respect of dividend income derived by a life office. |
| (ii) | Question | Are section 4(5) distributions tax free in the hands of a life office? |
|     | Answer | These distributions are assessable income as they are part of "the total revenue received or receivable ... from its investments ... "in terms of paragraph (d). However, distributions from share premium accounts would be excluded. of the definition "gross revenue" |
| (iii) | Question | How are bonus issues of shares treated in the hands of a life office? |
|     | Answer | 1.  In the case of a bonus issue derived prior to the commencement of the new tax regime - The assessable income on the realisation of the shares is the difference between the market value of the share immediately prior to the commencement of the new regime year and the selling price.<br>2.  In the case of bonus issues derived subsequent to the commencement of the new regime - The assessable income at the time of realisation of the shares would be the whole of the selling price. |
| (iv) | Question | What proportion of the profit is assessable on realisation of a property which is partly occupied by the life office and part rented? |
|     | Answer | If the life office occupies an area greater than 60 percent of the total floor area, no part of the profit on sale is assessable. If the life office occupies an area less than 60 percent, the whole of the profit is assessable |
| (v) | Question | On what basis is income from interest to be returned? |
|     | Answer | On the accrual basis. As loans generate interest income for the whole of the term of the loan, the interest income is derived throughout the accounting period irrespective of the due date for payment of the interest instalments.This means that the amount of interest to be returned under the accrual basis would include interest accruing up to balance since the previous due date for payment. |
| Expenditure |     |     |
| (vi) | Question | Does the cost price of shares and fixed interest securities include brokerage and stamp duty? |
|     | Answer | Yes. These expenses are part of the capital cost of acquiring the investment asset. |
| (vii) | Question | What will be the value for depreciation purposes of assets held at the date of change the new tax regime? |
|     | Answer | It will be necessary to calculate a deemed tax book value for existing assets at the beginning of the income year commencing 1 April 1983. This is achieved by taking the original cost price of the asset and reducing it by the amount of depreciation at tax scale rates for each year the asset has been used in the business. First year depreciation, where applicable should be used in the calculation. |
| (viii) | Question | As profits on sale of investments are taxable, are investments trading stock for the purposes of section 85 of the Tax Act? |
|     | Answer | No. Subsection (7) of the new section 204 sets out the basis of the calculation of the profit or loss on sale of investments. Therefore section 85 and section 104 have no application to investments. |
| (ix) | Question | What proportion of the profit is assessable on realisation of a property which is partly occupied by the life office and part rented? |
|     | Answer | If an employee is engaged on investment activities es well as servicing policies, can his salary be apportioned between the two activities on the basis of the time factor devoted to each? |
| (x) | Question | Are all tax concessions end incentives, such as first year depreciation and export incentives available to be claimed by a life office? |
|     | Answer | Yes. In terms of subsection (5), the new section 204 is not a complete tax regime for life offices as the former section 204 was. Other provisions of the principal Act apply except to the extent that they are amended, modified or overridden by the new section 204. |

APPENDIX E

Section 37 - Specified Leases
-----------------------------

### 1\. Introduction

**(a) Background**

This section inserts five new sections, 222A-222E, into the principal Act in respect of a new tax regime for financial leases and is consequent on the Budget announcement to treat such leases as loans for tax purposes and to allow depreciation allowances to the lessee rather than the lessor. Basically, taxpayers will be required to apply standard accounting practice in returning income from financial leases for tax purposes.

Because of the complexity of some lease agreements to which this new legislation will apply it has been necessary to spell out in some detail the definition of certain terms and care should be exercised in interpreting the legislation and understanding these notes.

**(b) Types of Leases subject to new legislation**

Section 37 introduces a new tax regime in respect of a "specified lease" which is a defined term. Any lease which is not a specified lease, will, subject to the new section 222E, continue to be treated for tax purposes as before.

A specified lease is basically a financial lease in accounting terms. However, the definition for tax purposes is not exactly the same in all circumstances and it is quite possible for a taxpayer to treat a lease as an operating lease (ie, not a financial lease) for his own purposes yet have it treated as a specified lease for tax purposes.

A financial lease is in effect no more than a mechanism for the purchase of the asset. The lessee under such a lease uses the asset for most, if not all, of its economic life and carries (or indemnifies the lessor for) all the financial risks and rewards of ownership. The finance lease is merely an alternative method of financing the purchase of the asset. The effect is exactly the same as an outright purchase utilising 100 percent borrowed funds. The lessor essentially makes a loan to the lessee of the cost of the asset and charges interest in a similar manner to that chargeable under a table mortgage. In other words interest is calculated on the outstanding loan at the commencement of each instalment period. The lessee makes repayments of the loan capital and interest in the form of lease rentals over the lease term.

The normal financial leases deal with long term leases of plant and machinery while an operating lease is for a short term. An example of a financial lease would be the lease of a major item of plant and machinery from a bank while the short term hire contracts offered by Hire Pool or Hertz/Avis rental cars are typical operating leases.

### 2\. Application

The new legislation on specified leases applies to any lease entered into on or after 6 august 1982. If the lease agreement was completed and executed by the lessee or lessor prior to that date the current tax treatment will apply to any income or expenditure arising from that lease up until that lease has expired. This means that leases entered into prior to the 1982 Budget will be allowed to run their course under the existing tax treatment.

It should be noted that there is no transitional provision contained in section 37 and consequently all leases "entered into" (which will generally be when the lease agreement is signed, as at all prior times the parties have an opportunity to change the terms of the agreement) on or after 6 August 1982 will be subject to the new tax treatment. For example, an agreement in which the parties had documented all the terms of the lease before 6 August but had not signed it until that date would be subject to the new tax treatment.

### 3\. Section 222A - Interpretation

This section defines many terms for the purpose of this section and the other sections in respect of leasing, ie, sections 222B, 222C, 222D and 222E.

Some of the definitions are self-explanatory but others require some elaboration.

1.  "Cost Price" - This definition is crucial to the new tax treatment of specified leases as it enables the determination of the total interest over the lease term and is also the bases for depreciation claims by the lessee. The cost price of an asset subject to a lease is:
    1.  The cost of acquisition and installation of the asset to the lessor. This will be the general case as the lessor will be required to purchase the asset in order to lease it in most instances; or
    2.  Where the lessor manufactures, assembles or distributes assets and also offers leasing of the same assets as an alternative to outright purchase, the cost price for the lease shall be the normal selling price of the asset that would apply if the lessee had purchased the asset; or
    3.  Where the asset subject to the lease has been used by the lessor in the production of assessable income prior the commencement of the lease the cost price shall be the tax book value at the commencement of the lease term.

It should be noted that if (ii) applies, the specified lease is deemed a sale to the lessee for tax purposes and will therefore be a sale of trading stock and any profit arising from that sale will be income to the lessor in the year the asset is first used.Where a lease asset is acquired by the lessor in his capacity as a lessee (ie where the lessor leases the lease asset from one person and leases it to another person) under a specified lease, the cost price to him is the same cost price that applies to the lessor in the head lease.

2.  "Initial period" is the period of hire that runs from the start of the lease until the first instalment is payable.
3.  "Instalment" is any payment made by the lessor, whether it is payment of interest, capital, or both.
4.  "Instalment period" is the period of time between instalments. Note that for the purposes of the definition of outstanding balance the initial period is included in the meaning of instalment period.
5.  "Lease" includes any hire or bailment or sublease. It will include therefore a financial lease, an operating lease and a hire purchase contract which involves a lease asset as defined.
6.  "Lease Asset" means any personal property other than livestock or bloodstock.The new legislation will therefore not apply to any lease of real property, ie, land and buildings,
7.  "Lease payment" includes any payment, whether in cash or kind made by the lessee under the lease.
8.  "Lease term" is the time from the commencement of the lease until the expiry of the lease. This is the period of time specified in the lease itself and does not include any period of time for which the lessee may have the option to renew the lease. In cases where the lease is for an indefinite period of time, the lease term is taken as that period of time during which the lessee cannot withdraw from or cancel the lease without incurring a penalty. A common situation is for the lease to be of an indefinite period of time but the lessee may cancel the lease by giving one month's notice of his intention to do so. In this situation the lease term (subject to any penalty) would be one month for the purpose of this section.
9.  "Outstanding balance" is basically the amount of principal outstanding in respect of the initial period or any instalment period. It is simply:
    1.  The total amount of principal deemed to be advanced as a loan since the commencement of the lease; plus
    2.  The total interest payable in respect of all previous instalment periods and the initial period; less
    3.  The total amount of previous instalments paid by the lessee (ie comprising principal and/or interest).

10.  "Specified Lease" defines the type of lease which is subject to the new tax treatment. A specified lease is any lease where:
    1.  There is a guaranteed residual value clause present. A guaranteed residual value is one where the lease states a value, as agreed between the lessor and the lessee, which the lessor is assured or guaranteed to receive for the lease asset on the expiry of the lease term: or
    2.  Any lease where the lease term is for more than three years, and
        1.  Ownership of the lease asset is transferred to the lessee at the end of the lease term; or
        2.  The lessee has the option to buy the lease asset at the end of the lease term at a price which is significantly lower than a fair market value at that time; or
        3.  The total lease payments exceed the cost price; or
        4.  The lessee is required to pay for all the costs associated with the repair and maintenance of the lease asset: or
    3.  Any lease where the ownership of the lease asset is acquired by the lessee subsequent to expiry or interim termination of the lease.

11.  Comment
    1.  Leases without a guaranteed residual value and a term of less than 3 years may be specified leases provided the economic life of the lease asset is less than 3 years and the lease term is the same as that economic life. The economic life is regarded as the useful life of the asset for normal business purposes.
    2.  Subpargaraph (B) of the definition refers to a bargain purchase option. The option price must be one which, at the commencement of the lease, is obviously lower than a reasonable valuation of the asset at the end of the lease term and such that the lessee would be able to purchase the lease asset at only a nominal sum.
    3.  Subparagraphs (C) and (D) refer to "a small extent less than" and "or nearly all" respectively. This means that if, for instance, the lease payments are one dollar short of the cost price, and the lease term is in excess of 3 years, the lease is still to be regarded as a specified lease. There is no intention to place a hard and fast rule on these circumstances, but if the lease is one in which there appears to be a deliberate attempt to draft the terms of the lease so that one or other of these two subparagraphs does not apply by virtue of only very small margin the lease is to be considered a specified lease.
    4.  Lease assets subsequently acquired by lessee - There is provision to treat a lease as a specified lease if the lease asset is subsequently acquired by the lessee. The provision means that a lease will be a specified lease if:
        *   There is a compulsory purchase clause irrespective of the lease term.
        *   The lessee subsequently purchases the asset after the lease has expired or the asset is purchased by an associated person.

This provision is basically to ensure that if the lease asset is acquired by the lessee the lease will be treated as a specified lease, ie, it was always intended that the lease was only a means of financing the asset. The effect of this provision is that any hire purchase contract will fall within the definition of a specified lease and the income derived from such contracts for tax purposes will be accounted for as a "receivable" and calculated on a diminishing principal basis or by a commercially accepted method approved by the Commissioner. This will mean that the interest derived on hire purchase contracts will no longer be accepted on the average basis for tax purposes.

12.  Section 222A(2)If more than one lease is executed in respect of the same lease asset, and the same lessee (or related person), the leases to run consecutively, the series of leases are to be treated as one lease for tax purposes.
13.  Section 222A(3)This is the normal subsection which relates the accounting year to the income year.

### 4\. Section 222B - Effect of Specified Lease

**_(a) Sections 222B(1) - (4)_**

This section deems a specified lease to be a sale of the lease asset for tax purposes to the lessee at the commencement of the lease and a resale of the lease asset back to the lessor at the expiry of the lease. The lessor is deemed to have advanced a loan of an amount equal to the cost price to the lessee who in turn is deemed to have applied the loan in respect of the purchase from the lessor and incurred capital expenditure of the same amount.

Section 222B also sets out the basis for determining the deemed resale price of the lease asset to the lessor at the end of the lease term or earlier if the lease is terminated.

The effect of this section is that the tax treatment of a specified lease will be no different from a situation in which the lessee purchased the asset and later sold it. The lessee, provided the asset is used in the production of assessable income, may then claim depreciation allowances and any such allowances allowed will be adjusted, if required on the disposal of the asset. The lessor is expressly excluded from claiming any depreciation allowances.

**_(b) Lease Asset purchased by Lessee at end of lease under the terms of the lease_**

These situations are not expected to pose any problems. The lessee merely continues to depreciate the asset at the tax scale rates as there is no deemed sale to the lessor at the end of the lease term. In other words the tax treatment is exactly the same as a deferred purchase, ie, the sale is recognised at the commencement of the lease.

**_(c) Section 222B(5)_**

Lease asset reverts to Lessor at end of lease under the term of the lease

The lease asset is deemed to be sold by the lessee to the lessor at an amount equal to the guaranteed residual value (GRV) or in the case of no GRV, an amount equal to zero. This is the preliminary step to establishing the deemed sale price subject to subsection (7) of section 222B.

**_(d) Section 222B(6) - Termination of lease before the end of the lease term_**

Section 222B(6) applies to the situation where a specified lease is terminated prior to the expiry of the lease term. In this situation the lease asset is deemed to be sold for an amount equal to the outstanding balance (ie the amount of the loan principal outstanding) less any amount payable by the lessee in consideration for the termination of the lease.

Where the amount payable by the lessee to terminate a lease exceeds the outstanding balance at the time of termination, the lease asset is deemed to be sold to the lessor for no consideration and the excess is assessable income of the lessor in the income year in which the lease is terminated.

**_(e) Section 222B(7) - Deemed Sale on the Expiry of the Lease_**

This subsection relates to the normal situation when a specified lease has gone the full lease term and the lease asset has reverted back to the lessor. The deemed sale price to the lessor by the lessee at the end of the lease term under section 222B(5) may be altered by this subsection if the lessor disposes of the asset.

The effect of this subsection is as follows:

1.  Where the consideration for the disposal exceeds the amount of the deemed sale under subsection (5), the deemed sale price is increased by the amount of the excess paid to the lessee.
2.  Where the consideration for the disposal is less than the deemed sale price under subsection (5), and the lessee is required to make a further payment equal to the difference under a GRV clause, the deemed sale price is reduced by the amount of that payment.
3.  If the consideration for disposal exceeds the deemed sale price under subsection (5), any amount of the excess not paid to the lessee is assessable income of the lessor in the income year the lease expires.

The deemed sale price (adjusted if applicable) on the expiry or termination of the special lease is the basis on which any depreciation allowances claimed by the lessee will be adjusted. The example given in the Addendum to this Appendix sets out this procedure.

**_(f) Section 222B(8) - Purchase and Resale of Lease Asset by Lessee_**

This subsection is a similar provision to that in section 107 of the principal Act. Where a lessee purchases the lease asset and subsequently sells it for an amount greater than that for which he purchased it, the excess will be assessable income of the lessee in the income year the asset is sold by the lessee. The usual associated persons test also applies.

### 5\. Section 222C - Income of Lessor

**_(a) Section 222C(1) - Income from specified lease is interest_**

This new section sets out the income position of a lessor in any specified lease. For the purposes of the Act the income derived from a specified lease is deemed to be interest.

**_(b) Section 222C(2) - Amount of Interest_**

The total interest payable is that amount by which the total lease payments exceed the cost price. It does not matter for what purpose the payments under the lease are made or what they are called. For tax purposes the income from the lease is everything in excess of the cost price. (The lessor is excluded from claiming depreciation allowances in respect of the lease asset.)

The total interest is then allocated to each lease payment or instalment. This section allows an option in the calculation of the allocation of interest to each instalment but overall it must be on a diminishing principal basis if the lease payment contains some element of repayment of the loan. Most specified leases will require a repayment of principal and interest in each instalment. Those which have deferred capital payments will be in respect of major capital acquisitions and terms of the lease will be quite explicit on this point.

The options to allocate interest to instalments are:

1.  The most common method of calculating interest by lessors is the actuarial (or annuity) method and is the basis of the interest calculation required by this section in the first instance. This method is the one used by financial institutions and the interest is based on the capital outstanding at the time of each instalment. As the loan principal is reduced by repayments so does the interest content of each instalment. This method of calculating interest on a diminishing loan principal basis is similar to that used table mortgage.
2.  The Commissioner can approve an alternative method of allocating interest to instalments where that alternative is a method in common commercial usage and it gives a fair and reasonable approximation to the method required in (a) above. At this stage the only alternative method approved is the use of the Rule of 78. This alternative method is only approved when the lease meets the following criteria:
    1.  The lease term is 5 years or less.
    2.  All the instalments are of an equal amount other than the final instalment which must be within 5 percent of all other instalments.
    3.  All instalments are payable on a regular basis, i e, weekly, monthly, six monthly, etc.

Once the interest has been allocated to the initial or any instalment period it is deemed to be derived in the income year in which that initial period or instalment period ends. This means that the income in any income year is the interest in respect of the instalments payable in the same income year.

### 6\. Section 222D - Deduction to Lessee

The lessee is only allowed a deduction in respect of expenditure incurred pursuant to the lease to the extent of the interest content allocated to the instalments which are payable by him in the income year. If the lessor and lessee operate different balance dates it is possible that in any particular tax year the interest returned by the lessor as income will be different from that claimed as a deduction by the lessee. This arises because there may be:

1.  A different number of instalments in the particular income year of the lessor as opposed to the lessee.
2.  A different method of allocating interest to instalments.

The lessee may choose to use a method of allocating interest to instalments, different to that used by the lessor, ie, he may use a method approved by the Commissioner such as the "Rule of 78". This is in fact the principal reason for allowing an option as most lessees, while they know the total interest being paid over the lease term, may not have access to the expertise required to calculate interest under the actuarial method. The rule of 78 offers a simple and reasonable alternative. Those leases where the "Rule of 78" is not appropriate will be those involving larger sums of money and where the lessee has the expertise to allocate on the actuarial basis or in fact knows in advance how each lease payment is structured on that basis.

### 7\. Section 222E - Non-Specified Leases

This section overrides section 104 of the principal Act in that, irrespective of when the lessee incurs the expenditure in relation to a lease (which is not a specified lease), the expenditure shall be deemed to apply to the whole lease term and shall be deemed to be incurred during the lease term in accordance with the following formula:

**(a / b) x c**

| Where - |     |
| --- | --- |
| a   | is that part of the lease term that falls within the income year |
| b   | is the lease term |
| c   | is the total lease payments in respect of the lease |

For administrative purposes the Department will not always insist on the calculation being made on an exact basis calculated in days. It will be sufficient in leases with regular instalments of the same amount that (a) and (b) reflect the number of instalments in the income year and the total number of instalments respectively.

This new section applies to all leases of personal property (including livestock or bloodstock) but not to leases of real property).

### 8\. Consequential Amendments

This section also consequentially amends section 118 of the principal Act which details the general provisions relating investment allowances.

Subsection (2) repeals the definition of the term "residual value" in section 118, which is no longer required. This term was previously only referred to in the definition of "qualifying lease" but as a result of changes made to that definition (see subsection (3) below), the term is no longer needed.

Subsection (3) amends the definition of the term "qualifying lease" in section 118, to refer to any specified lease (as defined in section 222A).

These changes apply to every lease entered into on or after 6 August 1982. However, by virtue of subsection (5), the old definition of "qualifying lease" will satisfy the requirements of claims for the regional, export and fishing investment allowances where the lease comes within the transitional provisions contained in sections 19, 20 and 21 of this Amendment. It should be noted that this relaxation only applies for the purposes of these investment allowance claims, but does not affect the tax treatment to be given to the lease itself.

ADDENDUM
--------

Example of Specified Lease
--------------------------

**Data**

"A" (lessee) leases a computer from "B" (lessor).

Cost price $1,100,000; installation costs $100,507.65

Lease term is 5 years with guaranteed residual value (GRV) of $200,000.

The lease provides for 10 six-monthly rental payments of $191,801.48

**Calculations (using Actuarial Method)**

| Instalment | Capital \*1 | Interest \*1 | Depreciation \*2 | Book Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | 59,800.69 | 132,000.79 |     |     |
| 2   | 66,888.20 | 124,913.28 | 300,126.95 | 900,380.70 |

|     | $1,000,507.65 | 917,507.15 |     |     |
| GRV | 200,000.00 |     |     |     |
| Cost Price | $1,200,507.65 |     |     |     |

**Notes**

1.  The apportionments between capital and interest have been calculated using actuarial tables.
2.  Depreciation on the computer has been claimed at maximum tax rates of 25 percent (first year) and 20 percent diminishing value thereafter. Annual depreciation claims are shown. Most items of plant would only qualify for 10 percent DV in Year 2 onwards.

Using the above information, the tax treatment to be applied in several situations is shown overleaf. The following examples are based on the actuarial method of allocating interest to instalments.

1.  **Lease asset sold at end of lease term for $500,000**
    1.  If none of the sale proceeds are returned to the lessee the deemed sale price under section 222B(5)(a) is $200,000 (the guaranteed residual value) and:
        *   The lessor is assessed on $300,000 (being the sale price of $500,000 less the GRV of $200,000) in the year in which the lease expires.
        *   The lessee is allowed a loss on sale of $168,795.94 (ie closing book value ($368,795.94) less GRV ($200,000)).
    2.  The normal situation would be the return of $300,000 from the sale proceeds by the lessor to the lessee.The deemed sale price in this case is:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
|     | $200,000 - section 222B(5)(a) |
| Plus | $300,000 - section 222B(7)(a) |
|     | $500,000 |

There is no effect on the lessor but the lessee will be subject to recovery of depreciation allowances of $131,204.06 ($500,000 deemed sale price less closing book value of $368,795.94) under the provisions of section 117.

**Lease terminated and asset sold for $500,000**

If we assume the lease was cancelled after instalment 7, the lessee paying a penalty of $210,000, section 222B(6) applies. The deemed sale price to the lessor is:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cost Price | $1,200,507.65 |     |
| Less capital repayments | (585,562.09) | (instalments 1 to 7) |
| Less payment to cancel | (210,000.00) |     |
|     | $404,945.51 |     |

The lessee would be allowed a loss on sale of $171,298.14. (Book value at time of termination $576,243.65 less deemed sale price $404,945.51).

The lessor on the sale of the asset for $500,000 would be assessable on $95,054.49 ($500,000 received less the deemed sale price of $404,945.51) under section 65(2)(a) as profits arising from the business of lending.

**Lease terminated and asset sold to the lessee**

Using the same information as in (b) above, if the lease asset was sold to the lessee the same procedures will apply as set out in (a) above. The cost price for tax purposes to the lessee after the purchase will be the purchase price.

APPENDIX F
----------

### Section 38 - Film Owners

This section inserts three new sections which set out the tax treatment to be applied to owners of films. These are as follows:

**Section 224A - Costs of Acquiring Any Film or Any Right in Any Film**

_Subsection (1) - Definitions_

"Broadcaster" means a person who operates a television station or network or a cable television system. It is designed to cover TVNZ and any other person who is in the business of television broadcasting.

"Completed", in relation to a film, means that the film has been completed to the double head finecut stage of production (as defined in this subsection) or equivalent production stage.

"Copyright" is defined simply for the purposes of clarifying the definition of the term "right". For the purposes of this section, the expression "copyright", in relation to any film, is defined as including all rights and choses in action in, or in relation to:

*   the film,
*   the prints of the film,
*   publicity material in relation to the film,
*   all other tangible assets in relation to the film.

"Cost of Acquisition" - This expression is used throughout the section for references to the amount paid by the owner of a film to enable that person to become possessed of that film or any rights therein. It means:

1.  In the case of an owner who invested in the actual production of the film, that person's share of that cost of production.
2.  In the case of an owner who purchased the film or the right in a film, the purchase price.

"Cost of Production" is defined for the purposes of the definition of the expression "cost of acquisition". It means the total costs involved in producing the film, whether incurred before or after the completion of the film. This means that all pre-production and production costs are included, together with those post-production costs which are related to the actual production of the film (as opposed to those associated with marketing the film). This would include such post-production costs as:

*   Taking the film from the double head finecut stage to the stage where it is ready for distribution to cinemas.
*   Costs of converting the film from 18mm gauge to 35mm.
*   Costs of adapting the film for overseas exhibition, such as dubbing or cutting. (These cannot be said to be marketing costs. Although it would be difficult to market the film without changes being made, the costs are in fact costs of production of the film for its exhibition in a specific market, not costs of selling to that market.)

Costs directly associated with marketing or selling the film do not come within the definition. These costs are allowable in the year incurred in terms of the general legislation.

"Depreciation Loss" means the amount of depreciation which would have been allowable as a deduction in a particular year had section 108 of the principal Act applied in respect of the assets used in the production of the film. The amount of the depreciation loss to be included in the accumulated cost of production figure (which will be spread upon the completion of the film) is the sum of the amounts of depreciation which would have been allowable in the years up to and including the year of completion had a current year deduction for depreciation been allowable in each of those years.

"Double Head Finecut Stage of Production" means the stage of production where the film has been completely edited, shot by shot, to its final length.

"Feature Film" means a film produced for, primarily and principally, exhibition in a cinema being a film which:

*   is to be exhibited in a cinema in 35 millimetre gauge, and
*   will have a continuous running time of not less than 75 minutes when exhibited in a cinema.

It does not include films made primarily and principally for television broadcast.

"Film" means a cinematograph film; and includes a videotape, any other material record of visual moving images that is capable of being used for the subsequent projection of those images in a fixed sequence on to any screen; and also includes any copy of the whole or any part of that film; but does not include:

1.  an advertising film or a commercial;
2.  a film which the Commissioner determines commenced on or before the 5th of August 1982.

This definition is designed to cover all films, including animated films, films of sporting events, documentaries, etc, and also includes videotapes, video cassettes and discs, audio-visual presentations and other similar property.

"Film Expenditure" means expenditure of a revenue nature which is allowable as a deduction under the general provisions of the principal Act; and includes any loss allowable under section 104 and any depreciation loss as defined in this section.

"Film Owner" is the person who owns the film or any rights to the film.

"Residual Value" means the total costs of acquiring a film which have been incurred at any time prior to the end of the income year, reduced by the amounts of the cost of acquisition of that film which have been written off in previous years.

The following example shows how the residual value is calculated.

| Year Ending | Production Costs for Year | Total Production Costs to Date | Amount Claimed in previous Year | Residual Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 31.3.83 | $ 600,000 | $ 600,000 | \-  | $ 600,000 |
| 31.3.84 | $1,800,000 | $2,400,000 | \-  | $2,400,000 |
| 31.3.85 | $600,000 | $3,000,000 | $400,000 | $2,600,000 |
| 31.3.86 | \-  | $3,000,000 | $1,560,000 | $l,040,000 |
| 31.3.87 | \-  | $3,000,000 | $1,040,000 | \-  |

(Note: This example assumes the film was a feature film which was completed in December 1983.)

"Right" in relation to any film, means any copyright (as defined in this section) and any licence in respect thereof and any other right which subsists in or attaches to the film (including any right to income from the film) and includes any equitable right. This means that the definition covers all rights associated with a film.

"Specified Deduction" sets out the formula for calculating the amount of the deduction for the cost of producing or purchasing a feature film (or purchasing a right in a feature film) which may be claimed as a deduction in any particular year. The formula, which gives effect to the 24 month write off allowed under subsection (5), is:

**(X / Y) x Z**

| Where - |     |
| --- | --- |
| X   | is, in the case of a film which was completed during the income year, the number of complete months in that income year from and including the month in which the film was completed. Where the film was completed in a year preceding the income year under consideration, X is the number of complete months in that income year. |
| Y   | is 24 reduced by the number of complete months in the period commencing on the first day of the month in which the film was completed, and ending on the last day of the preceding income year. |
| Z   | is the amount of the residual value. |

For example, if we use the figures contained in the example given in the commentary on the definition of residual value, the specified deduction calculations are as follows:

| Year ending 31.3.84 |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| X   |     | \=  | sum of the months of December (month of completion of the film) January, February and March - ie, 4 complete months. |     |
| Y   |     | \=  | 24 (Film was completed during the current income year so there is no reduction in this figure.) |     |
| Z   |     | \=  | $2,400,000 (Residual value for this year). |     |
| Therefore, the specified deduction for the year ending 31.3.84 is: |     |     |     |     |
| 4   | x   | $2,400,000 | \= $400,000 |
| 24  | 1   |
| Year ending 31.3.85 |     |     |     |     |
| X   |     | \=  | Full 12 month period, ie, 12 complete months. |     |
| Y   |     | \=  | 24 reduced by the 4 complete months which expired in the previous year between 1.12.83 and 31.3.84, ie Y = 20. |     |
| Z   |     | \=  | $2,600,000 (Residual value for this year). |     |
| Therefore the specified deduction for the year ending 31.3.85 is: |     |     |     |     |
| 12  | x   | $2,600,000 | \= $1,560,000 |
| 20  | 1   |
| Year ending 31.3.86 |     |     |     |     |
| X   |     | \=  | 12 (number of complete months in the year) |     |
| Y   |     | \=  | 24 reduced by 16 complete months which expired in the previous years between 1.12.83 and 31.3.85, ie, Y = 8 |     |
| Z   |     | \=  | $1,040,000 |     |
| The specified deduction for the year ending 31.3.86 is: |     |     |     |     |
| 12  | x   | $1,040,000 | \= $1,560,000 |
| 8   | 1   |
| (Note: The actual deduction allowable for this year is limited to the residual value of $1,040,000 in terms of subsection (5) of this section.) |     |     |     |     |

It should also be noted that the calculations in X and Y are based on complete months. This means that if, in the above example, the film production business had a balance date of 20 March, then the calculations for each year would be as follows:

| Year ending | Specified Deduction Calculation |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 20.3.84 | 3   | x   | $2,400,000 | \=  | $300,000 |
| 24  | 1   |
| 20.3.85 | 12  | x   | $2,700,000 | \=  | $1,542,857 |
| 21  | 1   |
| 20.3.86 | Claim Residual Value of $1,157,143 |     |     |     |     |

**Subsection (2)**

Provides that the allowance of a deduction for the cost of producing a film, or the cost of acquiring a film or any right in a film, is governed by the provisions of this section and (apart from section 106A) where there is any conflict between this section and any other section of the Act, the provisions of this section take precedence.

When considering the effect of this subsection, it is important to note that subsection (3) restricts the application of the section to film owners (as defined) and that the provisions of subsection (2) will apply to those persons only. For example, subsection (3) does not include a person who produces a film as a service for another and never obtains ownership of any right in that film. For this reason the cost of producing that film, to the extent that it is incurred by that person, does not come within the provisions of subsection (2). On the other hand, the person for whom that film is being produced (the film owner) would be a person to whom subsection (3) applies and accordingly the cost of production incurred by that person would come within the provisions of subsection (2).

The proviso to subsection (2) excludes broadcasters (as defined) from the provisions of subsection (2) in respect of the cost of producing a film, or acquiring a film or any right therein, where the film was produced or acquired primarily and principally to enable that broadcaster to broadcast that film in New Zealand. This exclusion does not apply to films produced or acquired with the dual intention of broadcast in New Zealand and sale overseas; nor does it apply to films produced for cinema release which are also broadcast on New Zealand television. To come within the proviso, any intention other than to broadcast the film on television in New Zealand must be of a minor and supplementary nature.

Those films which do come within the proviso are not covered by subsection (2). The costs of producing or acquiring such films fall to be considered under the general legislation.

**Subsection (3)**

Sets out the films and film owners to which the section applies. It provides that the section shall apply in relation to any film, and to any film owner who:

1.  becomes a film owner by reason of being the person who first owns a right in the film and who, before owning that right, incurred expenditure directly in the production of that film, or
2.  being a film owner other than one referred to in paragraph (a) above, incurs expenditure in purchasing or otherwise acquiring a film or a right in that film.

This means, in effect, that the section applies to any person who, whether through direct contribution towards production or through any other means of acquisition, becomes the owner of a film or any right in a film.

The proviso excludes broadcasters from the provisions of the section in relation to the costs of acquiring or producing any film (or any right therein) to which the proviso to subsection (2) of this section applies.

**Subsection (4)**

Simply prevents a taxpayer from claiming a double deduction for expenditure to which this section applies. It provides that where a film owner incurs expenditure which is either allowable as a deduction under this section or in respect of which depreciation loss is allowable, no further deduction may be claimed under any of the other provisions of the Act (including the investment allowance provisions) in respect of that expenditure.

**Subsection (5)**

Governs the allowance of a deduction for the cost of producing or acquiring any feature film or any right in any feature film. It provides that no deduction may be allowed until the year in which the film is completed (as defined). Costs incurred up to that date are accumulated and the total allowed rateably over the 24 month period commencing with the month in which the film was completed. The amount allowable in the year of completion and subsequent years is calculated on the basis of the formula contained in the definition of specified deduction, but is limited to the amount of the specified deduction for that income year or the residual value in relation to that income year.

An example of how subsection (5) will operate in practice is set out below:

| Year ending 31 March 1983 |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cost of production |     |     |     |     |     | $600,000 |
| Allowable Deduction |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| None of this amount is allowable as a deduction in this year because the film was not completed prior to the end of the year. |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| Year ending 31 March 1984 |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| Costs of production incurred during the year |     |     |     |     |     | $1,800,000 |
| Marketing costs incurred during the year |     |     |     |     |     | $ 150,000 |
| Film completed (double head finecut) on 14 December 1983. |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| (Accumulated production costs to date ie, residual value $2,400,000) |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| Allowable Deduction |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| Production Costs |     | 4   | x   | $2,400,000 | \=  | $400,000 |
|     |     | 24  | 1   |
| Add marketing costs incurred during year |     |     |     |     |     | $150,000 |
|     | Allowable as a deduction |     |     |     |     | $550,000 |
| Year ending 31 March 1985 |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| Cost of production incurred during the year |     |     |     |     |     | $600,000 |
| Marketing costs incurred during the year |     |     |     |     |     | $100,000 |
| (Accumulated production costs not yet written off ie, residual value - $2,600,000.) |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| Allowable Deduction |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| Production Costs |     | 12  | x   | $2,600,000 | \=  | $1,560,000 |
|     |     | 20  | 1   |
| Add marketing costs incurred during year |     |     |     |     |     | $150,000 |
|     |
|     | Allowable as a deduction |     |     |     |     | $1,710,000 |
| Year ending 31 March 1986 |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| Cost of production incurred during the year |     |     |     |     |     | Nil |
| Marketing costs incurred during the year |     |     |     |     |     | $70,000 |
| (Accumulated production costs not yet written off ie. residual value - $1,040,000) |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| Allowable Deduction |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| LESSER OF: |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| Specified Deduction of |     | 12  | x   | $1,040,000 | \=  | $1,560,000 |
|     |     | 8   | 1   |
| OR  |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| Residual Value of $1,040,000 |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| Production costs allowable as a deduction |     |     |     |     |     | $1,040,000 |
| Add marketing costs incurred during the year |     |     |     |     |     | $70,000 |
|     | Allowable as a deduction |     |     |     |     | $1,110,000 |

For 1987 and future years, costs are allowable as incurred.

The proviso permits a higher portion of costs to be written off in any year where the income derived from the film (or any right in the film) in that year exceeds the specified deduction which would otherwise be allowable. Where such an excess occurs, this proviso increases the amount allowable as a deduction in that year to the lesser of:

*   the residual value of that film (or any right in that film) in relation to that year, and
*   income derived from the sale, use, rental or other exploitation of that film (or any right in that film) during that year.

In practical terms this means that if, in the example outlined above, the film earned $2.5 million in the year ending 31 March 1984 and $200,000 in the year ending 31 March 1985, the amounts allowable as a deduction in each of those years would be as follows:

**Year ending 31 March 1984**

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Accumulated production costs to 31 March 1984 | $2,400,000 |
| Marketing costs for year | $150,000 |

Film completed (double head finecut) on 14 December 1983.

Specified deduction is $400,000

Allowable Deduction

As the income from the film exceeds the specified deduction, the amount allowable as a deduction is the lesser of:

*   the residual value - $2,400,000
*   the income from the film - $2,500,000

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Production Costs allowable as a deduction | $2,400,000 |
| Add marketing costs | $150,000 |
| Total Allowable Deduction | $2,550,000 |

**Year ending 31 March 1985**

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Cost of production incurred during the year | $600,000 |
| Marketing costs incurred during the year | $100,000 |

**Allowable Deduction**

Specified Deduction (12 / 20) x ($600,000 / 1) = $360,000

As the income from the film ($200,000) is less than the specified deduction, the allowable deduction for the year is:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Production Costs (specified deduction) | $360,000 |
| Marketing Costs | $100,000 |
| Total Allowable Deduction | $460,000 |

**Year ending 31 March 1986**

The balance of production costs (residual value) of $240,000 plus marketing costs of $70,000 give a total allowable deduction for this year of $310,000.

**Subsection (6)**

Governs the allowance of a deduction for the cost of producing or acquiring a film other than a feature film or any right in a film other than a feature film. It provides that no deduction may be allowed until the year in which the film is completed (as defined). Costs incurred up to that date are accumulated and the total allowed over a two year period, 50 percent in the income year in which the film is completed and the balance in the following year.

The proviso permits more than 50 percent of the costs to be written off in the year of completion (or acquisition) where the income from the film (or from any right therein) which was derived in that year exceeds that 50 percent deduction which would otherwise be allowable under this subsection. Where such an excess occurs, this proviso increases the amount allowable as a deduction in that year to the lesser of:

*   the total cost of acquisition which was incurred by the taxpayer prior to the end of that income year; or
*   the income from the sale, use, rental or other exploitation of that film (or that right) which was derived during that income year.

Any portion of the cost of acquisition which is not allowed in the year of completion of the film (or year of acquisition) is allowable in the following year. The maximum allowable for the two income years is, of course, the total cost of acquisition incurred prior to the end of the income year following the year of completion of the film (or, as the case may be, the total cost of acquisition incurred prior to the end of the income year following the year of acquisition).

**Subsection (7)**

Provides that where a taxpayer (who is a film owner) sells or, by any other means or because of any other circumstances, ceases to own a film and/or every right in a film, the balance of the cost of acquisition which has not previously been allowed as a deduction may be claimed in the year in which the taxpayer ceases to own that film or those rights.

It is important to note that the taxpayer must dispose of all rights in the film which are in his possession before the deduction is allowable under this section. If, for example, the owner of three distinct rights in the film sold the two most valuable rights and retained one right which was of only minor importance, subsection (7) could not be applied. Similarly, if a person owned a right in a film at the commencement of the year, sold it during the year, and later in that same year purchased a further right in that film, the balance of the cost of acquisition of that right which was sold during the year could not be written off under this subsection. The cost of acquisition of each right would have to be considered under subsection (5) or subsection (6) because the taxpayer, at the end of the year, had not ceased to own every right which was in his possession at any time during that income year as required by subsection (7).

**Subsection (8)**

Sets out the basis on which a deduction is allowable for deferred fees and similar types of expenditure. It provides that where, in relation to a person who invests in the production of a film:

*   an amount (referred to as the "specified amount") is contributed by the taxpayer or is contingently liable to be contributed in payment towards the cost of producing that film; and
*   all or any of that specified amount relates to the provision of goods or the supply of services; and
*   the liability for payment of the cost of those goods or services has, in terms of an agreement entered into between the supplier and any other person, been deferred; and
*   the period between the time of the provision of those services or the supply of those goods and the time of the payment of the cost thereof is, in the opinion of the Commissioner, excessive, or the liability for payment of that cost is dependent on a contingency,

The expenditure in the acquiring of those services or those goods shall be deemed to be incurred at the time or times of the making of that payment or those payments.

This means that deferred fees, and other costs of producing a film for which payment is deferred beyond the period in which it would, in accordance with normal commercial practice, normally have been payable, are not allowable as a deduction until the year in which payment is made.

**Subsection (9)**

Provides that where, in relation to any taxpayer who invests in the production of a film, the Commissioner is satisfied, having regard to the relationship between the film owner and the person who supplies goods or services which are used in the production of the film (or to any other relevant circumstances) that:

1.  the film owner and the supplier were not dealing with each other at arm's length, and
2.  the expenditure incurred by the owner exceeds the amount which would have been incurred had the film owner and the supplier dealt with each other on an arm's length basis,

then the amount allowable as a deduction will be limited to the amount which the Commissioner considers might have been expected to have been incurred if the film owner and the supplier had dealt with each other at arm's length.

Effectively, this subsection prevents arrangements from being entered into for the purposes of artificially inflating the cost of producing a film. It limits the amount allowable as a deduction to that which would be expected to have been paid in a normal commercial negotiation entered into between parties acting on an arm's length basis.

**Subsection (10)**

Enables the Commissioner to determine the depreciation to be recovered where the asset on which the deduction was allowed is either sold or transferred to another activity. The normal rules for recovery of depreciation will be applied.

**Subsection (11)**

Provides that where, in relation to any taxpayer who acquires a film or any right in a film, -

1.  the Commissioner is satisfied, having regard to the relationship between the taxpayer and the person from whom the film or right was purchased, that the taxpayer and that person were not dealing with each other at arm's length (in relation to the purchase); and
2.  the expenditure incurred by the taxpayer in the purchase of the film or the right:
    1.  exceeds the cost to the previous owner; or
    2.  does not exceed the cost to the previous owner but exceeds the value of the film or the right at the time of purchase by the taxpayer,the cost to the taxpayer for the purposes of this section shall be deemed to be the lesser of the cost to the previous owner or the value at the time of purchase by the taxpayer.The proviso simply provides that because the provisions of this subsection also apply where a share in a film or a share in a right is purchased, the Commissioner shall determine the cost of that share or, where appropriate, the value of that share.The subsection is designed to prohibit arrangements from being entered into to artificially inflate the tax deduction which may be claimed for the cost of purchasing a film or any right in a film. It is an anti-avoidance provision which will be applied only where the Commissioner is satisfied that the parties were not dealing with each other on an arm's length basis. It cannot be applied to sales entered into on a normal commercial basis.

**Subsection (12)**

Provides that where a film or any right in a film is purchased together with other property and the purchase price is not apportioned, the Commissioner has the power to determine the amount of that purchase price which relates to the cost of the film or the right. In practice, any reasonable basis of apportionment which fairly reflects the separate values of each item of property will be accepted.

**Subsection (13)**

Is a general anti-avoidance provision which gives the Commissioner power to disallow any excess deduction where he is satisfied that arrangements have been made between the taxpayer claiming the deduction and another person to give an unfair advantage under the section.

**Subsection (14)**

Provides that this section shall apply subject to section 106A of this Act (as inserted by section 15 of this Amendment Act). This means that adjustments required under section 106A must be made before the allowance of any deduction under this section.

**Subsection (15)**

Provides that every reference in this section to an income year shall be deemed to be a reference to the taxpayer's accounting year.

### Section 224B - Income derived from films

**Subsection (1) - Definitions**

"Film" means a cinematograph film; and includes a videotape, and any other material record of visual moving images that is capable of being used for the subsequent projection of those images in a fixed sequence on to any screen; and also includes any part, or any copy or part of a copy of the whole or any part of a film; and also includes any right therein. Unlike the definition in section 224A, this definition does not exclude advertising films or films which commenced before August 1982. It should also be noted that this definition includes any right in a film.

"Film owner" means the person who owns the film.

"Income from a film" means any income derived by the film owner from the sale, use, rental or other exploitation of the film; and includes -

1.  any amount received or receivable by the film owner for the use of, or the right to use, the film or any right therein; and
2.  any amount received or receivable by the film owner for the granting of any licence in respect of any future right in the film; and
3.  any amount received or receivable by the film owner in respect of the -
    *   disposal of, or
    *   assignment of, or
    *   assignment of any right to derive income from the use of any right or any interest in any right in the film.

The definition is designed to cover all income from the sale, use, rental or other exploitation of the film or any right in the film (the right being covered by reason of its inclusion in the definition of "film" for the purposes of this section). If it is found that the definition does not cover a particular source of income, or if any strong doubts exist, the matter should be referred to the Regional Controller.

"Right" means a right as defined in section 224A.

**Subsection (2)**

Provides that the assessable income of a film owner includes all income from a film derived by him in that income year. The purpose of this section is simply to make it quite clear that all income derived from films or rights in any film is assessable income.

### Section 224C - Determination as to Whether a Film Commenced on or Before 5 August 1982

The new sections 106A and 224A apply to films which commenced on or after 5 August 1982, with films which commenced on or before 5 August being considered under the previous legislation. This section sets out the criteria which is to be used by the Commissioner when he determines whether or not a film commenced prior to 6 August 1982.

**Subsection (1)** requires the Commissioner to determine whether a film commenced on or before 5 August 1982. Many producers of films have already written to the Commissioner for such determination, but it should be noted that written applications and approvals are not required by the section. While it is advisable, on the grounds of certainty, for a producer to obtain written approval, in many cases it will be quite clear that the conditions of subsection (2) have been met and the determination required under the section can be made when the return of income for the film production business is furnished.

**Subsection (2)** declares that (without limiting the generality of subsection (1)) the Commissioner shall not make a determination that a film commenced on or before 5 August 1982 unless he is satisfied that:

*   the film had, on or before that date, proceeded beyond the investigatory stages, and
*   a firm commitment to make the film either wholly or partially in New Zealand was clearly evident on or before that date.

**Subsection (3)** places a terminating date on the approval. It provides that where a film has been confirmed as having commenced on or before 5 August 1982, but that film has not been completed on or before:

*   30 September 1984; or
*   such later date as, in the opinion of the Commissioner, is the date before which the film could not reasonably have been expected to have been completed, notwithstanding that the making of the film has st all times proceeded with expedition and is continuing to so proceed,

the film shall be deemed for the purposes of section 106A and 224A not to have commenced on or before 5 August 1982.

Income Tax Amendment Act (No 2) 1983, Supplement 1
==================================================

Archived legislative commentary on the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 2) 1983, Supplement 1 from PIB vol 126, suppl 1 Sep 1984.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 126, Supplement 1, September 1984

[More information about _Public Information Bulletins_.](/about/about-our-publications)
 

### Section 1 - Short Title

This provides for the Amendment Act to be read with and form part of the Income Tax Act 1976.

### Section 2 - Application

The provisions of this Amendment Act apply to tax on income derived in the income year which commenced on the 1st day of April 1983, unless otherwise stated in the Amendment Act.

### Sections 3, 4 and 5 - Definition of "Spouse"

Sections 3, 4 and 5 make amendments to sections 48A, 48B and 50B of the principal Act respectively.

The sections insert into the respective sections of the principal Act a definition of the expression "_spouse_". The definition includes within the meaning of the term "spouse" a man or a woman who has entered into a relationship in the nature of marriage (commonly known as a de facto relationship). The partners in such a relationship will now be treated for the purposes of sections 48A (Rates Rebate), 48B (First Home Mortgage Interest Rebate) and 50B (Principal Income Earner Rebate), in the same manner as a legally married couple.

The effect that the introduction of the definition of "spouse" will have in respect of each of the above rebates is as follows:

### Section 3 - Rates and Chatham Islands Dues Rebate

This section inserts into section 48A of the principal Act the definition of the term "spouse".

The effect of this amendment is that the provision which limits entitlement to the rates rebate to the principal income earner will now apply in relation to both de facto and de jure (legal) marriages. Previously in a de facto relationship the rebate could be apportioned between the partners as they were treated as co-owners.

The new provisions apply from 1 April 1984.

### Section 4 - First Home Mortgage Interest Rebate

This section inserts a definition of "spouse" into section 48B of the principal Act.

There are three situations in which the new definition will affect claims from couples who are living in a relationship in the nature of marriage. These are:

1.  Where a couple are legally married and one partner of the marriage had previously held an interest in a home, both partners are precluded from claiming the rebate. On the other hand, in a de factor relationship, if one partner had previously held an interest in a home, the other partner was entitled to claim the rebate.
    *   The definition of "spouse" will mean that from the application date, 1 April 1984, the couple living in a de facto relationship will now be treated as if they were legally married. Therefore, if one of the partners has had a previous interest in a home then both partners will, from 1 April 1984, be precluded from claiming the rebate.
2.  A legally married couple cannot claim the rebate for more than 5 years. It was however possible in a de factor relationship where neither partner had held a prior interest in a home for one partner to claim the rebate for five years, then sell the property to the other partner who would then claim the rebate for a further 5 years.
    *   The new definition will deem the couple to be married, therefore as one partner has held a prior interest in a home, the other partner is prevented from claiming the rebate for the additional 5 years.
3.  Section 48B provides that in de jure marriages the principal income earner must claim the rebate. This restriction has not applied in de facto marriages and such couples could elect to apportion the rebate entitlement between the 2 partners.
    *   The new definition of spouse will mean that only the principal income earner may claim the rebate.

**Application date**

As with section 3 the application date for the amendment will be 1 April 1984.

### Section 5 - Principal Income Earner Rebate

This section amends section 50B of the principal Act by repealing the definition of spouse and replacing it with a new definition, which is similar to that inserted in sections 48A and 48B by sections 3 and 4 of this Amendment Act.

At present the principal income earner rebate is available to single adults without children and the principal income earner in a married or de facto household without children. It is also available to single adults or a principal income earner in a de jure marriage or a de facto marriage where there are children and the rebate exceeds the amount of the family rebate otherwise available under section 53C of the Act.

The new definition of spouse will prevent the situation arising where the principle income earner in a de facto relationship could claim either the Principal Income Earner Rebate or the Family Rebate (whichever is appropriate), while the other partner could also claim the Principal Income Earner Rebate. Of course, in a de jure marriage the secondary earning spouse is not permitted to claim the Principal Income Earner Rebate. The definition will mean that only the principal income earner in either a de jure or a de facto marriage may claim the Principal Income Earner Rebate.

The new provisions will apply from 1 April 1984.

### Section 6 - Family Rebate

This section gives effect to the changes in the family rebate announced in this year's Budget. These changes affect only the rebate maximum and abatement rates and ranges.

All other features of the family rebate (such as qualifying criteria, determination of the rebate where there is permanent exit/entry from New Zealand, or where a taxpayer dies, during the income year) _remain unchanged_.

**Full Year Amount of Rebate: 1984/85 Year**

From the _1984/85_ income year the amount of the rebate for qualifying taxpayers will be as follows:

*   Where "family income" is up to (and including) $9,800, the rebate will be $1,924;
*   Where "family income" is over $9,800 and up to (and including) $14,000, the rebate will abate by _15 cents_ for each $1 in excess of $9,800;
*   Where "family income" is over $14,000, the rebate will further abate by _20 cents_ for each $1 in excess of $14,000;
*   Where "family income" is over $20,470, _no rebate_ is allowable.

**Amount of Rebate: 1983/84**

The revised structure of the family rebate applies from 1 October 1983. For the _1983/84_income year, therefore, a composite rebate will be allowed as follows:

*   Where "family income" is up to (and including) $9,800, the rebate will be _$1,664_;
*   Where "family income" is over $9,800 and up to (and including) $14,000, the rebate will abate by _15 cents_ for each $1 in excess of $9,800;
*   Where "family income" is over $14,000 and up to (and including) $19,160, the rebate will further abate by _17.5 cents_ for each $1 in excess of $14,000;
*   Where "family income" is over $19,160, the rebate will further abate by _10 cents_ for each $1 in excess of $19,160;
*   Where "family income" is over $20,470, _no rebate_ is allowable.

**PAYE**

The new family rebate structure has been incorporated into the PAYE tables (namely codes "B" to "F") issued for use in pay periods ending on or after 1 October 1983. Those taxpayers currently eligible for the family rebate and operating any one of tax codes "B" to "F" will _not_ need to alter their tax code as a result of the Budget announcement.

**Note** that, as a result of the increase in the upper income limit of the rebate from $19,160 to $20,470, some taxpayers with "family income" in that range will be able to claim some portion of the rebate whereas previously they had been excluded on income-grounds.

### Section 7 - Housekeeper Rebate

This section amends section 54 of the principal Act. The amendment makes it clear that the rebate applies only where a payment is made to a woman or a man who tends the home of the taxpayer where the services are necessary by reason of any mental or physical infirmity or disability of the taxpayer.

Amendments made to section 54 in 1977 in accordance with the Human Rights Commission Act, changed the reference in the section from "a woman who tends the home" to that of a "a person who tends the home". The definition of "person" in section 2 of the principal Act includes a company and an unincorporated body of persons. It had been argued that payments to institutions such as private hospitals and rest homes therefore qualify for the rebate.

As it was not Government's intention that such payments qualify for the rebate, the section has been amended by defining home in such a way as to exclude institutions. The following definitions have been introduced:

1.  "Communal home" - this includes a hotel, motel, boarding house, guest house, convalescent home, nursing home, rest home, hospital, hospice or other similar establishments _but_excludes any part of an establishment that is occupied by a person or the spouse of the person who is engaged in operating the establishment.
2.  "Home" - this is the dwelling which is the residence which is resided in during the income year by the taxpayer _but does not include a communal home_ as defined.

### Section 8 - Application of Tax Codes Specified in Tax Code Declarations or Tax Code Certificates

Section 8 makes the necessary amendments to section 344 of the principal Act to incorporate the revised family rebate. (Refer to section 6).

**Subsection (2)** amends section 344 of the principal Act by repealing subsection 4. This subsection allowed the issue of a special tax code where the taxpayer chose not to specify in his tax code the presence of dependants.

As a result of the tax changes made in 1982 this subsection has become redundant.

### Section 9 - Provisional Taxpayers

This section amends section 377 of the principal Act. It increases from $500 to $1,000 the amount that any person not in business may earn from interest, dividends and rents in any income year before being required to pay provisional tax.

The section also consequentially amends section 17 (Due date for furnishing returns) to allow such taxpayers to furnish IR 5 returns of income.

Both changes will apply from the income year commencing 1 April 1984. This will mean that such taxpayers are not required to pay 1985 provisional tax, and will for the 1984/85 income year become IR 5 taxpayers.

### Section 10 - Payment of Provisional Tax by Instalments

This section removes the incorrect reference in section 385(3) of the principal Act to section 384(3), and replaces it with the correct reference which is 384(1).

### Section 11-14 - Basic Rates of Income Tax

**Section 11** inserts into the First Schedule of the principal Act the following composite tax rate scale which applies for the _1984_income year:

| Income Range | Tax (Cents per $1) Rate |
| --- | --- |
| $   |     |
| 0 - 6,000 | 20.00 |
| 6,001 - 24,000 | 31.25 |
| 24,001 - 30,000 | 41.10 |
| 30,001-38,000 | 56.10 |
| 38,001 and over | 66.00 |

This composite rate scale is a combination of the tax rates applying for the half-year from 1 April 1983 to 30 September 1983 and the new rates, including the surtax, applying from 1 October 1983 to 31 March 1984. This composite tax rate applies _only_ for the 1983/84 income year.

**Sections 12 and 13** insert into the First Schedule of the principal Act, the following two tax rate scales, either of which, subject to confirmation by the _Income Tax (Annual) Act 1984_, will apply for the 1985 and subsequent income years. The two rate scales result from the continuation of the surtax of 10 percent of the marginal rates applying to income over $24,000.

Although both the tax rate scales have been inserted in the principal Act neither can be used for any assessments until it has been confirmed by an Income Tax (Annual) Act.

**BASIC TAX SCALE (NO SURTAX): SECTION 12**

| Income Range | Tax (Cents per $1) Rate |
| --- | --- |
| $   |     |
| 0 - 6,000 | 20.0 |
| 6,001 - 24,000 | 31.5 |
| 24,001 - 30,000 | 41.1 |
| 30,001-38,000 | 51.0 |
| 38,001 and over | 60.0 |

**BASIC TAX SCALE (INCLUDING SURTAX): SECTION 13**

| Income Range | Tax (Cents per $1) Rate |
| --- | --- |
| $   |     |
| 0 - 6,000 | 20.00 |
| 6,000 - 24,000 | 31.5 |
| 24,001 - 30,000 | 45.1 |
| 30,001 - 38,000 | 56.1 |
| 38,001 and over | 66.0 |

### Section 14 - Basic Tax Deductions

This section makes the amendment necessary to incorporate the new tax rate scale, including the surtax into the PAYE tax tables for use from 1 October 1983. It also changes the rates of tax in respect of secondary employment income and extra emolument payments.

**Subsection (1)** - amends clause 3 of the Second Schedule which sets the "no declaration" rate of tax deduction and specifies the income at which "no declaration" rate transfers to the "G" tax code. The income has been amended from "$672" to "$664". Note that the "no declaration" rate is still 35 cents in the dollar on income not exceeding $664. On incomes over $664 the "G" code deduction is to apply.

**Subsection (2)** amends clause 6 of the Second Schedule to change the rate of tax deduction for payment of secondary employment income from 31 cents in the dollar to _31.5_cents in the dollar.

**Subsection (3)** amends clause 9 of the Second Schedule to change the rate of tax deduction for payments of extra emoluments from 31 cents in the dollar to _31.5_cents in the dollar.

**Subsection (4)** inserts the new weekly PAYE tables into Appendix A of the Second Schedule to the principal Act.

**Subsection (5)** is consequential to the previous amendment.

**Subsection (6)** provides that subsections (1), (2) and (4) of this section apply from the 1st day of October 1983.

**Subsection (7)** provides that subsection (3) of this section applies from the 1st day of October 1983.

### Section 15 - "Fourth Schedule" Expenses

This section:

1.  Increases the monetary limits specified in the Fourth Schedule in relation to books, tools of trade, and education; and
2.  Variously amends the clause covering education expenditure to:
    *   ensure that claims for educational books, etc., are subject to the same limit as other books, and
    *   allow a deduction in respect of expenditure incurred in undertaking research as a condition of employment, and
    *   ensure that expenditure incurred on books or travel in connection with education can only be deducted under clause 5 of the Fourth Schedule.

**Increase in Monetary limits**

With effect from the income year which commenced on _1 April 1983_, the monetary limits applicable in respect of expenditure on books, tools of trade, and education are increased as follows:

*   _Clause 2_: books, journals, periodicals, etc. $50 per volume or issue (formerly $20);
*   _Clause 4_: hand-tools, equipment, technical aids, $250 per item (formerly $100);
*   _Clause 5_: various education expenses, $1,000 per annum (formerly $400).

**Clause 5: Education Expenses**

The amendments to clause 5 of the Fourth Schedule (deductions for educational expenditure), apart from the increase in the annual limit, arise from recent Taxation Review Authority decisions which highlighted certain areas where the legislation lacked clarity - in particular, those which gave rise to outcomes other than those originally intended when the legislation was introduced. The amendments are as follows:

*   **Travel and Accommodation**
    *   Subsection 3 amends the Fourth Schedule by repealing the original clause 5 and substituting a new clause 5.
    *   The maximum allowable deduction for costs of travel, accommodation and study under this clause has been increased from $400 to $1,000 but there is also an important change in the effect of the clause. Under the original clause the situation could arise where a taxpayer could claim expenses which, although related to obtaining a degree or other qualifications, were also argued to be in the nature of a refresher course.
    *   This enabled a taxpayer to claim travel and accommodation expenses relating to obtaining a degree or other qualification under paragraph (b) which relates to attending refresher courses.
    *   The new clause 5 clarifies the situation by excluding "expenditure incurred for the purpose, in whole or in part, of obtaining a degree or any other qualification of whatever kind" from a deduction for travel or accommodation.
    *   Another problem with the interpretation of the original clause 5 was with the treatment of travel and accommodation expenses incurred by university lecturers, and others, on sabbatical leave. The argument advanced was that research undertaken on sabbatical leave was "original research" and thus, could not be categorised as a refresher course or as developing the lecturers' capacity to perform their existing duties. This meant that the travel costs were deductible in terms of clause 6 and, as such, were not restricted to a maximum deduction. This problem has been rectified by:
        *   Adding a new clause 5(c) which includes in the $1,000 maximum deduction any expenditure "in undertaking as a condition of his employment research for the purposes of his employment" and
        *   Excluding from clause 6 any "travel in connection with any matters referred to in clause 5 of this Schedule".
    *   The effect is to ensure any travel expenses in excess of $1,000 in connection with "study" or "research" cannot be claimed under clause 6.
*   **Books**
    *   Clause 2 of the Schedule governs expenditure on books and limits the deduction to a maximum of $50 in respect of any volume, issue or instalment. As the cost of books can also be deducted pursuant to clause 5 where they are related to study it was necessary to similarly limit the deduction.

### Income Tax Amendment (No.2) Bill

In a press statement released on 18 December 1984, the Minister of Finance, the Hon. RO Douglas, provided details of the provisions contained in the Income Tax Amendment (No.2) Bill introduced in Parliament.

Mr Douglas said the principal measures contained in the Bill relate to matters which were announced in the Budget but which were not contained in the Income Tax Amendment Bill passed on Budget night. In particular, it contains the legislation which will impose the new tax on fringe benefits, and the new late payment penalty and interest on tax in dispute provisions, which are to apply from 1 April next year. The Minister said that a detailed information paper on the fringe benefit tax has been prepared for release and is now available from his office and also from district offices of the Inland Revenue Department. Details of the legislation relating to late payment penalties and the payment of tax in dispute were contained in a detailed information sheet issued on Budget night.

Mr Douglas explained that the fringe benefit tax follows the broad detail of the Budget announcement except in one area. Shareholder employees will not be subject to the tax in relation to benefits provided to them in that capacity. The Government has given further consideration to this question, and it has been decided that the current tax treatment of shareholder employees is adequate for the time being. Under existing tax law private expenditure of shareholder employees is non-deductible to the company and may be treated as a dividend to the shareholders if not repaid by them to the company, Mr Douglas said.

The Bill also contains a number of technical amendments and several amendments which give effect to measures previously announced. These include changes to the legislation relating to the donations and school fees rebate (including the reinstatement of _CORSO_), pay period taxpayers, the tax treatment of assets distributed to the shareholders of a company on winding up, the tax deductibility of Accident Compensation levies and salaries to partners in a partnership, and the phase out of export incentives.

Mr Douglas explained that in view of the importance and detailed measures in the Bill, it will be referred to a Select Committee of Parliament in order that interested parties may make submissions. Details for the making of submissions will be advertised shortly, said Mr Douglas.

### Taxation of Shearers and Shearing Shedhands

The following is the text of a press statement released by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary to the Minister of Finance, Mr Trevor de Cleene, on 29 November 1984 outlining the new basis for determining PAYE deductions for shearers and shearing shedhands to apply from 1 April 1985.

The Parliamentary Under-Secretary to the Minister of Finance, Mr Trevor de Cleene, today gave further details about the new rates of PAYE for shearers and shearing shedhands to apply from 1 April 1985. The new rates have been introduced in response to requests for change from the shearing industry.

The new rates of PAYE deduction are a flat rate of 25 cents in the dollar for shearers and 20 cents in the dollar for shearing shedhands.

Mr de Cleene said that the new flat rates of tax are designed to make the tax deduction process easier for shearers' employers, and to minimise overdeduction of tax during the year which could result under the present tax tables for shearers and shearing shedhands.

Mr de Cleene explained that the existing graduated tax tables did not fully recognise the seasonal and intermittent nature of employment in the shearing industry and the resulting fluctuations in shearing earnings. "In the case of an experienced shearer who earned in excess of $150 per day, PAYE deductions under the current basis of calculation could be excessive when compared with the tax assessed in the annual tax return."

The flat rate of 25 cents in the dollar for shearers recognises a quantum of expenditure incurred by shearers and obviates difficulties experienced by farmers in calculating PAYE deductions, said Mr de Cleene.

Mr de Cleene also announced that as a consequence of this new basis for determining PAYE deductions for shearers the 10 percent combs and cutters allowance is to be removed from 1 April 1985. Shearers will however be permitted to claim actual expenditure in their 1986 and future years returns of income.

"Because of the generally lower incomes derived by shearing shedhands a 20 cent rate is considered more appropriate in their case" Mr de Cleene said.

Mr de Cleene pointed out that the above changes affect only those persons who are engaged as "employees" either by the shearing contractor or farmer. For shearing contractors the current withholding tax rate of 15 cents in the dollar remains unchanged. Similarly, for farm employees who assist with shearing but who also perform other duties on the farm the general PAYE tax tables applicable to all employees should continue to be used.
