APPENDIX 2(A): Capital Gains Tax Simplified Example Scenario  Jo Co Ltd is owned by Jo  Jo put $600,000 capital into Jo Co Ltd when she created it.  Jo Co Ltd used this to buy a small commercial building to rent for $500,000.  Ten years later the tenant offered $650,000 for either the shares in Jo Co Ltd or the building.  Because Jo’s personal circumstances had changed Jo accepted the offer and sold her shares. The CGT  At year ten Jo Co Ltd has made a gain of $150,000 on the shares and paid CGT of $50,000 (using a simplified 33.333% tax rate).  At year ten Jo Co Ltd has an asset (the building) which cost it $500,000, but which is now worth $650,000. If Jo Co Ltd sold the building and liquidated the company there would be another CGT tax bill of $50,000. This is double tax of the one $150,000 gain. Comment  This is a very simplistic example. Real life situations will be much more complicated, and there are many similar scenarios that could cause this set of problems.  Similar problems could arise if instead Jo Co Ltd sold the building. However, in this case Jo could avoid the double taxation by causing Jo Co Ltd to pay out the net capital gain as an imputed dividend.  This series of transactions could be restructured, but a CGT should not dictate structuring.  Superficially we could attribute the increase in the share value into the asset. However, this only works where 100% of the shares are sold at the same time. Think about multiple owners with only some selling up.  Also, multiple use of one loss could be a result.  Anecdotally we have heard that these scenarios created real problems in Australia and caused a significant fiscal loss. APPENDIX 2(B): Capital Gains Tax Example: Roll-over relief Roll-over relief Where an asset is sold (say to a 3 rd party) any gain or loss is clear. However, where it is sold to a person who is associated the Tax Act often teats these transactions differently in recognition of, among other things, the fact that real ownership may not have changed. For tax purposes, where roll-over relief applies, the acquirer assumes the tax cost base of the disposer of the asset. This has the effect of deferring any taxations consequences of the change of ownership. Note that it is only a deferral, and eventually the tax consequences will be suffered (or enjoyed, if the effect is a deduction). Simplified example An asset cost $5,000,000 and is now worth $6,500,000 Situations in which roll-over relief will be requested (or be necessary) include:  The asset changes ownership under a matrimonial property settlement (the Tax Act already has a roll-over that makes these events a tax book value transaction so that there is no income tax);  A spouse inheriting the asset under a will (the Tax Act already has a roll-over that generally makes these events a tax book value transaction so that there is no income tax);  The asset is a farm that the children of a farmer inherit upon the death of the parents (a CGT could actually force the sale of the family farm in some circumstances);  The asset is a commercial building which is insured for replacement cost, which is destroyed by say an earthquake – tax on the capital gain (and with replacement insurance there almost always is a capital gain) would mean that the building couldn’t be replaced like for like;  The asset is sold within a group of companies – economic ownership hasn’t changed and there should only be a CGT when the asset is sold outside the group of companies  The asset is a stepping stone farm which the farmer sells to buy a bigger farm; In all these examples except the last one it is reasonable to argue that there has not been, from an economic perspective, a real change of the ownership of the asset to a 3 rd party. Thus no “real” gain that has been realised that should be taxed. A Similar, but more nuanced argument could be made in respect of the last argument – the business is ongoing and has merely increased its net assets.

APPENDIX 4: Environmental regulatory framework as it effects farmers The Tax Working Group (TWG) discussion document takes aim at a number of environmental issues, and seeks feedback on what role taxation may play in addressing these issues. The environmental issues specifically mentioned include: - Climate change - Loss of ecosystem services - Loss of indigenous biodiversity and indigenous species - Loss of Wetlands - Water Quality - Water Quantity - Fish stocks - Freshwater fish species - Landfill waste Federated Farmers draft position in our initial feedback to the TWG is that taxation is a blunt tool, and regulation of these areas is a more effective mechanism for targeting specific issues and incentivising answers to these issues. As acknowledged in the TWG consultation document (page 49): Environmental taxes can be a powerful tool to efficiently reduce pollution and encourage better use of natural resources. Other tools to achieve these outcomes include government regulation (fines and penalties under industry specific regimes) and limiting supply through quota systems. If an environmental tax is set to reflect the cost of pollution to society (that is, the externality), the price of the activity will increase to reflect its true cost. We are proposing to argue that the complexity of the natural resource issues, and the need for a ‘causal nexus’ between the relative level of negative externality created and the relative level of tax. As a component of this approach, we are summarising the current regulations addressing each of the issues outlined in the TWG consultation document. Our argument is that where there are gaps in regulation and the requirements around sustainable resource use and good environmental outcomes, these gaps are more efficiently, effectively and equitably addressed through changes to regulation or additional regulation, rather than through blunt taxation. Climate Change New Zealand’s climate policy is to be reviewed by an independent Climate Change Commission. The regulatory framework for New Zealand’s Climate Change response is provided through the Climate Change Response Act and will be reinforced by a Zero Carbon Bill. Electricity and fuel are already within the ETS and their retail prices reflect this. The Government has strongly signalled that agricultural biological emissions such as methane and nitrous oxide will be included, it’s only a matter of when. As the carbon price rises it will bite increasingly, especially once agricultural biological emissions come in (even with a 95% ‘free allocation’ as provided for in the Labour-NZ First Coalition Agreement). On the other side of the ledger foresters get ETS credits and they will benefit from higher carbon prices. Loss of ecosystem services, indigenous biodiversity and indigenous species Loss of ecosystem services and species will be addressed as a component of the Treasury’s ‘Living Standards Framework’, currently under development. At present, regulation of biodiversity is already addressed under the Resource Management Act. The protection of areas of significant indigenous vegetation and significant habitats of indigenous fauna are considered ‘Matters of National Importance’ under section 6 of the Act. This importance is reflected in lower level planning documents, including through the New Zealand Biodiversity Strategy, New Zealand Biodiversity Action Plan, Regional and District Planning, including Regional Pest Management strategies, and is the focus of a potential National Policy Statement (NPS) under the Resource Management Act (this is being worked by a Biodiversity Collaborative Group, which includes Federated Farmers). The QEII Trust also works with private landowners to protect significant natural features through open-space covenants. Any changes or stronger directives from these various national strategies, action plans and the NPS will feed through regional and district councils which will all have to amend their plans and strategies accordingly. Whatever emerges will impact on the ability of farmers to go about their business, especially if farmers are required to retire land from production or incur costs to protect biodiversity. Protection of wetlands Wetlands are addressed through the regional and district planning processes, particularly the functions protecting biodiversity and significant natural areas. These protections include both rules around the clearance or use of wetlands, and funding for wetland restoration or protection, through the Department of Conservation and regional council administered landowner and funding assistance programmes. Wetlands are also an important and increasingly valued tool for improving or maintaining water quality through the regulation of freshwater quantity and quality. Water Quality and Quantity Water Quantity and quality (including cumulative impacts) are regulated through the National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management. The NPS requires the setting of enforceable water quality and water quantity limits. The NPS provides a framework that has been subject to some amendment, and it is likely further amendments will occur. Regional Councils are required to implement the Freshwater NPS in their policies and plans as promptly as is reasonable. As a consequence, Regional Water Plans have been and are being developed by regional councils, including particularly high profile plans including the Horizons One Plan, Waikato Healthy Rivers, Southland Land & Water Plan, Otago Water Plan, and various Environment Canterbury plan changes arising from a huge amount of catchment-based and region-wide work over recent years. There are also stock exclusion regulations under development. These would formally exclude livestock from waterways (building on and going beyond the dairy farmers’ commitments under the industry-led Clean Streams Accord). Freshwater fish Freshwater fish, including the ‘protection of the habitat of trout and salmon’ are specifically provided for under the Resource Management Act, with habitats addressed through regional planning processes, and freshwater quality and quantity addressed though the NPS for Freshwater Management.

LINK | Future of Tax – Written Submission Tax Working Group| April 2018 Company Details Name: Link International Group Limited Company No: 1195509 Document Approval: LINK executive team Document Author: Suneil Connor – CFO Email: About Us Established in Auckland, New Zealand, LINK is the largest business brokerage in the world with over 2,500 listed businesses for sale at any one time. LINK has sold over 600 businesses in the last year with a combined value of over $300 million. This submission focuses on current tax business in NZ face, and the issue of Capital Gains Tax (CGT) on sales of businesses. The authority on selling businesseslinkbusiness.co.nz \[1\] Private Business (company) Contribution to the NZ Tax System and Lack of Subsidies Income Tax The Future of Tax – Submissions Background Paper noted on p28 that, in the year 30 June 2017, the Government collected $12.6 billion in company tax which, when compared to GDP, was the highest in the OECD. The paper goes on to note that the NZ corporate tax rate at 28% is the tenth highest rate of the 35 OECD countries. GST, PAYE & Other Employer Taxes Although PAYE is an employee tax, it is a requirement of the employer, most likely a company, to deduct PAYE on behalf of the Government, and pay this on behalf of the employee. GST is a tax that is charged by the Government on all goods and services. The Government requires companies to hold the tax taken from GST and pay this to the Government on behalf of the consumer. Both of the above taxes are a significant cost to the business in both administration, and opportunity cost of this time and expense. It can be argued that the Government has legislated the outsourcing of the collection of GST, PAYE and other employer taxes, to the private sector without any subsidy for providing this service. Lack of Subsidies Given the level of administrative burden and income tax level NZ companies are imposed with, there is a gaping hole in the subsidies the Government provides to businesses in NZ to assist with the cost. Although a lack of subsidies exist for the administrative tasks performed by the private sector for the Government, there are subsidies for other priorities for Government such as Research and Development (R&D) expenditure. The current Government still noting the rhetoric that NZ is underspending in R&D, and it is a top priority to move NZ R&D spend up from current levels of 1.28% of GDP to the OECD average of 2.35%, has now slashed the subsidy available to NZ businesses. The existing and soon to be phased out R&D subsidy was 20% of eligible R&D spend paid out quarterly in cash to the business, will now be moving to 12.5% of eligible R&D spend to be added as a tax credit at the end of each year. Given the number of start-up companies who do not make a profit, notwithstanding 7.5% decrease from 20% down to 12.5%, the ability to use the 12.5% is dampened significantly due to lack of profits from companies, mainly technology exporters, who would increase NZ GDP when they become profitable. We would not be surprised to see R&D spend as a percentage of GDP drop significantly on the proposed changes, and although in speeches, representatives of this Government state moving R&D spend to OECD levels is a top priority, it is our view the Government is directly discouraging businesses to spend on R&D when compared to the previous rules, taking away what little cash subsidy a business in NZ received from their Government in the past. The authority on selling businesseslinkbusiness.co.nz Review of Reasoning For a CGT Below are the two major issues that could be combated by a CGT outlined in Future of Tax – Submissions Background Paper. Housing Affordability The Reserve Bank Governor, Adrian Orr, recently commented on TVNZ’s Q&A “when you see 90% of household wealth being equity in a home and 80% of the loans in banks are to housing and you see relative prices of housing where they are, then you’re saying ‘hey this is a real issue’”. The above statement from the Governer shows NZ has an overwhelming affinity with housing and given the ability to leverage $1 to $5 to purchase these assets without needing to pay tax on profits (excluding the bright-line test and traders), it makes sense that a lot of money has moved into this asset pool which has inflated prices. The Government will bring in laws to extend the bright-line test to five years and establish rules to ringfence rental losses. The extension of the bright-line test is a CGT, and therefore, in our opinion, bringing in a comprehensive CGT would do little more to housing affordability than the adjustment of the bright-line from 2 to 5 years would do. Disproportionate Ownership of Capital Assets Within the Future of Tax – Submissions Background Paper, it was noted on p48 that capital assets are owned by higher income households and so introducing a capital gains tax would make the tax system more progressive. The purchasing of capital assets such as land or shares is often with taxed income that is already subject to a progressive tax system. To state that introducing a CGT to make the tax system more progressive is using the wrong “p” word. The correct word would be ‘punitive’. In a report by Statistics NZ in December 2017, it stated as at March 2017 household net disposable income was $148.0 billion, and household consumption was $152.1 billion showing a deficit of $4.1 billion. The statistics show us that New Zealanders are failing to save, and this may have long term impacts on retirement dependency. To encourage saving, Kiwi’s need an incentive to place their disposable income into assets that will appreciate long term. The incentive should be no taxes on the appreciation of certain asset classes. The authority on selling businesseslinkbusiness.co.nz CGT on Business Sales New Zealand Small Enterprises According to the 2016 Small Business Factsheet, small enterprises (<20 employees) make up 97% of all enterprises. Small businesses are the lifeblood of NZ, and the Government should be doing more to encourage business ownership. CGT on Business Sales Ageing demographic & lock-in effect It is our view that imposing a CGT on business sales would directly discourage the needed and overdue divestment of businesses that are currently sitting in an aged demographic. In their Success through succession planning report, Xero identified more than 90,000 businesses are owned by people aged 55 and over. Imposing CGT on the sales of these businesses would encourage the owners to hold onto the business for as long as they can (lock-in effect), likely to the detriment of the business. We believe CGT would be at the forefront of the decision whether or not to sell the business as opposed to the factors business owners should be citing such as: • What is the ideal market timing to sell the business? • Who should I be selling the business to? • Who can take this business to the next level to increase profits and employ more people? • When and how would I like to retire? Family owned house vs family owned business The majority of small businesses in NZ are family owned. If a CGT were to be implemented, there would be an exemption for the family home. Given the exemption for the family home is due to it being a personal asset for family benefit, logic would suggest the same should apply to the family business. Valuing different items within a business sale Business sales are made up of property plant & equipment (PPE), stock, and goodwill, which is sometimes split into business and site goodwill. A CGT may motivate sellers to value different items to either derive a capital loss or a reduction in capital gain. Increase in value due to profits which have already been taxed We find the most common reason a business’ value has increased over time is not due to economic cycles or that business value “always goes up” like the housing market, but because of the increased profit the business generates over time. This means the return on initial investment of the business is greater, which in-turn increases the value of the business. Hard work, sweat equity, risk-taking and entrepreneurial ambition increase profits. Profits which the Government has already taxed. Stifling of entrepreneurial ambition Businesses succeed because of entrepreneurial ambition, risk taking and persistence. One of the pay-offs for the risk undertaken is the increase in value of the business. A CGT may stifle entrepreneurial ambition and have flow on effects to employment, GDP and investment. Harvard Business School Professors, Gompers and Lerner, found that a one percentage point increase in the rate of CGT was associated with a 3.8 percent reduction in venture capital funding. Investment into non-productive assets We see many purchasers decide to buy a business given it is a productive asset that helps the economy, produces jobs and assists customer’s needs. The alternative for a number of potential purchasers is to obtain a job from the market, and invest their earnings in owning a larger personal home which is a non-productive use of funds. A CGT may swing the decision back to investment in non-productive assets. Positive economic impact Within a Forbes article titled The Overwhelming Case Against Capital Gains Taxation (Forbes, 2014), Peter Kugler and Carlos Lenz (2001) examined the experience of regional governments (“cantons”) in Switzerland that eliminated their capital gains taxes. The authors statistical analysis showed that the elimination of capital gains taxes had a positive and economically significant effect on the long-term level of real income in seven of the eight cantons studied. Specifically, the increase in the long-term level ranged between 1.1% and 3.0%, meaning the size of the economy was 1% - 3% larger due to the elimination of capital gains taxes. Conclusion There are a number of studies that state a CGT is damaging to the economy and well-being of a nation. We feel the current reasoning for a CGT is to move investment away from housing. The bright-line move to five years and ring-fencing of rental losses tackles this issue. If the Government were to introduce a comprehensive CGT, it would be a calculated strike at those who decide to save and invest their money in productive assets, and an attack on all small business owners in New Zealand.

Submission to the Tax Working Group on the Future of Tax First name: Andrew Last name: Brock Position: Chairperson Organisation (if any): New Plymouth Injury Safe ☒ I am aware that my submission will be released on this website, with my email address withheld, and have noted the Official Information Act and privacy considerations that apply ☐ I would like to speak to this submission if the opportunity arises Thank you for the opportunity to make this submission on behalf of New Plymouth Injury Safe Trust (NPiS). I do not wish to speak to my submission before the Committee. NPiS is a coalition of local organisations and groups with an interest in injury prevention and community safety. The group was established as an informal coalition in 2001 and formalised their structure by registering as a Charitable Trust in 2006. Our core aim is to achieve a positive safety culture and create safer environments for all people within the New Plymouth District. NPiS exercises a collegial approach to decision making and decisions are based on consensus among the group. The New Plymouth injury Safe collaborative partners are:  Tui Ora Ltd.  Taranaki District Health Board  New Plymouth District Council  Bishop’s Action Foundation  Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC)  New Zealand Police  Worksafe New Zealand  Kidsafe Taranaki Trust  Fire and Emergency New Zealand Our core objectives from our current Strategic Plan are to: 1. Advocating for policy and legislative change that supports improved community safety 2. To establish and strengthen effective partnerships with others working towards improving safety 3. To raise awareness, commitment and motivation to promote safety within organisations and throughout the community 4. To gather and share information on injury trends, priorities and programmes 5. To guide and support organisations to develop effective injury prevention interventions that target high risk and vulnerable groups New Plymouth Injury Safe Trust C/- Westown Police Station PO Box 344 New Plymouth 4340 \[1\] 6. Work to enhance engagement with the Maori community in order to better understand Maori injury prevention priorities and ways in which the safe community can support and effective response to these priorities. 7. Te enable the New Plymouth District and neighbouring districts to meet the International Safe Community (ISC) criteria for Safe Communities 8. To establish and strengthen effective partnerships with others working towards improving safety The harmful consumption of alcohol, and its contribution to all injury fields, is one of the key priority areas for action for the NPiS Trust. Alcohol is a key contributor towards NPiS’ significant areas of concern, including falls, suicide and road safety. (New Plymouth Injury Safe, 2016 1 ) Alcohol was identified as a key factor contributing to both intentional and unintentional injuries in the New Plymouth District (New Plymouth Injury Safe, 2015 2 ). We remain concerned about the increase in affordability over time across all alcohol types due to the proven relationship between consumption and price (Health Promotion Agency 2018, Wall and Casswell, 2013 3 , 4 ). We support the Tax Working Group’s review seeking to identify a fair tax system that positively impacts on the well-being of all New Zealanders. We believe that the current approach to alcohol excise tax in New Zealand is not fair for the majority of New Zealanders. We believe that rates of alcohol excise tax should reflect the cost of alcohol-related harm to society. Alcohol causes more harm than any other drug available in society, e.g. tobacco, cannabis, heroin, methamphetamine. Increases in alcohol excise rates are urgently required to address the growing number of hazardous drinkers in New Zealand. In 2016, there were 179,000 more hazardous drinkers than in 2012. Almost every group defined by age, ethnicity and sex has increased their drinking since 2011. The greatest increases are among our women. There remains significant inequities in alcohol- related harm between Māori and non-Māori, which is unacceptable. To achieve fairness, alcohol excise taxes need to be addressed  Today, alcohol is more affordable than it has ever been  New Zealanders are missing out on millions of dollars of alcohol excise tax revenue each year because wine is taxed at a level equivalent to 10% alcohol, yet levels of alcohol in a bottle of wine are typically much higher than this (e.g. 12-14%). Taxpayers are losing out on this revenue which could be used to fund essential social services. Further this could potentially incentivise more alcohol producers and retailers to provide low alcohol options (if they are cheaper due to lower tax), helping to positively change the drinking culture.  Every year, the Government receives money from alcohol excise tax ($1 billion in 2017) but this does not come close to the annual cost of alcohol-related harm to individuals and society (around $5 billion in 2005/06). 1 New Plymouth Injury Safe (2016).

Addiction, 108(1), 7279.  People who don’t drink alcohol (20% of New Zealanders) and low-risk drinkers are unfairly burdened with these costs. Recommendations For a fairer and more equitable society, we recommend the following:  Increase alcohol excise rates by at least 50% across all alcohol products to raise the price of alcohol by at least 10%  Annually adjust the excise rates to take into account changes in income (and to offset any strategies used by retailers to not pass on increased rates to consumers)  Address rates of excise tax on wine – all wine should be taxed by alcohol content, not volume of beverage. If a producer is unable to determine the exact alcohol content in their product, then the level of excise tax should be raised from being based on 10% alcohol strength to 14%.  It is preferable that all alcohol products (beer, wine, cider, spirits, etc.) be taxed by the exact amount of alcohol they contain. This is fair across all beverages. Currently, some products are taxed by volume whereas others are taxed by alcohol content. It is alcohol that causes the harm. These recommendations are fair as low income heavy drinkers are shown to benefit the most when prices of alcohol are increased. Thinking outside the system, we recommend that a Minimum Unit Pricing Policy also be implemented to address the availability of very cheap alcohol. This policy is the most fair as it targets heavy drinkers and significantly reduces inequities in alcohol -related harm between income groups. NPiS believes that national policy changes are required to support regional initiatives targeting an improved culture around alcohol consumption and associated harm.

Tax Working Group Submission April 2018 Financial Cohorts Forum (Christchurch) Tax Working Group Secretariat PO Box 3724 Wellington 6140 By email: submissions@taxworkinggroup.govt.nz 27 April 2018 Dear Sir Michael Cullen Re: Tax Working Group Submissions We welcome the opportunity to make submissions on the future of our New Zealand tax system and applaud the Tax Working Group in undertaking this initiative. To provide you with some context, I am the Chairperson of a close group of financial professionals employed by a range of upper scale medium sized organisations. As a Group we seek to meet on a bi-monthly basis to discuss topical issues of interest. This submission is made on behalf of this Group and is supported by Mark Lodder, Tax Partner, BDO Christchurch Limited (who assists in facilitating and co-ordinating our discussions). To be clear, the views presented are those of this Group and not those of BDO. In making this submission we have observed the following directions: • “Tax is not just for experts”, this is not a technical submission and in the absence of such our submission points are posed largely as questions requiring further thought and deliberation. We acknowledge that there are many wider discussions including the existing Double Tax Treaty regime, in its current form, which may discount certain submission points. • “Tax should operate neutrally and as much in the background as possible”. • The above point is to be contrasted with a tax system that offers equity and balance. • Areas outside of scope of discussion include inheritance tax, increases in income tax and/or GST rates. As a general comment, based on the current evolution of our respective businesses along with rapid technological advances we are constantly reminded that what we did yesterday and do today may not be fit for purpose tomorrow. We have considered this in light of our current tax system. Our submission is structured focussing on each of the five key questions posed by the Tax Working Group in turn. Thank you again on behalf of our Group for the opportunity to submit. We look forward to continued dialogue and the Tax Working Group’s considerations and recommendations with interest. Yours faithfully Dale Andrews Chairperson, Financial Cohorts Forum Financial Controller, Southern Rehab \[1\] \[1\] What does the future of tax look like to us? It is said that New Zealand operates a “broad base, low rate tax system”. As a Group we fundamentally agree with this approach and would be protective of it. In particular we see that being “broad base” (noting our comments below) supports an objective of simplicity and tax operating “neutrally and in the background”. We do, however, question whether the current system will be broad enough in the future to meet the needs of our country. Specifically, our concerns are that the current tax system seeks, on the whole, to tax functions performed and labour. It is yet to be determined whether digital revolution will result in fewer jobs or create new jobs, some that have not yet been thought of. With respect to an environment that reflects the former our views are that: • The tax system is not necessarily broad enough to capture sufficient revenue streams, on the assumption PAYE monies will fall. • We appreciate that, in theory, corporation taxes could rise, however from a social perspective does this mean a widening gulf between those who are rewarded through risk and invention, verses those who are currently rewarded through labour (if labour is to be replaced)? Our concern is that this is a very real risk. With respect to remedies, we have discussed: • The pending Research and Development Tax Credit and its objective of using the tax system as a tool to encourage investment in this area. • Is it appropriate that the tax system offers an incentive to organisations that employ people as opposed to machines/technology? Conversely, should technology rich organisations be taxed at a higher rate to reflect the loss of PAYE revenues that would have otherwise arisen? • We have some sympathy for a capital gains tax regime. We can acknowledge that arguably the absence of a capital gains tax does not lend itself to our tax system being “broad base” as it excludes a type of taxation and the absence thereof could be said to encourage certain behaviour (and not congruent with the tax system offering neutrality and operating in the background). • A fundamental change to how organisations are taxed and globalisation. As a general premise, organisations are taxed in jurisdictions based on residency or source. Source often is dictated by a physical presence. We would like to explore whether income tax would be better imposed on the residency of the consumer, and to recognise that the consumer is the real driver of profitability. We note that the recently introduced “Netflix” tax and Sales Tax regimes in the US largely reflects this notion. Would this approach, which seeks to tax income based on the location of the consumer, render tax havens largely redundant (and assist with the BEPS initiative)? To this end, we offer the taxation of business profits to be imposed based on a pro rata apportionment of net profit to jurisdictional sales. For example: MeteorSoft Ltd is incorporated in Bermuda and is not subject to income tax either in Bermuda or anywhere else in the world due to tax efficient structuring. Its net profits total $10m. Its consumers, together with quantum of sales is as follows: Residence of consumers Total sales ($) % of total sales Net profit apportionment ($) United States of America 20m 40% 4m United Kingdom 14m 28% 2.8m Australia 7m 14% 1.4m Germany 4m 8% 0.8m Argentina 3m 6% 0.6m New Zealand 2m 4% 0.4m Total 50m 100% 10m Taxable income (assuming net profit equates to taxable income) totals $0.4m in New Zealand, whereas no amount is subject to tax under the current system (due to a policy of taxing based on residency and source). What is the purpose of tax? The Group’s position is that the purpose of tax is simple. Taxation is needed to pay for things we all need and use. It ideally should be fair, simple, certain and flexible and nimble in today’s evolving world (note recent discussions on cryptocurrency and how it should be taxed). It should also collect more than it costs to collect. As per your direction it is acknowledged there is a compromise between equity and simplicity. Often simplicity creates unfairness (and vice versa). In addition, in our experience, we consider that too much certainty can lead to inflexibility in the system and manipulation. We consider that the performance of the tax system can be measured in part by: • Comparing total collection to the costs of collection (as a key performance indicator for Inland Revenue); • A police force that is achieving targets; • A health system that is achieving targets; • An education system that is delivering a quality, innovative and adaptable future work force; • Stability in Government; • A reducing or relatively low hidden economy. Equity is difficult to achieve and we concur that what is considered fair to one is not necessarily considered fair to another. It is an example often seen, but it is difficult to argue that a tax system that offers the following as equitable: John and Mary have three children. All children attend schools, they visit A&E from time to time and have had their house burgled (the Police found the culprits and recovered all their belongings). Barry and Bobbi also have three children. All children attend schools, they visit A&E from time to time and have had their house burgled (the Police found the culprits and recovered all their belongings). Apart from the names, the families are very similar, except...John had a start-up business developing new technology. The business generated tax losses and never paid any tax. John sold the business for a large capital gain, $2m. The family lives off the $2m capital gain, spending around $100,000 per year. Barry and Bobbi live off Bobbi’s $100,000 salary in a professional law firm. Both use the same services and have very similar life styles, however one pays tax, the other doesn’t. This example, lends itself to the argument that if we all use the same public services then we should all pay proportionately to use. However, it is then necessary to balance this with ability to pay and need. Furthermore, given the majority of taxes paid are incurred by the few, in the absence of economic information, we question whether a tax system based on “use” would generate sufficient funds? A fair system is one where taxpayers pay tax on a progressive basis. To this end, the question arises as to whether companies should also be taxed on the same basis, rather than a flat rate? We concur that there is merit in exploring this (especially as a lower rate could be utilised using an alternative structure to an ordinary company). We appreciate that a discussion on the welfare system is outside of the scope, but agree that empathy and looking after the whole of the population must also be considered. We consider that a fair system generates sufficient funds for public spending, that in itself is administered efficiently. Are we taxing the right thing? In our working life, we are constantly reminded that what we did yesterday may not be fit for purpose tomorrow. We consider this question is somewhat interlinked to the question of “what the future of taxation looks to us”. We consider the same principle applies to our tax system. We are concerned that a tax system that focuses upon taxing function/labour could well be obsolete and wholly inefficient depending on how society continues to adopt and adapt to technological advance. Our group considers that we should not discount exploring further a tax system that encourages or discourages certain behaviour. It can be a useful tool in a country’s amour to achieve overriding desired objectives (for example in relation to alcohol and tobacco), but perhaps it should not be the tool of choice. We have discussed four main areas: 1. Taxation of multinationals We have provided detail in this regard per above. We consider that “consumption” and “residency of the consumer” as the focal point of taxing multinational organisations, as opposed to residency and source. Taxing based on residency and source have been the foundation of the tax system, before the world was able to sell remotely. Circumstances have changed. We consider that this approach could reduce manipulation and use of tax havens. 2. Savings Given the aging population and potential burden upon society we consider a system that encourages saving appropriate. We consider a system that provides tax relief at source for those saving for retirement worthy of further discussion (and would not be incongruent with similar systems overseas). We agree that taxing pension receipts in the future appropriate and that the receipt of a pension should be based on means. We consider this approach in line with a progressive tax system as it currently stands. 3. Capital gains tax As a Group we have been fiercely protective and somewhat proud of our system that does not tax capital gains. However, in doing so we acknowledge that the absence of such has led inequity, complexity and uncertainty of our tax system. For example, the taxation of land transactions is often widely misunderstood and is complex. The recently introduced bright-line test is effectively a pure capital gains tax (largely because it does not discriminate as to the reasons for a disposal), operating within the confines of income tax legislation. As a compromised position, our Group discussed the introduction of taxing capital gains on foreign non-resident investors, especially if the investor resides in a country that operates a capital gains tax. We are aware of countries that operate systems whereby foreign investors are taxed differently from domestic taxpayers, in particular Australia and stamp duty rates. And closer to home our withholding tax regime has different rules for domestic and foreign taxpayers. We consider that a capital gains tax if introduced should operate on a realised basis. A mechanism should be introduced such that taxpayers cannot avoid capital gains tax merely by leaving the country (it may operate on a pro rata ownership basis and seek to tax a share on ultimate sale). Complexity arises upon gifting of assets and requires careful consideration. For example, how do you deal with a “gift” on death? Depending on the objective of a capital gains tax, its application could be diluted in the absence of an Inheritance Tax as a backstop (which the Group is fundamentally opposed to). We appreciate that there are many pros and cons in discussing the validity of a capital gains tax. We look forward to continued discussions in this regard. As previously mentioned, our thoughts are softening in this area and we have increased sympathy for a capital gains tax that is carefully considered and executed. 4. “Bad” behaviour As a general observation we consider that there are many examples within the tax system that offers elements of distortion and may encourage or discourage certain behaviours. For example: • The proposed research and development concessionary treatment recently a revisited topic of discussion; • Concessionary tax treatment for the agricultural industry; • Income tax treatment of portfolio foreign equity interests versus domestic portfolio equity interests (in particular the tax treatment of traders); • Changes to the taxation of residential property (bright-line) and proposed future changes (ring-fencing of tax losses). We are not convinced that there should be a greater role for tax in promoting certain behaviours, but rather it be accepted as a tool that should be used under appropriate circumstances. For example, if society’s behaviour is placing too much burden on the welfare system, then we may need to introduce complexity in this regard to rebalance (i.e. a sugar tax). Can tax make housing more affordable? Our view is that the answer to this in short is “no”. We do consider, however, that tax in respect to housing may provide equity. That being said, we are not convinced that it would be appropriate to discriminate between the taxation of residential housing to commercial. Could this give rise to distorted investment decisions and encourage investment in commercial property as opposed to residential, and shifting focus or creating a problem elsewhere? As a point of note, we do not consider residential property is necessarily taxed any differently to other investments. For example, most goodwill on the sale of a business is equally not taxed as for residential property. One could argue further, in particular, that the introduction of the bright-line test could be seen to encourage more investment in businesses. Tax issues that matter most to us as a Group For us as a Group common issues that we currently face in our business are: • Double Taxation We are frustrated with a global fixation on multinationals paying little or no tax and/or double dipping on deductions. More often is the case that small global organisations are paying tax twice. Ironically Double Tax Agreements act as a sword as much as they do a shield, giving a host country a right to tax income, which ultimately can give rise to taxation of the same income twice upon repatriation to the final shareholder. This is often seen as a deterrent for business owners seeking to take advantage of offshore markets. We consider that this problem is of equal significance to the legal manipulation of global tax systems by multinational organisations. • Cross-border transactions and working through transfer pricing requirements Continuing with the theme of cross-border transactions we appreciate the existing safe-harbour thresholds for transfer pricing, but would appreciate more. Often the cost of compliance outweighs the commercial benefit in seeking to get this right. • The capital gains tax conundrum As previously mentioned, a capital gains tax has merit. We consider it should have the following characteristics: - Applies on the realisation of the property (which may alleviate any concerns in relation to Maori assets). - It excludes the family home (only one family home). Or as a compromised alternative is excluded to a capped threshold, for example a nil rate band calculated on a multiple of median income. - It is taxed at a slightly lower rate, or offers taper relief, to take into account inflation. - Certain chattels must be excluded, it should not allow capital losses to arise for ordinarily depreciating property (non-vintage vehicles for example). • Future needs and a system that is fit for purpose We are concerned that our tax system will be “huffing and puffing” without effect, because as it currently stands it may not have the ability to tax tomorrow’s world and provide for the needs of New Zealanders (as is its wider purpose). As businesses and society evolve, so should a tax system. If the purpose of a tax system is to pay for things society needs, then we may need additional complexity to achieve this objective.

Investment by the industry in the plantation forestry sector is reflected in the commitment of the NZ Forest Owners Association Inc (FOA) and its members to the highest standards of sustainable silviculture, environmental practice and workforce safety. Substantial industry investment into plantation forestry has been made by a range of domestic and international investors – particularly over the last thirty years following the sale of the public forest resource. 2. FOA is submitting on behalf of its national membership. Comments on Forest Growing, Products and Trade 3. The current total New Zealand plantation forest estate is approximately 2.3 million hectares. The government wishes to expand the estate with its “Billion Tree Programme”. To achieve this target will require substantial private sector investment. 4. The total New Zealand plantation forest harvest in 2017 was approximately 33.5 million cubic metres. Approximately 18.5 million cubic metres of logs were exported in 2017. The value of log exports for the June 2017 year was $2.7 billion. Forest product exports in total were over $5 billion. 5. Thousands of kiwi jobs rely upon the plantation forest industry. Our Submission 6. Investors must have surety that the tax system treats different primary sectors fairly and is consistent and is not continually modified. 7. There is a significant failure to recognise universal productivity measures between countries – these are what drives outputs and imputes taxation, general or targeted. There is no reference to New Zealand’s Productivity Commission. 8. Capital Gains Tax: Not having a capital gains tax has resulted in land price appreciation for land that could be converted to forestry but has not been due to the land becoming over-valued compared to its carrying capacity. We support investigation into this tax option. 9. Wealth Tax: The fundamental definition - “a tax on the “net wealth” – assets minus liabilities – of taxpayers each year” is fraught with definitional difficulties and goes straight to the capability of creating illusional liabilities. There are no working examples Page 4 of 4 world-wide where this type of gross wealth tax system has been effective. We oppose this option. 10. International Tax: With over 70% of the plantation forest estate owned by overseas investors this option is most likely to have the biggest immediate impact on investment/return criteria for New Zealand. Foreign owners have invested heavily in forest infrastructure, training and processing in New Zealand. To meet the government’s billion tree programme will also require significant future or additional overseas investment. Overseas companies have a range of countries to invest in. Tax treatment should not discourage overseas investment. 11. Cost of Standing Timber: We welcome the government’s goal to encourage the planting of new forests. Much of that planting will necessarily be on farmland and before investing, landowners will be looking at the experience of today’s small forest growers. Right now, the ‘cost of standing timber’ provisions make it harder for small growers to sell or amalgamate their forests. These provisions put an immediate tax liability on the seller of standing trees, while the purchaser cannot deduct the cost of buying them until the trees are harvested or sold. The difference in timing of the tax liability and the tax benefit creates a ‘price mismatch’ between buyer and seller. That mismatch makes it harder to trade immature forests, which discourages investment. IRD has recognised the problem and is considering an exemption for small forest owners who want to transfer their forests into an estate for economies of scale. Grouping would help small forests become more profitable and encourage investment. Easing the provisions will help give the right signal to these landowners. We support the proposed exemption for small forest owners who want to transfer their forests into an estate. 12. The submitter wishes to be heard in support of its submission. 13. The FOA is happy for this submission to be made public. D avid Rhodes Chief Executive \[1\]

Disclosure statements for Forsyth Barr Authorised Financial Advisers are available on request and free of charge. 30 April 2018 Tax Working Group Secretariat PO Box 3724 WELLINGTON By email: submissions@taxworkinggroup.govt.nz Dear Members Future of Tax Forsyth Barr is a New Zealand-owned firm providing a full range of investment services including portfolio management, investment advice and sharebroking, and research. Our clients include tens of thousands of ordinary New Zealanders who invest directly in capital markets in New Zealand and offshore. As such, we have a keen interest in the taxation of savings and capital income generally. The comments below largely respond to Chapter 5 of the consultation document, and in particular the section on taxation of household savings. We would be interested in discussing our comments further with the Tax Working Group and/or the Secretariat. Changing demographics will make taxes on capital income become relatively more important over time. It will thus be critical that the playing field is as level as possible. The longer biases and distortions are allowed to persist, the more disruptive the later removal of those distortions will be. In terms of taxation of savings, the Portfolio Investment Entity (PIE) regime provides welcome encouragement for New Zealanders to save for retirement with its package of tax measures. However (and as illustrated in figure 21 of the consultation document), the regime has also created tax incentives for investors to invest via PIEs as opposed to investing directly. We think that the playing field should be levelled for those investing directly, particularly for those investing via a discretionary investment management service (DIMS), by: - Aligning the treatment of capital gains on New Zealand and listed Australian share investments. Currently, PIEs are generally not taxed on these gains, but direct investors can be. This change would not only better align the tax treatments of investments made through these channels, but would also remove the uncertainty for investors of the capital/revenue distinction when investing in shares directly. - Providing for a maximum tax rate for income from directly-held investments that corresponds to the highest PIR, to mirror the PIE regime. This could be restricted to share investments only, or considered more widely for interest / financial arrangement income. As well as improving consistency, we believe there may be positive externalities from such an approach. For example, the highly concentrated nature of the New Zealand funds management industry is often cited as a reason why smaller companies struggle to raise capital (as the proposed investment may be too small to warrant interest from large fund \[1\] 2 managers); levelling the playing field for direct investment in effect markedly increases the number of fund managers in the New Zealand economy. Such an approach would lead to an increase in market liquidity which investment theory has demonstrated leads to a lower cost of capital for companies. Consideration could also be given to allowing investors to opt-in to an FDR regime for their Australasian share investments. This would promote certainty and remove a potential bias under the current regime towards investment in non-Australasian shares, particularly if a capital gains tax is introduced. More generally, we believe that taxation of returns from property investments and returns from capital markets investments should be better aligned. We do not make any specific suggestions in this regard, as we believe that the relevant changes would largely be to the taxation of returns from property investments. However we would be interested in participating in any future discussions about the taxation of savings and capital income generally. While we believe that the current tax treatment of retirement savings through KiwiSaver is appropriate, we also note that, to the extent that changes to the KiwiSaver regime are planned or if there is to be any change to the universality of, or eligibility for, New Zealand Superannuation, the tax treatment would need to be reconsidered. We would be pleased to share with you our thoughts on these subjects. No part of this submission is confidential. Yours sincerely Forsyth Barr Limited Neil Paviour-Smith Managing Director \[1\]
30 April 2018 Tax Working Group Secretariat PO Box 3724 Wellington6140 Dear Secretariat Tax Working Group Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper We are writing to submit on the Tax Working Group’s Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper(“the submissions paper”). We are members of the Corporate Taxpayers Group, who is also making a submission; however, given the importance of the topics included in the submissions paper we are also making a separate submission. We would be happy to be contacted by the Tax Working Group and the Secretariat to discuss any of the points raised in our submission. About Fisher & Paykel Healthcare Fisher & Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited (and its branches and subsidiaries) (the “F&P Group”) is a leading designer, manufacturer and marketer of products and systems for use in respiratory care, acute care, surgery and the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea. Our headquarters, R&D facilities and New Zealand manufacturing operations are located in East Tamaki, Auckland. We also operate a manufacturing facility in Tijuana, Mexico. We have over 4,100 of our people located in over 30 countries worldwide, with the majority located in New Zealand. Our products are sold in over 120 countries worldwide. Principal sales and distribution sites are located in the United States, the United Kingdom, Europe, Asia and Australia. Our competitors are predominantly headquartered in the United States or Europe with operations in multiple jurisdictions. Our aspiration is to double our constant currency revenue every five to six years through investing for long term growth in research, technology and the development of our employees.

Which of these are most important?as this question and our responses encapsulate the topics of particular relevance and importance to the F&P Group. Our main submission points are: xThe fundamental challenge to the New Zealand tax system is to remain competitive and to continue to attract and retain investment in New Zealand. xIn order to maintain its competitiveness New Zealand requires a lower headline corporate income tax rate. xA lower effective corporate income tax rate achieved by incentivising good behaviour (such as R&D) and allowing tax deductions for black hole expenditure (such as tax depreciation on buildings) should be considered. xReducing compliance costs for business should also be considered. What do you see as the main risks, challenges, and opportunities for the tax system over the medium-to long term? Which of these are most important? While the F&P Group is headquartered in New Zealand 99% of our revenue is generated offshore. We also have people located in over 30 countries worldwide, including at our manufacturing facility in Tijuana, Mexico and at our sales and distribution sites in countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Europe, Asia and Australia. We are currently expanding our facilities in New Zealand and in Mexico with the construction of a new building in New Zealand and a new facility in Mexico to accommodate our growth. Our competitors are predominantly headquartered in the United States and Europe. We have been closely monitoring the tax developments in a number of key countries in which we operate, many of which have introduced or are proposing tax changes specifically targeted at encouraging or retaining investment in their country. Some of these changes are to reduce the headline corporate income tax rate (relevant countries for the F&P Group are the United Kingdom, the United States, France and Australia), while other changes are targeted at specific incentives (such as the changes for exporters from the United States). Given our global operations, these changes are likely to be beneficial for the F&P Group and its shareholders but they do lessen some of the benefits of being located in New Zealand. The F&P Group’s decisions on where to undertake its operations are based on sound business and commercial factors, of which tax is one consideration. Given our global operations we believe that the fundamental challenge to the New Zealand tax system is to remain competitive and to continue to attract and retain investment in New Zealand. We believe that the Tax Working Group should have New Zealand’s tax competitiveness as its primary objective. We support the following considerations: Competitive headline corporate income tax rate Lowering the headline corporate income tax rate to a rate more in line with New Zealand’s major trading partners (see also the above countries relevant for the F&P Group) and the OECD average (24.9% for 2017) should be actively considered. Sound investment decisions consider all factors, of which tax is generally a part. Having a corporate income tax rate above the OECD average is not sustainable in the long term for New Zealand given its relative small size and distance to major trading nations or for multinationals with a choice of where to locate and carry on business. A more competitive corporate income tax rate is one lever available to continue to encourage and maintain investment in New Zealand. We are aware of the desire to align company and individual tax rates as a reason for not reducing the New Zealand corporate income tax rate. However, a number of countries appear 3 to have overcome this “issue” in their own countries and do not believe that this should be a primary determinant in maintaining the close alignment. We also believe that there are sufficient controls available in this area to prevent any abuse. We continue to support the imputation regime and believe that this should be maintained. However, we believe that improvements could be made to the system to ensure that it remains competitive in the international context. We would encourage the consideration of trans- Tasman recognition of imputation / franking credits and/or limited streaming of imputation credits to ensure that maximum value can be provided to domestic and foreign shareholders. Competitive effective corporate income tax rate Lowering the effective corporate income tax rate by incentivising good behaviour/activities (such as R&D tax incentives) or re-introducing tax deductions for certain black hole expenditure (such as depreciation on buildings) should also be actively considered. We generally support the broad-base low rate approach of the New Zealand tax system. In the paragraphs above we question whether the “low rate” label can still be applied given the actions that other countries have taken to lower their own corporate income tax rates. If there is little appetite to reduce the headline corporate income tax rate in New Zealand, then other tax changes should be considered which have the same desired outcome of encouraging or maintaining investment in New Zealand. R&D We welcome the theme of the proposals set out in the R&D Tax Incentive Discussion Document: Fuelling Innovation to Transform our Economyas a measure to encourage positive investment and spending in New Zealand. Some of our largest competitors already benefit from R&D Tax credit/incentive regimes in the countries in which they operate and we support the consideration of an equivalent regime for New Zealand. We intend to make a detailed submission on this topic. Building depreciation In recent years there have been some positive changes to address specific types of black hole expenditure. However, there are still some areas of legitimate (and potentially significant) business expenditure for which there is no tax deduction available; tax depreciation on buildings is particularly relevant to the F&P Group. Our headquarters in East Tamaki, Auckland are located on 42 hectares of land and the F&P Group currently occupies 85,000m 2 of purpose designed facilities housing R&D, sales and marketing, manufacturing, operations and administration teams across three buildings. Approximately 32% of the area is allocated to manufacturing related activities and the remainder to office and support areas for R&D, sales and marketing, and administration. Earthworks is well progressed on a new 36,000m 2 building at our East Tamaki site which will principally accommodate a blend of R&D and pilot manufacturing, and will accommodate anticipated growth from 2020 until around 2023. The East Tamaki site has capacity for another building of a similar size, beyond which a further site (in New Zealand or elsewhere) will need to be considered. In addition to leased land in Tijuana, Mexico we also own 15 hectares of land in Tijuana and are constructing a new 17,000m 2 manufacturing facility on the site, as the first of a potential four building manufacturing campus. It is anticipated that the first facility will be completed later in calendar year 2018. Once the construction of this facility is complete we intend to commence exploring the possibility of manufacturing at a further location outside of New Zealand. The value of the buildings in the F&P Group’s balance sheet is not insignificant and when the two additional buildings are completed will be substantially more. In New Zealand we receive no tax relief on the significant investment we have made and are continuing to make to our 4 structural assets. In comparison, in Mexico there is tax depreciation available for the investment we are making (and intend to make) by constructing a manufacturing campus in Tijuana. The tax treatment of the specialised buildings in which we design and manufacture our products is one of the inputs included in our facility location decision making. We consider that re-instating tax depreciation on buildings will support New Zealand growth, complement other initiatives such as the R&D tax incentive and level the playing field for New Zealand based companies compared to our offshore competitors. We are aware that the Tax Working Group is considering a capital gains tax and believe that this analysis should not be undertaken in isolation, and should also address tax depreciation on buildings. Compliance costs With an increasing reliance on technology in the workplace, the ability to provide and share large amounts of data and the consequential changes in the way that business takes place across borders we consider that the Tax Working Group should also have an objective to reduce tax compliance costs for businesses. We support the following considerations of relevance to the F&P Group: Active income branch exemption For genuine commercial reasons we conduct a proportion of our offshore operations through branches of New Zealand and foreign companies. We are supportive of the active income exemption for Controlled Foreign Companies (“CFCs”) and for Foreign Investment Funds. We are also supportive of extending the active income exemption for foreign branches of New Zealand companies. We believe the treatment of branches should, where possible, mirror the treatment of CFCs. In our mind businesses that operate as subsidiaries or branches are no different from an operational view point and should be treated as such. We consider that this is also critical in order to reduce the current compliance costs that arise when operating offshore from New Zealand through a foreign branch. We consider this to be consistent with the current Business Tax Simplification policy work programme. We are aware that the active income exemption for foreign branches was considered during New Zealand’s response to hybrid mismatches. We understand the introduction of an active income exemption for foreign branches would restrict the flow through of foreign losses against the New Zealand tax base and there are concerns about the impact on taxpayers of removing this flow through of losses from foreign branches (especially for small start-up type businesses). While this is generally only a timing benefit as future income arising from the foreign branch should also be recognised in New Zealand, it is possible for taxpayers to structure their arrangements such that this is not necessarily the case. Employee mobility Domestic and international tax rules and, importantly, how these rules are applied and enforced by tax authorities can act as a significant barrier to the mobility of labour and employers being able to source the skills they need. Various tax barriers exist to both trans-Tasman labour mobility and to attracting highly skilled personnel from further afield. Addressing these issues will help New Zealand businesses, such as the F&P Group, deploy and attract talent. Some of the compliance costs / issues we have encountered are connected with the application of the treaty exemption based on the time spent in country and who is the economic employer, superannuation (including Kiwisaver) complications particularly for short secondments and the time and cost of operating shadow payrolls and applying for special tax codes. Concluding comments We continue to be a large New Zealand headquartered business employing a growing number of people both in New Zealand and offshore. We want to continue to be based in New Zealand and pay the majority of our taxes here. However, being an international business with 5 substantially all of our customers and revenue base and a growing proportion of our manufacturing outside of New Zealand, we therefore have a choice in where we locate growth and value creating activities and assets and employees to support them. We therefore encourage the Tax Working Group to ensure we and other New Zealand headquartered businesses have access to an internationally competitive tax regime to assist (or at the least not inhibit) this intention and our competitive position against our international competitors. Please let us know if you have any queries in relation to our submission, or would like to discuss any of the points further.

Submission to the Tax Working Group This is a submission from Frucor Suntory NZ Ltd to the Tax Working Group. The Working Group has indicated that it will consider expanding the scope of behavioural taxes as part of its review, calling out sugary drinks in particular. 1 Frucor Suntory supports the Government’s efforts to address obesity and related illness, but opposes the taxation of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs). There is insufficient evidence to show that taxes on SSBs, as a small portion of overall energy intake, will positively impact health outcomes for New Zealanders. We submit that the Working Group recommends against implementing a sugar tax. About Frucor Suntory Frucor Suntory produces, markets and distributes a range of fruit juices, fruit drinks, sports drinks, energy drinks, waters and carbonated soft drinks.

Sugar sweetened beverages and obesity Almost one in three adult New Zealanders is obese. 2 This is a significant problem without a single cause or a simple solution. Obesity is basically the result of too much energy in and not enough out. 3 Sources 1 Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper available at https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2018-03/twg-subm-bgrd-paper-mar18.pdf (last accessed 30.04.2018) “New Zealand does, in a few selected cases, deliberately incentivise or discourage particular behaviour (for example, tobacco and alcohol excise tax).

But with SSBs accounting for just 1.6% of a New Zealand adult’s daily energy intake, they make up a small fraction of the total intake. 4 In fact, for the past 10 years, SSB consumption has declined as consumers look towards healthier low and no kilojoule options. 5 Yet health academics and campaigners continue to pressure governments to introduce taxes on SSBs – despite the lack of conclusive, empirical evidence that they actually improve health outcomes. The problem is that taxation does not always change underlying behaviour. While tobacco excise taxes may have reduced smoking rates, there is no guarantee a tax on SSBs will lead to decreased consumption because SSBs can “easily be substituted for other sugary foods such as cakes and biscuits, and alcoholic beverages, which have a negative societal impact”. 6 Singling out soft drinks alone will not solve the obesity problem, given the small proportion of kilojoules they contribute in the average diet. International experience Research into sugar taxes in Mexico, Denmark and several US states shows that taxes on SSBs are not effective in achieving their stated health goals of reducing obesity and related illness. The 2017 New Zealand Institute of Economic Research (NZIER) report to the Ministry of Health concluded that “the evidence that sugar taxes improve health is weak”. 7 NZIER assessed 47 peer-reviewed studies and working papers on sugar taxes published in the past five years and found none of them “has identified an impact on health outcomes”. 8 Similarly, the 2016 report by the International Tax and Investment Center and Oxford Economics entitled “The Impact of Selective Food and Non-Alcoholic Beverage Taxes,” 9 found that governments seeking to introduce sugar taxes do so in a highly speculative context. 10 4 New Zealand National Nutrition Survey 2008/2009 available at https://www.health.govt.nz/system/files/documents/publications/a-focus-on-nutrition-v2.pdf (last accessed 13.04 2018) 5 New Zealand Beverage Council, “A Look Inside NZ Fridges” (2016) available at http://www.nzbc.nz/myfiles/Wright\_Beverage\_Infographic\_23.pdf (last accessed 13.04.2018).

Submission to the Tax Working Group This is a submission from Frucor Suntory NZ Ltd to the Tax Working Group. The Working Group has indicated that it will consider expanding the scope of behavioural taxes as part of its review, calling out sugary drinks in particular. 1 Frucor Suntory supports the Government’s efforts to address obesity and related illness, but opposes the taxation of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs). There is insufficient evidence to show that taxes on SSBs, as a small portion of overall energy intake, will positively impact health outcomes for New Zealanders.

The FSC represents New Zealand’s financial services industry having 33 members at 31 March 2018. Companies represented in the FSC include the major insurers in life, disability, income, and trauma insurance, and some fund managers and KiwiSaver providers plus law firms, audit firms, and other providers to the financial services sector. Our submission has been developed through consultation with FSC members, and represents the views of our members and our industry. We acknowledge the time and input of our members in contributing to this submission. The FSC‘s guiding vision is to be the voice of New Zealand’s financial services industry and we strongly support initiatives that are designed to deliver: 1. Strong and sustainable consumer outcomes; 2. Sustainability of the financial services sector; and 3. Increasing professionalism and trust of the industry. Executive summary We welcome the opportunity to submit on whether the tax system should encourage saving for retirement and provide suggestions on how this could be achieved. Given the focus of the FSC on growing and protecting the wealth of New Zealanders, our submission is centred around the question on Retirement Savings: Should the tax system encourage saving for retirement as a goal in its own right? If so, what changes would you suggest to achieve this goal? The FSC believes that the tax system should encourage saving for retirement. The FSC would therefore support any recommendations of the Tax Working Group that both encourage greater Financial Services Council of New Zealand Level 33, ANZ Centre, 23-29 Albert St, Auckland 1010 P: +64 9 985 5762 E: fsc@fsc.org.nz www.fsc.org.nz 2 FSC Submission – Tax Working Group savings and/or provide a “level playing field” for investments that will encourage diversification of investments (including retirement savings) by individual investors. The FSC considers that the most viable options to encourage retirement savings that best fit within the current “Taxed Taxed Exempt” tax policy setting, and which could be implemented relatively easily, are: 1. provide lower PIR tax rates across all PIR bands for all PIE funds; or 2. at a minimum, provide lower PIR tax rates for locked-in savings such as KiwiSaver and similar locked-in superannuation schemes (including wholesale PIEs). Ideally lower PIR tax rates could be based on a proportion of the appropriate marginal tax rate of each individual scheme member, for example, reducing existing PIR rates for these products by a further 5% to say 5.5%, 12.5% and 23%. 3. Remove or reduce the rate of Employer Superannuation Contribution Tax (ESCT) that applies to employer contributions, or if a more targeted approach was preferred because of fiscal cost, limit ESCT relief to below a certain threshold, say $48,000, to assist the growth of retirement savings of lower income earners. The FSC believes that it is important that the tax policy settings are appropriate to encourage New Zealanders to save for their retirement, and that those settings complement the broader retirement policy settings (and are not necessarily done in isolation). I can be contacted on to discuss any element of our submission. Yours sincerely Richard Klipin Chief Executive Officer, Financial Services Council \[1\] 3 FSC Submission – Tax Working Group Introduction Our research shows that a very real concern for New Zealanders is whether they will be able to have a comfortable retirement financially. This research also shows that New Zealanders are under-prepared for retirement 1 . It is forecast that there is a $218 average after tax weekly gap between what the retired need to live comfortably and what they actually have. For many, this gap may well be larger especially if they still have a mortgage or are renting. In the FSC’s view, this highlights to those still working the importance of making the most of opportunities to grow their wealth and increase their sources of retirement income. We do not believe that New Zealand Superannuation will be enough to facilitate the high level of living standards that New Zealanders expect during retirement. This puts the onus on private retirement savings to bridge the income gap during retirement. The FSC believes that the taxation of savings forms an important part of the overall retirement puzzle. Therefore, it will be important that the tax policy settings encourage New Zealanders to save for their retirement, and that those settings complement the broader retirement policy settings (and are not necessarily done in isolation). We therefore welcome the opportunity to submit on whether the tax system should encourage saving for retirement and provide suggestions on how this could be achieved. Should the tax system encourage saving for retirement as a goal in its own right? If so, what changes would you suggest to achieve this goal? Broadly, New Zealand follows a “Taxed Taxed Exempt” (TTE) approach to the taxation of savings. This means that savings are generally funded out of post tax income (T), returns on savings are taxed (T) and withdrawals of savings are tax free (E). This does however place considerable importance on ensuring that the current tax system, while not providing concessions for retirement savings, does not go beyond that and penalise retirement savings due to tax applying to savings as they accrue or distort decisions between different forms of savings. The strategic issue is therefore to have all savings taxed to an equal extent but, if this is not possible, to remove or at least reduce tax disincentives on accumulating savings so that savings are not directed by the tax system away from financial assets (e.g. bank deposits, government bonds, equities, managed investment schemes such as KiwiSaver). How our tax system impacts on the accumulated investment income of retirement savings is therefore critical for determining the level of retirement income New Zealanders can expect in the future. The quality of savings in New Zealand has been historically recognised as a problem. New Zealanders have traditionally put a large proportion of their savings into residential property. The reasons behind that may be entirely rational, taking into account the bad experiences as a result of investment fads, the stock market crash in the 1980s, the dot com collapse in the 1990s and the global financial crisis that saw the collapse of many finance companies. However, 1 Great Expectations: Research conducted for the FSC, December 2017 4 FSC Submission – Tax Working Group investment that increases the cost of residential property contributes nothing to the productive growth of the country. The current tax policy settings encourage the over-investment in land (residential property) and under-saving by way of financial assets. This has adverse impacts on retirement and housing policy and also results in our relatively low level of savings being put to relatively unproductive use. Further, even without an increase in the overall level of national savings, policy changes that redirect savings into financial assets such as KiwiSaver in our view would improve the quality of investments and facilitate investment in the productive areas of the economy. In order to achieve a more level playing field, either investments currently receiving favourable tax treatment will need to be taxed more, or those investments currently disadvantaged taxed less. In reality, it is likely that a mixture of approaches will be required to achieve an optimal outcome. From a compliance perspective, maintaining simple rules with broad application should be encouraged with any changes recommended. The FSC therefore supports any recommendations of the Tax Working Group that both encourage greater savings and provide a “level playing field” for investments that will encourage diversification of investments (including retirement savings) by individual investors. This should also provide social and fiscal benefits to the New Zealand economy over the longer term, such as a significant enlargement and deepening of our financial system with knock-on effects for firm growth and productivity. At a minimum, the FSC recommend a move towards a ttE type system be evaluated for locked in savings such as KiwiSaver i.e. tax contributions (the first ‘t’) and the savings income (the second ‘t’) at lower tax rates. Given a substantial portion of locked in retirement savings are now managed through portfolio investment entities (PIEs), this outcome could be achieved through an across the board reduction in the tax rates that apply to locked-in PIEs such as KiwiSaver. Tax barriers to retirement savings The FSC published a report in 2013 titled “The tax barriers to retirement prosperity in New Zealand” which considered how our current tax rules affect savings, retirement provision and New Zealand’s overall economy 2 . The report also outlined a number of options that could be considered to reduce these barriers. A copy of the paper is attached to this submission. 2 The 2013 Paper was produced with the assistance of Paul Mersi (a former tax partner of PricewaterhouseCoopers and a member of the Savings Working Group), and Robin Oliver MNZM (a former Deputy Commissioner of Inland Revenue in charge of tax policy) and modelling work done for FSC by EY, with the particular input of Peter Goss (Director, Transaction Advisory Services) and Aaron Quintal (Director, Tax) and Blair Tomblin (Senior Consultant, Tax) who was with IRD Policy Advice Division. The Paper has been reviewed by Professor John Piggott of the University of New South Wales and a member of the Henry Review in Australia and the modelling work has been reviewed by John Savage a former NZIER Senior Economist. 5 FSC Submission – Tax Working Group The key findings of the report were: 1. that tax changes are necessary to remove the tax barriers in the current tax rules, which heavily discriminate against savings in financial assets. 2. No other country has our combination of comprehensive taxation of the return on debt instruments as they accrue, no superannuation tax concessions, no tax on capital gains on rental properties, and the unconstrained deductibility of the nominal value of interest against other income on debt used to purchase rental property. 3. For most people their first priority is likely to be paying off the home mortgage and then meeting their retirement savings target by building up investments. In New Zealand this is likely to be a KiwiSaver scheme. However, New Zealanders are not saving enough in this way and our current tax rules are a major reason for this. 4. Our tax rules heavily discriminate against savings in financial assets (whether directly or via KiwiSaver or other types of funds) relative to investing in home ownership. For example: a. For a home owner every dollar used to repay the mortgage reduces mortgage interest costs that are non-deductible and have to be paid out of after-tax wages. The return on an investment in mortgage repayments is thus totally tax-free. Being a tax-free investment the tax benefit or subsidy is equal to the total equity investment in the home times the income a person would get from investing this money in, for example a bank account, times the person’s marginal tax rate. b. Ownership of rental accommodation was also tax favoured but to a lesser extent as noted by the Savings Working Group report in 2011, largely due to the non-taxation of capital gains and the ability to deduct the inflation component of interest costs against other income. c. By contrast, an investment in say debt instruments such as a bank term deposit was tax penalised with an effective tax rate up to almost 50% 3 . What this means is that people need to save almost twice as much when investing savings in financial assets such as KiwiSaver in order to generate the same income as investing in home ownership. These findings are consistent with the analysis in the Future of Tax background paper on pages 39-40 which clearly illustrates the issue of different types of savings being taxed at significantly different effective tax rates. As the background paper notes, there should be 3 Pg8, The tax barrier to retirement prosperity in New Zealand. The real effective tax rate was calculated as the tax rate on the nominal return as a percentage of the real return. For example, regarding interest income on a bank term deposit a person pays tax on the 6% nominal return at 33% and inflation of 2%. The tax liability of 1.98% (being 33% times 6%) is calculated as a proportion of the real return of 4%. The real effective tax rate on a bank account term deposit of 49.20%, calculated as 1.98%/4%. 6 FSC Submission – Tax Working Group only minor (or no) differences in the tax treatment of different forms of investments if our broad base, low rate system is working well. 5. When it comes to accumulating savings, whether tax is levied each year as income accrues (the tax treatment of KiwiSaver and bank term deposits) versus taxing only when the savings are withdrawn (the tax treatment of a property taxed on gains when it is sold) made a big difference to the eventual post-tax saving fund, the longer the savings accumulate. This simply reflects the importance of compounding interest in building up a substantial fund of savings over time. This is demonstrated in the following graph. This shows how an initial $100 deposit grows over 50 years to $1,842 if untaxed, $1,319 if taxed only when withdrawn and only $782 if taxed annually on an accrual basis. In other words, in this example, taxing the deposit earnings reduces its value to the saver by about one third but taxing those earnings as they accrue year by year reduces the savings by 57%. Assumptions: nominal return of 6%, marginal tax rate of 30%. $100 is invested for up to 50 years. 6. A high tax rate on KiwiSaver investments has consequences for the level of private retirement savings in New Zealand. The real effective tax rate impact becomes higher the earlier a person starts saving for their retirement in KiwiSaver. This is due, in large part to the taxation of the inflation component of investment returns. As a consequence, a person would effectively be incentivised to delay saving for their retirement until a later time, thereby reducing the real effective tax rate impact on their KiwiSaver investment but greatly increasing the amount of contributions needing to be made annually in order to have enough savings for a comfortable retirement. 0.00 200.00 400.00 600.00 800.00 1000.00 1200.00 1400.00 1600.00 1800.00 2000.00 05101520253035404550 Value ($) Years The impact on value of taxation on a realisation basis Tax free Tax on realisation Taxed as accrued 7 FSC Submission – Tax Working Group Saving a little for a long time is therefore not a tax effective retirement savings strategy for New Zealanders but saving over a shorter time period is generally unaffordable. This tax bias against financial assets used to build up a retirement fund matters. It penalises such savings and makes it hard for people to save to meet their retirement objective. It also encourages people to invest in housing not financial assets such as KiwiSaver. It therefore should also not come as a surprise that most New Zealanders do not think they are saving enough to fund the sort of retirement they want. The need to address the tax treatment of savings is often seen as an issue relevant to our level of retirement provision. In part that is the case, but it is only part of the story. It needs to be addressed not only as part of sensible retirement income policy but also if New Zealand is to meet our economic expectations as a country. What is the appropriate model to tax retirement savings – TTE, TET, EET or something else? The largest cost by far borne by those saving for retirement is the taxation of the return on savings (the middle “T”). The effect of taxation can be to reduce a person’s private retirement income on a given level of savings by almost half. That is especially the case with long term or accumulating savings where savings are made over time and the return is reinvested each year in the instrument or savings fund. The issue of the appropriate tax policy settings for savings is therefore critical for the ability of people to provide a comfortable retirement income by saving a relatively small proportion of their income throughout their working years (saving a little for a long time). However, the options for change are not easy. A modest and realistic objective is to recognise that home ownership will remain the priority for most people. Therefore, the FSC believes that we should ensure that the tax system provides a level playing field with respect to how people invest their discretionary savings over and above their home ownership needs. This requires a more even or neutral tax treatment of savings for retirement in financial assets compared with the tax treatment of investments in rental accommodation. New Zealand adopted its TTE basis for taxing retirement income in 1988 and is one of a few countries within the OECD that uses a TTE basis (although we note that Australia does have a concessionary tax rate applied to superannuation scheme earnings). OECD research published in July 2017 noted countries encourage saving for retirement by taxing retirement savings in private pension plans differently to savings in alternative plans or offering other financial incentives. This is consistent with evidence that suggests tax can have a very significant impact on how people save and invest. This research noted around half of OECD and EU countries apply a variant of EET to retirement savings (refer figure 1) 4 . 4 Tax treatment of Retirement Savings in private pension plans across OECD countries, July 2017 8 FSC Submission – Tax Working Group Past research has supported an EET regime increasing both personal retirement income and total tax revenue over a life time given the compounding effect gross investment returns has on the accumulated lump sum at retirement. It would also provide encouragement to continue saving in retirement and broadens the tax base in retirement when the retired make demands on public services such as health. The FSC acknowledges the fiscal cost of an EET regime during transition and also how it interacts with the current National Superannuation settings. For that reason, we have considered alternatives that would not present the same fiscal cost. 9 FSC Submission – Tax Working Group Potential options under TTE approach The FSC’s 2013 report outlined a number of possible responses to level the playing field for investment in financial assets, including setting out the advantages and disadvantages of each option. We have not sought to repeat the analysis completed of the options in this submission, but it can be found in pages 26 to 28 (land and residential property) and 34 to 40 (savings) of that report. The options for reform are not necessarily mutually exclusive but instead a portfolio of options could be pursued. The FSC considers that the most viable options to encourage retirement savings that best fit within the current TTE tax policy setting, and which could be implemented relatively easily, would be as follows: 1. provide lower PIR tax rates across all PIR bands for all PIE funds or 2. at a minimum, provide lower PIR tax rates on locked-in savings such as KiwiSaver and similar locked-in superannuation schemes (including wholesale PIEs). Ideally a lower PIR tax rates could be based on a proportion of the appropriate marginal tax rate of each individual scheme member 5 , for example, reducing existing PIR rates for these products by further 5% to say 5.5%, 12.5% and 23%. 3. Remove or reduce the rate of Employer Superannuation Contribution Tax (ESCT) that applies to employer contributions, or if a more targeted approach was preferred because of fiscal constraints, limit ESCT relief to below a certain threshold, say $48,000, to assist the growth of retirement savings of lower income earners. We believe that a much lower tax rate on investments in financial assets or KiwiSaver-type schemes, would also encourage more people to save for their retirement from an earlier stage of life. This is critical to ensure that New Zealand builds a solid economy for the future with people having a comfortable standard of living in their retirement years. We acknowledge that any reduction to the tax rate on financial assets or KiwiSaver-type schemes would have a fiscal cost, although this cost could be offset by changes in other policy settings that are recommended by the Tax Working Group. However, if necessary, part of any fiscal cost could be met by redirecting the current government funded incentives for KiwiSaver (the annual member tax credit) to reduce the fiscal impact. However, this approach would need to be considered in the context of the Governments’ wider retirement policy settings and other incentives that the Government may be considering outside the tax system. 5 The FSC’s 2013 report estimated that, to create a level playing field for say KiwiSaver funds with an investment in rental property, on reasonable assumptions, the highest tax rate on savings in a KiwiSaver scheme needs to be substantially lowered from the current 28% to 1% assuming that the alternative investment to KiwiSaver is an investment in rental property that is 80% geared and is held for twenty years until sold. The recent changes to introduce a 5 year bright line test and proposal to ring fence rental losses will partially level the playing field, but we still believe that there is scope for lower tax rates to achieve a more neutral outcome. 10 FSC Submission – Tax Working Group Real vs nominal gains Given our comments above about relief for the taxation of retirement earnings given the powerful impact it has on the growth of retirement savings, we do need to comment on taxing real vs nominal gains particularly if the Tax Working Group do recommend to the Government introducing a Capital Gains Tax. Tax should only be levied on real gains, not nominal gains so there is no taxation of gains which are solely attributable to inflation. Given the difficulty in applying this, in practice, nominal gains are taxed. Taxing nominal gains is an issue, especially in a low interest rate environment. As noted in the Tax Working Group Background Paper, “As nominal income is fully taxed (that is, income including the inflation component), a 33% tax on the nominal return (that is, the real return plus inflation) on savings in a bank account is actually a materially higher tax on the real return. 6 ” Income from capital should be taxed on a real basis as opposed to a nominal basis, both in relation to taxation on dividends and taxation on interest. These issues are even more significant in the context of how a newly introduced capital gains tax would apply to property that has been held for a number of years, discussed further below. For capital income where the tax is levied relatively close to the time of its derivation over a short period, inflation can be considered as immaterial. For assets held over a longer term the effects of inflation will be significant, which necessitates some form of allowance to attempt to minimise the taxation of inflation created gains. There are a number of options to account for inflation. There is a Risk-Free-Return-Method which makes an annual adjustment for inflation which can be set at a rate based on real returns on capital. This option accurately allows for adjustments for the effect of inflation. Another option would be to adopt some form of indexation. While indexation should be more accurate than a taper (discussed below), it would also be more complex. Australia previously had an indexation system but this was replaced in 1999 with tax relief. The UK has also changed indexation both for individuals and, more recently, companies. This then brings us to taper relief. Many countries have taper relief where the amount of the capital gain on which tax is levied decreases or is eliminated if the asset is held for a certain period. In Australia assets held for over a year qualify for a partial exemption from Australian CGT (a 50% discount for individuals and trusts and 33.33% for complying superannuation entities). Holding period thresholds for taper relief vary significant across countries, for example Australia and the USA have a one year minimum holding period whereas Germany has a 10 year minimum period and France a minimum of 30 years. 6 Tax Working Group, Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper (March 2018), p39. 11 FSC Submission – Tax Working Group An option would be a taper system with a scale of different rates. For example, an asset held for five years might qualify for say a 10% discount CGT rate and an asset held for 10 years might qualify for say a 25% discount CGT rate. This would allow the taper to more accurately reflect the trend of inflation over time. The taper could be periodically reset approximating to inflation outturns over the holding period. Retention of capital gains exemption – PIE funds If a capital gains tax is recommended by the Tax Working Group, given our comments above on growing private retirement savings, the FSC would strongly advocate that the current tax exemption relating to capital gains on Australasian shares be retained for all PIEs. This recognises that many retail funds including KiwiSaver funds invest into wholesale PIEs to obtain their investment exposures. FIF rules The existing FIF rules (i.e. fair dividend method, comparative value method) would also need to be modified if a capital gains tax is recommended by the Tax Working Group to ensure double taxation does not arise. Land tax The introduction of a land tax is likely to have a wider impact than just those investments which are the target of the reform. However, any exemptions to narrow the effect of the tax (such as excluding the land under the family home) is likely to reduce the efficiencies of such a regime and its ability to generate taxation revenue. Given the overall impact of the regime would have on the asset bases and balance sheets of the country and individual businesses, we consider that a land tax is not a preferred option. Savings in retirement The market for post-retirement products in New Zealand is an opportunity and the industry is looking at ways to provide products such as annuities. The FSC supports an active annuities market (i.e. retirement investment and drawdown options for consumers once their retirement funds become available to them). We believe that such a market would help New Zealanders make the most of their KiwiSaver and retirement savings and help people achieve the level of retirement they want. However, the current tax settings potentially over-tax annuitants because annuity earnings are taxed at the corporate tax rate of the annuity issuer (often 28%). Tax rate data previously distributed by Inland Revenue shows the tax rates of a high proportion of those aged over 65 (the likely group of annuitants) is likely to be in the current 10.5% or 17.5% rate categories. We recommend the Tax Working Group consider a similar approach to Australia, where neither annuities or annuity accumulation are taxed. 12 FSC Submission – Tax Working Group GST Framework The FSC’s members have to work with the GST boundary between taxable supplies and exempt financial services. This is one of the most complicated areas of the GST rules. It also has the potential to create cascades of tax due to non-recoverable GST relating to exempt supplies being suffered at different points in the value chain. This means the effect of the GST is not transparent to those investors who actually bear the cost. Of particular concern is the “in source” bias created by GST. As GST does not apply to salary and wages, there is a bias to having services provided by employees rather than third parties whose services may be GST taxable. For the industry it is impractical and inefficient to hire employees to undertake work on every fund that they manage, for example, where specialist knowledge or skillsets are required such as managing global equity/fixed interest investment portfolios. Further, the Financial Market Conduct Act 2013 (FMCA) and associated regulations impose particular ways of managing funds. The inclusion of “arranging financial services” as a financial service in the GST legislation has been helpful to manage the “in source” bias. It allows third party services to be supplied without further cascading of GST, which is ultimately borne by the end consumer, the investor. However, the definition may no longer be workable in achieving this policy objective due to changes arising from the FMCA and associated regulations and interpretations taken by Inland Revenue which is a current issue that requires remediation. The possible responses include: • A review of the financial services definitions to confirm the border is appropriately drawn. A narrow review is currently being considered by Inland Revenue which may resolve some of the problems associated with a taxable/non-taxable boundary. • A review to consider the appropriate treatment of financial services. The FSC’s response considers this further. The last significant review of financial services and GST was in 2002. Around that time, work was done by Professor Tim Edgar on the appropriate treatment of financial services. The broad conclusion was that GST should not apply as, in brief, there was no consumption but mere flows of money. This work in part supported the policy for the GST B2B zero-rating rules. It was not accepted as supporting a broader zero-rating of financial services. The FSC considers the zero-rating of financial services is a worthwhile topic of further consideration and that it would be timely for the TWG to support a wider review of GST and financial services. We would therefore recommend that a such a review be part of the on-going work programme recommended by the TWG (as we acknowledge that it is unlikely that the TWG will have time to consider the issue and make recommendations). 13 FSC Submission – Tax Working Group Appendix A: The tax barrier to retirement prosperity in New Zealand

The table uses 100% gearing as one example. This means that the rental property is fully funded by debt and there is no equity investment. Such gearing is possible if an investor uses equity in their own home as security to purchase rental properties. A professional couple who have $400,000 equity in their $500,000 home can borrow $1 million to purchase two $500,000 houses to rent out. The couple have then used $200,000 of equity in their own home so that the bank is prepared to lend the full $1 million to purchase the rental properties. For tax purposes the two rental properties are 100% geared (funded by debt). The couple can then deduct the full interest cost, to the extent it exceeds rental income, from their other professional, income. 4HEABOVETABLEISEXPRESSEDINTERMSOFREALEFFECTIVETAXRATES “New Zealand stands out compared to comparable economies by having one of the highest tax biases in favour of investing in real estate and against investing in financial assets (such as KiwiSaver and bank term deposits).” PAGE 6 The tax barrier to retirement prosperity in New Zealand The Tax Bias has Important Consequences This tax bias against financial instruments used to build up a RETIREMENTFUNDMATTERS)TPENALISESSUCHSAVINGSANDMAKES ITHARDFORPEOPLETOSAVETOMEETTHEIRRETIREMENTOBJECTIVE 4HE3AVINGS7ORKING'ROUPESTIMATEDTHATONREASONABLE assumptions up to 90% of a person’s retirement income comes from the tax penalised compounding investment income and only 10% from the initial annual contributions out of salaries ANDWAGESMADEOVERAPERSONSWORKINGLIFE 7HENITCOMESTOACCUMULATINGSAVINGSWHETHERTAXISLEVIED each year as income accrues (the tax treatment of KiwiSaver and bank term deposits) versus taxing only when the savings are withdrawn (the tax treatment of a property taxed on gains when it is sold) makes a big difference to the eventual post-tax SAVINGFUNDTHELONGERTHESAVINGSACCUMULATE The retirement income that a person can expect to be generated from KiwiSaver or similar savings is therefore largely going to be FROMTHECOMPOUNDINGINCOMETHESCHEMEGENERATES4AXINGTHIS compounding income substantially reduces the source of 90% of EXPECTEDRETIREMENTINCOME This simply reflects the importance of compounding interest INBUILDINGUPASUBSTANTIALFUNDOFSAVINGSOVERTIME4HISIS DEMONSTRATEDINTHEFOLLOWINGGRAPH4HISSHOWSHOWANINITIAL $100 deposit grows over 50 years to $1,842 if untaxed, $1,319 IFTAXEDONLYWHENWITHDRAWNANDONLYIFTAXEDANNUALLY ONANACCRUALBASIS)NOTHERWORDSINTHISEXAMPLETAXINGTHE deposit earnings reduces its value to the saver by about one third but taxing those earnings as they accrue year by year reduces the SAVINGSBY THE IMPACT ON VALUE OF TAXATION ON A REALISATION BASIS YEARS VALUE ($)            05102045152530354050 TAX FREE TAX ON REALISATION TAXED AS ACCR UED Assumptions: nominal return of 6%, marginal tax rate of 30%. $100 is invested for up to 50 years. www.fsc.org.nz PAGE 7 This tax bias also encourages people to invest in housing not lNANCIALINSTRUMENTS7HEREASlNANCIALINVESTMENTSARELIKELYTO be used to increase the productive potential of the economy, more jobs and higher future incomes, tax induced housing investment ISLIKELYTOFLOWTHROUGHTOHIGHERLANDPRICES4HISDOESLITTLE if anything to increase the real wealth of New Zealand nor our ABILITYTOEARNHIGHERINCOMES-OREOVERMUCHOFOURHOUSING INVESTMENTISLIKELYTOBEFUNDEDULTIMATELYBYOFFSHOREBORROWING The tax system encourages offshore borrowing so that New :EALANDERSCANBIDAGAINSTEACHOTHERTOINCREASELANDPRICES As a result housing becomes increasingly less affordable for lower INCOMEEARNERSASDEMONSTRATEDBYTHEFOLLOWINGGRAPH Numerous government reports have concluded that this flows through to a low performing economy, lower incomes and less jobs, an economy that is vulnerable to offshore financial crises, unaffordable housing costs, and a higher exchange rate that MAKESITDIFlCULTFOREXPORTERSTOCOMPETEONWORLDMARKETS This is the result of tax rules that penalise saving in financial instruments and provide subsidies to housing and alternative INVESTMENTS4HELEVELOFSUBSIDYFORHOUSINGISVERYHIGH4HETAX subsidy on owner occupied housing is estimated to be $4 billion PERANNUM4HISISABOUTTWICETHELEVELOFASSISTANCETHE#ROWN spends each year to meet the housing needs of lower income New Zealanders through rent subsidies for state home tenants ANDINTHEACCOMMODATIONSUPPLEMENT)TISNOWONDERTHATAN ESTIMATEDOFHOUSEHOLDWEALTHISINTHEFORMOFHOUSING It is not a surprise that most New Zealanders do not think they ARESAVINGENOUGHTOFUNDTHESORTOFRETIREMENTTHEYWANT 3OURCE2ESERVE"ANKOF.EW:EALAND"RIGGSAND.G  RATIO OF AVERAGE HOUSE PRICE TO AVERAGE HOUSEOLD DISPOSABLE INCOME YEARS VALUE OF RATIO  6 5 4 3 2 1 0 19621968198019861992199820042010196519831989199520012013 “The level of subsidy for housing is very high.

The FSF is the industry body representing New Zealand’s responsible and ethical finance and leasing providers of New Zealand. We have nearly sixty members and associates providing financing, leasing, and credit-related insurance products to more than 2 million New Zealanders and some of our members are licensed Non-Bank Deposit Takers (“NBDTs”). Our affiliate members include internationally recognised legal and consulting partners. A list of our members is attached as Appendix A. Our work includes setting industry standards for responsible lending, compliance, consumer awareness and working with Government towards fair and enforced legislation. The following submission speaks mainly on behalf of the FSF’s NBDT members and their clients. Current tax treatment of interest income The Tax Working Group’s paper highlights the issue of the influence of tax settings on the rate and composition of saving in New Zealand. 1 It further notes that, as New Zealand taxes nominal income (i.e. in the context of interest, the real interest rate plus inflation), a 33% headline tax rate on the nominal return on deposits is a materially higher tax on the real return. The Tax Working Group’s Background Paper sets out that the effective marginal tax rate on interest as approximately 55.7% (a figure that is broadly 1 Tax Working Group, Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper, 2018, p. 39. similar to comparable studies). This is the highest of all savings types and is significantly higher than the top personal tax rate of 33%. This effective marginal tax rate is due to the effect of inflation on interest income. We set out a simplified example to illustrate the issue: Consider a situation where the nominal interest rate is 5%, the real interest rate is 3% (i.e. the rate of inflation is 2%), and the marginal tax rate is 33%. If you deposit $100 into a bank account, after one year you will have derived interest income of $5 and have tax deducted from this of $1.65. This will leave you with a bank balance before tax of $105 and after tax of $103.35. However, in that same time, inflation has meant that the purchasing power of money in your bank account has gone down and that $100 in year 1 is the equivalent of $102 in year 2. This means that the real return on the bank deposit is only $3. As tax of $1.65 is paid on the real return of $3, the effective tax rate on bank account interest is 55%. While New Zealand has experienced low inflation in recent years, it is has begun trending up again (and is forecast to be 2% by 2021 according to the Reserve Bank’s forecasts) and the average inflation rate since 2000 has been 2.7%. Even low inflation rates are significant when nominal interest rates are low (as they have been over the past decade). The tax treatment outlined above discourages savings and investment outside of residential housing, inflation on which is not taxed to the extent that gains are not caught by the new residential property “bright line” tests or otherwise taxed on revenue account. Under a broad base, low rate tax system, effective marginal tax rates should not vary between different investment types. We support policy options to encourage saving away from housing and towards more productive and diversified investment. Policy solutions We outline below some policy options which we consider would assist with this objective: — Excluding the inflation component of interest income from tax by indexing for inflation. We acknowledge that there is likely to be complexity in terms of implementation. In addition, the flipside of not taxing the inflation component of interest income is that the inflation component of interest expense is non-deductible. However, we consider the proposal should be explored in more detail as it is likely to be more efficient economically than current settings. Indexation of interest income and expenses at a rate that reflects the inflation rate (e.g. 2%) was supported by the Savings Working Group (their report also noted that the 1989 Government Consultative Document on the Taxation of Income from Capital concluded that indexation was not infeasible). 2 2 Savings Working Group, Final Report, 2011, pp. 14 and 83. — An alternative to indexation might be to tax only 60% of interest income or to reduce tax rates on interest income. We note that partial taxation of 60% of interest income was recommended in Australia’s 2001 Henry Review final report as providing a more consistent tax treatment across income from bank deposits and bonds, shares and rental property. 3 However, we acknowledge that consideration would need to be given to anti-avoidance provisions to mitigate arbitrage opportunities arising from having partially taxable interest income but fully deductible interest expense. — Consideration should also be given to reducing tax rates on income from capital more generally (e.g. deposits and dividend/interest-bearing investments and PIEs) as a further measure, i.e. moving to a Nordic-style tax treatment where capital is taxed more lightly on economic efficiency grounds. One option to achieve this could be to apply the 28% top tax rate that applies to investors in PIEs to interest and other investment income. This option was also supported by the Savings Working Group. 4 Finally, the FSF is a member of the Affiliated Industries Group of Business New Zealand and as such has had the opportunity to read their more comprehensive submission to you. The FSF fully supports all the excellent points made in that submission. Thank you again for the opportunity to submit. Please contact me on if you would like any further information.

SUBMISSION TO THE TAX WORKING GROUP ON THE FUTURE OF TAX: SUBMISSIONS BACKGROUND PAPER BY FOODSTUFFS (NZ) LIMITED APRIL 2018 1.0 Introduction 1.1 We are writing to submit on the Tax Working Group’s (TWG) Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper (the submissions paper). This submission is made by Foodstuffs (NZ) Ltd on behalf of its shareholders: Foodstuffs North Island Ltd and Foodstuffs South Island Ltd (Foodstuffs). 1.2 Foodstuffs appreciates the opportunity to provide our views and observations. We have not attempted to answer all the TWG’s questions. Whilst we see all questions raised as important and relevant, we are conscious the TWG will receive many submissions with many different views and appreciate the complex and demanding task to balance and consider all views. 1.3 We have focused on three areas which we see as having the most significant impact on our business – possible capital gains tax, possible land tax, and possible GST exemptions. We have also made some broader observations regarding New Zealand’s tax landscape and other possible tax areas that we would like to see addressed as part of the TWG’s process. 1.4 We would welcome the opportunity to make an oral submission to the TWG on our submission. 2.0 About Foodstuffs 2.1 Foodstuffs is New Zealand’s largest retailer and owns the following brands: PAK’nSAVE, New World, Four Square, Liquorland, Henry’s and Gilmours. PAK’nSAVE, New World, Four Square, Henry’s and Gilmours stores are licenced to owner-operator retailer members of the Foodstuffs co-operatives, while Liquorland stores are franchised. 2.2 Foodstuffs’ focus on grocery wholesaling and distribution is supported by a strategy of long term ownership of supermarket land and buildings. 2.3 Despite Foodstuffs’ phenomenal growth, Foodstuffs remains 100% New Zealand owned and operated with all profits and taxes remaining in New Zealand. 2.4 Foodstuffs is a large New Zealand business which makes a significant contribution to the New Zealand economy. Together with members, the wider organisation employs more than 36,000 people and for the year ended 31 March 2018, was responsible for paying or administering over $420 million in taxes, including income tax, PAYE, FBT, and GST. 3.0 General Comments 3.1 We support the continuation of a broad-based low-rate (BBLR) tax framework. We believe this is a fair tax system, treating all income and assets in a fair, balanced and efficient manner whilst being cost effective from a revenue dollar collected relative to collection rate, for New Zealand businesses and the Government. Further, we believe BBLR minimises distortions in the tax system and allows for tax to be a relatively neutral factor in decision making. 3.2 We believe the tax system, whilst revenue generation for the Government, also needs to support and incentivise innovation and economic growth. This in turn creates new business and employment opportunities for New Zealanders, to ensure the long-term sustainability and productivity of the New Zealand economy. 3.3 We support a level playing field between domestic players and foreign businesses. We also acknowledge that the compliance costs for small businesses are a heavier burden than for larger organisations. Given a large proportion of businesses employ fewer than 20 people, consideration needs to be given to how we can reduce compliance costs (not just for tax) for small businesses, to free up resources so they can make a greater contribution to the economy. 4.0 Specific Challenges Identified in Submissions Paper 4.1 Capital Gains Tax (CGT) 4.1.1 As noted above, we see one of the strengths of the New Zealand tax system is its BBLR framework. Further, we support a fair tax system and acknowledge that some may view the lack of a CGT regime as unfair. 4.1.2 Our observation is that it is debatable whether a CGT regime, which excludes owner- occupied housing, improves the tax system. In our view the tax base “gap”, currently not being taxed is much narrower than the perceived gap. This is due to the recently extended five-year bright line test (and ring-fencing of rental losses if introduced) and our current robust land transaction provisions which bring to tax any gains from property speculation and property businesses. 4.1.3 It is contra to the premise of a fair tax system and creates a tax imbalance, to tax certain productive assets. Foodstuffs, and many other productive businesses, including our farming community, do not exist to make a capital gain on its productive infrastructure assets. This is not part of the business model. If a CGT were to be introduced productive assets should be excluded from the regime. 4.1.4 Foodstuffs is a proud New Zealand owned and operated business which makes a significant contribution to New Zealand through its current tax contribution, employing more than 36,000 people, and supporting local growers and businesses as part of the grocery supply chain. Ultimately if a broad-based CGT were introduced, we would absorb as much of the additional tax burden as we could, however in reality some of the cost would be charged through to store owners and ultimately all New Zealanders as part of the cost of goods. 4.1.5 Foodstuffs operates in a highly competitive but fair market. Where costs into store rise as a consequence of any tax on our infrastructure assets, this arguably shifts the balance in favour of offshore competitors, for example where large offshore retailers operate from an offshore distribution centre. We are supportive of a fair tax system for all. 4.1.6 If a CGT were to be introduced for speculative assets, some allowance should be given for inflation in calculating capital gains. Any CGT should look to tax any ‘true’ capital gain and not be looking to tax nominal gains. Further if a CGT were to be introduced, “rollover relief” should be allowed where there is reinvestment in similar assets. 4.1.7 We encourage the TWG to bifurcate the issues facing the housing market from the wider property market, which includes non-residential land and buildings. We would be wary of using the tax system to improve affordability for owners and renters and support the transfer system as a mechanism to address imbalance. 4.2 Land Tax 4.2.1 We acknowledge that one of the perceived gaps in New Zealand’s current BBLR tax framework is land tax. In our view we do currently have a form of land tax via the rates charged by Local Government. 4.2.2 Our observation is that it is contra to the premise of a fair tax system, and creates a tax imbalance, to tax a single class of capital asset. 4.2.3 For the reasons noted above under capital gains taxes, if land tax were selectively introduced, some of this cost would be passed on to New Zealand customers and it potentially creates a competitive imbalance between local New Zealand based businesses and businesses with offshore distribution centres. 4.2.4 If a land tax were to be introduced, it should be limited to “non-productive” assets. 4.2.5 Consideration also needs to be given as to how a land owner would fund the land tax. It could be difficult for some sectors of society, which are asset rich and cash poor, to fund a land tax. If a land tax were to be introduced, consideration should be given to whether the tax is payable on realisation of the asset as opposed to annually. 4.3 GST Exemption for Particular Goods 4.3.1 We support the continuation of a no exemptions policy for GST and are of the view that GST should remain a broad-based tax with few, if any, exemptions. 4.3.2 From our observations New Zealand’s GST system is successful due to its simplicity (in both administration and application). GST is an effective and efficient tax, driven by the fact that the rules are broad and encompassing, with few exceptions. In our view, this simplicity should not be undermined by exclusions, particularly where they would add significant additional upfront costs (by way of systems and people) and ongoing compliance costs for many small businesses. 4.3.3 We are advocates for keeping the administrative costs of New Zealand business low, simple and certain for the business owner and customer. If exemptions were to be introduced, as opposed to zero-rating, this could result in additional costs to New Zealand businesses due to their inability to fully recover input tax. 4.3.4 Our view is the preferred way to support low income families is by the transfer system. 5.0 Other Observations 5.1 Businesses should be able to claim a tax deduction for all business expenditure, either immediately or over time. Currently there are a number of gaps in the tax legislation where legitimate business expenditure is non-deductible. We propose as part of the review of the current and future tax system, consideration is given to the non-deductibility of: (1) cost incurred in raising debt funding where ultimately the raising of debt is unsuccessful; (2) costs incurred in raising equity; (3) due diligence costs where the acquisition does not proceed; (4) some resource consent costs; (5) building earthquake strengthening costs; and (6) certain feasibility expenditure. 5.2 We note Australia adopts a “catch all” approach to black hole expenditure by providing an effective deduction for black hole expenditure, which is not otherwise deductible, spread over a period of 5 years. This could be a solution to the non-deductibility of black hole expenditure in New Zealand. 5.3 Further we would encourage the TWG to recommend the reinstatement of tax depreciation for non-residential buildings. In our experience commercial buildings do decline in value. From a fairness perspective, it is inequitable to treat different business assets differently particularly now in the increasingly omni-channel world, this builds inequality into the sale and distribution model. --------------------------------------------------------

The NZAA is an incorporated society with over 1.6 million Members. It represents the interests of road users who collectively pay over $3 billion in taxes each year through fuel excise, road user charges, registration fees, ACC levies, and GST. The NZAA’s advocacy and policy work mainly focuses on protecting the freedom of choice and rights of motorists, keeping the cost of motoring fair and reasonable, and enhancing the safety of all road users. Our comments on the discussion paper relate to The Future Environment:  Technological change and its impact on tax bases  Environmental challenges We cover these items separately below. Technological change and its impact on tax bases The NZAA submits that it will be necessary in the next decade replace the Fuel Excise Duty (FED) with some form of electronic distance-based charging for all motor vehicles. In the medium-term fuel-based taxes will become less viable and equitable due to technological changes in the vehicle fleet. The expected growth in more fuel-efficient cars and electric vehicles (which are currently exempt from Road User Charges), and potentially excise-exempt biofuels will erode revenues from FED, which is hypothecated into the National Land Transport Fund which largely funds New Zealand’s land transport network. FED is also a regressive tax, in that it those members of society who are unable to afford a newer and more fuel-efficient car or electric vehicle, will disproportionately pay a higher amount of FED over the same distance. These same people also tend to live in outer suburbs of cities, where housing costs are lower, and where public transport is generally less accessible or practical (e.g. time-efficient), and thus travel further to access employment or health or education services. We understand the Ministry of Transport have commenced investigation into a universal electronic RUC system. That investigation should form an input into this broader review. THE NEW ZEALAND AUTOMOBILE ASSOCIATION INCORPORATED 342-352 Lambton Quay Wellington New Zealand PO Box 1 Wellington New Zealand \[1\] 2 AA Submission: Future of Tax Environmental challenges NZAA Members are concerned about the environment. 88 percent of Members are conscious of being environmentally responsible, and in regards to transport, 69% say they have made changes to their travel in recent years for environmental reasons. However, in a September 2017 random survey, AA Members said they were prepared to pay an average of $26 a month in a climate change tax that was used to reduce emissions. The NZAA submits that any environmental-based taxes should be:  proportionate  equitable  revenue-neutral The submission background working paper discusses using the tax system “to ensure that consumers and producers face the costs of emissions and other environmental harm.” We recommend that any environmental-based taxes should be proportionate to the contribution that motor vehicles make to greenhouse gas emissions. Approximately 12 per cent of New Zealand’s net greenhouse gas emissions come from light motor vehicles. Therefore, if it were possible to eliminate all motor vehicles or replace them with electric vehicles, New Zealand would still have 88 per cent of current greenhouse gas emissions. Further, the NZAA suggests that such taxes should not unfairly penalise New Zealanders who do not have viable mobility options, and have no control over the environmental footprint of their available mode. Until relatively recently, the only type of car that New Zealanders could buy was internal combustion-engined. Now electric vehicles offer a low-emission alternative, but are limited in supply and generally more expensive. The focus should be on encouraging people to make better environmental choices in future rather than penalise people for past choices. This includes investing in providing New Zealanders with viable mobility choices and alternatives to the car that are fit for purpose.

The Federation has a commitment to providing a powerful voice for women consumers of health and disability services, and to act as a public good advocate in matters that affect their well-being interests and those of their family/whanau. General Remarks 1. We support the Tax Working Group’s review seeking to identify a fair tax system that positively impacts on the well-being of all New Zealanders. 2. We applaud the holistic approach taken to adopt The Living Standards Framework incorporating the four ‘capital stocks’ and associated flows as a basis for public policy direction. We agree this approach is a more appropriate fit with Tiriti o Waitangi obligations and commitment to respect the land and the people, now and into the future; to strive for more equitable and just participation opportunities and outcomes for all from engaging in social and economic activity; and to consider how taxes might more fairly support these wider social wellbeing measures. 3. We have been dismayed to note the appalling statistics around child poverty, family violence, high incarceration rates; poor educational outcomes that have a strong link with socio-economic deprivation; and marked income inequalities in Aotearoa. Structural arrangements that emphasise and promote individual gain/success are inconsistent with cultures that prioritise communitarian values and obligations. Promotion of need for a more ‘caring society’ is too often left to whanau and/or the NGO social services sector to manage and pick up the shortfall, often on a voluntary basis. Clearly the current arrangements around opportunities, earnings and taxation Contact: Co-Convenors Barbara Holland Barbara Robson \[1\] Page 2 of 5 do not meet the necessary balance to foster an egalitarian society that is so glibly boasted about as ‘the great Kiwi way of life’ despite the reality. 4. We support the view that regulatory mechanisms that are fair, universal, and drive public good outcomes are the most effective tool for increasing social and economic well-being throughout Aotearoa. 5. FWHC recognises the broader elements covered in this discussion document but will limit our comments to some specific examples of current concern that we consider to result in unfair and/or inequitable outcomes, and we suggest some changes that we wish to see implemented. Low wage earners 6. We strongly support a continued focus on opportunities to rebalance tax measures that will reduce inequities associated with low wage earnings. 7. This becomes a critical issue for Work & Income recipients where the gain from supplementary earnings is compromised by current abatement levels and secondary tax rates. In the main, this is a significant issue that predominantly affects women who are also the primary caregivers for children. The private costs of child care, purchase of clothing that is appropriate for the employment role, and transport costs and time associated with getting to/from work, often create barriers to participating in the workforce when the only work available is also low paid. 8. New Zealand currently has a low wage employment market, and many workers work less than full time and want/need more hours and cannot get them. The minimum wage (which is set on the basis that it is the lowest rate of earnings a person should have to live on, and is still lower than the living wage, which is accepted as the actual lowest rate of earnings that a person can live on) is still significantly higher than the benefit plus any abated earnings. 9. Rather than part time or extra work being a way for beneficiaries to supplement a minimal income and cover extra cost-of-living expenses, the abatement regime actually imposes a ‘lid’ of poverty that is very hard to manage within. For many, the opportunity to exit the benefit system is minimal, and they are stuck in a poverty trap, unable to earn enough to be independent, and unable to retain the income they earn. 10. FWHC recommends: • that the rate at which earnings of Work and Income clients are penalised above the $150 gross threshold should be reduced from 70% to 20% in order to improve the incomes of people who are on a benefit and are working. Targeted taxes 11. FWHC notes the success of targeted taxes that act as a behaviour modifier, in particular, on both alcohol and tobacco, where these products cause considerable costs to wider society beyond that borne by the individual consumer. We urge the Page 3 of 5 government to continue this targeted approach to reduce uptake through raising excise taxes. 12. We are disturbed by the inconsistent and overall low level of tax take on alcohol sales that nowhere near meets the true related costs of alcohol-related harms that unfairly fall upon us all. While the contributions of the alcohol industry to the economy are emphasised by the industry we note the external costs are underplayed or silenced by those same players. We strongly believe this is unjust and that allowing this particular business sector to carry significantly more weight in determining economic priorities and private sector benefits without contributing proportionately to the economic costs associated with alcohol-related harm is neither democratic nor fair. Alcohol pricing 13. FWHC believes the current approach to alcohol excise tax in New Zealand is not fair for the majority of New Zealanders. People who don’t drink alcohol (20% of adult New Zealanders) and low risk drinkers are unfairly burdened with the wider costs to society of alcohol-related harm. The government receives excise tax from alcohol ($1 billion in 2017) but this does not come close to the annual cost of alcohol-related harm to individuals and society (around $5 billion in 2005/06). 14. Further, New Zealanders are missing out on millions of dollars of alcohol excise tax revenue each year because wine is taxed at a level equivalent to 10% alcohol, yet levels of alcohol in a bottle of wine are typically much higher than this (e.g. 12-14%). This anomalous situation needs to be addressed. It is the alcohol content that causes the harm. 15. FWHC supports the introduction of the World Health Organisation’s policy directives on ending the availability of cheap alcohol as a mechanism to reduce alcohol-related harm. As with tobacco, and all products, price has a direct impact on demand. The Alcohol in Our Lives document 1 notes that alcohol consumption, alcohol-related offences and anti-social behaviour have all increased as alcohol has become more affordable relative to our income. 16. We believe that rates of alcohol excise tax should more closely reflect the cost of alcohol-related harm to society. Alcohol causes more harm than any other drug available in society, e.g. tobacco, cannabis, heroin, methamphetamine. Of particular concern is the increasing number of hazardous drinkers in New Zealand. 17. Specific measures to target heavy drinkers would significantly reduce inequalities in alcohol-related harms between income groups. Further, low income heavy drinkers would benefit the most when the price of alcohol is increased. 1 Alcohol in Our Lives Issues Paper 15 (2009) http://www.lawcom.govt.nz/sites/default/files/projectAvailableFormats/NZLC%20IP15.p Page 4 of 5 18. All alcohol products (beer, wine, cider, spirits, etc.) should be taxed by the exact amount of alcohol they contain. This is fair across all beverages. Currently, some products are taxed by volume whereas others are taxed by alcohol content. AWC believes a Minimum Unit Pricing policy would achieve this aim. 19. FWHC strongly recommends implementation of the following alcohol tax measures: • That alcohol excise rates are increased by at least 50% across all alcohol products to raise the price of alcohol by at least 10%; • That excise tax on alcohol products under 2.5% by volume be removed to promote consumption of low alcohol products; • That the excise rates on alcohol are adjusted annually to take into account changes in income (and to offset any strategies used by retailers to not pass on increased rates to consumers); • That all wine should be taxed by alcohol content, not volume of beverage. If a producer is unable to determine the exact alcohol content in their product, then the level of excise tax should be raised from being based on 10% alcohol strength to 14%; • That a minimum price per standard unit of alcohol be introduced. Sugary drinks 20. We suggest government gives active consideration to extending the targeted tax model by introducing a tax on sugary drinks and other high sugar content products to act as a behaviour modifier and to address the alarming rise of pre-diabetes and current diabetes incidence and associated management costs. We understand these costs will escalate even further if we take no action now as a society to forestall these avoidable impacts on wellbeing, employment capability, and life years lost. Thank you for the opportunity to make comment on these particular aspects of concern to the Federation of Women’s Health Councils. We do not seek to speak in further support of our submission.

In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. Submission to the Tax Working Group By Waikato Environment Centre Trust, trading as Go Eco The Waikato Environment Centre Trust, trading as Go Eco, thinks it is time for an overhaul of the tax system so that it better enables a transition to a low carbon economy and greater equality. We applaud the Treasury in its use of the Living Standards Framework to incorporate a more comprehensive range of factors into its analysis. The Living Standards Framework identifies four ‘capital stocks’ that are crucial to intergenerational wellbeing including financial and physical, human, social and natural capital. Go Eco believes that there is there a case to make greater use of environmental taxation to improve environmental outcomes and diversify the tax base. Go Eco supports the introduction of a water levy on commercial use of all water used on a volume basis. This would not apply to households or stock drinking water. Go Eco supports the government to introduce a phased process of ecological tax reform and consider levies on resources such as minerals mined, commercial fish caught, and various forms of pollution and waste. Go Eco notes that the policies recommended by the Productivity Commission to mitigate Climate Change could increase the costs of household energy, food and transport. Go Eco supports the Commission’s recommendation to reduce the adverse impact of such increases on the real incomes of vulnerable households through the tax and welfare system. We also support the Commissions’ recommendation for the government to monitor energy, food and transport price trends to ensure that the benefits and tax credits adjustments are being appropriately adjusted over time. The Productivity Commission notes that shifting from fossil-fuel vehicles to low- emission vehicles may be challenging for lower-income households. They note that while policies such as feebates may be sufficient to change the behaviour of wealthier households, it is unlikely they would be enough for those on lower incomes, especially since feebates would only apply when vehicles enter the fleet. The price premium for electric vehicles over fossil-fuel vehicles is currently large, effectively putting them beyond the reach of lower-income households, at least in the short run. We support targeted support for low-income households to replace an emissions-intensive vehicle. As the Productivity Commission notes “New Zealand retains several policies that subsidise the ongoing use of fossil fuels, such as concessionary tax deductions for petroleum-mining” (p.10). “New Zealand provides approximately $78-88 million per year worth of government support to fossil fuel production and consumption.” (p. 114). We agree with the Productivity Commission that this tax policy run counter to the goal of reducing national GHG emissions and should be abandoned. Go Eco supports the development of subsidies to incentivise emissions reductions through rewarding certain behaviours or activities. The Australian Emissions Reduction Fund provides support to businesses and farmers to adopt new practices and technologies to reduce Australia’s GHGs. Go Eco would like to see something similar developed in New Zealand. The waste disposal levy rate of $10 a tonne is too low and should be increased significantly (eg, up to $150 a tonne) to drive further emissions reductions. We support the Ministry of Environment’s recommendations to gradually increase the levy. We also support the investigation of a differential levy rating system. This is particularly relevant for the issue of organic waste and its emissions consequences. Go Eco supports a more progressive tax system, and supports a tax and transfer system that reduces inequality to pre-1980 levels. Inequality is associated with poor environmental outcomes because it generates higher levels of consumption and waste. Inequality is also associated with less social cohesion, a key ingredient in collective efforts to protect the environment and the common good. 1 We support Oxfam New Zealand’s call for the government to crack down on tax avoidance. Data compiled by Oxfam showed that the top 10 per cent took more than half of the wealth. Just two men own more than the poorest 30 per cent of New Zealanders - about 1.4 million people. Those 1.4 million took just one per cent of the wealth created and about 90 per cent of Kiwis own less than half of New Zealand's wealth. 1 http://www.un.org/esa/desa/papers/2015/wp145\_2015.pdf

Background Goodman Group (ASX listed, ticker GMG), operates in New Zealand through its wholly owned subsidiaries GNZ, GPS and various other investment and property development entities. GNZ is the manager of the NZX listed Goodman Property Trust (“GMT”). GPS provides property management and development management services to GMT. GPS is also manager of Wynyard Precinct Holdings Limited, a joint venture between GMT and GIC, the government of Singapore’s investment arm. Through a New Zealand based subsidiary, Goodman Group also owns approximately 21.5% of GMT. In total, Goodman manages almost $3.0 billion of commercial real estate in New Zealand with a predominant focus on Auckland industrial property. GMT owns a majority of this real estate, and provides a listed PIE investment vehicle to retail and institutional investors seeking exposure to an industrial property asset class. Our submission Goodman has worked closely with the Property Council New Zealand (“PCNZ”) to help develop PCNZ’s detailed submission to the TWG and fully supports the comments made therein. We comment briefly below in addition to our support for PCNZ’s detailed submission.  We support the ‘broad-based, low-rate’ approach, recognising that all economic activities are broadly taxed on a similar basis and providing for fairness in the tax system;  We support the continuation of a tax system which is, in general, relatively straightforward in its implementation. Such a tax system helps mitigate the cost of compliance, and provides confidence to international investors who provide a significant amount of capital to New Zealand businesses.  Commercial and residential property differ from each other. The tax system should properly recognise commercial property as a business asset and it should be treated as such by reinstating depreciation on commercial property. By not recognising that commercial building structures become obsolete and depreciate, our current tax law is acting as a disincentive to continuous improvement of New Zealand’s building stock, particularly in relation to seismic performance and the provision of green buildings; \[1\]  We conditionally support a capital gains tax if it were to account for capital losses without ring fencing and was introduced contemporaneously with a reinstatement of depreciation of commercial property;  We strongly support the current PIE taxation regime;  We do not support transactional taxes such as typical stamp duty implementations as they are inefficient and insufficient funds are likely to be collected to make them viable; and  Land taxes, if introduced, would be a blunt instrument likely to have many negative unintended consequences, including a significant drop in property values. If you have any queries regarding Goodman’s submission, please do not hesitate to contact me by email or by phone Yours faithfully Andy Eakin Chief Financial Officer Goodman (NZ) Limited \[1\] \[1\]\[1\]
Greenpeace New Zealand 30 April 2018 Hon Sir Michael Cullen Tax Working Group Secretariat PO Box 3724 Wellington 6140 New Zealand Greenpeace submission to the New Zealand Government’s Tax Working Group on the Future of Tax Summary: New Zealand’s water quality, soil health, and biodiversity are in decline, and emissions of dangerous greenhouse gases are increasing. We have a moral obligation to future generations to curb this degradation and restore our natural environment. Perverse environmental outcomes have often resulted from market failures. These failures unjustly place the cost of environmental degradation onto society, rather than those responsible. Greenpeace supports the Government using taxation as a way to correct for these failures for the benefit of the environment and the New Zealand public. The OECD acknowledges that many environmental taxes implemented by its member countries are poorly designed and targeted. Too often, big polluters are exempt from an environmental tax due to unjustified competitiveness claims, compromising its environmental effectiveness and leaving the wider public to cover the cost. Greenpeace urges the Government to stand up to lobbyists and polluters and implement environmental taxes with as few exemptions as possible, and at rates which drive behaviour change. Greenpeace advocates that the revenues from new environmental taxes be used to provide an income tax free threshold. Submission: Dear Hon Sir Michael Cullen, Greenpeace New Zealand, Inc. (Greenpeace) thanks you for the invitation to provide our views on ways to improve the fairness, balance and structure of the tax system in New Zealand over the next 10 years. The following submission will focus on environmental taxes. The case for environmental taxes Nearly all of New Zealand’s state of the environment reports, such as Our Land 2018 report i , Our Fresh Water 2017 report ii and New Zealand’s Greenhouse Gas Inventory 1990-2016 iii show that we now face multiple worsening environmental crises. These New Zealand trends are symptomatic of world-wide trends, which threaten ecosystem services and life on earth. This is a moral challenge with intergenerational implications – our current actions are threatening the very existence of future generations – which calls for system-wide interventions on multiple levels and taxation can play a key role. Systemically damaging outcomes are often the result of the failure of markets to price the environmental costs of economic activity. Because of the normalisation of societal values that treat environmental costs as externalities, polluting activities are underpriced in the market. Society is left to pick up the tab for environmental clean-up, often at taxpayers’ expense. A well-designed environmental tax can adjust the price of a good or activity to reflect its true cost, including the environmental impacts that it creates over its full life-cycle. Essentially environmental taxation cost- effectively encourages consumers, primary producers and firms to take account of the cost to society of their pollution, driving behavioural change. iv Furthermore, environmental taxes lead to increased resource efficiency, thus decreasing resource demand and reducing environmental change. Environmental taxes have the advantage of giving businesses, state sector and households the flexibility to determine how to reduce their pollution, which enables lowest-cost solutions and provides an incentive for innovation. v This can complement regulatory approaches which involve the Government specifying how or who should reduce pollution. Greenpeace urges the Government to use this Future of Tax review as an opportunity to implement a system of taxation that directly and openly addresses our environmental degradation and its unsustainable and unjust consequences. Greenpeace is heartened to see that the future of tax is being considered within the context of a commitment by the Prime Minister and Finance Minister to measure the economy in a new way. vi As noted in the Submissions Background Paper, GDP can be an important enabler of higher living standards, but it is not designed to be a measure of wellbeing. Perversely, the cost of cleaning up the environment is counted as a positive in GDP measurements. In an extreme example, this has led BP to try to justify drilling in the Great Australian Bight by saying, should there be an oil spill, “in most instances the increased activity associated with cleanup operations will be a welcome boost to local economies.” vii We welcome the Government’s use of the Living Standards Framework which identifies that wellbeing is generated by the combination of four interdependent capital stocks: financial/physical capital, human capital, social capital and natural capital. Using this approach to contextualise the last three decades of Government policy – it becomes clear that successive Governments have been privileging financial capital in economic decision making while overlooking the social, human and environmental impacts. Growing environmental degradation and social inequity provide compelling evidence that it’s time to rebalance our economic decision-making in favour of human, social and environmental health. When we take stock of our environment – the fact that the majority of our monitored lowland rivers are unsafe for swimming, that our species loss is among the highest in the world, and that we are losing soil at an alarming rate – it becomes obvious that we haven’t been valuing natural capital enough. Our natural environment is our life support system: not only is it important for our wellbeing, it is essential for our survival. It’s important that our national conversation about the economy in general and our tax system in particular, places greater emphasis on environmental health. Therefore, Greenpeace welcomes the Government’s stated intention to fully adopt the Living Standards Framework. Principles of good environmental tax design The OECD acknowledges that many environmental taxes implemented by its member countries are poorly designed and targeted. viii To illustrate, quite a number of taxes that are defined by the OECD as environmental taxes are not designed for the purpose of influencing pro-environmental behavior but rather for generating revenue. These taxes are nevertheless defined as environmental taxes because they are levied on tax bases that have negative impacts on the environment. For example, in some countries, such as New Zealand, petrol taxes are levied to generate revenue for transport infrastructure, predominantly roads. Furthermore, a study of EU member states found that the competitive position of affected sectors is the major concern expressed in relation to the design of environmental taxes, and as a result, the largest polluters are frequently exempt from the tax, compromising its environmental effectiveness. ix This is despite evidence that, “in relation to carbon and energy taxes, there is growing econometric evidence that the immediate competitiveness impacts of existing carbon pricing mechanisms are negligible or nil.” ibid And a study of environmentally related taxes and charges on nitrous oxide, water abstractions, waste water discharges, pesticides, fertiliser, landfill, aggregates, packaging and batteries, showed that “exemptions were too often granted based on a static assessment of the effects of market-based policies, ignoring their dynamic efficiency effects.” ibid The purpose of environmental taxes should be to improve environmental outcomes. As such, the following principles of design should apply:  the tax should be levied as close to the environmentally damaging pollutant or activity as possible;  the tax should be broadly applicable (i.e. as few exceptions as possible);  and the tax should be set at an adequate rate. x , xi Environmental taxation in New Zealand Environmental taxation in New Zealand accounts for 4.2% of revenue and 1.3% of GDP, which is below the OECD average. xii Most of this revenue is collected through taxes on consumption of energy products (54%) and vehicle ownership (45%). xiii Taxes on pollution and resource use aren’t employed much in New Zealand: the Government has only implemented the Waste Disposal Levy on waste to landfill and the Synthetic Greenhouse Gas (Goods) Levy on imported products containing the greenhouse gases hydrofluorocarbon and perfluorocarbons. As noted in the Submissions Background Paper, New Zealand’s resource-based economy and the wellbeing of our population are heavily dependent on protecting our natural environment. However, the New Zealand Government has historically shown a highly permissive attitude to environmentally-damaging activities and forms of pollution. The effect has been a substantial erosion of our natural environment, as evidenced by rising greenhouse gas emissions, increasing freshwater pollution and scarcity in some regions, species extinction rates among the highest in the world, and increasing emissions of major air pollutants. xiv In order to address the market failure and lack of regulation that have enabled this environmental degradation in New Zealand, we recommend that the Tax Working Group consider implementing the environmental taxes explored below. We have focused our recommendations on addressing the issues of climate change, freshwater degradation and ocean health, because these are particular priority issues for Greenpeace. However, we welcome the use of environmental taxes to achieve other environmental objectives as well. Climate change New Zealand is not pulling its weight when it comes to addressing climate change: on a per capita basis, New Zealand’s emissions are the fifth highest in the OECD, and our emissions are growing. This brings up equity issues. Our inaction now will mean forcing other countries or future generations of New Zealanders to pick up our tab, or face the consequences of catastrophic climate change. Greenpeace sees a vital role for taxation in addressing our climate change obligations. Price agricultural emissions Greenpeace is concerned with the market distortion resulting from agriculture’s exemption from the ETS. By not exposing agriculture, in particular dairying, to the ETS, the New Zealand public is subsidising and incentivizing polluting land uses and polluting land use practices, as well as sending the wrong investment signals. Since 1990 the number of dairy cows has nearly doubled, and the use of synthetic nitrogen fertiliser has increased seven-fold. xv The dairy industry alone is now responsible for nearly a quarter of all of our greenhouse gas emissions. This industry, and the wider agriculture industry, must be brought into the ETS immediately. Greenpeace advocates for an “all gases, all sectors” approach to the ETS which is administratively easier than a scheme which differentiates between short-lived and long-lived greenhouse gases. Given that agriculture is New Zealand’s largest emitter and is responsible for 49% of gross emissions (38.7 Mt CO2-e) xvi exposing agriculture to 100% of its emissions would lift the Crown accounts by billions. In 2016, when the two-for-one ETS subsidy was removed, the Government calculated that it would “positively impact the operating balance by $356 million over the next four years, based on a New Zealand Unit price of $12.” xvii Failing to bring agriculture into the ETS places a disproportionate burden on other sectors of the economy and slows agriculture’s adjustment to a low carbon future. The argument that there are not yet sufficient technological solutions for reducing ruminant livestock emissions as grounds for not being included in the ETS is spurious. Reducing the dairy herd would be an obvious solution and won’t necessarily impact on farmer profit. Between 2003 and 2013 the average dairy farmer added 100 cows to their herd, but Dairy NZ scientist John Roche says they're no better-off financially because they have had to spend more on supplementary feed and are damaging the environment in the process. xviii A price on agricultural emissions would incentivise profitable business models with fewer cows and fewer inputs. Price carbon to incentivise forestry Greenpeace supports any changes to the ETS that increase the price of carbon, such as instituting a price floor, removing the price cap, leaving the ETS closed to international markets and auctioning of units. A stronger price signal will incentivise afforestation which will be essential if we are to meet our climate targets. Research by the NZ School of Forestry at University of Canterbury forecast limited afforestation beneath a carbon price of $15/NZU but forecast a planting rate of 13,900 ha/year at $15/NZU increasing to 27,600 ha/year at $30/NZU and to 50,500 ha/year at $50/NZU. xix Greenpeace advocates for the Government to incentivise planting of permanent biodiverse forests, which have significantly higher ecological benefits than radiata pine. We also support changes to the ETS that would recognise the carbon sequestration of agro-forestry – the practice of planting trees into grazing pasture. Furthermore, we would recommend that the Government consider opening the NZ ETS to credible Pacific carbon credits at some point as a way to support projects in the Pacific. Implement a coherent system of fuel and vehicle taxes and charges New Zealand’s transport-related greenhouse gas emissions are high and increasing. xx New Zealand’s vehicle fleet is old and carbon intensive and the current transport tax/charge system isn’t geared to improve transport’s environmental impacts. For example, New Zealand is the only OECD country not to have a fuel excise duty on diesel, which is instead subject to road user charges. The road user charges are structured so that all light vehicles (weighing less than 3.5 tonnes) face the same rate, and so there is no incentive for New Zealanders to move to using lower-emission and more fuel-efficient vehicles. Furthermore, New Zealand’s fuel excise duty is comparatively low. New Zealand’s tax rates on road fuels are among the lowest in the OECD. xxi Both the fuel excise duty and the road user charges for diesel vehicles are set according to the fiscal requirements of new land transport projects, and do not attempt to internalise the environmental externalities of road transport. Diesel, for example, generates harmful NOx emissions and fine particulate matter which are associated with adverse human health effects. In New Zealand, national air quality standards are exceeded near busy roads in some urban areas, and the number and cost of premature deaths from exposure to particulate matter is projected to rise over the next 50 years. xxii In line with OECD recommendations, Greenpeace suggests that the Government introduce an excise duty on diesel and increase the tax rate for both petrol and diesel to ensure that the rates account for the environmental costs of transport. xxiii Further, Greenpeace suggests a fiscally neutral change to the way that vehicle registration fees are set. Currently all road vehicles are subject to a one-off registration fee and periodic licensing fee which do not account for the vehicles’ environmental performance. Greenpeace suggests making these fees vary according to environmental performance in order to incentivise the uptake of vehicles with greater fuel-efficiency and fewer emissions. Analysis by the OECD shows that fringe benefit tax has negative environmental consequences because it favourably taxes the benefits derived from the personal use of company cars and does not incentivise employees to limit company car use or to choose more fuel- efficient vehicles. They estimate that this favourable tax treatment led to approximately $253 million in lost revenue in 2012. xxiv Greenpeace suggests taxing company car benefits fully, in order to create more Government revenue and eliminate the associated environmental externalities caused by the preferential tax treatment of personal company car use. Eliminate environmentally harmful subsidies Greenpeace strongly urges the Government to end all support for fossil fuels, because this support runs counter to our efforts and obligations to address climate change. The Government could increase its fiscal position by $30 to $40 million per year and reduce carbon emissions by eliminating refunds for excise duty payments for off-road users of fuels. xxv Up to $20 million of further revenue could be obtained by eliminating all further environmentally harmful subsidies for the petroleum industry, such as the non-resident drilling rig and seismic ship tax exemption, indemnity for mining land remediation, research and development funding for the oil industry, tax deductions for petroleum-mining expenditures, and the petroleum tax and royalty regime. ibid The tax and royalty regime for petroleum is designed to attract investment in oil and gas exploration, but there is no justification for supporting petroleum exploration when the reality of climate change means we can’t burn most of the fossil fuels that have already been discovered. Our Government take (royalties plus taxes) for petroleum is the fourth lowest in the world, xxvi well below the 61-65% average among OECD countries with appreciable petroleum exploration activities. xxvii We therefore recommend that the Government take for petroleum double from 42% to 84% to ensure that New Zealanders receive their fair share of profits generated from this common resource, as well as incentivizing the shift away from fossil fuels towards renewable energy. xxviii If production remained the same as 2017 levels, then petroleum royalties would increase yearly Government revenue by around $170 million. xxix Freshwater New Zealand’s freshwater is in crisis. 70% of monitored rivers are unsafe for swimming, xxx 44% of monitored lakes are in heavily polluted (eutrophic) states, xxxi and 72% of native freshwater fish are threatened with extinction. xxxii Aquifers are also in decline. According to the Ministry for the Environment, 71% of monitored groundwater sites did not meet the drinking water standard for E. coli at least once. For nitrate- nitrogen, the figure was 13%. xxxiii Driven by conversion of land into intensive dairying and other agricultural intensification, the nitrogen balance between 1998 and 2009 worsened more than in any other OECD country. Nitrate pollution is worsening in over half of monitored rivers, with dairying being the main source of nitrogen pollution. Greenpeace supports the OECD recommendation that New Zealand expand the use of economic instruments to internalize environmental costs, promote innovation and encourage the efficient use of water (quality and quantity). xxxiv Greenpeace acknowledges that taxation must be supported by a strengthened regulatory environment, increasing bottom lines for water quality and quantity so that they protect human and ecosystem health, and must be done while fulfilling obligations to Māori as Treaty partners. Capital gains tax Greenpeace supports a comprehensive capital gains tax. Not only does a capital gains tax improve equity, it will also improve environmental outcomes because many New Zealand farmers are farming for capital gains rather than production. Without a capital gains tax we have a situation where farmers are incentivised to borrow heavily for farms and then claim the cost of the interest payments against their tax bill, so they pay little tax. They can then make a tidy profit which is tax-free capital gains when they sell the farm. xxxv A 2008 survey of dairy farmers in the Canterbury and North Otago regions identified that 64% of dairy farmers ranked farming for capital gains as “very important” or “important”. xxxvi These areas are particularly prone to water quality and over-abstraction issues, which highlights the importance of introducing a capital gains tax to stop people from farming for capital gains rather than production. Pollution tax Greenpeace recommends the introduction of a pollution tax on nitrogen and phosphorous that is leached from farms, levied at a rate that reflects the significant social costs of the pollution and leads to improvements in water quality by incentivising a significant transition away from high intensity farming and damaging land-use practices like overstocking and intensive chemical fertiliser use. According to the Ministry for the Environment, dairy cattle contributed 50 million kilograms of nitrogen leachate in the soil in 2012, while sheep accounted for around 40 million kilograms and beef cattle around 20-25 million kilograms. xxxvii Removing nitrogen and phosphorous from freshwater is extremely costly. For example, costs for the removal of nitrogen from the Rotorua Lakes using constructed floating wetlands range from NZ$14,000/tonne N ($14 kg/N) xxxviii to $4 million/tonne N ($4,000 Kg/N) and around $250,000/tonne P ($250 Kg/P). xxxix Currently, diffuse pollution outputs are measured with OVERSEER, a proprietary system (owned by the Ministry for Primary Industries, AgResearch Limited and the Fertiliser Association of New Zealand) xl that models on farm flows of nutrients and estimates nutrient loss to air, soil and across the land. It has not been validated on the majority of New Zealand soils. In order for a taxation system for farm pollution to be effective, the nutrient modelling instrument must be validated on New Zealand soils and must not be owned or influenced by the fertiliser industry which has a vested interest in selling more chemical nitrogen and phosphorous fertilisers. Greenpeace recommends either replacing OVERSEER or amending it so that is a fully publically owned, open-source nutrient loss accounting system that is validated on New Zealand soils. Fertiliser tax Greenpeace also recommends a tax on chemical fertiliser use. The application of nitrogen has increased seven-fold between 1990 and 2016, having increased from 59,200 tonnes in 1990 to 432,000 tonnes in 2016. xli Chemical nitrogen fertiliser and superphosphate are key drivers of intensive agriculture and the climate and freshwater impacts associated with this industry. In the mid to late 1990s Sweden levied a nitrogen tax on fertilisers which amounted to about 20% of the price of the fertilisers, and used the revenue to finance deintensification programmes and research. Evaluations of the levy indicated that the charge had some impact on fertiliser use, but the main benefit to water quality was the financing of de-intensification programmes. xlii Greenpeace suggests the introduction of a New Zealand tax on synthetic nitrogen and superphosphate fertilisers that is designed to result in a major decrease in their use and creates positive environmental outcomes. Experience from overseas suggests that complementing these taxes with policies to encourage regenerative farming practices would likely result in even greater environmental outcomes. Pesticide tax A number of countries, such as Norway, France, Demark, Sweden, and Italy have taxed the use of pesticides – each with differing tax schemes. For example, Norway’s tax was levied on the negative human health and environmental effects and taxed per kilogram or litre of pesticide, while France had categories of pesticide with differing rates. Evaluation of these taxes showed a significant decrease in pesticide use was only achieved in those Scandinavian countries where the pesticide tax was higher and accompanied by complementary policies encouraging sustainable agriculture. xliii Comprehensive and reliable data on pesticide use in New Zealand is difficult to obtain because importation classifications are too broad and the sector’s membership organisation captures incomplete information. However, a Government study estimates that pesticide imports grew 12% between 1999 to 2003 and in 2003 were valued at US$72m. Over this period pesticide imports constituted about 1% of the annual value of New Zealand’s agricultural exports (US$8b). xliv Greenpeace suggests the introduction of a New Zealand pesticide tax that is based on health and environmental effects and is levied at a rate that leads to a decrease in use and environmental outcomes. Volumetric water charge Greenpeace recognises that water ownership issues in New Zealand have not been resolved and acknowledges Māori interests in water as a Treaty partner. We agree with the OECD which says that New Zealand needs to further clarify and recognize Māori community rights and interests in water before the Government can ensure effective water policies. xlv Provided that these issues are resolved, Greenpeace suggests putting a charge on commercial water use, including for irrigation, in order to drive water use efficiency. Oceans New Zealand’s marine environment is under pressure from both extractive industries, such as mining and fishing, and pollution discharges such as plastic pollution. For example, 17% of our fish stocks have been over-fished and 6% have collapsed, despite having a large and comprehensive quota management system (QMS). xlvi Furthermore, ongoing research by the Auckland University Institute of Marine Science has shown that seven of eight fish species common in New Zealand ate plastic on a regular basis. xlvii This risks New Zealanders’ health and our fisheries, as well as our international reputation. We also have a moral responsibility to look after the wildlife with which we share this planet. Greenpeace advocates for taxes that can help address these issues. Resource rental on fish New Zealand imposes royalties on the extraction of natural resources such as petroleum, and minerals such as gold and silver. As the Submission Background Paper states, this is often an attempt to capture a “rent” on the profit generated by a miner over and above a reasonable economic return, and ensures that the public gets a fair share of the profits generated from the use of the country’s resources. Although fishing companies are profiting from a common resource, they do not currently pay royalties or a resource rental tax. Iceland has a system of individual transferable quota, similar to our quota management system. Historically, Icelandic fishing firms paid fees to the Government to finance the fisheries management system, but starting in 2012, Icelandic fishing firms began paying a resource rent tax which was composed of a general part that replaced the previous fishing fees, and a special part aimed at collecting part of the resource rent. xlviii According to Dr Glenn Simmons of Auckland University, the Icelandic resource rental tax was an important catalyst for innovation and helped shift Icelandic fishing firms away from a business model of producing commodity products and towards a value add business model. xlix The OECD says, “the fact that the Icelandic fishing industry can pay a special resource rent tax on top of other taxes and at the same time receives no subsidies, can be seen as a sign of its economic efficiency.” l In the early days of the QMS, New Zealand fishers paid a resource rent, determined on the basis of quota values, the expected net returns of fishers and other factors considered important by the regulator. li However, New Zealand then moved away from the resource rental and adopted a cost recovery approach. Mindful of the need to work through Treaty implications, Greenpeace recommends that the New Zealand Government re-introduces a resource rent on commercially caught fish to ensure that the public receive a return on the private use of a common resource. Waste levy Incentivising the diversion of waste to landfill is increasingly important given that, earlier this year, China banned the import of certain types of waste that we have previously exported for recycling. lv Last year, New Zealand sent $21m worth of waste to China, of which $8.2m was plastic waste. lvi Currently, some New Zealand waste companies are stockpiling plastics, waiting for new Asian markets to become available, lvii and the concern is that this waste will end up in landfill. Currently half of the funds generated by the waste levy go into the Waste Minimisation Fund, so increasing the levy to an adequate level could create the funds for onshore processing of products that were formerly recycled in China, preventing them from ending up in our landfills. ibid Container deposit scheme To help increase the recovery of single-use plastic bottles and reduce virgin plastic production, Greenpeace supports Kiwi Bottle Drive’s campaign for a container deposit scheme whereby a 10c levy is included in the price of a drink and this amount is refunded when the container is returned to a drop-off point. Marine plastic pollution is impacting on our oceans, and a container deposit scheme can help address the problem. A study of container deposit schemes in the United States and Australia found that the proportion of containers found in coastal debris surveys in states with a container deposit scheme was approximately 40% lower than in states without such schemes. lviii This is strong evidence that container deposit schemes can be an effective management tool for reducing coastal plastic waste. New Zealand’s recycling rates for beverage containers are estimated to be less than 40%, which means the majority of the bottles end up in landfill or as litter. Container deposit schemes can increase recovery rates to 82%, as was achieved by the South Australian container deposit scheme. According to a model developed by Envision, a container deposit scheme can be implemented in New Zealand with no fiscal costs if the Government takes certain steps available to it under the Waste Minimisation Act 2008. Estimated system costs of $10 million would either be absorbed by beverage producers or passed on to consumers in beverage prices - equating to about 0.5 cents per beverage container. lix There is widespread support for a deposit-refund scheme for beverage containers in New Zealand: 83% of New Zealanders support a scheme and the recent Local Government Waste Manifesto has named it among the top five priorities for councils. lx This support is unsurprising considering that modeling suggests a container deposit scheme will at least double the quantities of all beverage containers recovered, divert at least 45,865 tonnes of containers from landfill, and save New Zealand ratepayers between $26 million and $40 million per annum. lxi Revenue – opportunity for “double dividend” Greenpeace advocates for the revenues from new environmental taxes to be used to provide an income tax free threshold, in order to ensure that environmental taxation is paired with socially just outcomes. This would have the effect of shifting tax from “goods” such as taxing labour, to “bads” such as pollution. This is considered economically efficient and creates a “double dividend” through both a positive environmental outcome as well as a positive social outcome. This type of tax shift is often referred to as environmental fiscal reform or a green tax shift. Environmental tax shifts have been implemented in European countries such as Sweden and Germany. Environmental taxes are designed to influence producer and/or consumer behavior away from the taxed good or service, so if they are effective, they will lead to tax base erosion over the long term. This implies a need to review taxes periodically and increase them if additional revenue is needed. Further, environmental taxes are likely to reduce in efficacy if they are not increased with inflation. Greenpeace suggests that the Government set up an Environmental Taxation Committee in order to evaluate and refine environmental taxes as needed. Conclusion Environmental taxes function most effectively when they have a broad base with as few exceptions as possible. However, we see that in many cases exceptions are made for the biggest polluters who cite competitiveness concerns. We urge the Government to stand up to the narrowly-defined self-interest of polluters and implement strong environmental taxes that lead to measurable positive environmental effects. Not requiring polluters to pay simply means the cost of their pollution falls onto the rest of society, resulting in a taxpayer subsidy for polluting industries. As you well know, the economy is a subset of the environment, and we depend on our environment for our survival. We simply cannot continue on our current path of environmental degradation. We hope that you will take this opportunity to rebalance the tax system for the sake of intergenerational equity and wellbeing. i http://www.mfe.govt.nz/sites/default/files/media/Environmental%20reporting/Our- land-2018.pdf ii http://www.mfe.govt.nz/sites/default/files/media/Environmental%20reporting/our- fresh-water-2017\_1.pdf iii http://www.mfe.govt.nz/sites/default/files/media/Climate%20Change/National%20 GHG%20Inventory%20Report%201990-2016-final.pdf iv https://www.oecd.org/tax/tax-policy/environmental-fiscal-reform-G7-environment- ministerial-meeting-june-2017.pdf v https://www.oecd.org/env/tools-evaluation/48164926.pdf vi http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c\_id=1&objectid=12035576 vii https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/world/2018/04/06/bp-oil-spill-australia-good/ viii https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2018-03/twg-subm-bgrd- paper-mar18.pdf, p 49. ix https://www.oecd.org/tax/tax-policy/environmental-fiscal-reform-G7-environment- ministerial-meeting-june-2017.pdf, p 14. x https://www.oecd.org/env/tools-evaluation/48164926.pdf, p 12 xi https://www.oecd.org/tax/tax-policy/environmental-fiscal-reform-G7-environment- ministerial-meeting-june-2017.pdf, p 41 xii https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2018-03/twg-subm-bgrd- paper-mar18.pdf, p 49 xiii https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/environment/oecd-environmental-performance- reviews-new-zealand-2017\_9789264268203-en#page140 xiv http://www.eds.org.nz/assets/MediaReleases/2017%20Releases/OECD%20Envirom ental%20Performance%20Review%20NZ%202017%20HIGHLIGHTS.pdf xv http://www.mfe.govt.nz/sites/default/files/media/Climate%20Change/National%20 GHG%20Inventory%20Report%201990-2016-final.pdf, p 145, 187. xvi http://www.mfe.govt.nz/climate-change/state-of-our-atmosphere-and- climate/new-zealands-greenhouse-gas-inventory xvii http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA1605/S00499/ets-one-for-two-subsidy-to-be- phased-out.htm xviii http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/ninetonoon/audio/201753835/d oes-increasing-herd-sizes-really-get-farmers-any-extra-money xix https://www.mfe.govt.nz/sites/default/files/media/Climate%20Change/Afforestati on%20responses%20to%20carbon%20price%20changes%20and%20market%20certai nties.pdf xx http://www.eds.org.nz/assets/MediaReleases/2017%20Releases/OECD%20Envirom ental%20Performance%20Review%20NZ%202017%20HIGHLIGHTS.pdf xxi https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/environment/oecd-environmental-performance- reviews-new-zealand-2017\_9789264268203-en#page123 xxii https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/environment/oecd-environmental-performance- reviews-new-zealand-2017\_9789264268203-en#page83 xxiii https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/environment/oecd-environmental-performance- reviews-new-zealand-2017\_9789264268203-en#page124 xxiv https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/environment/oecd-environmental-performance- reviews-new-zealand-2017\_9789264268203-en#page127; $US205 is $NZ253 using 31 Dec 2012 exchange rate of 1.234992 from https://www.ofx.com/en-nz/forex- news/historical-exchange-rates/ xxv https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/environment/oecd-environmental-performance- reviews-new-zealand-2017\_9789264268203-en#page133 xxvi http://www.ipaa.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/InternatlPetroTaxSupp.pdf xxvii https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/oecd-economic-surveys-new-zealand- 2013\_eco\_surveys-nzl-2013-en#page90 xxix https://treasury.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2018-04/b17-revenue-data.xls xxx http://www.mfe.govt.nz/sites/default/files/media/Environmental%20reporting/our -fresh-water-2017\_1.pdf xxxi http://www.mfe.govt.nz/publications/fresh-water-environmental-reporting/lake- water-quality-new-zealand-2010-status-and-2 xxxii http://www.mfe.govt.nz/sites/default/files/media/Environmental%20reporting/ou r-fresh-water-2017\_1.pdf xxxiii http://www.mfe.govt.nz/publications/fresh-water/fresh-water-report-2017- water-quality/monitored-groundwater-quality xxxiv The OECD recommends that New Zealand expand the use of economic instruments to internalize environmental and opportunity costs, promote innovation and encourage the efficient use of water (quality and quantity). xxxv https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/farming/82696726/better-incentives-needed- to-encourage-forestry\_2 xxxvi Source: http://www.siddc.org.nz/assets/Research/SIDDC-Past-Research/impact- of-ludf.pdf xxxvii https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/97755574/how-much-nitrogen- leaches-from-the-soil-in-new-zealand xxxviii Hamill, K., MacGibbon, R., & Turner, J.

Future of Tax: Submission Name: Lew Rohloff Organisation: Grey Power New Zealand Federation Incorporated Address: Telephone: Email: 1. 2. (a) (b) (c) (d) (a) Introduction: This submission is made on behalf of Grey Power New Zealand Federation Incorporated. The Federation is a non-sectarian and non-party political, advocacy organisation that aims to advance, promote and protect the welfare and well-being of older people. The Federation is made up of some 72 individual Associations with an overall membership of approximately 62,000. The terms ‘the Federation’ and ‘the Group,’ where used in this submission, refer to Grey Power New Zealand Federation and the Tax Working Group, respectively. Summary: In a general sense we understand the terms of reference directing the review and accept the broad relevance of the many considerations the Group has identified in the background paper(s). In asking ourselves “which aspects of the taxation system concern us most?” we conclude that the generic interest of our present membership is encapsulated in the third ‘capital stock’ of Treasury’s ‘Living Standards Framework,’ being ‘Social Capital’ such as trust, cultural achievements and community connections. However, it is also important that we convey a growing concern for the future wellbeing of our direct descendants and other succeeding generations of New Zealanders. These, more particularly, will depend on advancement of each of the other three ‘capital stocks’ of the “Living Standards Framework.’ \[1\] 2 3. (b) (c) (d) (a) Our one serious disappointment is the expressed exclusion of local government rates from this review. Rates on owner–occupied property have now reached such proportion that they are generally unaffordable for fixed income and other low- income households. Local Government rates are substantially levied on an arbitrary basis, lacking any semblance of fairness, equity or affordability for low-income households. While my colleagues responsible for formulation of our Local Government policy might be looking elsewhere for solutions, I feel it’s worthwhile, to suggest as a possible Grey Power policy extension, that the principles of ‘progressive taxation’ might be easier maintained if local authorities were funded from government revenues. Further, as the Group intends to evaluate the utilisation of exemptions to gst, partial relief might be delivered to fixed and other low income households by the Group recommending “that rates on owner-occupied residential property (‘family’ homes) are exempted from gst.” We acknowledge the review is not intended to address the sufficiency of New Zealand Superannuation (NZS) but we must observe that NZS is the primary and often sole source of income for the majority of our members. Targeted tax credits or gst exemptions are possible avenues of assistance to pensioners. The Federation will welcome subsequent enquiry(s) seeking clarification of any aspect of this submission or to explore other ways our organisation might assist further research required by the Group. Our Response(s) to the Background Papers: We congratulate the Group for its compilation of a comprehensive range of background papers. Over the longer term, this reference material might well assist us to develop a more sophisticated knowledge of the mechanics and other influences of the taxation system. For the time being, existing Federation ‘policy’ influences our contribution to this consultation and our focus is limited to our general belief that it behoves all citizens to trust and maintain the nation’s taxation system, based predominately, if not exclusively, on ‘progressive’ income tax principles. In other words, our representations on taxation (and local government taxation) are, we suspect, similar to those which predominantly concern a wage and salary earner. With regard to the eight stated factors which will affect the tax system over the next decade and beyond we suggest that given a return by government to justifiable intervention in the future economy, the first identified challenge “changing demographics, particularly the aging population and the fiscal pressures that will bring” will, hopefully, prove to be a temporary phenomenon. 3 4. (b) (c) (d) Development of a ‘population’ policy designed, primarily, through immigration to reduce the projected ‘dependency ratio’ might prove reasonably effective within the next ten years. Previous government’s response to public concerns of rapidly worsening inequality has been to maintain that the unduly high income disparity through the 1980’s to the mid 1990’s while clearly persisting has not measurably increased. Thus, attention has been diverted away from the failure to actually reverse the income inequality, with the predictable consequence that by the sustained maintenance of high income disparity, the repositories of wealth have expanded, exponentially, year upon year. We have no criticism of the stated principles embodied in New Zealand’s broad based ‘income’ and ‘expenditure’ tax system. However, the deteriorating outcomes related to the ‘human’ ‘social’ and ‘natural’ capitals of the Living Standards Framework suggest, perhaps, that system implementation and performance is manifestly inadequate. For example, could it be that the comprehensive coverage of our gst (expenditure tax) which impacts regressively upon low to middle income households, seriously compromises the ability of our progressive income tax system to achieve the ‘human,’ ‘social’ and ‘natural’ capital stocks of the Living Standards Framework? In footnote 2 of the background Paper, the Group recognises the ‘fairness’ ethic as one of the justifications for exempting rent from gst. We agree with this rationale but as we have indicated earlier, we conclude that affordability considerations and ‘consistency’ should also see local government rates on ‘family’ homes, exempted from gst. Conclusion: Thank you for the opportunity to contribute our policy position and other thoughts on this matter. Lew Rohloff Chair Retirement Income and Taxation Advisory Group \[1\]

We thank the Tax Working Group for seeking the views of New Zealanders with regards to the future of taxation and how this will impact future public policy. Hāpai celebrates this opportunity to be able to discuss and share our thoughts on tax policy, which may help design a tax system that is fair and equitable for New Zealand, and for Māori in particular. 2. Hāpai Te Hauora are national leaders in Population Health, Public Health, Policy and Advocacy, Research and Evaluation, and Infrastructure Services. Our role is to support Māori communities and whānau to play a role in decision-making on matters affecting their health and wellbeing. 3. Hāpai affirms the rights to good health and well-being is enshrined in Te Tiriti o Waitangi, and that whānau Māori, hapū, and iwi have the right to good health and well-being. Established as a Tripartite agreement between Te Rūnanga o Ngāti Whātua, Tainui and ngā Mātāwaka (Te Whānau o Waipareira) to broker health contracts for the benefit of iwi Māori living within Tāmaki Mākaurau, Hāpai supports actions that uplifts the health and well-being of Māori in alignment with the rights and principles guaranteed to Māori with Te Tiriti o Waitangi. 4. Hāpai sees many benefits to the process of taxation, however we also recognise the inherent flaws in our taxation system, which do not serve the purpose of the tax inquiry. We have identified several points of concern within our current method of taxation. 5. The issue is in managing the balance between paternalism of the state and autonomy of the individual. We see a future taxation system as one which recognises individual choice whilst also ensuring the provision of an efficient welfare system which supports our most vulnerable members of our society when needed. 6. Hāpai Te Hauora urges the Tax Working Group to look to Te Ao Māori, and its traditional systems of taxation, when contextualising the tax inquiry and when examining further improvements to the structure, fairness and balance of the tax system. 7. Traditional method of taxation in Te Ao Māori is that of the ‘koha’ system - essentially an organic taxation system of accountability and mutual obligation between giver and receiver. Within the ‘koha’ system, the ‘giver’ and receiver are unequivocally bound to each other, each acutely aware of their position in the process of redistribution. 8. We recognise that the introduction of a third party redistribution system, herein referred to as taxation, and the welfare system, interrupts this natural law, severing the relationship between ‘giver’ and ‘receiver’. In a welfare system, the giver cannot account for where and how their loss has enhanced the mana of somebody else. Equally, the receiver is unable to trace the source of charity and is thus un-obliged to reciprocate in some capacity, or to recognise the limitations of the giving capacity of others. The third party re-distribution system effectively dehumanises the process of ‘koha’. 9. Whilst we recognise the evolution of taxation, we recommend that, in imagining the future of taxation, the Tax Working Group strongly reconsider re-humanising the process of taxation, enabling transparency across all mechanisms of taxation, in order to ensure that our tax system is future proofed for the benefit of future generations of New Zealanders. We support the adoption of a Maori values system as outlined in the submission document which fundamentally supports our Maori worldview with regards to a taxation approach 10. Strong evidence supports that more equitable societies fare better in health and social outcomes that inequitable countries. Mortality and health outcomes are not determined by the overall wealth of a country, but rather by the level of inequality that exist in that country. More equitable countries are likely to experience lower rates of health issues such as obesity, mental illness, alcohol, gambling and drug addictions. Further to this, more equitable countries are more likely to experience better social outcomes for crime, literacy, social mobility and environmental responsibility. 11. Our tax system needs urgent attention in order for it to address the astounding rates of wealth inequality within New Zealand in order to be strong contenders on a world stage where positive experiences of health and social wellbeing are prioritised. Given this, Hāpai makes the following recommendations to The Tax Working Group: Taxation Overhaul 12. A complete overhaul of our tax system, to include the development of a taxation system which is fit for purpose and possesses efficient operations which do not continue to increase inequities in New Zealand. 13. Hāpai advocates for a taxation system which does not further detriment those disadvantaged populations, particularly Māori and Pacific. This will require the re-prioritisation of our values as a nation. 14. Given this, Hāpai supports a morality and values based taxation system in the future. We recognise that our future generations will inherit said system and thus, we wish for a future proofed taxation system which recognises the value of every individual as an eco-systemic member of the fabric of our New Zealand society. 15. We support a taxation system which effectively taxes wealth as opposed to income. The current system of income taxation provides many loopholes which facilitate tax evasion, which has major negative impacts on our economy. 16. Hāpai believes that taxation should be used to support services that targeted populations in particular Māori and Pasifika require, and most importantly that they are provided by to specifically support these population groups for positive outcomes in health and wellbeing. 17. If resources generated from our current taxation system were distributed correctly, we would not see Māori and Pasifika health inequities as they largely stem from poverty. Māori is at the lower end of almost every health and social indicator; we are more likely to experience unemployment, die earlier, suffer poorer health, be incarcerated, and require greater government assistance. 18. Recently we have seen iwi and hapū such as Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei provide private health insurance and Ngāi Tūhoe to assume responsibility for the welfare system within its rohe. Whilst this is a primary example of self-determination, it is simultaneously a reflection of the inequity of our taxation system against Māori. 19. In the failure of the taxation system to meet, or even to accommodate for the needs of Māori, a future tax system needs to be one which affirmatively recognises the self-determinability of Māori, whilst also resourcing Māori to serve their own populations. Te Ao Māori 20. We believe that the reconfiguration of the tax system can adequately allow for growth and sustainability of both ‘Māori in the economy’ and the Māori economy’ through focussing on values based economy 21. Taxation needs to not disadvantage those on low wages, thereby forcing whānau into welfare and contributing to the disproportionately high rates of Māori unemployment. We advocate for a mechanism which reduces, or eliminates tax for people on zero-hour contracts, until such a time as stronger employment laws are legislated which protect the employment rights of our most vulnerable populations. 22. Despite the structural inhibitors which have negatively impacted the ability of Māori to thrive in the modern global economy. It must be said that 30 years of treaty settlements and recognition of the principles of Te Tiriti o Waitangi does not excuse more than 175 years of colonisation, discrimination and oppression by the crown. 23. Māori have been alienated from their lands, waterways and marine spaces for several generations. In addressing ‘Te Ao Māori’ or Māori economics into the context of this discussion, we need to first recognise that, in settlements, Māori only received 5% on average of the value of land previously confiscated. Further to this, settlements did not account for the economic costs of the harms imposed by raupatu, nor do they return any iwi or the population of Māori to the state of vitality experienced by Māoridom pre-colonisation 24. It is imperative that it be recognised that the continued health and social disparities are consequential of the historical and ongoing attempts to marginalise Māori in our own land. 25. We thus, do not see it as appropriate to further punish Māori for our lucrative investments and entrepreneurialism. We believe that any asset base owned by Iwi should be subject to the tax exemption clauses much like those of charitable trusts. 26. The burden of taxation revenue from harmful products should not fall entirely on the consumer, thereby disadvantaging the whānau economically. Industries which manufacture and profit from harmful products such as alcohol, tobacco and sugar sweetened beverages should equally feel the costs of the taxation of harmful products in order to encourage harm minimisation strategies on the part of the manufacturer. 27. Whilst we understand that excise tax is primarily a deterrent mechanism for unhealthy behaviour, we simultaneously see that there will be no behaviour change or risk mitigating behaviours on the part of the manufacturer if there is not a concerted effort by the government to ensure that they take on responsibility for the harm associated with their products. Tobacco 28. Hāpai supports the recommendation of Aspire 2025 that a mandated approach to retail price of tobacco would best serve to reduce the harm from tobacco consumption. 29. This would mean that all brands would be the same price per cigarette or tobacco weight. A periodically adjusted Government mandated retail tobacco price per cigarette (or tobacco weight), combined with a maximum price before tax, would enable Government to control the effect of tobacco tax rises. Hāpai recognises that Māori and Pasifika financially suffer from tax increases each year. Hāpai also recommends that tax increases should be implemented at the start of the government financial year and not at the calendar year as many in the community are already financially restrained due to other whānau commitments, such as holiday and back to school expenses. 30. Hāpai urges the Tax Working Group to review the investment strategy of the tax revenue on tobacco, with a key focus on re-investing tobacco excise tax into supply reduction initiatives as well as focussing on the re-investment into peer-led, culturally appropriate cessation and addiction services. 31. Hāpai supports tax increases if it is invested in supply reduction, which supports whānau in becoming and/ or remaining smoke-free. Those living in poverty are more likely to smoke and live in tobacco- dense areas making it easier to start smoking and harder to quit. 32. The increasing rates of tobacco-related violence and theft demonstrates this financial stress. Reinvesting tobacco tax into supply reduction will help prevent this crime because it reduces the availability of tobacco products for theft. 33. Hāpai believes responding to retail crime should not be at the expense of forgoing tobacco tax increases- an established and evidence-based policy. This would harm the health of New Zealanders because tobacco price increases are so strongly associated with reducing and preventing tobacco use and prompting smokers to quit. 34. Hāpai recommends reviewing profit margins tobacco companies made since tax increases were introduced as this will support the argument of reducing supply will, in turn, reduce tobacco companies’ profits. 35. Some research suggests hardship may have increased for some low-income smokers following recent tax increases; in particular, the potential negative impacts on the children of smokers. For example, there is the risk that parents or caregivers may be burdened by the expensive addiction of cigarettes making the purchasing of household essentials unaffordable. 36. Using dedicated tax revenue to invest in culturally appropriate and driven and peer-led holistic services that emphasis smoking cessation support as part of a wider health strategy could mitigate the potential effect of financial hardship. The underwhelming success rates of current smoking services clearly show that resources need to be redirected into services that are proven to reduce smoking rates. This includes vaping support services that are peer-led and community driven. 37. If tax does not support these interventions to help increase quitting, the adverse financial effects of tax increases are likely to impact disproportionately on low-income smokers who continue to smoke. 38. The New Zealand Government currently funds a Pharmacy NRT Service as part of the smoking cessation programme. The underwhelming enrolment and quit rates for priority groups indicate service method and delivery needs to change. Hāpai see the benefit in investigating the merit in government also supporting harm minimisation which has been approved and regulated for quality control. 39. Hāpai supports tobacco taxation if used to support whānau. There is broad health sector support and evidence within New Zealand that annual 10% tobacco excise tax increases, currently under government review, is one of the most powerful tobacco control interventions and has an important role in achieving a Smokefree New Zealand by 2025. Quality of life is impacted by socioeconomic deprivation therefore pricing has been a significant trigger to stop smoking. This is especially true when motivation alone is not always enough to remain smoke free (Macfarlane et al., 2011). Studies measuring the effect of tobacco tax increases (Macfarlane et al., 2011) found that cost was twice as likely to be a motivating factor to stop smoking compared to before the tax increase, and more smokers made a quit attempt in 2010 post-tax increase. Māori, Pacific, and rangatahi (young Māori) are disproportionately more likely to be living in socio economic deprivation. Evidence shows that low-income earners were significantly more likely to report ‘cost’ as a reason for making a quit attempt. 34% of Māori were motivated to stop smoking due to ‘cost’ following the unscheduled 2010 tax increase of 20%. Alcohol 40. Hāpai sees the application of excise tax to all alcohol products, in a consistent manner, as fundamentally important to the reduction of alcohol related harm. In New Zealand today, alcohol is more affordable, and therefore more accessible than it has ever been. 41. Almost every group defined by age, ethnicity and sex has increased their drinking since 2011. The greatest increases are among our women. As with all other harmful products instituted into our society in the process of colonisation, Māori are disproportionately affected by the burden of alcohol related harm. 42. We believe that rates of alcohol excise tax should reflect the cost of alcohol-related harm to society. Alcohol causes more harm than any other drug available in society, e.g. tobacco, cannabis, heroin, methamphetamine. Every year, the Government receives money from alcohol excise tax ($1 billion in 2017) but this does not come close to the annual cost of alcohol-related harm to individuals and society (around $5 billion in 2005/06). 43. Increases in alcohol excise rates are urgently required to address the growing number of hazardous drinkers in New Zealand. In 2016, there were 179,000 more hazardous drinkers than in 2012. 44. We recommend, in line with the recommendations made by Alcohol Healthwatch, that there be an Increase alcohol excise rates by at least 50% across all alcohol products to raise the price of alcohol by at least 10% 45. We support the clear application of excise tax on wine – all wine should be taxed by alcohol content, not volume of beverage. If a producer is unable to determine the exact alcohol content in their product, then the level of excise tax should be raised from being based on 10% alcohol strength to 14%. 46. Due to the inaccuracies and loopholes which technically allow for non-compliance of industry to the excise tax against alcohol, the New Zealand economy is losing out on a significant amount of potential tax revenue. Wine is taxed at a level equivalent to 10% alcohol, yet levels of alcohol in a bottle of wine are typically much higher than this (e.g. 12-14%). Taxpayers are losing out on this revenue which could be used to fund essential social services, or further to use in the resourcing of initiatives to reduce alcohol harm and treat alcohol dependency. 47. It is preferable that all alcohol products (beer, wine, cider, spirits, etc.) be taxed by the exact amount of alcohol they contain. This is fair across all beverages. Currently, some products are taxed by volume whereas others are taxed by alcohol content. It is the alcohol content, as opposed to the beverage itself which causes the alcohol related harm. 48. Thinking outside the system, we recommend that a Minimum Unit Pricing Policy also be implemented to address the availability of very cheap alcohol. This policy is the most fair as it targets heavy drinkers and significantly reduces inequities in alcohol-related harms between income groups. Gambling 49. Problem gambling is evidenced to contribute to our failing rates across a number of health issues such as alcohol addiction, substance use and abuse, increased stress, poor mental health and suicide. It is further linked to poor social outcomes including unemployment, poverty, homelessness and family violence. 50. The burden of gambling harm is experienced far beyond the individual with one in every 4 New Zealanders experiencing the negative impacts of someone’s gambling. 51. The proceeds received by the government are allocated towards an array of gambling harm prevention and minimisation outcomes as outlined in the Strategy to Prevent and Minimise Gambling Harm. The revenue acquired by the government for the purposes of harm minimisation is currently not enough to adequately address the harm of problem gambling. 52. We recommend that taxation (currently applied by way of a gambling levy under Schedule 2 of Gambling \[Problem Gambling Levy\] Regulations 2016) be applied to class 4 gambling profits at a rate that resembles the associated harm of gambling addictions. 53. We recommend an excise tax be applied to the purchase of lotteries tickets, particularly given the public platform provided to lotteries commission by way of television broadcasting, which arguably, increases visibility and thus facilitates more gambling related harm than other classes of gambling. 54. Under current laws, gambling licencing trusts are tax exempt on the premise that they fall in the cohort of charitable trusts. We believe that it is fair and adequate to tax all pokie licencing trusts as if they were businesses, given that the economic benefits of their charitable activity pales in comparison to their margin of profit. 55. The overall gambling levy is 3.76% of gambling proceeds per annum. We argue that the levy rate does nothing to minimise gambling harm, and furthermore, when considering the three- way distribution of the 3.76%, only a third of this levy is re-distributed to the community, and often redistributed to the communities outside of where the profits were made. 56. We recommend, in the overhaul of our tax system, that the levy be increased to reflect the proportion of gambling related harm experienced by the community. 57. Taxation, acquired through levies for the purpose of community grants should be earmarked to prioritise purposes which improve social and health outcomes above leisure or recreational purposes. Furthermore, the re-distribution of the grants funds from gambling proceeds should return, proportionately to the community it is derived from. 58. The revenue gathered from any tax associated with reducing uptake or consumption of any class of gambling should be readily allocated to the reduction of gambling harm, with a prioritisation of resourcing to those populations most affected, in this case, Māori and Pacific and less affluent communities. Sugar Tax/ Food Tax 59. We recognise the effectiveness of taxation as a public health approach to reducing harm from other harmful products such as alcohol and tobacco and as such, we see value in using this approach to our food and drinks industry. 60. We advocate for reducing the sale and supply of sugary drinks, with a focus on attaching an excise tax to the purchase of these products. Sugar sweetened beverages are identified as a major contributor to poor health, including obesity, type-2 diabetes, tooth decay, and overall poor oral health, gout and other risk factors for cardiovascular disease and premature death. 61. There is a significant evidence base which implicates sugary drinks with these common diseases, and thus we believe that the same successful approach that has been used in reducing the consumption of tobacco and alcohol needs to be applied. 62. Whilst we recognise that the severity of our recommendation for taxation of all products which are harmful to our whānau may be viewed as paternalism, we also recognise the counter argument to that, which is that we are currently subject to the whims of these industries who participate in the sale of these products primarily for profit. 63. We tender that the purpose of tax, as outlined by the tax working group, is to provide fair tax system that positively impacts on the well-being of all New Zealanders, and that such risk mitigating strategies are well aligned to the 64. In recognition of the impact of our food products and its contribution to our obesogenic society, we believe that adequate taxation needs to be imposed in the form of food excise tax to certain products. We further believe that food products available to our most vulnerable whānau need to be regulated, by way of excise, should be progressively taxed by 65. We advocate for the removal of GST from all fresh and frozen, unprocessed or unmodified fruit and vegetables (For example, we support GST removal for frozen peas, but not frozen fries). This will encourage the sale of fresh goods to whānau, given that access to healthy food should be viewed as a necessity rather than a “good” or “service”. 66. Further to this, we believe that an excise tax should be applied to foods that are not health promoting. In an ideal society, we would rely on a Health Star Rating (HSR) system to determine the taxation levels on products, however, we recognise that there are flaws in the HSR that would inhibit the effective implementation of this excise tax. 67. Any tax revenue gathered from sugar sweetened beverages or other excise tax applied to unhealthy foods should be earmarked for the reduction of issues relating to poor nutrition such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and any other such health issues which may arise through research. 68. Not only would a sugar tax result in increase in revenue from the excise tax itself, there would also be an increase in governmental budget from the reduction in health costs which stem from the consumption of sugary drinks. Conclusion 69. We see this inquiry as fundamental to increasing the effectiveness of our tax system overall as they were originally purposed - to create a fair taxation system that positively impacts on the well-being of all New Zealanders. 70. If the opportunity arises we would welcome the opportunity to present to this submission orally. 71. We once again thank the Tax Working Group for the opportunity to contribute to the progress of this inquiry, and look forward to seeing the outcomes of this inquiry.

In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. 24 April 2018 submissions@taxworkinggroup.govt.nz RE: Submissions on the Future of Tax Dear Tax Working Group Background I write to you on behalf of the Home Early Learning Organisation, HELO. HELO was launched in late 2012 as a new and stronger voice to lead the home-based Early Childhood Education sector in fostering strong and cooperative relationships with Government agencies. This also includes working to communicate and expand the benefits of in-home early childhood learning, where we believe quality learning comes from the strength of the relationship between the child, the family and the educator/nanny or au pair in a secure home environment. HELO represents most of the largest home-based ECE Service Providers: Au Pair Link, PAUA, Home Grown Kids, and PORSE. We represent over 20% of all child enrolments in home-based ECE. Home- based ECE represents 10% of all ECE service types with close to 19,000 children enrolled in home- based ECE. We are funded and regulated by the Ministry of Education (MoE) and our job is to arrange childcare in a home environment. Close to $120m p.a. is provided to the home-based ECE sector in subsidy funding from MoE. Educators or Nannies care for a maximum of four children in a home environment. Most nannies are employed directly by their families (whose homes they work in) and Educators generally work in their own homes as self-employed/independent contractors. Current inconsistencies that need to be addressed We appreciate the opportunity to input our thoughts into the tax system and be part of any reforms that may result from this work. Our aim, like you, is to ensure a robust tax system that is equitable, fair and meets the needs of the 21 st century. Unfortunately, this has not been some of our experiences to date. Over the years, some providers, such as PORSE and Home Grown Kids, have been through an extensive process with Inland Revenue in relation to how Educators and Nannies are set up, and the flow of Government and parent money through these arrangements. However, there has been no consistent application to the other 151 current services (and over 400 licences) that exist in home- based ECE which has resulted in unfair competition causing economic harm. Some providers have blatant disregard to the regulations, while others have incurred significant costs and processes, such as registering as a PAYE Intermediary. We acknowledge your paper that notes that “another important aspect of fairness is procedural fairness. Taxpayers should have as much certainty of their tax situation as possible and should be treated fairly by the tax department”. We hope this occurs at some point in the future. As with all providers in the home-based sector, the inter-relationship with Parents, Nannies, Home Educators and funding agencies (such as the Ministry of Education and Ministry of Social Development) is governed by overlapping regulations, agreements, registration or application forms and other documentation. The broad consensus within the sector is that the Service Provider provides the educational framework, maintains the ECE licences and thereby facilitates and monitors arrangements for nannies and educators to provide the education, care and comfort directly to the children. Essentially, to comply with the statutory framework and maintain ECE licences, Service Providers play a quazi-regulator role. This is consistent with the statutory framework as set out in the Education Act 1989, Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008 and the Licensing Criteria for Home-based Education and Care Services 2008. However, Inland Revenue have differing interpretations and thought that GST should apply parent payments (for the Educator) and payments from W&I (that parents apply for but have to flow through a Service Provider) and that the Service Provider should be responsible for the GST. Inland Revenue also considered that any Service Provider that administers wages on behalf of families (as the employee for Nannies) should be PAYE Intermediary registered. While PORSE and Au Pair Link are PAYE Intermediary registered, most other providers who offer this same service are not. This is an area where there are significant inconsistencies in the market and in the current tax system and this needs to be addressed to ensure equity and fairness with the current system. GST exemption options and rationale Exemption for home-based Educators The other area we would like the working group to consider is assisting the sector to consider GST exemptions for home-based Educators and ensure there remains strong incentives for Educators to work from their home and receive tax benefits so they can maintain a living, contribute to society and also allow for other women to maintain their positions in the labour workforce following having children. Ninety eight percent of home-based ECE Educators are women. Many of these women work for the love of what they do and make a very modest living. Not many Educators would reach the GST threshold of $60k p.a. However, ECE plays an important role, particularly home-based in allowing for flexible and responsive care based on parent’s needs. Not all parents can work a 9am – 5pm job and home-based ECE plays an important role in providing flexible care arrangements. We should be encouraging women to enter into this workforce and breaking down the barriers to ensure it is a sustainable business; a GST exemption could assist with this group given they are low-income earners but play a vital role in society with social benefits. The public good component of this group of workers is beneficial to society. Exemption for all of ECE Alternatively, there is strong support in the sector to allow for early childhood education to be zero- rated and not exempt; ideally providers can still recover all GST they incur and GST on cost would not be recoverable. This approach is consistent with Australia and other jurisdictions given the strong social contribution early childhood education contributes to society. We understand the rationale behind Australia’s reforms was to ensure consistency and provide an equal playing field. For example, like health and medical care, education receives significant government assistance. This Government is keen to ensure that public primary and secondary education is provided free of charge and there is a strong push for more public ECE services and more services appear to be achieving charitable trust status with tax benefits while still following the same regulatory requirements. The Working Group needs to ensure that the tax system minimises any discrimination between private and public provision or goods and services for any GST-free areas. Public good and benefits for lower social economic groups and generational change Finally, Government funding, which we heavily rely on, has not increased over the last five years for current services. While there has been an increase this has been to allow for the increase in new services that have been established to meet previous Government’s Better Public Services Programme with the aim to increase participation in ECE to 98% of all new entrants by 2016. There have not been any increases to allow for CPI. However, more costs have been imposed on providers (such as paying for Police Checks for each core worker; approximately $10 per check unless you have charitable status and ensuring teachers are paid fair salaries for the important work that they do). GST exemptions can help ensure the longevity of ECE services and would go some way to recognise the importance that high quality ECE can play for our future generations. This is specifically important when it comes to low income earners where there is substantial evidence that shows high quality ECE for the lower socio-economic groups or vulnerable children can help with academic achievement and provides positive impacts on literacy, numeracy and problem-solving skills which leads to higher levels of achievement and better social outcomes. 1 International and longitudinal studies have also found that participation in high quality ECE can translate into improved longer-term outcomes. Several studies have identified links between participation in ECE and better social and economic outcomes for children when they reach older ages (Wylie et al, 2009). 2 This link is, again, strong for disadvantaged children. Some studies have also identified positive relationships between ECE participation and the affect on wider societal outcomes; for example, ensuring participation in the labour force and in building labour force capability (Ministry of Women's Affairs, 2004). 3 If you would like to further discuss our submission or any of the points raised, please feel free to contact Kerry Henderson on Nāku noa, nā Kerry Henderson President 1 https://www.educationcounts.govt.nz/statistics/indicators/main/student-engagement-participation/1923 2 https://www.educationcounts.govt.nz/statistics/indicators/main/student-engagement-participation/1923 3 https://www.educationcounts.govt.nz/statistics/indicators/main/student-engagement-participation/1923 \[1\] \[1\]

NZIER report -Taxing times i Key points Federated Farmers of New Zealand Inc., B+LNZ (Beef + Lamb New Zealand Ltd), DairyNZ, Horticulture NZ, and IrrigationNZ have asked us to review a range of proposed taxes on the primary sector against principles of good tax policy. Taxes are necessary to fund government services, but involve potentially large economic costs The Tax Working Group convened by Victoria University of Wellington proposed a set of principles for a good tax system in its 2010 report that we have applied in assessing a series of proposed new taxes on the primary sector: • Efficiency and growth • Equity and fairness • Revenue integrity • Fiscal cost • Compliance and administration cost • Coherence. No tax that raises the levels of revenue required by modern economies can meet these criteria at the same time: trade-offs are required In practice, public finance economics recommends that governments adopt a ‘broad- base, low-rate’ (BB/LR) approach to designing tax systems: • Taxes should apply to wide ranges of activities • Individual taxes on specific sub-sectors of the economy should be avoided • Rates of taxation should be as low as possible, while still meeting revenue needs and equity concerns • Taxes should be seen as a system, not a collection of individual measures designed to meet specific policy objectives. New Zealand’s current tax system has been consistently assessed as being one of the best in the OECD at raising revenue at least cost While reviews by local and international bodies have recommended changes at the margin, no serious case has been made for moving away from the BB/LR approach. Most of the tax policy proposals advanced prior to the 2017 general election by parties now forming part of or supporting the Government find little support in our framework • Applying a resource rental tax on all uses of water might be justified on efficiency grounds, but should be compared with other regulatory instruments, following a robust assessment of the actual public policy problem such measures are seeking to address • Taxing exported bottled water in isolation is difficult to justify on any grounds: it would be an outlier within the New Zealand tax system (i.e. it NZIER report -Taxing times ii would be the only tax applied exclusively to an exported product), is likely to have high compliance and administrative costs because it is applied on a very narrow base (i.e. one product) and would likely raise very little revenue • Applying a tax to one by-product of farming (nitrate) is difficult to justify: it would be an additional tax on one production process; is likely to have high compliance and administrative costs because it would be applied on a very narrow base and would likely raise very little revenue. Using the proceeds of this tax to finance specific expenditure would likely lead to sub-optimal spending or taxation levels • Extending the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) to agriculture can be justified, but would need to be undertaken as part of a comprehensive policy programme if unintended consequences, especially international leakage and loss of competitiveness, are to be avoided.

Introduction Leading up to the 2017 general election, the political parties now forming or supporting the Government proposed a range of new taxes on the primary sector. A number of these proposals, with some modifications, are on the new Government’s agenda. Federated Farmers of New Zealand Inc., B+LNZ (Beef + Lamb New Zealand Ltd), DairyNZ, Horticulture NZ, and IrrigationNZ have asked us to assess these proposals against principles of good tax policy. In undertaking this review, we have adopted a systems approach. Rather than look at individual proposals in isolation, we have examined how they would fit within the whole New Zealand tax system. The Tax Working Group (TWG), which conducted the last major review of taxes in New Zealand, stressed that system-wide coherence was one of the key principles it used. We return to the TWG’s other principles below. 1.1. New Zealand tax policy Given our focus on the tax system, we first outline the basic structure of that system and the policy considerations have been used to arrive at where we are today. After a series of reforms undertaken in the 1980s and 1990s, the New Zealand tax system has long been regarded as one of most efficient within the OECD. 1 The guiding principle that has led to this result goes by the general name broad-base low-rate (BB/LR). Major features of the BB/LR approach in New Zealand have been: • Repeal of many small, ad hoc, taxes and charges, like stamp duty and the TV licence fee • Repeal of taxes that might be justified on equity grounds, but which raised a limited amount of revenue, were costly to administer and were relatively easy to avoid, like gift and death duty • Replacing taxes on business inputs (like tariffs 2 and the wholesale sales tax) with taxes on outputs (income and consumption), i.e. Goods and Services Tax (GST) • Progressive removal of tax incentives – departures from treatments applied to sectors or the whole economy designed to promote specific economic developments – and the resulting increases in revenue used to fund across- the-board rate reductions. Today, the New Zealand government annually raises about $67 billion or 91% of total revenue from the income tax and GST. Of the remaining 9%, 4.5% is road user charges 1 Mourougane (2007), p. 2. 2 While the removal of tariffs was undertaken as part of a trade liberalisation programme and wider economic reform agenda, tariffs had been a major source of general revenue for successive governments. For example, in 1915, customs and excise duties contributed 56.03% of total revenue, falling to a modest 33.26% in 1934 (Statistics New Zealand 1935). NZIER report -Taxing times 2 and fuel excise; 3.5% is excises on tobacco and alcohol and the remaining 0.8% is comprised of a range of smaller taxes. 3 Successive governments wishing to change tax revenue have altered the rates of income tax and GST, rather than add or repeal specific taxes. Figure 1 Income tax and GST raise over 90% of the Government’s annual revenue Projections for financial year ended 30 June 2018 Source: Treasury 1.2. A much-reviewed system Since BB/LR was adopted as a guiding principle for tax policy, there have been many reviews of the New Zealand tax system undertaken both locally and by international bodies like the OECD and the IMF. Three major local reviews have been: • The Committee of Experts of Tax Policy (1999) 4 • Tax Review 2001 (2002) 5 • The Tax Working Group (2010). 6 Comprehensive reviews of the tax system were undertaken by the OECD in 2000 and 2007. Successive biennial Economic Surveys of New Zealand by the OECD have also 3 Tariffs ($148m), gaming duties ($240m), motor vehicle fees, ($237m), petroleum and mineral royalties ($200m). Approved Issuer Levy and cheque duty ($31m) and energy resources levies ($31m). All figures are revenue raised for the year ended 30 June 2017. 4 https://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/sites/default/files/1998-other-tax-compliance.pdf 5 http://www.treasury.govt.nz/publications/reviews-consultation/taxreview2001 6 https://www.victoria.ac.nz/sacl/centres-and-institutes/cagtr/twg Income tax: individualsIncome tax: companiesGSTRoad transportExcisesOther NZIER report -Taxing times 3 considered tax matters to greater or lesser degree. 7 Likewise, the IMF’s routine consultations with the New Zealand authorities also address tax policy. 8 While each of these reviews have made recommendations for specific changes to the tax system, none has suggested moving away from the current overall BB/LR approach. 1.3. Principles of good tax policy The BB/LR approach is the result of applying a set of consistent principles. In this report, we have used the six principles of a good tax system proposed by the TWG in 2010. These principles are very similar to those applied by successive governments and recommended by the OECD and the IMF. 9 The TWG explained its principles as: 10 • Efficiency and growth: Taxes should be efficient and minimise as far as possible impediments to economic growth. That is, the tax system should avoid unnecessarily distorting the use of resources (e.g. causing biases toward one form of investment versus another) and imposing heavy costs on individuals and firms. Another term used to describe efficient taxes is “neutrality”. • Equity and fairness: The tax system should be fair. The burden of taxes differs across individuals and businesses depending on which bases and rates are adopted. Assessment of both vertical equity (the relative position of those on different income levels or in different circumstances) and horizontal equity (the consistent treatment of those at similar income levels, or similar circumstances) is important. The timeframe is also important, including how equity compares over peoples’ life-times. • Revenue integrity: The tax system should be sustainable over time, minimise opportunities for tax avoidance and arbitrage, and provide a sustainable revenue base for government. • Fiscal cost: Tax reforms need to be affordable given fiscal constraints. 11 • Compliance and administration cost: The tax system should be as simple and low cost as possible for taxpayers to comply with and for the Inland Revenue Department to administer. 12 • Coherence: Individual reform options should make sense in the context of the entire tax system. While a particular measure may seem sensible when viewed in isolation, implementing the proposal may not be desirable given the tax system as a whole. 7 Reviews since 1975 can be found online at: http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/oecd-economic-surveys-new- zealand\_19990162 8 See http://www.imf.org/en/Countries/NZL. 9 See Brys et al. (2016) and International Monetary Fund (2017), especially Chapter 2. 10 Tax Working Group (2010) p. 15. 11 As none of the proposals we are examining involve reductions in revenue, we have not needed to apply this criterion. 12 The TWG was focused mainly on income tax, hence the reference to Inland Revenue. New Zealand Customs administers tariff duties, excise taxes and GST on imports. The New Zealand Transport Authority (road user charges and motor vehicle licence fees), the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (mineral royalties) and the Department of Internal Affairs (gaming duty) also administer various tax regimes. NZIER report -Taxing times 4 1.4. The special case of taxing economic rents There is one case where public finance economics recommends a departure from the general principle of neutrality, and that is the taxation of natural resources like minerals where the owners of rights to exploit those resources can earn excess profits, or economic rents. Partly because mineral resources are not a large part of the New Zealand economy, whether departing from the BB/LR approach is justified in the case of natural resource taxation has not featured prominently in local tax policy debates. 13 However, the Labour Party’s proposal to impose a tax on all commercial uses of water was an example of such a tax, and therefore we will provide a brief discussion of the main elements of such taxes. One important feature of economic rents is that they can be taxed with little or no efficiency cost. 14 This is because economic rents are an extra return above that required to compensate the owner of the capital earning the rent for risk and the opportunity cost of their investment. Taxing away that extra return, or a part of it, does not diminish the attractiveness of the investment compared to investment that only earn “normal” (i.e. rent-free) profits. So just taxing rents would not cause investors to reduce the amount that they have invested. Under a traditional income tax, economic rents are taxed at the same rate as all other returns to capital and labour. 15 Some countries, therefore, impose additional taxes on owners of natural resources that can earn rents. The Australian Treasury has long favoured resource rental taxes, given the importance of extractive industries to Australia’s economy. 16 While the case for taxing rents is conceptually sound, differentiating between normal and excess rates of return is difficult in practice. Most countries do not include additional taxes on rents in their main income taxes. Royalties on extraction, which are easier to measure (because they are often charged on the quantity mined, rather than the profits earned) are, however, common. New Zealand applies royalties to a small number of minerals (petroleum, coal, gold), raising about $200 million annually. 13 Resource rental taxes are different from the more common environmental taxes used to correct market failures that lead to sub-optimal levels of pollution. We discuss this issue further in Section 2.3. Although environmental taxes were out of scope of the 2010 TWG, the 2001 Tax Review did discuss ‘Eco Charges’. The Labour Party and the Green Party have advocated for environmental taxes in their tax and environmental policies and we note that the terms of reference of the recently announced review of the New Zealand tax system includes how the tax system can help deliver positive environmental and ecological outcomes. 14 Garnaut (2010). 15 It is possible, at least conceptually, to design a broad-based tax that taxes rents at a higher rate than normal returns. A cash- flow tax is one such instrument, and implementing such a tax remains the goal of many tax policy experts in the United States. In its 2017 review of the United States economic policy, the IMF recommended that the United States convert its income tax to a cash-flow tax and elements of this proposal were enacted as part of the President Trump’s tax bill. Some years ago, the New Zealand Treasury investigated whether a cash flow tax was practical in New Zealand and decided it wasn’t, mainly for reasons to do with the fiscal and economic cost of a transition. See Katz (1999) and Wilson (2002). 16 See Australian Treasury (2009). NZIER report -Taxing times 5 1.5. New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme Introduced in 2008, the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme (NZ ETS), while technically not a tax or a charge, is a significant economic instrument used to change behaviour. A carbon tax is an alternative instrument often used to achieve the same goals as an ETS, and indeed, the Green Party proposed in its manifesto that the NZ ETS be replaced by such a tax. It is, therefore, appropriate to provide a brief description of the scheme here. 17 The NZ ETS puts a price on greenhouse gas emissions. This is intended to create a financial incentive for people to invest in technologies and practices that reduce emissions. The NZ ETS requires all sectors of New Zealand’s economy to report on their emissions and, with the exception of biological emissions from agriculture, to purchase and surrender emissions units to the Government for those emissions. Just over half of New Zealand’s greenhouse gas emissions are covered by the NZ ETS’ surrender obligations. The scheme also encourages forest planting by allowing eligible foresters to earn emission units as their trees grow and absorb carbon dioxide. An emission unit represents one metric tonne of carbon dioxide, or the carbon dioxide equivalent of any other greenhouse gas. Currently, the only eligible emissions unit in the NZ ETS is the New Zealand Unit (NZU). Figure 2 provides a schematic overview of how the NZ ETS works. Figure 2 How the NZ ETS works Source: Ministry for the Environment 17 For an explanation of the economics behind the NZ ETS, see Wilson (2011). NZIER report -Taxing times 6 1.6. What has the Government proposed? Prior to the election, the Labour Party, New Zealand First and the Green Party all issued manifestos that proposed changes to the taxes applied to the primary sector. More details are in Appendix A. Following the government formation process, a number of these proposals are to proceed, at least in a modified form. Some of the proposals to be adopted are amalgams of the various parties’ positions, others are conditional on further study and, in some cases, the policy announcement is not to proceed with proposed initiatives in the first term of the Government. The proposals that we have analysed in this report are: • A tax on all commercial users of water (which is not to proceed this term, but could conceivably be considered post-2020). Included in this analysis is a discussion of the proposal to tax exports of bottled water • A tax on nitrate (while this not proceeding this term, the proposal is a good example of how taxes on narrow bases can have high costs) • Including agriculture in the NZ ETS (which is to be subject to further study by the newly established Climate Commission). NZIER report -Taxing times 7 2. Assessment of the proposals Just because a tax can be imposed, or has been imposed in some other place or at some other time, doesn’t mean that it should be imposed. In this section, we provide our initial assessment of the policies the new Government has said it will be advancing to determine whether they might be justified on grounds of improving the overall tax system. We have also included an analysis of some of the proposals that the Government has indicated will not be progressed immediately, because they represent interesting examples of how to analyse taxes within our framework, and because such taxes could be considered at a later date by government. This analysis is only preliminary, as many of the important details of what has been proposed have yet to be announced. 2.1. Summary of assessment In Table 1, we provide a high-level summary of our assessment against the TWG’s principles.

Resource rental tax on water Table 2 The water royalty could be justified on efficiency grounds Efficiency Equity Revenue integrity Compliance and administration cost Coherence ✓  ✓   Source: NZIER The coalition agreement between the Labour Party and New Zealand First specifically states that the proposal to place a royalty on the commercial uses of water will not proceed this Parliamentary term. Given the prominence of this issue prior to the election, we include some high-level commentary on this matter. Again, detailed analysis is not possible given the lack of detail on these specific proposals. As we noted above, there is a conceptual case for applying an additional tax on owners of rights to use natural resources where they can earn economic rents. However, there are many steps required from that case to deciding in practice whether a royalty should be applied to users of water in New Zealand. The first, and perhaps most important, is whether rents are actually being earned and, if so, why. Using water for agricultural purposes is often capital intensive, as it requires investment in water storage and irrigation equipment, in addition to operating costs of irrigation (electricity, etc.) and resource management costs. The return on this investment will not likely give rise to rents and should thus only be subject to normal income tax treatment. This is a further example of the potential complexity of a resource rental tax. In the case of most natural resources like minerals, rents arise because of the finite supply of the resources, which is a product of nature. Water itself is not a finite resource in New Zealand (notwithstanding droughts) in the way that minerals are. Minerals, once mined, are not replaced by nature. Water, however, is continually going through a cycle as rain water eventually returns to clouds via evaporation. 18 18 Tietenberg and Lewis, (2012), p. 206. NZIER report -Taxing times 9 Figure 3 The water cycle is complex Source: US Geological Survey The water cycle, can however, be measured in millennia. Water that seeps into deep aquifers (groundwater storage in the picture above) may be trapped for thousands of years, as is water that falls as snow and forms glaciers and ice sheets. 19 Water that is taken from anywhere in the cycle, from rivers and streams or underground bores and used for man-made purpose (drinking, irrigation, etc.), will eventually be returned to the cycle in some form. 20 Rights to use water in New Zealand are the product of law, not nature. If it is established that these laws give rise to rents (which is far from certain or simple), then a better approach would be to question whether the laws are efficient. If they are found not to be, then addressing the conditions in law that give rise to rents, rather than using the indirect measure of a tax on excess profits would make sense. More generally, the entire question of water use and its regulation is a complex matter that is still under active consideration. 21 We note, in particular, that the stated aim of the policy is “encourage the best and most efficient use of freshwater”. 22 It is not clear to us that using a tax would represent the best and most efficient way of achieving this aim. Using taxes to align private and social costs, as is the case with externalities, requires the government to know the difference between those costs. That is, how 19 For a description of the hydrological cycle, see the United States Geological Survey’s website at: https://water.usgs.gov/edu/watercyclesummary.html#infiltration. 20 This raises the point of where in the water cycle any royalty should apply: should it just apply to water taken from rivers, streams and aquifers, or also to rain water? 21 See Ministry for the Environment (2017). 22 Labour Party Manifesto 2017: Water, p.8. NZIER report -Taxing times 10 much the tax should be. (We return to this point below when considering the nitrate tax). The Labour Party’s proposal was to apply different rates of tax to different uses of water in each region. This would give the royalty the nature of a charge for use, which would be more efficiently imposed by way of tradeable permits or auctions, because these regimes have the advantage of revealing the true social value of the resource. Applying a resource rental tax on all uses of water should, therefore, be compared with other regulatory instruments, following a strong assessment of the actual problem such measures are seeking to address. 2.2.1. Bottled water royalty Following the coalition formation negotiations, the Government announced that it would introduce a “royalty” on exports of bottled water. No details have been announced regarding the rate of the royalty, on whom it will be levied and by whom it would it will be administered. Also unavailable is any clear discussion of what policy problem the royalty is intended to address. This tax is not specifically directed at the agricultural sector: if anything, it is a tax on part of the manufacturing sector. The context of the proposal, however, is clearly the Labour Party’s proposal for a wider tax on commercial users of water, which the new Government has announced is not going to proceed in the term of the current parliament. We have included this tax in our report because it represents a recent example of how very specific proposals can emerge from the government formation process without the usual input from experts and consultation with affected parties. Table 3 The royalty on bottled water is very hard to justify Efficiency Equity Revenue integrity Compliance and administration cost Coherence      Source: NZIER The Labour Party’s original proposal was based on concerns about the way in which water use rights are allocated. If that is the case with the narrower proposal, then it might be better to change that over time, rather than introducing a new narrow tax. This all points to the need for a clear problem definition and for all alternative solutions to be considered. One possible way to impose this tax would be to use the current excise regime, administered by New Zealand Customs, which is a product-specific tax regime, albeit one that applies only to domestic consumption. As excises are not charged on exports NZIER report -Taxing times 11 the system used for items like wine and spirits would require modification if it were to apply to exported water. 23 Because it will apply to a narrow sub-sector of the economy, it is likely to involve proportionately high administrative and compliance costs. To put this in context, the value of bottled water exports from New Zealand is very small, as shown in Figure 4. 24 If the tax was set at the GST rate (15%), it would have raised about $1.8 million in 2017. Officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade have advised Parliament that taxing water exports could breach New Zealand’s trade agreements. 25 If it were subject to a tax, bottled water would be the only manufactured export that would be taxable by New Zealand (under New Zealand’s GST regime, exports are zero- rated and royalties on minerals apply equally to exports and domestic consumption). Figure 4 Bottled water exports are very small Value of exports in NZD at FOB of bottled water for the year ending 30 June Source: Statistics New Zealand Taxing exported bottled water in isolation is difficult to justify on tax policy grounds. It goes against the BB/LR approach. We note that commercial bottlers of water are subject to income tax on their profits. If the industry continues to grow at its current 23 Under the Customs and Excise Act, the manufacture of goods subject to excise in New Zealand must take place in a Customs controlled area. Goods that are intended for home consumption are taxed at the time they leave the controlled area (called “entered for home consumption”). Goods that are intended for export are either exported immediately after they leave the manufacturing area or are moved to a licensed export warehouse and are exempt from duty. 24 The data in Error! Reference source not found. relates to exports of natural and mineral water without additives. We take this to be the target of the Government’s proposal. Exports of drinks that contain or are made from water (like soft drinks and beer) are clearly much higher. However, they are not “water”. This point shows another problematic aspect of the proposal: what is to be counted as “water”. 25 New Zealand Herald 30 November: “Tax on water exports would breach NZ trade agreements says top MFAT official”. http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c\_id=1&objectid=11950475 0 2,000,000 4,000,000 6,000,000 8,000,000 10,000,000 12,000,000 14,000,000 1998200020022004200620082010201220142016 NZIER report -Taxing times 12 rate, then, assuming bottlers continue to be profitable, the sector will make a greater proportional contribution to the tax take. It is unclear why an additional tax is required. 2.3. Nitrate tax Table 4 A nitrate tax scores poorly Efficiency Equity Revenue integrity Compliance and administration cost Coherence ✓  ✓   Source: NZIER The Green Party proposed a specific levy of $2 per kilogram of nitrate leached per hectare per year. The levy is an impost on an input, while the principles of good tax policy state that outputs (income and consumption) should be taxed. It is also a tax on one input into dairy farming, rather than applying generally. This levy is also an example of an important finding in public finance economics about the difference between regulation of prices versus quantities. 26 In cases of environmental externalities, the desired outcome is to reduce the quantity of pollution to an optimal level. Environmental economics does not consider pollution a bad thing in its own right, due to a reduction in amenity values. 27 Rather, the environmental economics framework considers pollution undesirable only if it is the result of a breakdown in the decision-making process of the relevant market, most often in the form of externalities, 28 but also due to public goods 29 or instances of common property. 30 Provided economic decision-makers are taking all the costs and benefits of their actions into account (along with other conditions), markets will operate to produce an equilibrium outcome and this outcome will be optimal. 31 The central contribution of 26 The seminal article is Weitzman (1974). 27 Not to be confused with a large body of literature on how to value the conservation of natural resources, especially national parks, which is critically interested in amenity values. 28 Where the full benefits or costs of an activity are not accurately reflected in market prices. 29 Where it is not possible for firms to set prices equal to marginal cost. Maler (1985) presents an extensive welfare framework for environmental economics based on “the environment" being a public good (although he does also suggest that it is a common property good). 30 Where profit-maximising firms do not face the true scarcity value of an input. 31 Pigou (1920/2005) is often credited as being the first person to state this result, although Sedgewick is also credited at having touched on the matter in his Principles of Political Economy. Baumol (1972) was an early developer of the formal version of the modern concept of Pigouvian taxes and Baumol and Oates (1988) did much to popularise its use. NZIER report -Taxing times 13 economics to the study of environmental issues is that there may be a non-zero optimal level of pollution. 32 This is still a current view. 33 Government will seldom be able to predict with much certainty what the optimal level of pollution will be. While economics predicts that applying a tax will reduce the quantity produced, the amount of that reduction is an empirical matter that can only be determined by measurement of the responsiveness of supply and demand to price (known as elasticities). We are not aware of whether the $2 levy proposed by the Green Party will be sufficient to achieve an optimal level of nitrate use. An alternative approach, which is in use in Taupō, is to set the quantity of nitrate that can be used and then use a rights-trading regime to deliver the optimal outcome of social marginal cost equalling social marginal benefit. 34 The Green Party’s proposal is that the revenue raised by the levy will be used to fund sustainable farming programmes and the clean-up of waterways. We assume that means “environmentally sustainable” given the traditional focus of the Green Party. Thus, the levy would be what is called a “tied-tax”. But not only is the revenue tied to a particular expenditure, that expenditure is to be directed at reducing the very thing that is being taxed. It is possible, therefore, that the tax would be the victim of its own success. If the tax is very successful in reducing nitrate use, then the amount of revenue raised will fall and it may be that the amount raised would be insufficient to fund the desired level of expenditure. 2.4. Extending the NZ ETS Table 5 Extending the NZ ETS could be justified Efficiency Equity Revenue integrity Compliance and administration cost Coherence ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ Source: NZIER Extending the NZ ETS to agriculture can be justified within the tax policy framework we are using to assess proposals, but would need to be undertaken as part of a comprehensive policy programme if unintended consequences are to be avoided. 32 See Bator (1974) for an early contribution along these lines. 33 Stavins (2008) begins his entry on environmental economics in the New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics with: “The fundamental theoretical argument for government activity in the environmental realm is that pollution is an externality: an unintended consequence of market decisions, which affects individuals other than the decision maker". 34 Lake Taupo nitrogen cap and trade programme was established in 2011 as part of Waikato Regional Council’s Regional Plan. For details, see: https://www.waikatoregion.govt.nz/Community/Your-community/For-Farmers/Taupo/Nitrogen- management-in-the-Lake-Taupo-catchment/. For reviews of the scheme, see OECD (2015) and Duhon, McDonald and Kerr (2015). NZIER report -Taxing times 14 Issues of leakage (where production shifts to another country that does not impose a carbon charge) and export competitiveness are critically important issues to address to avoid imposing a cost for limited or no environmental benefits. Although there is some evidence that it is possible to lower emission rates from agricultural activity without reducing livestock numbers (for example, by use of nitrogen inhibitors in fertiliser application, or by feed management in growing cattle), measurement of emissions from a specific agricultural activity (for example, by individual livestock) is currently not achievable. 35 The aim of any domestic policy decisions regarding agriculture (and indeed any sector subject to emissions reduction initiatives) should be to minimise the total long-run cost of meeting New Zealand’s climate change commitments in a global context, including the cost of fulfilling any obligations arising from failure to meet these commitments. Ensuring that the benefits are greater than the costs, even if the costs seem very large and global in scale, is a core part of public policy. Benefits, however, are not just financial, nor are costs. Matters like international reputation, support for rules-based global solutions for global problems and burden-sharing between developed and developing countries are all important, but are unlikely to determine optimal domestic policies. This objective captures the relatively simple point that the lowest cost means of meeting the climate change target should be adopted. Although this is a simple point, it is not necessarily one that is easy to achieve. The reality is that it may prove cheaper to pay emitters in another country to reduce emissions rather than to achieve any reduction within New Zealand. This is not a failure of policy. All emissions regardless of where in the world they are emitted will become part of the global atmosphere and thus make the same contribution to climate change as any other emissions. 36 All costs should be considered when designing policy, for example, a balance should be sought between the benefit of including all emitters in any scheme, and the cost of monitoring individuals who have only a small effect on overall emissions. In most cases, the initial entity on whom the costs fall will not be the party who eventually pays, as the costs are diffused through the economy. The exception is where entities are exposed to international competition. In this case, they are unlikely to be able to increase prices to reflect the cost of climate change mitigation policy (unless the policy is international). This means that the party that receives the benefit of the emission (the consumer) does not also bear the cost of the emission. As much of New Zealand’s agricultural production is destined for export markets where it is a price-taker, there are clear risks to competitiveness if New Zealand imposes commitments on agriculture when other countries have not. The design and effect of the free-allocation system that the Government has proposed will therefore be very important for determining the outcome of extending the scheme. 35 Kerr (2016) and Hollis et al. (2016). 36 However, the process of international carbon trading has been controversial and the New Zealand Government decided in 2015 to limit the ETS to domestic market. NZIER report -Taxing times 15 The compliance and administration costs of the NZ ETS will depend very much on how the scheme is extended to cover livestock emissions, including key issues like point of obligation, and there is still a lot of policy uncertainty over the how the scheme will work in practice. For example, if the obligation to surrender units is applied at the processor level (the current default in the legislation), then providing individual farms with an incentive to reduce emissions without reducing stock numbers will be dependent on how the economic impact of the scheme is passed down the production chain. 37 In a major report to Business New Zealand in 2007, when plans for the NZ ETS were in their infancy, NZIER set out a series of pre-conditions that would need to be met before establishing such a scheme would be justified. 38 While much has transpired since, those pre-conditions remain relevant to considering the question of whether agriculture should be included within the NZ ETS. At the international level, the pre-conditions we proposed were: • Acceptance that climate change presents a sufficient risk, albeit one with uncertainty, for it to be prudent to take action now to reduce the probability of significantly larger damage and costs later; • Understanding of the potential for significant amelioration of climate change through reductions of emissions from human activities; • International commitments to reduce emissions with an internationally agreed means of counting net emissions; and • New Zealand and international agreement among a significant number of countries on emissions reduction targets. These conditions now seem to have been largely met, particularly following the Paris Accord. At the domestic level, the pre-conditions we proposed were: • An accurate and comprehensive emissions monitoring and reporting system, for measuring performance relative to targets and reconciling abatement with allowances and credits; • The conditions required for a market to operate – a clearly and specifically defined tradable unit, transferability of units and enforcement of transfer, sufficient numbers of competitive buyers and sellers, institutions and infrastructure for trade and exchange, and reasonable transaction costs; • Established accounting, financial reporting and tax rules for participants in the ETS to use; • Sufficient economic efficiency benefits from trading to outweigh the costs of establishing and operating an ETS; • Public and social consensus that emissions trading will deliver the intended policy outcomes such as controlling emissions, without significant 37 If processors add a charge per head for animals processed at an abattoir or per kilo of milk solids in the case of dairy farming, then the economic impact on farmers would be invariant to the amount of effort applied to reduce emissions at the level of individual animals. 38 Branson et al. (2007). NZIER report -Taxing times 16 unintended side-effects. This will require there to have been a thorough economic analysis of the potential impacts of any ETS for New Zealand; and • Sufficient public and social consensus on the need for moving towards emissions trading to ensure durability and avoid disruptive policy reversals that undermine the value of investments and confidence in the system. Experience with the NZ ETS to date means that there is now more evidence available regarding whether these pre-conditions can be met than there was in 2007. We note that Federated Farmers and other sector groups have been active in continuing to engage with the Government on these issues, for example in its submission to the last review of the NZ ETS. 39 Despite its conceptual appeal, applying the NZ ETS to biologically-based emissions would still be a world-first and the case for doing so is yet to be made. The above list of pre-conditions remains, in our view, an appropriate starting point for further official consideration of this matter. 39 We note that in addition to Federated Farmers also made a submission to the Productivity Commission’s inquiry into a low emissions economy. Federated, Horticulture NZ, Beef+Lamb NZ, and Dairy NZ are all members (along with some other agricultural sector groups and the Ministry of Primary Industries) of the Biological Emissions Reference Group (or BERG) which has been working over to jointly build an agreed evidence-base on current and future opportunities to mitigate biological (methane and nitrous oxide) greenhouse gas emissions on-farm and the costs and opportunities and barriers of doing so.

NZIER report -Taxing times 19 Appendix A Detailed proposals This appendix outlines the details of the taxes studied in the main body of this report. A.1 Labour policy A.1.1 Freshwater royalty In its manifesto, the Labour Party proposed a “freshwater royalty”, that would be applied to “large commercial users”, including water bottlers, irrigators and other industrial users. The stated purpose of the royalty was to “encourage the best and most efficient use of freshwater”. Some features that were to apply were: • The royalty would be set on a per cubic metre basis • Different rates would apply in different regions, and different uses would also attract different rates • A premium would be charged on the taking of pristine water suitable for bottling • Details of the scheme would be developed by experts, including the Treasury, with input from users, councils and other stakeholders. A.1.2 Climate change The Labour Party committed to setting a target of net zero for greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, with legally binding emissions reduction targets, and carbon budgets to keep New Zealand on track to this goal. It also promised to establish an independent Climate Commission to recommend interim emissions reduction targets and provide advice on the ramifications of not achieving them. A Climate Commission has independently been recommended by the New Zealand Parliamentary Commission for the Environment, based on the model of the UK Climate Change Act. 40 A.1.3 Emissions trading In its environmental manifesto, the Labour Party proposed that it would reform the NZ ETS so it puts a price on carbon that drives behaviour change away from carbon- polluting goods and services towards low or zero-carbon options. As part of these reforms, the Labour Party announced that it would not allow the importation of international units until “it is clear that they have environmental integrity, are from a reputable source and a mature international market, and are realistically priced; and for the foreseeable future will manage access to any such units through direct acquisition by the Government”. More generally, it proposed that at least 50% of all units surrendered to meet obligations under the NZ ETS would need to be NZUs issued by the New Zealand Government. 40 Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment (2017). NZIER report -Taxing times 20 It also proposed to bring agriculture into the NZ ETS in its first term with a free allocation of 90%. 41 A.2 Green Party policy A.2.1 Nitrate tax In its policy paper, Clean Water, Great Farming, the Green Party proposed to implement a nitrate pollution levy, calculated using the nutrient management tool OVERSEER, to incentivise farmers to pollute less. For an initial period of three years, the levy would only apply to dairy farmers. Over an unspecified timeframe, the Green Party said that the levy would be extended to include beef and sheep farming, other agriculture, horticulture, and other sources of nitrogen pollution. The levy would be set at a rate of $2 per kilogram of nitrate leached per hectare per year. The levy would be collected from dairy processors, not individual farmers. The revenue (estimated by the Greens at $136.5 million), would be used to fund sustainable farming programmes and the clean-up of waterways. A.2.2 Replacing NZ ETS in favour of carbon charges The Green Party’s Climate Protect Plan proposes replacing the NZ ETS with a “Kiwi Climate Fund”. The fund will be a combination of a tax of carbon emissions, a bounty on carbon absorption by forests and a universal payment system to recycle revenue to adult New Zealand citizens and residents. While an independent Climate Commission will advise on rates of any taxes, the Green Party expects prices at the following levels to be indicative of what would be set in 2020: • $40 per tonne of carbon dioxide emissions (excluding biological emissions); • $6 per tonne of nitrous oxide emissions from agriculture; and • $3 per tonne of methane emissions from agriculture. The policy states that levels of taxes would rise over time “in line with the necessity of reaching net zero emissions by 2050”. Foresters would receive a “guaranteed minimum payment” for every tonne of carbon dioxide sequestered. This would “initially” be set at the same rate that applies to emission, i.e. $40 per tonne. A.3 New Zealand First New Zealand First proposed to repeal the NZ ETS and replace it with a UK/Norway- style Climate Change Act and to establish a new Parliamentary Commission for Climate Change as an Office of Parliament. The Parliamentary Commissioner would be responsible for reporting against both the Kyoto and Paris Accord by setting a three- 41 Under transitional provisions in the NZ ETS, when trade-exposed sectors become covered by the scheme, emitters are given a free allocation of emission units, based on emission levels in the past. NZIER report -Taxing times 21 yearly ‘Carbon Budget’ designed to reach these commitments (first Budget to become operative in 2021). Resources previously devoted to the NZ ETS would be applied to research and development and climate change adaptation. The Parliamentary Commissioner would also provide independent advice to central and local government on meeting the Carbon Budget and preparing for climate change. A.4 The Government’s agenda The new Government’s policy programme is based on a coalition agreement between the Labour Party and New Zealand First and an agreement on confidence and supply between the Labour Party and the Green Party. A.4.1 Labour Party and New Zealand First coalition agreement Specific tax and related provisions directed at the primary sector in the coalition agreement are: • Introduce a royalty on exports of bottled water • No resource rentals for water in this term (2017 to 2020) of Parliament • Introduce a Zero Carbon Act and an independent Climate Commission, based on the recommendations of the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment • If the Climate Commission determines that agriculture is to be included in the NZ ETS, then upon entry, the free allocation to agriculture will be 95% but with all revenues from this source recycled back into agriculture in order to encourage agricultural innovation, mitigation and additional planting of forestry. 42 A.4.2 Labour Party and Green Party confidence and supply agreement The agreement between Labour and the Green Party includes the following matters: • Adopt and make progress towards the goal of a Net Zero Emissions Economy by 2050, with a particular focus on policy development and initiatives in transport and urban form, energy and primary industries in accordance with milestones to be set by an independent Climate Commission and with a focus on establishing Just Transitions for exposed regions and industries • Introduce a Zero Carbon Act and establish an independent Climate Commission • All new legislation will have a climate impact assessment analysis • A comprehensive set of environmental, social and economic sustainability indicators will be developed 42 Note that the Labour Party’s proposal of 90% free-allocation has been increased to 95% and there is now a proposal to recycle “revenues” from the agricultural sector. It is unclear what this relates to, as the ETS operates by way of units, not money. NZIER report -Taxing times 22 • A new cross-agency climate change board of public sector CEOs will be established. A.4.3 Climate change Under the Paris Agreement, New Zealand has committed to reduce its emissions to 30% below 2005 levels by 2030, and under the Climate Change Response Act 2002, has committed to reduce its emissions to 50% below 1990 levels by 2050. The new Government has stated its intention to adopt and make progress towards the goal of a net zero emissions economy by 2050, with a particular focus on policy development and initiatives in transport and urban form, energy and primary industries. It will establish a Climate Commission to provide independent advice and, in particular, to consider whether and how agriculture should be included within the NZ ETS. Some details of the Government’s proposed action plan are contained in a Cabinet Paper from the Minister for Climate Change considered by the Cabinet on 17 December 2017. 43 In that paper, the Minister acknowledged the transition to lower emissions will be challenging and will require a fundamental economic shift, saying: 26. New Zealand has an existing 2030 target (our Paris Agreement contribution). This commits us to a reduction in emissions to 11% below 1990 levels by 2030 (30% below 2005 levels). 27.Based on current estimates, approximately 193 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO 2 e) abatement (ie reduce emissions, absorb through forests or buy international emissions reductions) is required over the 2021-2030 period to meet this target. Achieving the 2030 target will require significant action across multiple sectors of the economy, particularly if the target is primarily to be met by domestic efforts. For example, the forecast abatement from forestry would only mitigate approximately 18 MtCO 2 e across the 2021-2030 period (I understand that the proposed Billion Trees Planting Programme could lead to between 10 and 30 MtCO 2 e of additional carbon dioxide being stored). 28. Taking bolder action on climate change will require further investment, policy intervention, social adjustment, and economic transformation. This could include moving towards 100 per cent renewable electricity generation, with: fossil fuel generation only called upon in years of hydroelectric electricity generation shortages; the electrification of low grade industrial heat sources; and a shift to mostly electric vehicles with more domestic freight carried by rail. New methane inhibitors and techniques to reduce biological emissions would also need to be developed, and we will 43 See: http://www.mfe.govt.nz/more/cabinet-papers-and-related-material-search/cabinet-papers/100-day-plan-climate- change NZIER report -Taxing times 23 need changes in land use, including substantial afforestation.

Thank you for the opportunity to provide a submission to inform the Tax Working Group’s review of New Zealand’s tax system. 2. The Health Promotion Agency (HPA) is a Crown entity that reports to the Minister of Health. It has statutory functions to lead and support activities to:  promote health and wellbeing and encourage healthy lifestyles;  prevent disease, illness and injury;  enable environments which support health, wellbeing and healthy lifestyles; and  reduce personal, social and economic harm. 3. HPA also has alcohol-specific functions to give advice and make recommendations on the sale, supply, consumption, misuse of alcohol, and undertake, or work with others to undertake, research on alcohol issues. HPA’s alcohol work is funded from the levy on alcohol produced or imported for sale in New Zealand. This levy was previously paid to HPA’s predecessor organisation, the Alcohol Advisory Council of New Zealand. 4. This submission focusses primarily on alcohol-related tax issues, in line with HPA’s independent Crown Entity status to provide advice related to its alcohol-specific functions. Summary of HPA recommendations Excise tax on alcohol  HPA supports the continuation of an excise tax on alcoholic beverages.  HPA supports an increase in the level of excise tax on alcoholic beverages to achieve a minimum price per standard drink of $1 or more.  HPA supports a review of the classes of liquor used to calculate excise tax, and of the excise tax rates for those classes, aimed at encouraging increased production and consumption of low-alcohol beverages. 3 TAXES ON ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES 5. Taxation of alcohol beverages is used internationally by governments to reduce rates of harm from alcohol. In New Zealand, taxes (excise tax and the alcohol levy) are used as a means to control price and affordability of alcoholic beverages, with an aim of modifying alcohol drinking behaviour and to fund activities to prevent and reduce alcohol-related harm. RATIONALE REGARDING EXCISE TAX ON ALCOHOL 6. The use of taxation to increase the price of alcoholic beverages is one of the most evidence-based and internationally well-accepted strategies to reduce alcohol-related harm. The rationale is that increasing the price reduces consumer demand for alcohol. While the relationship between price and drinking is complex, research conducted in many parts of the world has demonstrated that increased alcohol taxes and prices are related to reductions in alcohol use and related problems 1 . 7. While excise tax on alcoholic beverages continues to be an effective harm-reduction strategy, changes to the alcohol market in recent years have eroded its effectiveness. The full cost of increases in excise tax through Consumer Price Index adjustments is not always passed on to consumers, the cost instead being partially absorbed by producers. 8. An increase in the level of excise tax to achieve a minimum price per standard drink of alcohol to $1 or more would reduce the affordability of the cheapest alcohol, which contributes to disproportionate levels of harm in young people aged 18 to 24 and other heavy drinkers. Research on alcohol pricing 9. The Ministry of Justice (in conjunction with The Treasury and contractors) undertook an investigation of the effectiveness of a minimum price regime in reducing harmful alcohol consumption and in 2014 published the research report The Effectiveness of Alcohol 1 Babor, T., Caetano, R., Casswell, S., Edwards, G., Giesbrecht, N., Graham, K., Rossow., I. (2010) Alcohol: No Ordinary Commodity research and public policy, second edition. New York: Oxford University Press: Summary of HPA recommendations continued The alcohol levy  HPA supports the continuation of the levy on alcoholic beverages, which is used by HPA to reduce alcohol-related harm.  HPA supports a review of the bands within the classes of liquor that are used to calculate the alcohol levy. 4 Pricing Policies, Reducing harmful alcohol consumption and alcohol-related harm 2 . Pricing options considered were no change, minimum price per standard drink of $1.00, $1.10 or $1.20, and excise tax increases of 82%, 107% or 133%. The effect of the price increase options on the annual volume of alcohol purchased and per occasion alcohol purchased by drinker type were considered. 10. The research concluded that all pricing options are effective in generating positive savings for society. Excise increases up to 133% (which affects the price of all alcohol) result in a much larger benefits compared with a minimum price (which only affects the price of the cheapest alcohol). Excise increases also provide more funding for government efforts to reduce alcohol harm, where minimum pricing can benefit the alcohol industry. Both are important tools in any package of measures aimed at reducing alcohol-related harm. 11. Increasing the price of alcoholic beverages is likely to have an impact on reducing short and long-term harms experienced by heavy drinkers of all ages. Higher prices help to reduce the incidence of heavy drinking sessions and subsequent intoxication and its effects and impact on the drinker and on others. Young people 12. Raising the price of cheap alcohol is an important tool for reducing young peoples’ alcohol consumption. Young people aged 18 to 24 are the heaviest drinking age group by far, characterised by drinking more heavily per occasion in social settings than other groups 3 . 13. Young people are more ‘price elastic’ (that is, an increase in price is more likely to result in reduced consumption of alcohol) than other population groups. Availability of cheap alcoholic beverages, in particular higher strength options, are known to facilitate heavy drinking sessions, including pre-loading. Young people also experience the highest rates of acute alcohol-related harms, such as injuries and death from traffic injuries 4 . Alcohol affordability over time 14. Alcohol beverages have become more affordable in New Zealand over the last few decades, due to incomes increasing more than the price of the beverages. In its issues paper Alcohol in our Lives: An issues paper on the reform of New Zealand’s liquor laws 5 , the Law Commission stated that overall alcohol has become more affordable since 1989. Of all beverage types, wine has seen the greatest increase in affordability. 2 Ministry of Justice.

Wellington: Law Commission. 5 15. The Law Commission’s findings are reflected in HPA’s recently released report Trends in affordability of alcohol in New Zealand 6 . Key findings from HPA’s report are that:  The real price (inflation-adjusted price) of wine was found to decrease from the late 1980s until 2017. Although the real price of beer and spirits and liqueurs increased from the 1980s, incomes have been increasing at a faster rate, making alcohol overall more affordable.  Since 2012, the affordability of wine (which is the price of wine relative to income) increased by more than 20%, based on average hourly earnings and average alcohol prices.  In 2017, it took as little as 2.1 minutes of work for a person on a median income (an ‘average’ worker) to earn enough money to buy one standard drink (containing 10g of pure alcohol) of averagely priced cask wine purchased from a supermarket or liquor store. It took only 1.6 minutes to buy a discounted standard drink of cask wine (based on the cheapest advertised prices).  It takes less time to earn enough to buy an averagely priced standard drink of beer, whisky or cask wine from off-licensed premises (supermarket or liquor store) now than in 1999. Excise tax on low-alcohol beverages 16. Excise tax can also be used to encourage production, and therefore consumption, of low- alcohol beverages. The rationale is that reduced or eliminated excise tax for low-alcohol beverages stimulates supply, and the lower cost encourages demand. This would lead to increased consumption of these beverages in place of higher alcohol beverages. In the long-term, it would be beneficial by helping to facilitate more low-alcohol choices, and could lead to changes in people’s drinking habits and ultimately reduced alcohol-related harm. RATIONALE REGARDING THE ALCOHOL LEVY 17. HPA receives the levy on alcohol produced or imported for sale in New Zealand and uses it to fund activities to prevent and reduce alcohol-related harm. This levy is adjusted annually and rates and amounts collected vary depending on six class of liquor (bands of alcohol content). Each class of alcohol includes different beverages (eg, beer, wine, spirits, cider, and liqueurs). 18. The availability and consumption of different types of alcohol beverages and the range of alcohol by volume within a beverage type changes over time. Regular review of the bands used for excise tax and the alcohol levy would help to keep up with market changes and also encourage low-alcohol beverage production and consumption. 6 Health Promotion Agency.

Tax Working Group Public Submissions Information Release Release Document September 2018 taxworkingroup.govt.nz/key-documents Key to sections of the Official Information Act 1982 under which information has been withheld. Certain information in this document has been withheld under one or more of the following sections of the Official Information Act, as applicable: \[1\] 9(2)(a) - to protect the privacy of natural persons, including deceased people; \[2\] 9(2)(k) - to prevent the disclosure of official information for improper gain or improper advantage. Where information has been withheld, a numbered reference to the applicable section of the Official Information Act has been made, as listed above. For example, a \[1\] appearing where information has been withheld in a release document refers to section 9(2)(a). In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. 30 April 2018 The Tax Working Group Secretariat PO Box 3724 Wellington 6140 submissions@taxworkinggroup.govt.nz This submission is made on behalf of the InterChurch Bureau ((ICB), formerly the InterChurch Working Party on Taxation). The ICB (the Churches) represents some 35 Christian denominations and entities in New Zealand. Combined, the Churches make up roughly one-third of the charitable sector and are therefore one of its largest groupings. A detailed list of members is set out in Appendix 1. The Churches of New Zealand hold charitable status under the centuries-long recognised head of charity, ‘the advancement of religion’. Church welfare organisations operate first and foremost as charitable organisations, not as business operators. Working in partnership with Government, they supplement and complement state benevolent activity and social provision. Faith-based organisations are highly efficient at delivering social service ‘goods’. Many socially important agencies such as city missions, schools, hospitals and retirement/rest home facilities were first established and continue to be run by faith-based organisations. As Churches operate at grass roots level in the community, they have the ability to be flexible and responsive to changing needs. Charity law is based on the premise that the overall purposes of the state and charity are the same: in the public interest. Social services work is an interrelated outcome of the Church’s core faith with the provision of care and advocacy simply Christianity in action. Faith communities are heavily involved in the provision of an extensive range of social benefit activities. Activities undertaken by the Churches include: abuse and addiction counselling, anger management courses, help-lines, budgeting services, disaster relief, educational scholarships, employment training, food banks, help with furniture and clothing provision, grief counselling, hospital visiting, meals in homes, prison visiting, soup kitchens, help with housing, student mentoring and support and training for the unemployed, to name a few. Throughout the country the Churches also provide an efficiently run, low-cost network of facilities available for a wide range of community activities. These facilities have been generally provided and maintained by volunteers, with no reliance on public/government funding. Charitable business enterprise is not about making profits. Defining ‘business’ or ‘trading operations’ is problematic as Church ‘trading operations’ are generally directly aligned to the charitable purposes of the organisation with any small surpluses going back into supporting its charitable and social provision activities. Such enterprises not only provide employment for those in need, but also education and training. Giving people employable skills and work experience is a social benefit which helps individuals to find their feet again and enables money to go back into charitable purposes for \[1\] the further betterment of society. There is no evidence that non-profit organisations hold any competitive advantage. They are generally constrained by the terms of their charitable trusts deeds, lack access to shareholder capital and are under pressure to distribute a higher proportion of funds back to their charity than would a private enterprise. Activities such as thrift shops providing second hand goods or companies producing basic breakfast cereals and spreads are no different to the provision of social services through Government contract. In each case, any profits are generally applied directly to further support charitable works. Charitable action and religious giving is a practical expression of faith, with the work of all charities heavily dependent on gifts and donations freely given. Churches in New Zealand do not hold great wealth in trusts and investments. As the 2007 Statistics NZ report on Non-Profit institutions found: Religious activity relies heavily on the donations and bequest of individuals. Seventy- one percent of all income is in the form of donations compared with 24 percent for all non-profit institutions. These donations come almost exclusively from households. While the income of charities is often limited and their resources scarce, this is generally offset by the significant input of volunteers. Those who work for the Church as employees or volunteers are generally highly committed and motivated. Many volunteers gain and develop significant work place experience and independent skills which can often be transferred to the public sector. Recent societal change has led to a greater proportion of people in the workforce, with an increasing number working beyond the expected age of retirement. This has meant fewer volunteers able to contribute their time, but remaining in paid employment means they are able to participate in charitable support through financial assistance. The ICB considers that it is of benefit to both the Government and taxpayers to encourage philanthropy and that it is reasonable for society to award recognition to those who demonstrate generosity. The 1989 Working Party on Charities and Sporting Bodies Report to the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Social Welfare concluded that to abolish the donation tax rebate would have the adverse effect of diminishing donations and indeed recommended the value of the rebate be increased and protected (Pp.5-53). The Income Tax Act 2007, which enacted the current donations rebate system, has helped encouraged a public spirit of generosity and empathy and has proved be a direct and successful incentive for individual taxpayers to donate to charities and be more aware and considerate of the needs of others. The Churches greatly value the current taxation concessions for charities. Any perceived ‘cost’ to the taxpayer is significantly offset by the ‘good’ that the current system provides, as it enables charities to provide public benefits and services that the market economy often fails to adequately supply.

Submission to the New Zealand Government Tax Working Group April 2018 Submitter: Income Equality Aotearoa New Zealand Inc –Closing the Gap Peter Malcolm National Secretary We wish to speak to the submission This submission is from the Income Equality Aotearoa New Zealand Inc which is concerned about the high and damaging levels of income and wealth inequality, and poverty in New Zealand This submission is in six parts Basic Submission Appendix 1 Answers to questions asked by the Tax Working Group Appendix 2 More details on a fair, socially just tax system for New Zealand Appendix 3 Some ideas for tax systems Appendix 4 Some comments about tax Appendix 5 List of research and reference material. \[1\] Our Basic Submission Who we are and why are we doing this: We are Income Equality Aotearoa New Zealand Inc –Closing the Gap. We have some 3000 supporters from around the country. Research clearly shows that significant inequality is bad for any country in terms of health, economics and many other social issues, and that inequality is much worse in New Zealand that it was some 30 years ago. The tax system has a significant effect on inequality and so our system should be modified to help reduce inequality in New Zealand. Also the current system is unfair and inconsistent ( not all income is taxed, very low incomes are taxed, capital gains taxes are minimal and there no inheritance taxes ) Overall we believe that it is possible for all New Zealanders to enjoy a decent life, one where everyone thrives. In particular every kid deserves a good start. But we recognise that big imbalances of income and wealth have been deeply destructive, and make the ideal above very difficult to achieve Our vision for New Zealand: A tax structure which incorporates all incomes, wealth, individuals and businesses, is socially responsible, is fair to all, helps us ensure a quality life for all, now and in the future, and is a major influence on helping to reduce inequality. A tax system which is promoted as, and recognized as, a positive contribution to public good. It is the price we pay for a civilized society. It is our belief that the system should provide a higher overall tax take for Government which, together with more generous welfare and income support payments enables all to live decent lives. See appendix 2 re increased tax take and welfare Our basic submission: we need a tax system that . • is significantly more progressive than as at present ie with higher taxes for very high incomes and lower or no taxes for those on low incomes • taxes wealth, either annually and/or when assets are sold, probably through a universal capital gains tax • provides a higher overall tax take for Government see appendix 2 Preamble no. 4 • together with more generous welfare and income support payments enables all to live decent lives. See appendix 2 re welfare Preamble no.5 Appendix 1 Questions Asked by the Tax Working Group 1. What Does the Future of Tax Look like to you? (A)Tax is the price we pay for civilisation. Therefore it will always be important. Governments need to tax to: 1) have enough money to provide services eg education, health etc 2) have enough money for redistribution of income/wealth to a. ensure all can live decent lives b. reduce inequality 3) discourage/encourage certain behaviours, personal, for example smoking, and environmental, for example recycling and conservation (B) Sources of Tax. 1)Because of our rapidly changing world and the interests of fairness, equity and ability to pay, the source of taxation must be as broad/wide as possible. This also ensures that in the light of changing circumstances the tax system can be adjusted without significant disruption. Tax should be paid on ALL income or financial benefits accruing to an individual or organisation including capital gain. We recognise that this includes tax on the capital gain on the family home. While this is excluded through the terms of reference, we believe that the final report should include comments about this. As this stands it does provide a loophole that can be exploited and will not help in making housing affordable. There could be exclusions or exceptions in terms of how such a tax might be levied to make this more politically palatable. It is noted that overseas where the family home is subject to CGT then there are various mechanisms to alleviate that tax, such as reduced rates, tax free allowance, exceptions where the proceeds of sale are offset against any new home purchased and only the net gain is taxed 2)Things that can be targeted by authorities to promote or curb the use of. See 1(A) 3 above. (C)Who Pays and How the tax is paid: Who Pays: • all over 16 • we believe that everyone should furnish a return so that all income regardless of source is included ie superannuation, benefits, capital gain, gifts, inheritances. This also reinforces the importance of the tax system in terms of a decent life for all. 2.What is the purpose of tax? See above 1(A) and To significantly reduce income and wealth inequality. To have an impact on the price of housing. To pay for Govt services, and encourage/discourage some activities. See 1(A)3 above 3.Are we taxing the right things? Yes but you need to expand the net significantly to include ALL income regardless of source for individuals and organisations 4.Can tax make housing more affordable? Yes. Apart from renting, the taxation system must discourage people from using housing as an investment. Housing should simply be there to provide accommodation and people should be encouraged to use other avenues for investment opportunities. This is also one of the reasons why capital gains tax in some form should be levied on the family home. 5.What tax issues matter most to you? Reducing inequality in both income and wealth Reducing accommodation costs—the cost buying “homes”, and reduce the cost of renting Looking after the environment—flora, fauna, water, climate change in particular Getting rid of poverty. Producing sufficient income for the Government to properly provide services for all—see Appendix 2 Preamble no. 4 Appendix 2. More details on a fair, socially just tax system for New Zealand PREAMBLE 1. Income and wealth inequality in Aotearoa New Zealand have grown significantly since the mid 1980s. In 2017 the richest one percent gained 28% of new wealth while the poorest 30% got just one percent. Over the last 30 years the ratio of the average top 10% to the bottom 10% has gone from 5 to 1 to 8 or 9 to 1; for the workforce. as a whole the increase is 3.7% NZ could aim to reduce economic inequality to the level enjoyed by countries, such as Denmark, where the richest tenth have an average income five times that of the poorest tenth, the level NZ had in the early-1980s. Currently in New Zealand that ratio is nine to one 2. The current low progressivity of our tax system contributes badly to this present situation Income Times Living Wage Tax After Tax income Income per week % tax 42,000 1.00 9,000 33,000 635 21.43% 210,000 5.00 60,220 149,780 2,880 28.68% 420,000 10.00 129,520 290,480 5,586 30.84% 630,000 15.00 198,820 431,180 8,292 31.56% This shows the lack of progressivity in our present tax scales. No one pays more than 32% of their income in tax. Income tax increases most rapidly around $70,000 when the maximum marginal rate cuts in. Now the current tax rates: 0 to 14,000 10.5% 14,001 to 48,000 17.5% 48,001 to 70,000 30.0% Over 70,000 33.0% Someone earning twice the living wage--$84,000 is paying the same marginal rate of income tax as someone earning $2 million or more. That does not seem fair or progressive. Aotearoa New Zealand ranks 115 out of 152 countries in the progressivity of its tax policies (Nigeria is at 114) and 30 out of 35 OECD countries. 3. Government tax structures should have two major purposes: to provide sufficient funds for Government services and infrastructure, and to control inequality by carrying out a redistributive function of resources to ensure all can be part of a fair and properly functioning society 4. Government services are the framework for a civilised country and to have these services freely available to all helps significantly to reduce inequality. There is considerable evidence that current government funding for essential services such as health, mental health, education, and welfare is not adequate to meet the needs of our communities. Compared with OECD countries we are a low tax country. 30% of our GDP is from taxation compared with Scandinavian countries at 40% or above. We have very little tax on wealth and we tax high incomes lightly 5. The way the welfare and tax systems interact has a big impact on low and middle income households. The current levels of income support such as Working for Families, Accommodation Supplement and other welfare benefits are insufficient for individuals and families to live decent lives, and further, the way these are reduced as people’s income increases is very unfair. It means that many people on very modest incomes can lose most of the extra income earned through increased tax rates and/or reduced income support. 6. If inequality is reduced it will have a significant beneficial effect on poverty--another serious issue in our country Key data from the 2016 Child Poverty Monitor • 14% of children are living in material hardship. That means 155,000 New Zealand children are in households that are living without 7 or more items, from a total list of 17 items which are considered necessary for their wellbeing • 8% (or 85,000) of NZ children are experiencing even worse material hardship with households missing out on 9 or more items from the list of 17. This is a new measure for the Child Poverty Monitor following its introduction to government reporting • 28% of children are living in low income homes. That means 295,000 New Zealand children are in homes where money is tight and are considered to be in income poverty. • More than 8% of children are in severe poverty. That means 90,000 New Zealand children are experiencing both material hardship and living in a low income household • While child poverty has been reasonably stable for a number of years, it is significantly worse than the 1980s now. In 1982 the percentage of children in families experiencing income poverty was 14%, compared to 28% now. What we believe should be introduced into our Tax System 1. The Principles under-pinning the economics of our society should • be fair to all • be beneficial to all • look after the disadvantaged • reduce inequality • recognise the importance of individuals, families and children • recognise the economic imperatives for New Zealand • recognise the importance of all communities in our country • look after our environment both natural and “built up” • have all New Zealanders accept the need for taxes and their responsibility to pay their dues ie taxation is not theft This could be used as a “Check-list” against which any tax system could be evaluated 2. Why Tax Taxation is the subscription that we all pay, for us all to enjoy the benefits of living as a member of a fair and properly functioning society. The overall tax levels must enough so the things that Government provides that affect people most are sufficient for all to live decently and reasonably, ie health, education, justice, welfare and superannuation. Tax structures do have an affect on inequality and inequality is currently too great in New Zealand. and is consequently a serious problem for us all. 3. Amount of Taxation accrued by Government. Although it would appear that the Government does not seem interested in raising the current level we would suggest that the final report from the Tax Working Group should include comments about this to at least provoke public debate and political action. We believe that there are a number of Government provided services which are severely underfunded such as health, education, welfare, justice and this has a significant impact on the poor and inequality and the economy. See 4 in the preamble above. There has been a prevailing opinion in many western governments in the last 40 years that an undue percentage of GDP in the hands of government will inhibit economic performance and that everyone, rich and poor will be worse off. That has been the prevailing mantra in New Zealand. There is an increasing body of evidence from leading economists and the examples of other countries, see 4 in the preamble above, which demonstrates that a higher tax rates will not damage the economy or individual initiative. To increase the total tax take does not necessarily impact on the low or middle income groups. 4. Who pays the Tax: All according to their ability to pay and there must be systems in place to ensure that all, including foreign owned businesses that make profits in New Zealand, pay the tax they owe. NB. There are many stories around the supposed damage that higher taxes accrue and most of them are myths. 5. What should/could be Taxed: • All income ---wages/salaries/transfers/benefits/superannuation/income from trust ---“rents’ on property, money etc ---any realised capital gain (after costs/inflation adjustments) ---gifts above a given figure each year ---inheritances above a certain figure • “negative externalities” tobacco, alcohol ie things that are perceived a negative effect on society • Wealth see appendix 3 • Land, all natural resources ie the Georgian “Land Value” tax and other natural resources such as water • Business • Financial transactions if agreed internationally • Trusts including Registered Charitable Trusts. There are large commercial organisations that are operating as Charitable Trusts, gaining cash flow advantages compared with their taxable equivalent organisations allowing them to expand their operations unfairly. Profits retained in the ongoing operations should be taxed at normal rates. • Realistic levels of income for overseas companies making profits in New Zealand We have some real concerns about “consumption” taxes or levies ie GST, fuel, etc. They are all regressive, have most impact on the poor and as a consequence increase inequality Further Views on Future Taxation not Mentioned Elsewhere Tax Scales Indexed to inflation/CPI. This seems a sensible move which would avoid the problems associated with so-called “tax boundary creep” GST on Food • Our current GST system is very simple. What are the implications of removing GST on food items? This must be reasonably easy to determine from experiences overseas. If it would make the collection complex and expensive for businesses/tax authorities then those costs should be compared to the cost of increasing the beneficiary/superannuation (Transfer) payments. With the move towards the Living Wage (which might practically coincide with the introduction of any new tax system) then the costs to the lower income wage groups would be automatically catered for. Remove the tax on food only if there is a proven overall net benefit. Also see above on consumption taxes. GST on Imports • GST on imports should be lowered to all imports over $40, to avoid discrimination against local retailers. Capital Gains Tax • There should be a broad based capital gains tax on profits of all assets sold (or disposed of) after an allowance for inflation. There should be a minimum taxable level set. Capital losses to be offset against current or future CGT profits – not other income. Profits should be taxed at income tax rates It should include the family home (though it is noted that this is outside your brief - but should be commented on in your final report see appendix 2). Harmful activities • There should be a tax on sugar and its substitutes where those substitutes are known to be harmful. • Similar taxes should be introduced where recommended by health professionals to avoid societal health costs. • Environmental harmful activity (listed by central Government) should be taxed/fined/controlled (rules set by central Government) by the relevant Regional Local Authority. Central government should also be responsible for implementing recycling levies/schemes at the point of importation/manufacture for items such as electronic goods/tyres/plastics/glassware etc. Superannuation • Should be taxed where other income exceeds a set amount (say $60,000--indexed) to be fully offset (at say $100,000). Ie the superannuation is paid gross and then added to all other income for tax purposes Land and other Natural Resource • Land, and other natural resources such as water could be taxed. • There is a land-value windfall tax which is a tax placed on a gain in the capital value of land that results from the actions of central or local government. For example, a Council rezones ‘rural’ land to ‘residential’ thereby increasing the capital value by 900% - say from $1,000,000 to $10,000,000. The gain of $9,000,000 should be taxable. Another is Central government builds a motorway resulting in an increase in land value near access points or central government and local government jointly fund a light rail system resulting in an increase in land values along the corridor. . Appendix 3 Some more specific details required for a better tax system for all A More steeply progressive tax system for New Zealand is essential if we are to reduce income inequality Here is an example of a fairer more progressive tax system.

Taxation on Families Some possibilities 1. Families---add all incomes together, then split into separate incomes according to the number of members in the immediate family (one for each adult and a half for each child under 16) and then tax each unit as individuals as per above Eg A 2 adults and 2 children family with a total income of $60000 is treated as 4 incomes of $20000, $20000, $10000 and $10000 and taxed accordingly 1 adult and 2 children family would be treated the same 2 adults and 3 children would treated as 5 incomes of approximately $17000, $17000 and 3 of $8500Ie no tax on any of these example NB the net income for families 2 adults 2 kids with one and a half FT jobs at the living wage is about $60000 per year ie no tax to be paid 2. Many would argue that because in this day and age the concept of “families” is very difficult to define , a better approach might be to treat everybody (over 16) for tax purposes as individuals and have a significant UBI (at least $80 per week) for all under the age of 16. Taxation on Individuals Add ALL cash income ( not assets --assets should be taxed when realized) from all sources including transfers. Some sources may have to contribute only a percentage eg capital gain, inheritance income and spread over a number of years The alternative would be different tax rates for capital income, but this would be more complex than above. One off incomes could be spread over a number of years with a progressive tax on this with zero tax on the lowest rising to a maximum marginal rate on "income" of some upper figure. We suggest that if we have strongly progressive tax scales, then we should pay all benefits to all (the UBI for children to all, GRI and other super schemes to all) and claw it back from the well- off through the progressive tax scales. Have all adults complete tax returns as we all used to. Consumption taxes. Where these affect everybody they need to be kept as low as possible because of the greater effects on the poor. Perhaps there could be exceptions eg certain foods. Wealth Tax It is important to try to ensure that high wealth holders contribute to the wellbeing of all through the tax system. A comprehensive capital gains tax will capture the returns on wealth. Maybe a better approach might be a small annual percentage tax paid on high wealth that would generate significant revenue. Its annual cost to individual asset holders would be small enough to not encourage avoidance or tax minimisation strategies. Another approach is a" deemed rate of return" of property, that encourages assets to be used for productive purposes instead of seeking passive returns by simply holding assets for capital gain. The OECD has a very good study on wealth taxes. See appendix 4 Tax problems which affect the lowest earners and urgently need fixing: 1. The amount which can be earned before benefits are severely reduced or stopped completely, should be raised substantially. The allowable earnings in addition to the benefit, before claw- backs set in, are still only $80 a week for a single person, an amount that has not been raised since the 1980s and equates to only a few hours at the minimum wage 2. The rules and processes for combining benefits and earnings, which are both of course subject to tax, must be revised so that they work effectively and sustainably for all parties concerned and support people as they re-enter the paid workforce. All beneficiaries should be able to access this combination in an efficient, manageable way. That is what the internet and computers are for! 3. The secondary tax rate levied on additional jobs must be removed immediately, so that the very common combination of several low-paid jobs, often with irregular hours, does not penalize people who are already earning very little in total. Although it is in theory possible to put in a tax return at the end of the year and receive a refund, this requires considerable skill to achieve and is far too late – the money is needed when it is earned. Labour promised to do this in its manifesto but seems to have been silent about it since. This is all the more urgent because the National led government removed the low earner rebate and it has not been restored. Appendix 4 Some Comments about Taxation by Experts Capital Gains Taxation Taxes are most effective if they treat all income as being equal. NZ does not tax capital gains (unless they are earned by professional property developers) encouraging casual investors to buy property in the knowledge that profits made will not be taxable. As well as being unfair this distorts capital investment decisions. IMF mission chief Thomas Helbling told a briefing in Wellington targeting bottlenecks in the housing supply, redirecting savings from property into other investments ........ would help lift potential growth for New Zealand. A tweak to the country's existing capital gains tax was seen as addressing both housing issues and supporting savings and other investments, Helbling said. "There is a sense that the asset allocation in New Zealand households has a bit too much emphasis on housing versus other investments. We think a capital gains tax at the margin would help," he said. "We think there would probably be benefits in the sense of redirecting savings towards other instruments and deepening the capital markets." Progressive Tax Rates The advocates for lower tax rates on the rich argue that this encourages the rich to invest in economic growth. Probably one of the most successful investors of all time, American Warren Buffet refutes this on two grounds. Firstly the issue of fairness. Warren Buffett has publicly stated that he believed it was wrong that rich people, like himself, could pay less in federal taxes, as a portion of income, than the middle class, and voiced support for increased income taxes on the wealthy. He believes taxpayers in the highest income bracket should pay tax at a higher rate than less-affluent Americans. Buffet says “last year my federal tax bill — the income tax I paid, as well as payroll taxes paid by me and on my behalf — was $6,938,744. That sounds like a lot of money. But what I paid was only 17.4 percent of my taxable income — and that’s actually a lower percentage than was paid by any of the other 20 people in our office. Their tax burdens ranged from 33 percent to 41 percent and averaged 36 percent. This is wrong and unfair.” The second issue is the claim that higher taxes on the wealthy discourage investment. Buffet disputes this. “Back in the 1980s and 1990s, tax rates for the rich were far higher including my own. According to a theory I sometimes hear, I should have thrown a fit and refused to invest because of the elevated tax rates on capital gains and dividends. I didn’t refuse, nor did others. I have worked with investors for 60 years and I have yet to see anyone — not even when capital gains rates were 39.9 percent in 1976-77 — shy away from a sensible investment because of the tax rate on the potential gain. People invest to make money, and potential taxes have never scared them off. And to those who argue that higher rates hurt job creation, I would note that a net of nearly 40 million jobs were added between 1980 and 2000. You know what’s happened since then: lower tax rates and far lower job creation.” High levels of CEO salaries One of the obvious sources of inequality is the very high levels of CEO salaries. This is a matter that is increasingly attracting the attention of shareholders in public companies but is also becoming an issue in state owned entities. Prime Minister(at the time) Bill English has criticised the Board of the New Zealand Superannuation Fund for approving a 36 percent pay-rise for chief executive Adrian Orr last year, and suggested there could be a shakeup in how CEOs of the largest state entities are paid. English said he was disappointed with the board's decision to lift Adrian Orr's salary to over $1 million in 2016. As finance minister, English opposed the raise as "too large in the current economic climate" and suggested a 2.5 percent hike instead. The prime minister said the raise would be taken into account when it comes to reappointing board members. The argument in favour of ever higher CEO salaries is that this rewards superior performance and is needed to attract high calibre people. But it is becoming increasingly apparent modern companies run better with flatter pay structures. Dean Hall is chief executive and founder of Rocketwerkz, a Dunedin-based gaming studio undergoing rapid expansion and having attracted investment from a Chinese internet giant. Since moving to the city two years ago, Hall's company now employs 40 people and is on track to reach 100 by the end of the year. There is unlimited annual leave, profit sharing, open financial statements, a chief executive who pegs his salary, and Friday sport days. "Major decisions are open, the company's financials are open," Hall said. "We think that helps keep you honest." If Hall wants to fly business class, he has to justify it to his staff. His salary is pegged at 10 per cent more than the highest-paid employee. "We try and keep the salaries realistic, and instead make lasting changes in people's lives through profit share." Hall said he wasn't driven by money and after his early financial success, "realised I didn't care that much about money". Offering unlimited annual leave wasn't offering a perk to an employee, he said, but was offered simply "because it works". Appendix 5 . List of some of the research and reference material used. 1.

Submission to the New Zealand Government Tax Working Group April 2018 Submitter: Income Equality Aotearoa New Zealand Inc –Closing the Gap Peter Malcolm National Secretary We wish to speak to the submission This submission is from the Income Equality Aotearoa New Zealand Inc which is concerned about the high and damaging levels of income and wealth inequality, and poverty in New Zealand This submission is in six parts Basic Submission Appendix 1 Answers to questions asked by the Tax Working Group Appendix 2 More details on a fair, socially just tax system for New Zealand Appendix 3 Some ideas for tax systems Appendix 4 Some comments about tax Appendix 5 List of research and reference material. \[1\] Our Basic Submission Who we are and why are we doing this: We are Income Equality Aotearoa New Zealand Inc –Closing the Gap. We have some 3000 supporters from around the country. Research clearly shows that significant inequality is bad for any country in terms of health, economics and many other social issues, and that inequality is much worse in New Zealand that it was some 30 years ago. The tax system has a significant effect on inequality and so our system should be modified to help reduce inequality in New Zealand. Also the current system is unfair and inconsistent ( not all income is taxed, very low incomes are taxed, capital gains taxes are minimal and there no inheritance taxes ) Overall we believe that it is possible for all New Zealanders to enjoy a decent life, one where everyone thrives. In particular every kid deserves a good start. But we recognise that big imbalances of income and wealth have been deeply destructive, and make the ideal above very difficult to achieve Our vision for New Zealand: A tax structure which incorporates all incomes, wealth, individuals and businesses, is socially responsible, is fair to all, helps us ensure a quality life for all, now and in the future, and is a major influence on helping to reduce inequality. A tax system which is promoted as, and recognized as, a positive contribution to public good. It is the price we pay for a civilized society. It is our belief that the system should provide a higher overall tax take for Government which, together with more generous welfare and income support payments enables all to live decent lives. See appendix 2 re increased tax take and welfare Our basic submission: we need a tax system that .  is significantly more progressive than as at present ie with higher taxes for very high incomes and lower or no taxes for those on low incomes  taxes wealth, either annually and/or when assets are sold, probably through a universal capital gains tax  provides a higher overall tax take for Government see appendix 2 Preamble no. 4  together with more generous welfare and income support payments enables all to live decent lives. See appendix 2 re welfare Preamble no.5 Appendix 1 Questions Asked by the Tax Working Group 1. What Does the Future of Tax Look like to you? (A)Tax is the price we pay for civilisation. Therefore it will always be important. Governments need to tax to: 1) have enough money to provide services eg education, health etc 2) have enough money for redistribution of income/wealth to a. ensure all can live decent lives b. reduce inequality 3) discourage/encourage certain behaviours, personal, for example smoking, and environmental, for example recycling and conservation (B) Sources of Tax. 1)Because of our rapidly changing world and the interests of fairness, equity and ability to pay, the source of taxation must be as broad/wide as possible. This also ensures that in the light of changing circumstances the tax system can be adjusted without significant disruption. Tax should be paid on ALL income or financial benefits accruing to an individual or organisation including capital gain. We recognise that this includes tax on the capital gain on the family home. While this is excluded through the terms of reference, we believe that the final report should include comments about this. As this stands it does provide a loophole that can be exploited and will not help in making housing affordable. There could be exclusions or exceptions in terms of how such a tax might be levied to make this more politically palatable. It is noted that overseas where the family home is subject to CGT then there are various mechanisms to alleviate that tax, such as reduced rates, tax free allowance, exceptions where the proceeds of sale are offset against any new home purchased and only the net gain is taxed 2)Things that can be targeted by authorities to promote or curb the use of. See 1(A) 3 above. (C)Who Pays and How the tax is paid: Who Pays:  all over 16  we believe that everyone should furnish a return so that all income regardless of source is included ie superannuation, benefits, capital gain, gifts, inheritances. This also reinforces the importance of the tax system in terms of a decent life for all. 2.What is the purpose of tax? See above 1(A) and To significantly reduce income and wealth inequality. To have an impact on the price of housing. To pay for Govt services, and encourage/discourage some activities. See 1(A)3 above 3.Are we taxing the right things? Yes but you need to expand the net significantly to include ALL income regardless of source for individuals and organisations 4.Can tax make housing more affordable? Yes. Apart from renting, the taxation system must discourage people from using housing as an investment. Housing should simply be there to provide accommodation and people should be encouraged to use other avenues for investment opportunities. This is also one of the reasons why capital gains tax in some form should be levied on the family home. 5.What tax issues matter most to you? Reducing inequality in both income and wealth Reducing accommodation costs—the cost buying “homes”, and reduce the cost of renting Looking after the environment—flora, fauna, water, climate change in particular Getting rid of poverty. Producing sufficient income for the Government to properly provide services for all—see Appendix 2 Preamble no. 4 Appendix 2. More details on a fair, socially just tax system for New Zealand PREAMBLE 1. Income and wealth inequality in Aotearoa New Zealand have grown significantly since the mid 1980s. In 2017 the richest one percent gained 28% of new wealth while the poorest 30% got just one percent. Over the last 30 years the ratio of the average top 10% to the bottom 10% has gone from 5 to 1 to 8 or 9 to 1; for the workforce. as a whole the increase is 3.7% NZ could aim to reduce economic inequality to the level enjoyed by countries, such as Denmark, where the richest tenth have an average income five times that of the poorest tenth, the level NZ had in the early-1980s. Currently in New Zealand that ratio is nine to one 2. The current low progressivity of our tax system contributes badly to this present situation Income Times Living Wage Tax After Tax income Income per week % tax 42,000 1.00 9,000 33,000 635 21.43% 210,000 5.00 60,220 149,780 2,880 28.68% 420,000 10.00 129,520 290,480 5,586 30.84% 630,000 15.00 198,820 431,180 8,292 31.56% This shows the lack of progressivity in our present tax scales. No one pays more than 32% of their income in tax. Income tax increases most rapidly around $70,000 when the maximum marginal rate cuts in. Now the current tax rates: 0 to 14,000 10.5% 14,001 to 48,000 17.5% 48,001 to 70,000 30.0% Over 70,000 33.0% Someone earning twice the living wage--$84,000 is paying the same marginal rate of income tax as someone earning $2 million or more. That does not seem fair or progressive. Aotearoa New Zealand ranks 115 out of 152 countries in the progressivity of its tax policies (Nigeria is at 114) and 30 out of 35 OECD countries. 3. Government tax structures should have two major purposes: to provide sufficient funds for Government services and infrastructure, and to control inequality by carrying out a redistributive function of resources to ensure all can be part of a fair and properly functioning society 4. Government services are the framework for a civilised country and to have these services freely available to all helps significantly to reduce inequality. There is considerable evidence that current government funding for essential services such as health, mental health, education, and welfare is not adequate to meet the needs of our communities. Compared with OECD countries we are a low tax country. 30% of our GDP is from taxation compared with Scandinavian countries at 40% or above. We have very little tax on wealth and we tax high incomes lightly 5. The way the welfare and tax systems interact has a big impact on low and middle income households. The current levels of income support such as Working for Families, Accommodation Supplement and other welfare benefits are insufficient for individuals and families to live decent lives, and further, the way these are reduced as people’s income increases is very unfair. It means that many people on very modest incomes can lose most of the extra income earned through increased tax rates and/or reduced income support. 6. If inequality is reduced it will have a significant beneficial effect on poverty--another serious issue in our country Key data from the 2016 Child Poverty Monitor • 14% of children are living in material hardship. That means 155,000 New Zealand children are in households that are living without 7 or more items, from a total list of 17 items which are considered necessary for their wellbeing • 8% (or 85,000) of NZ children are experiencing even worse material hardship with households missing out on 9 or more items from the list of 17. This is a new measure for the Child Poverty Monitor following its introduction to government reporting • 28% of children are living in low income homes. That means 295,000 New Zealand children are in homes where money is tight and are considered to be in income poverty. • More than 8% of children are in severe poverty. That means 90,000 New Zealand children are experiencing both material hardship and living in a low income household • While child poverty has been reasonably stable for a number of years, it is significantly worse than the 1980s now. In 1982 the percentage of children in families experiencing income poverty was 14%, compared to 28% now. What we believe should be introduced into our Tax System 1. The Principles under-pinning the economics of our society should  be fair to all  be beneficial to all  look after the disadvantaged  reduce inequality  recognise the importance of individuals, families and children  recognise the economic imperatives for New Zealand  recognise the importance of all communities in our country  look after our environment both natural and “built up”  have all New Zealanders accept the need for taxes and their responsibility to pay their dues ie taxation is not theft This could be used as a “Check-list” against which any tax system could be evaluated 2. Why Tax Taxation is the subscription that we all pay, for us all to enjoy the benefits of living as a member of a fair and properly functioning society. The overall tax levels must enough so the things that Government provides that affect people most are sufficient for all to live decently and reasonably, ie health, education, justice, welfare and superannuation. Tax structures do have an affect on inequality and inequality is currently too great in New Zealand. and is consequently a serious problem for us all. 3. Amount of Taxation accrued by Government. Although it would appear that the Government does not seem interested in raising the current level we would suggest that the final report from the Tax Working Group should include comments about this to at least provoke public debate and political action. We believe that there are a number of Government provided services which are severely underfunded such as health, education, welfare, justice and this has a significant impact on the poor and inequality and the economy. See 4 in the preamble above. There has been a prevailing opinion in many western governments in the last 40 years that an undue percentage of GDP in the hands of government will inhibit economic performance and that everyone, rich and poor will be worse off. That has been the prevailing mantra in New Zealand. There is an increasing body of evidence from leading economists and the examples of other countries, see 4 in the preamble above, which demonstrates that a higher tax rates will not damage the economy or individual initiative. To increase the total tax take does not necessarily impact on the low or middle income groups. 4. Who pays the Tax: All according to their ability to pay and there must be systems in place to ensure that all, including foreign owned businesses that make profits in New Zealand, pay the tax they owe. NB. There are many stories around the supposed damage that higher taxes accrue and most of them are myths. 5. What should/could be Taxed:  All income ---wages/salaries/transfers/benefits/superannuation/income from trust ---“rents’ on property, money etc ---any realised capital gain (after costs/inflation adjustments) ---gifts above a given figure each year ---inheritances above a certain figure  “negative externalities” tobacco, alcohol ie things that are perceived a negative effect on society  Wealth see appendix 3  Land, all natural resources ie the Georgian “Land Value” tax and other natural resources such as water  Business  Financial transactions if agreed internationally  Trusts including Registered Charitable Trusts. There are large commercial organisations that are operating as Charitable Trusts, gaining cash flow advantages compared with their taxable equivalent organisations allowing them to expand their operations unfairly. Profits retained in the ongoing operations should be taxed at normal rates.  Realistic levels of income for overseas companies making profits in New Zealand We have some real concerns about “consumption” taxes or levies ie GST, fuel, etc. They are all regressive, have most impact on the poor and as a consequence increase inequality Further Views on Future Taxation not Mentioned Elsewhere Tax Scales Indexed to inflation/CPI. This seems a sensible move which would avoid the problems associated with so-called “tax boundary creep” GST on Food  Our current GST system is very simple. What are the implications of removing GST on food items? This must be reasonably easy to determine from experiences overseas. If it would make the collection complex and expensive for businesses/tax authorities then those costs should be compared to the cost of increasing the beneficiary/superannuation (Transfer) payments. With the move towards the Living Wage (which might practically coincide with the introduction of any new tax system) then the costs to the lower income wage groups would be automatically catered for. Remove the tax on food only if there is a proven overall net benefit. Also see above on consumption taxes. GST on Imports  GST on imports should be lowered to all imports over $40, to avoid discrimination against local retailers. Capital Gains Tax  There should be a broad based capital gains tax on profits of all assets sold (or disposed of) after an allowance for inflation. There should be a minimum taxable level set. Capital losses to be offset against current or future CGT profits – not other income. Profits should be taxed at income tax rates It should include the family home (though it is noted that this is outside your brief - but should be commented on in your final report see appendix 2). Harmful activities  There should be a tax on sugar and its substitutes where those substitutes are known to be harmful.  Similar taxes should be introduced where recommended by health professionals to avoid societal health costs.  Environmental harmful activity (listed by central Government) should be taxed/fined/controlled (rules set by central Government) by the relevant Regional Local Authority. Central government should also be responsible for implementing recycling levies/schemes at the point of importation/manufacture for items such as electronic goods/tyres/plastics/glassware etc. Superannuation  Should be taxed where other income exceeds a set amount (say $60,000--indexed) to be fully offset (at say $100,000). Ie the superannuation is paid gross and then added to all other income for tax purposes Land and other Natural Resource  Land, and other natural resources such as water could be taxed.  There is a land-value windfall tax which is a tax placed on a gain in the capital value of land that results from the actions of central or local government. For example, a Council rezones ‘rural’ land to ‘residential’ thereby increasing the capital value by 900% - say from $1,000,000 to $10,000,000. The gain of $9,000,000 should be taxable. Another is Central government builds a motorway resulting in an increase in land value near access points or central government and local government jointly fund a light rail system resulting in an increase in land values along the corridor. . Appendix 3 Some more specific details required for a better tax system for all A More steeply progressive tax system for New Zealand is essential if we are to reduce income inequality Here is an example of a fairer more progressive tax system.

Taxation on Families Some possibilities 1. Families---add all incomes together, then split into separate incomes according to the number of members in the immediate family (one for each adult and a half for each child under 16) and then tax each unit as individuals as per above Eg A 2 adults and 2 children family with a total income of $60000 is treated as 4 incomes of $20000, $20000, $10000 and $10000 and taxed accordingly 1 adult and 2 children family would be treated the same 2 adults and 3 children would treated as 5 incomes of approximately $17000, $17000 and 3 of $8500Ie no tax on any of these example NB the net income for families 2 adults 2 kids with one and a half FT jobs at the living wage is about $60000 per year ie no tax to be paid 2. Many would argue that because in this day and age the concept of “families” is very difficult to define , a better approach might be to treat everybody (over 16) for tax purposes as individuals and have a significant UBI (at least $80 per week) for all under the age of 16. Taxation on Individuals Add ALL cash income ( not assets --assets should be taxed when realized) from all sources including transfers. Some sources may have to contribute only a percentage eg capital gain, inheritance income and spread over a number of years The alternative would be different tax rates for capital income, but this would be more complex than above. One off incomes could be spread over a number of years with a progressive tax on this with zero tax on the lowest rising to a maximum marginal rate on "income" of some upper figure. We suggest that if we have strongly progressive tax scales, then we should pay all benefits to all (the UBI for children to all, GRI and other super schemes to all) and claw it back from the well- off through the progressive tax scales. Have all adults complete tax returns as we all used to. Consumption taxes. Where these affect everybody they need to be kept as low as possible because of the greater effects on the poor. Perhaps there could be exceptions eg certain foods. Wealth Tax It is important to try to ensure that high wealth holders contribute to the wellbeing of all through the tax system. A comprehensive capital gains tax will capture the returns on wealth. Maybe a better approach might be a small annual percentage tax paid on high wealth that would generate significant revenue. Its annual cost to individual asset holders would be small enough to not encourage avoidance or tax minimisation strategies. Another approach is a" deemed rate of return" of property, that encourages assets to be used for productive purposes instead of seeking passive returns by simply holding assets for capital gain. The OECD has a very good study on wealth taxes. See appendix 4 Tax problems which affect the lowest earners and urgently need fixing: 1. The amount which can be earned before benefits are severely reduced or stopped completely, should be raised substantially. The allowable earnings in addition to the benefit, before claw- backs set in, are still only $80 a week for a single person, an amount that has not been raised since the 1980s and equates to only a few hours at the minimum wage 2. The rules and processes for combining benefits and earnings, which are both of course subject to tax, must be revised so that they work effectively and sustainably for all parties concerned and support people as they re-enter the paid workforce. All beneficiaries should be able to access this combination in an efficient, manageable way. That is what the internet and computers are for! 3. The secondary tax rate levied on additional jobs must be removed immediately, so that the very common combination of several low-paid jobs, often with irregular hours, does not penalize people who are already earning very little in total. Although it is in theory possible to put in a tax return at the end of the year and receive a refund, this requires considerable skill to achieve and is far too late – the money is needed when it is earned. Labour promised to do this in its manifesto but seems to have been silent about it since. This is all the more urgent because the National led government removed the low earner rebate and it has not been restored. Appendix 4 Some Comments about Taxation by Experts Capital Gains Taxation Taxes are most effective if they treat all income as being equal. NZ does not tax capital gains (unless they are earned by professional property developers) encouraging casual investors to buy property in the knowledge that profits made will not be taxable. As well as being unfair this distorts capital investment decisions. IMF mission chief Thomas Helbling told a briefing in Wellington targeting bottlenecks in the housing supply, redirecting savings from property into other investments ........ would help lift potential growth for New Zealand. A tweak to the country's existing capital gains tax was seen as addressing both housing issues and supporting savings and other investments, Helbling said. "There is a sense that the asset allocation in New Zealand households has a bit too much emphasis on housing versus other investments. We think a capital gains tax at the margin would help," he said. "We think there would probably be benefits in the sense of redirecting savings towards other instruments and deepening the capital markets." Progressive Tax Rates The advocates for lower tax rates on the rich argue that this encourages the rich to invest in economic growth. Probably one of the most successful investors of all time, American Warren Buffet refutes this on two grounds. Firstly the issue of fairness. Warren Buffett has publicly stated that he believed it was wrong that rich people, like himself, could pay less in federal taxes, as a portion of income, than the middle class, and voiced support for increased income taxes on the wealthy. He believes taxpayers in the highest income bracket should pay tax at a higher rate than less-affluent Americans. Buffet says “last year my federal tax bill — the income tax I paid, as well as payroll taxes paid by me and on my behalf — was $6,938,744. That sounds like a lot of money. But what I paid was only 17.4 percent of my taxable income — and that’s actually a lower percentage than was paid by any of the other 20 people in our office. Their tax burdens ranged from 33 percent to 41 percent and averaged 36 percent. This is wrong and unfair.” The second issue is the claim that higher taxes on the wealthy discourage investment. Buffet disputes this. “Back in the 1980s and 1990s, tax rates for the rich were far higher including my own. According to a theory I sometimes hear, I should have thrown a fit and refused to invest because of the elevated tax rates on capital gains and dividends. I didn’t refuse, nor did others. I have worked with investors for 60 years and I have yet to see anyone — not even when capital gains rates were 39.9 percent in 1976-77 — shy away from a sensible investment because of the tax rate on the potential gain. People invest to make money, and potential taxes have never scared them off. And to those who argue that higher rates hurt job creation, I would note that a net of nearly 40 million jobs were added between 1980 and 2000. You know what’s happened since then: lower tax rates and far lower job creation.” High levels of CEO salaries One of the obvious sources of inequality is the very high levels of CEO salaries. This is a matter that is increasingly attracting the attention of shareholders in public companies but is also becoming an issue in state owned entities. Prime Minister(at the time) Bill English has criticised the Board of the New Zealand Superannuation Fund for approving a 36 percent pay-rise for chief executive Adrian Orr last year, and suggested there could be a shakeup in how CEOs of the largest state entities are paid. English said he was disappointed with the board's decision to lift Adrian Orr's salary to over $1 million in 2016. As finance minister, English opposed the raise as "too large in the current economic climate" and suggested a 2.5 percent hike instead. The prime minister said the raise would be taken into account when it comes to reappointing board members. The argument in favour of ever higher CEO salaries is that this rewards superior performance and is needed to attract high calibre people. But it is becoming increasingly apparent modern companies run better with flatter pay structures. Dean Hall is chief executive and founder of Rocketwerkz, a Dunedin-based gaming studio undergoing rapid expansion and having attracted investment from a Chinese internet giant. Since moving to the city two years ago, Hall's company now employs 40 people and is on track to reach 100 by the end of the year. There is unlimited annual leave, profit sharing, open financial statements, a chief executive who pegs his salary, and Friday sport days. "Major decisions are open, the company's financials are open," Hall said. "We think that helps keep you honest." If Hall wants to fly business class, he has to justify it to his staff. His salary is pegged at 10 per cent more than the highest-paid employee. "We try and keep the salaries realistic, and instead make lasting changes in people's lives through profit share." Hall said he wasn't driven by money and after his early financial success, "realised I didn't care that much about money". Offering unlimited annual leave wasn't offering a perk to an employee, he said, but was offered simply "because it works". Appendix 5 . List of some of the research and reference material used. 1.

Infrastructure New Zealand members come from diverse sectors across New Zealand and include infrastructure service providers, investors and operators. This submission represents the views of Infrastructure New Zealand as a collective whole and may not necessarily represent the views of individual member organisations. Infrastructure New Zealand submission to the Tax Working Group on the future of tax Infrastructure New Zealand supports the review of New Zealand’s tax system and commends the Working Group on the development of the discussion paper. In our view, there are four “macro” questions to consider when reviewing the tax system: 1. Who pays the tax? 2. How much do they pay? 3. Where does the tax go? 4. Who allocates the tax revenue? The Working group has discussed in some detail the first three questions, but we think needs to give greater consideration the fourth. 2 Both tax payers and tax spenders are incentivised by taxation policy It is not just tax payers who are incentivised by different tax structures, it is also the administering bodies. Central government, which is majority funded by taxes tied to economic performance, has different incentives than local government, whose funding is tied to capped property rates which are guaranteed regardless of economic performance. Central government is incentivised to want, invest in and proactively pursue economic growth. Local government, is much more focused on cost minimisation. Further, not all taxes are equal. Some taxes are gathered at the point of value creation, while others are gathered retrospectively from individuals and businesses. Income tax on wages and salaries, for example, tends to be levied before payments are made to workers. In contrast, local government rates are paid out of a home-owner’s after-tax income. To pay income tax, a worker does nothing. The money is redirected before the salary or wage is deposited into the worker’s account and, other than in the unusual instance of a tax rate increase, the impact on the worker’s income, earnings or wealth is unnoticeable. To pay a rates levy, a home-owning worker must actively transfer money from their own savings account to their local council. Each payment “hurts” and every increase takes more money away from a voter which they in most cases considered rightfully theirs. The combination of guaranteed revenue not tied to economic performance and heavily politicised taxation practices is shaping local government priorities in ways which are having severely negative impacts on New Zealand. Most notably, the reluctance of councils to invest in infrastructure to support new housing and development and zone land sufficient to promote competitive urban land markets is the driving force behind housing unaffordability and undersupply. A much more efficient, fair and effective taxation system needs to reallocate funding from economic performance taxes – GST, income and/or corporate tax – to local government to align councils’ priorities with wider society and central government. Whether councils are granted a share of GST, income or corporate tax, or given some scope to levy additional GST, income or corporate tax, is something that needs to be given a high level of consideration. As long as councils have a guaranteed funding source, independent of council performance and central government direction, councils cannot be expected to act in manner which promotes wider societal objectives. 3 Rates and land taxes The Discussion Document highlights an issue with the taxation of property. Most notably, Working Group evidence suggests that capital and, in particular, property is taxed comparatively little in New Zealand. The greater part of this issue can be remedied simply, efficiently and fairly by resolving the obvious inconsistency in the way that land is taxed in New Zealand. Unlike GST, income and corporate tax, increases in land value are for all intents and purposes not taxed in New Zealand. Rates are charged based on a series of inputs, reflecting among other things land values. However, rates are not “ad valorem” (i.e. levied in proportion to a property’s land or capital value), they are capped and reflect relative rather than absolute value. Thus, in a city like Auckland which has seen very rapid increases in land value, rates for many residents have at times fallen in spite of land value increases because their property values have increased more slowly than others. The complex and inconsistent way that property is taxed does have advantages, including insulating councils and residents from fluctuations in property values. But to continue to limit the exposure of the wealthiest New Zealanders and by far the largest asset class in the country to what strongly appears to be their “fair share” of the tax burden is not only questionable from an equity perspective, it is having a deleterious effect on urban growth policies. New Zealand’s rates approach is a material factor in the housing crisis Land use regulations, including urban boundaries to prevent urban expansion and height restrictions to limit densification, are designed to protect the interests of established residents either by controlling the speed of change in local areas or by limiting the exposure of existing residents to the costs of new infrastructure. Land use regulation also restricts the supply of urban land, increases the cost of development and slows the supply of housing. 1 Greater land use regulation therefore benefits existing property owners by protecting local areas and amenity from change, limiting new rates-funded capital investment and inflating capital values by restricting the supply of new housing (thereby increasing relative demand). Rate (and also weak capital gains policies) should act as a counterweight by increasing the revenue to councils from rising property values caused by restrictive land use policies, but under current settings do not . 1 Productivity Commission, Housing Affordability, April 2012. 4 Capped rates protect established residents from rising land taxes, even while their wealth expands, and provide no additional revenue to councils to address the negative externalities of restrictive land use regulation. Under an ad valorem land tax approach, land use restrictions which slow the speed of housing and push up land values would come with three major consequences. First, land value increases would be met with a proportionate increase in council/government revenue to address emerging needs, such as demand for subsidised housing. Second, established residents would “feel” the impact of land use policies which constrain development by way of rapidly increasing “rates”. Third, higher and more rapidly changing “rates” would improve the price signals sent to land owners about the true value of their land. These consequences would, in our view, provide some balance to urban land use policies which at the moment are strongly in favour of existing residents over future residents. Furthermore, readily accessible evidence from the Auckland Council and others indicates that property owners are much more likely to engage in local body elections. This has given rise to what the Productivity Commission has labelled a “democratic deficit” 2 , whereby the interests of established voting residents has been reinforced in policies promoted by politicians striving for election. We acknowledge that residents can be “capital rich” and “cash poor”, making it significantly more complex politically to gather a pure land tax than a capped rate. However, councils already have in place policies which allow particularly older residents on fixed incomes to defer rates payments until a home is sold. This policy can be expanded so that those benefitting from increases in wealth can in part be insulated from the most significant impacts of this benefit, while still paying a tax rate which reflects their benefit. Another advantage of land tax is that it operates as a much more accurate “value capture” tool, potentially removing the need for expansion of this theoretically attractive, but in practice complex, concept. We highlight the work of Infrastructure Australia in their investigation of value capture. 3 After significant analysis, Infrastructure Australia determined that the fairest, most efficient and effective way to capture land value improvement was as simple as a broad-based land tax. 2 Productivity Commission, Using Land for Housing, September 2015. 3 Infrastructure Australia, Capturing Value: Advice on Making Value Capture Work in Australia, December 2016. 5 A tax swap Concerns that, with an ad valorem land tax in place, councils could be exposed to severe reductions in revenue if property prices fall could be mitigated by a “tax swap” with central government. If central government was to receive a share of land taxes, most notably the variable component reflecting the value of overall property/land, and local councils a share of GST, income and/or corporate taxes, concerns about council financial resilience could be mitigated. Although councils would be exposed to some risk via their share of local GST, income and/or corporate tax, the broader tax base would offset some of this risk. More importantly, councils would have incentives realigned with wider societal objectives and central government would receive a share of the benefit from major Government decisions. If a portion of local government revenue was tied to the value created by council activities, local government would be incentivised “go for growth”, effecting a culture shift inside many councils challenged by high costs and limited revenue. Central government and, to the extent it is exposed, local government would, meanwhile, see a direct benefit from activities which add value to land. Major city shaping infrastructure like the City Rail Link, light rail or an eventual Weymouth crossing which unlock vast tracts of land for development would be much more likely to achieve cross-government support. Infrastructure NZ encourages the Working Group to look closely at who gets what type of tax and whether changes to the allocation of different taxes could achieve better alignment of government generally with public outcomes. We consider analysis of whether local government in its current form is capable of managing more complex funding systems should comprise part of this work. Revenue bonds A further taxation tool we consider should be given consideration by the Working Group are directly elected taxes tied to defined projects or initiatives. Under this approach, councils could ask the electorate for support to raise debt to finance an investment as well as to levy the tax to pay off the debt over the long term. Such tools are commonplace in the United States, where they are most commonly implemented as revenue bonds. The principal advantage of this approach is that, while the debt sits on an organisation’s consolidated balance sheet, with appropriate ringfencing of the obligation and future tax revenue, ratings agencies permit a much higher degree of leverage. 6 Both sales and land tax revenues are used in the US to repay bond issuances for major public projects. A 1 percent sales tax increase, for example, was supported by the greater Dallas electorate as a means to rolling out a rapid transit system. An attractive outcome from wider use of this type of project finance in the US is some apparent depoliticisation of investments; rather that contesting projects through elections, direct votes are held helping to separate parties from projects. We encourage the Working Group to investigate revenue bonds and whether there are barriers to their adoption here. Road pricing and water metering Finally, we support the wider application of direct user charges, most notably road pricing and water metering. Traditionally, water and transport investment has been managed by councils and government agencies because charging and use for the assets has been difficult to oversee. Technology has radically broken down the barriers to accurate and equitable charging for “public” services. We consider that water charging should be disaggregated from local body rates and water use metered. Charging for the operation of water assets based on consumption has been proven to lower total water demand and the presence of a revenue stream to repay debt means public water companies can be separated from council balance sheets. This will enable water companies to borrow more heavily to invest in services, opening more land for development and promoting the government’s objective of competitive urban land markets. The technology is now available to charge all vehicles using public roads by total trip length, location and time of day. Further, prices for using roads can be raised and lowered to reflect road scarcity, i.e. higher charges can be applied at busy times and lower charges at less busy times. This approach is much more efficient than existing road user charges and fuel excise and is inevitable given the shift already underway to electric vehicles. We encourage, however, the Working Group to investigate the monopoly risks of the state determining road pricing levels. While we are strong proponents of road pricing, we observe a clear risk that suboptimal implementation could lead to an inefficient tax on travel. That is, the objective of transport policy is always to facilitate and enable travel. Travel is essential to economic, social and political integration and any charge which exceeds the actual cost of providing services is impeding the most fundamental societal outcomes. 7 If other objectives prevail, for example, congestion reduction or moving trips to public transport, road users will be charged a price which overestimates the cost of their decisions, disincentivising travel. In order for road pricing to be efficient, fair and supportive of broad societal outcomes, the revenue generated by road charges must be fully hypothecated to the people who pay the charges. That is, revenue must be injected into maintaining existing roads, expanding capacity where revenue exceeds the cost of improvements or into alternatives which benefit the users paying the road charges (for example, a public transport solution where the contribution of road charges is proportionate to the number of vehicles taken off the road). We consider it important that the Working Group investigate the fundamentals of fair, efficient and equitable road pricing policy as this initiative is now being worked through inside government. We thank the Working Group for this opportunity to provide feedback.

In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. www.innercitywellington.nz 30 April 2018 Page 1 of 5 Inner City Wellington’s Submission to the Tax Working Group 1. Inner City Wellington’s (ICW) 1 submission focuses on the need to provide relief for property owners who face significant seismic strengthening compliance costs imposed by the Government to achieve a public good outcome. Legislation changes applied retrospectively to achieve public good outcomes are ‘shocks and surprises’ to property owners that the tax system needs to take into account. 2 What is the problem? 2. Property owners in Wellington (and across the country) are facing substantial costs for mandatory seismic strengthening. 3 This burden was initially imposed under the Building Act 2004, and then under the Building (Earthquake Prone Buildings) Amendment Act 2016. Public safety is the driver for the imposition of these costs, with the result that the cost of a public good is being borne by private owners. 3. For the majority of owners facing these costs, the imposition occurred after purchase so they had no choice about taking on that burden. Many owners have found that the analysis of the likely costs has been grossly erroneous and misleading and are faced with much higher costs than the Government and Parliament envisaged. 4. For the purpose of this submission, residential owners refers to owner-occupiers and commercial owners refers to all other private property owners. Public safety outcomes v wellbeing and living standards of New Zealanders 5. The Living Standards Framework identifies four capital stocks that are crucial to intergenerational wellbeing: financial and physical capital, human capital, social capital and natural capital. 6. The costs of strengthening existing earthquake-prone buildings for public safety outcomes are being borne fully by the current owners, when the public safety benefits are spread over multiple generations of the public. The current owners bought buildings compliant with the codes at the time in good faith, but changing legislation and new methodologies and technologies for assessing compliance determines them to now be non-compliant. Central or local government owners facing mandatory seismic strengthening can incur debt and spread the burden over many generations of beneficiaries. 1 Inner City Wellington advocates for residents, property owners, organisations and businesses in the inner city. The impacts of seismic strengthening has been a priority from the beginning in 2008. www.innercitywellington.nz 2 Future of tax: submissions for background paper, p4. 3 The costs include engineering reports (sometime multiple), geotechnical reports, detailed engineering plans, architectural fees, quantity surveyor fees, project management costs, legal fees, resource and building consent fees, scaffolding costs, GST for non-GST registered owners, make good costs, and displacement costs while the work is being done. www.innercitywellington.nz 30 April 2018 Page 2 of 5 7. This is not possible for private owners who are spending all their savings or going into debt (often at later stages of their lives) for the benefit of future generations. This creates an inequity between owners facing the same compliance costs. Mandatory seismic strengthening costs are effectively a tax borne by the current private owners for a long-term public good. 8. Costs to strengthen earthquake-prone buildings can range from around $100,000 (if the owners are lucky) to $1.0 - $1.5m to $5m, $11m or the highest that we know about so far is around $25m. Owners have little real choice on how much to spend to strengthen the buildings. Their choice is based on the solutions that will address the structural weaknesses in the building and what percentage New Building Standard that will get them to. After that, comes the costs and affordability and whether the building as a whole or individual units are being over-capitalised. Current tax treatment of seismic strengthening costs 9. IRD has argued that seismic strengthening costs are not maintenance as the building is ‘improved’ once the work is completed and any costs associated with the project are deemed to be capital costs. 4 Buildings with an Earthquake Prone Building Notice begin to lose value immediately the notice is issued – and continue to lose value until the strengthening is completed. Any ‘improvement’ in value is only to regain that lost value, if that occurs at all. 10. Feedback from body corporates going through the strengthening process is that additional work to ‘add value’ is required if there is to be any substantive improvement in the capital value of the building. Added value work could be replacing all the windows with double-glazed windows. This would add value, but adds substantive additional costs, which potentially puts the project beyond the reach of even more owners. 11. A different approach is required to the treatment of costs for mandatory seismic strengthening that recognises that commercial and residential owners are bearing the same costs. GST registered owners in a GST-registered body corporate can already claim GST paid on body corporate levies that include strengthening-related costs, which is not available to residential owners. This creates inequity between owners facing the same costs. How other ‘shocks and surprises’ are treated 12. The previous government argued that the tax system must be kept simple and have used this as a reason to not consider any special tax treatment for owners facing mandatory seismic strengthening costs. But other sectors are provided with Government financial support when faced with shocks and surprises. Some examples include: Driver for support Form of assistance Eligibility Adverse effects affecting farmers Income equalisation scheme (IRD) All farmers in the area declared (eg, drought, flooding, disease, earthquakes, storms) Weather-related events (flooding in Edgecumbe & Bay of Plenty) Rural Assistance Payments and Rural Support Trust Businesses in the affected area Kaikoura Earthquake Kaikoura Earthquake Relief Farmers in affected area apply 4 QB16/08 Income tax – deductability of the costs of obtaining a detailed seismic assessment of a building. www.innercitywellington.nz 30 April 2018 Page 3 of 5 Driver for support Form of assistance Eligibility Fund ($12,000 to $50,000 per applicant) to a panel Kaikoura Earthquake Primary Industries Earthquake Recovery Fund Community groups, land owners and land managers in affected area Weathertight homes caused by systemic regulatory failure Financial Assistance Package & access to advisory service Affected owners Financial support available for owners facing mandatory seismic strengthening has primarily focused on heritage buildings and buildings in heritage areas: Fund Eligibility Comment National Heritage EQUIP National heritage listing building Categories 1 and 2 once resource consents issued Contributes towards investigation, planning and strengthening costs Local – eg, Wellington 5 Built Heritage Incentive Fund Any building on Wellington City Council heritage building list or building in a heritage area Small contributions: Sept 2017: $2,150 - $50,000; but grants made for $400,000 for St Mary of the Angels, which received a total of $530,000 Building consent subsidy (since 2014) Any earthquake-prone building after work completed, removed from Earthquake Prone Building List and received Code Compliance Certificate 10% of the cost up to a maximum of $5000. In 15/16 and 16/17 FYs approximately $11,000 for 20 buildings; an average of $566 per application. Rates remission – once strengthened (since 2014) Any earthquake-prone building once it has been removed from list and Code Compliance Certificate received. WCC reserves the right to determine valuation changes arising from seismic strengthening Based on difference between pre-strengthened and completed values; 3 years for non-heritage; 5 years for heritage, 10 years for Heritage NZ Cat 1, 8 years for Heritage NZ Cat 2. Owners may need to pay for valuations to prove completed strengthening values. Rates remission (since 2014) While the building is unoccupied for strengthening and not capable of generating revenue. Owners incur much higher costs associated with displacement of businesses or homes for many months. An example of the remission is $2,700 on rates of $22,250. Rates rebate – building demolished Earthquake-prone building that have been demolished 10% of rates payable for 3 years after demolition 5 In two financial years only 27 buildings are receiving the rates remission following completed strengthening, and 20 buildings have received the building consent subsidy. ICW has requested data on the uptake of the building consent and rates remission measures since they were introduced. www.innercitywellington.nz 30 April 2018 Page 4 of 5 What are the impacts being borne by private owners for a public good? 13. The variability of the costs of seismic strengthening is matched by the variability of financial circumstances of the owners. There are some commercial and residential owners who have the savings or the ability to service a loan, but it is still a significant financial impact on them through loss of funds and the accumulating interest. 14. Other owners are facing severe financial hardship. While it is mainly residential owners based on the feedback we have had, we know commercial owners are also impacted. The impact on commercial owners will increase as regional and provincial towns begin the process of identifying earthquake prone buildings. 15. Examples of the impact are: a. Using all their retirement savings when they are no longer in the workforce and are unable to recover it b. Having their retirement savings plan written off due to the costs of strengthening and/or inability to sell at a reasonable price c. Selling their units (often their homes at a loss (eg, land value only or less than what was paid for 10-15 years previously) either to remove themselves from stressful situations or knowing they will be forced to sell by the body corporate so the project can progress d. Credit servicing ability is diminished for commercial owners as the value of the building decreases and no economical strengthening option is available e. Not being able to raise a loan through retail channels due to lack of equity (as the value has dropped) or inability to service the loan (as no longer working) f. Not being able to sell their commercial or residential units at all as no one wants to incur the burden of strengthening. 16. We are beginning the process of collating data on actual costs being faced by affected owners. 17. Politicians wanting to keep the tax system simple cannot be justified when a small number of all property owners in New Zealand are funding public good outcomes for their local communities. What is needed? 18. A system of rebates and transfers is required to provide financial recognition that commercial and residential private owners are funding a public safety outcome through mandatory seismic strengthening of existing buildings. 19. How it could work: a. Rebates for property owners who are earning income and paying taxes. b. Transfers for property owners who are not earning income. Government superannuation needs to be exempt as income as for many it is there only source of funding for living expenses. c. Set a maximum threshold for the rebate or transfer based on the owner’s share of the project cost. d. Threshold be set at:  33% of the owner’s share. If donations to registered charities are eligible for a 33% rebate on tax, then private contributions toward public good outcomes should also be eligible for similar rebates. www.innercitywellington.nz 30 April 2018 Page 5 of 5  18% for GST-registered owners owning commercial property or in GST-registered body corporates. These owners are able to claim the GST on their share of the strengthening costs or the body corporate strengthening project levies to ensure equity between the two categories of owners. e. Eligibility based on evidence that property is on the earthquake prone building list held by the council (or MBIE national register when established) f. Costs based on evidence provided by owner and/or body corporate of the full project costs for the mandatory seismic strengthening and the owners share. IRD reserves the right to access original documentation if needed.  Identifiable costs for ‘added value components’ will need to be kept separate from seismic strengthening costs. Based on feedback from some body corporate chairs, the construction industry does not readily split out ‘added value component’ costs from project management, resource consent, professional fee costs, scaffolding costs for the seismic strengthening. However, the majority of the costs (eg, construction and installation of double-glazing windows) will be readily identifiable and a small percentage could be added for the related wider project costs. g. Owners can apply in the financial year that the costs were incurred. h. Owners who have already completed the seismic strengthening work must be able to apply; they have still privately funded public good outcomes. 20. Yes, there is some administrative overhead with this. There undoubtedly was administrative overhead with the weathertight financial assistance package, and with the other financial support packages. Administration costs alone does not justify doing nothing. The Government has imposed the costs without completing a rigorous cost-benefit analysis and using erroneous costs in the process. 21. It is difficult to quantify the number of owners that will take up future tax relief as central government has not undertaken research on the number of owners of earthquake prone buildings or commercial units/apartments in earthquake prone buildings. Wellington City Council has consistently refused to do establish the number of owners, despite having the data and making one attempt to estimate in 2013. The government policy talks about 15 – 25,000 buildings, but the number of owners will be higher due to multi-owner buildings. Concluding statement 22. Inner City Wellington raised the cost implication and downstream social impacts on owners at numerous Select Committees hearings and Wellington City Council committee meetings from the outset of this process. Politicians have known about the implications but have ignored it. 23. Government may consider mandatory seismic strengthening of earthquake prone buildings as a Wellington problem. While Wellington is facing it first, and is well into the 15 year timeframe for many buildings, it will begin to impact in the regions. At some point it will begin to hit in Auckland. For the regions it will mainly be commercial building owners that are affected. In Auckland and Dunedin there will also be significant numbers of residential owners. 24. The Tax Working Group is an opportunity to consider how ‘shocks and surprises’ are more fairly implemented to ensure that a few do not fund the public good for many. Inner City Wellington would appreciate the opportunity to talk with the Tax Working Group about the issues for owners facing mandatory seismic strengthening.

The ICBA Asia Pacific Regional Group (APAC Group) represents the interests of the beverage industry in the region including Australia, New Zealand, South Pacific Islands and all markets from India through to Japan. Today the APAC Group comprises over 100 industry professionals from both company and national associations. The ICBA APAC Group welcomes the opportunity to provide its perspective on a range of issues on the Future of Tax in New Zealand. On behalf of our Members across the Asia-Pacific, including New Zealand, we wish to provide comment specifically on two issues that have been raised in the Background Paper: 1. Taxation of sugar-sweetened beverages 2. Water management and usage. 1 ICBA is an international nongovernmental organization established in 1995 that represents the interests of the worldwide non-alcoholic beverage industry. The members of ICBA include national and regional beverage associations as well as international beverage companies that operate in more than 200 countries and territories and produce, distribute, and sell a variety of non-alcoholic sparkling and still beverages, including soft drinks, sports drinks, energy drinks, bottled waters, flavored and/or enhanced waters, ready-to-drink teas and coffees, 100 percent fruit or vegetable juices, nectars and juice drinks, and dairy-based beverages. ICBA has been a recognized and well-respected observer at Codex Alimentarius for 20 years. 2 ICBA Asia Pacific Regional Group 2 Allen Street SYDNEY AUSTRALIA 2017 www.icba-net.org/regional-groups/asia-pacific/ 1. Taxation of Sugar-Sweetened Beverages Recently, taxation of certain food products, and specifically sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), has been mooted by a small group of commentators as a means to address a complex and multi-factorial problem like obesity. The notion of a SSB tax to address obesity fails on all fronts. Specifically a SSB tax: a. Is not a WHO ‘cost-effective’ intervention; b. Is lacking any robust evidence and should not be a public health policy; c. Has not shown to improve public health from any global example; d. Will lead to unintended budget and economic problems. A) Taxation of SSBs is not a WHO ‘cost-effective’ intervention In the recent update to Appendix 3 (the menu of interventions to combat Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs)), the World Health Organisation (WHO) acknowledged that taxing sugar- sweetened beverages to reduce consumption is one of the weaker methods available to member states. As identified by the WHO’s internal CHOICE analysis it is not cost-effective nor does the WHO consider it a “best buy” for countries to use. 2 The WHO’s findings regarding the ineffectiveness of taxing sugar-sweetened beverages mirrors independent findings by the McKinsey Global Institute. McKinsey also noted the very poor science base to support such an intervention, its cost-ineffectiveness and the lack of DALYs resulting from adoption of such a policy. Moreover, there is concern among Members of the ICBA in New Zealand and elsewhere that the introduction of a levy on sugar-sweetened beverages would be costly to administer (see D) and the outcomes of any levy would, by extension, be challenging to measure. B) Lack of robust evidence should not be a proxy for sound public health policy There is insufficient evidence to support the use of SSB taxation as efficient public policy. There also is an inconvenient truth that there is no real world evidence that a SSB tax has produced positive health outcomes on any of the populations subject to this measure. Such an approach oversimplifies the economic complexities of taxation and ignores significant pitfalls with this approach: i. Good Fiscal Governance Means Examining a Budget as a Whole, Not Promoting Piece-meal “Solutions” 2 It’s further worth noting that at WHA70, the US government formally disassociated from the resolution endorsing Appendix 3 due to concerns about the lack of evidence underlying certain recommendations, including taxation of sugar-sweetened beverages. A SSB tax failed the WHO’s internal CHOICE analysis, and is neither a ‘best buy’ nor a cost effective intervention for member states to adopt. 3 ICBA Asia Pacific Regional Group 2 Allen Street SYDNEY AUSTRALIA 2017 www.icba-net.org/regional-groups/asia-pacific/ Taxation policy is complex, and there are documented “side-effects” to taxing sugar- sweetened beverages, as documented by the experience in Philadelphia. In January 2017, the city of Philadelphia, PA adopted a 1.5 cent per ounce beverage tax to raise revenue for pre-K education. As a recent study from the Tax Foundation highlights, the result has been fewer jobs and lower revenues 3 : • Promises to direct revenue toward particular programs go awry: In Philadelphia, only 49% of the revenue is going to pre-Kindergarten programs, despite Mayoral pledges. The rest is going toward consolidated revenue. There is simply no guarantee that funds raised from a beverage tax will go where promised. • Revenue projections can fall short.... leaving budget shortfalls: soda tax collections in the first six months were already $6.9 million below Philadelphia’s downwardly revised estimates. When the existence of a program is predicated on an uncertain tax, the foundation is at best shaky. • Jobs loss is real, and in Philadelphia, families are feeling the impact, especially those who cannot afford to travel outside the city limits to avoid the punitive beverage tax. Major beverage companies have announced layoffs of nearly 20% of their workforce in the city, and bodegas, supermarkets and gas stations are struggling. ii. The Economic Impact of Selective Taxation May Have Detrimental Effects on Health. The economic growth created by beverage and retail industries contributes positively toward health outcomes, particularly in low-income populations, by providing employment and livelihood to thousands of people around the world, and supporting access to foods. It has been clearly demonstrated that socio-economic status plays a key role in health status. In January 2017, The Lancet published a study on socioeconomic status as a risk factor for premature mortality. 4 This study of 1.7 million people across seven high-income WHO member countries 5 found that socioeconomic status is a more important driver of health outcomes than alcohol, obesity and other risk factors considered in the WHO 25x25 initiative (which did not consider socioeconomic factors). 3 “Soda Tax Experiment Failing in Philadelphia Amid Consumer Angst and Revenue Shortfalls,” S. Drenkard and C. Shupert, Fiscal Fact No. 555 (August 2017). 4 “Socioeconomic status and the 25 × 25 risk factors as determinants of premature mortality: a multicohort study and meta-analysis of 1·7 million men and women,” Stringhini et al January 2017. 5 UK, France, Switzerland, Portugal, Italy, USA, and Australia The SSB tax in Philadelphia has resulted in workforce layoffs of 20% and tax revenue is nearly $7million below estimates for the first six months. 4 ICBA Asia Pacific Regional Group 2 Allen Street SYDNEY AUSTRALIA 2017 www.icba-net.org/regional-groups/asia-pacific/ Participants with low socioeconomic status had greater mortality compared with those with high socioeconomic status. 6 By singling out sugar-sweetened beverages for discriminatory tax treatment and thereby reducing the industry’s employment, governments (or tax advocates who advise them) are pursuing policies that have a disproportionate detrimental impact on the very populations they are supposed to help, and therefore may worsen health outcomes. C) Taxing SSBs has not shown to improve public health from any global example There is no demonstrated real-world example of taxation reducing obesity or improving public health. The global experience with taxation to date demonstrates a minimal initial, and then unsustained, calorie drop from taxation of beverages, which in turn does not reduce obesity. In Mexico, for example, there is no evidence that the 2014 tax on sugar-sweetened beverages has had any impact on obesity. In fact, data from Mexico’s 2016 national health and nutrition survey has shown that the obesity rates have edged upward among adults from 2012-2016, especially among adult women (a statistically significant rise from 73% of the adult female population to 75.6% of that population). 7 Obesity in Mexico has increased, not declined, since the imposition of a beverage and snack taxes in country. The tax resulted in a decrease of only 4 calories per consumer per day in year one (2014) with government sales tax receipts demonstrating resumed levels of consumption in years two and three. 8 6 Low socioeconomic status was associated with a 2.1-year reduction in life expectancy between ages 40 and 85 years, the corresponding years-of-life-lost were 0.5 years for high alcohol intake, 0.7 years for obesity, 3.9 years for diabetes, 1.6 years for hypertension, 2.4 years for physical inactivity, and 4.8 years for current smoking. 7 See Mexico’s 2016 National Health Survey (ENSANUT). 8 Notably, a recent article in the journal Health Affairs claimed incorrectly that the drop in consumption witnessed in 2014 was sustained in later years. Regrettably, the authors of this article are relying on theoretical models, which are estimations that do not align with actual tax receipts from the Mexican Secretariat for Finance and Public Credit (SHCP). This real-world data shows increases in sugar-sweetened beverage sales through 2016, as opposed to the projected decrease suggested by the authors. This government tax receipt data can be reviewed at http://finanzaspublicas.hacienda.gob.mx/es/Finanzas\_Publicas/Estadisticas\_Oportunas\_de\_Finanzas\_Publicas Socio-economic status is a more important driver of health outcomes than alcohol, obesity and other risk factors. Four years after a SSB tax was introduced in Mexico, prevalence rates of obesity continue to climb, with statistically significant increases in rates amongst women in the period 2012-2016. 5 ICBA Asia Pacific Regional Group 2 Allen Street SYDNEY AUSTRALIA 2017 www.icba-net.org/regional-groups/asia-pacific/ In Berkeley, California, a tax on SSBs has caused calorie intake to rise rather than decrease. For instance, a recent study of the SSB tax implemented in Berkeley, California, found that while caloric consumption of taxed beverages dropped by a statistically insignificant margin of an average of six calories per day – equivalent to a bite of an apple, caloric consumption of untaxed beverages rose by an average of 32 calories per day, resulting in a net increase of 26 calories per person per day resulting from the tax. 9 In other words, consumers switched from soft drinks to milkshakes, smoothies and other similarly calorie-dense products – resulting in more calories consumed. Using the simplistic linear thinking of soft drink tax proponents, a narrow tax on sugar-sweetened soft drinks produced insignificant decrease in consumption of tax beverages, it also produced the unintended consequence of driving greater consumption of untaxed higher calorie beverages, and likely exacerbating the overweight and obesity issue. The Berkeley results are highlighted in the figure below: A number of other reputable studies and acclaimed reports further question the utility of sugar and/or soft drink taxes. For example: • At the request of New Zealand’s Ministry of Health, the well-regarded New Zealand Institute of Economic Research conducted an analysis entitled “Sugar taxes: A review of the evidence,” in which the authors ultimately concluded that “the evidence that sugar 9 L. Silver et al., “Changes in prices, sales, consumer spending, and beverage consumption one year after a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages in Berkeley, California, US: A before-and-after study,” PLOS Medicine (April 18, 2017). A year after the Berkeley tax was introduced, daily per capita caloric intake from all non-beverages has increased by 26 calories. 6 ICBA Asia Pacific Regional Group 2 Allen Street SYDNEY AUSTRALIA 2017 www.icba-net.org/regional-groups/asia-pacific/ taxes improve health is weak.” 10 In their review of the 47 peer-reviewed studies and working papers on the topic of sugar taxes, the authors found, among other things, that: i. estimates of reduced intake are often overstated due to methodological flaws and incomplete measurements; ii. there is insufficient evidence to judge whether consumers are substituting other sources of sugar or calories in the face of taxes on sugar in drinks; iii. studies using sound methods report reductions in intake that are likely too small to generate health benefits and could easily be cancelled out by substitution of other sources of sugar or calories; and iv. no study based on actual experience with sugar taxes has identified an impact on health outcomes. 11 • A June 2016 paper by the International Tax and Investment Center and Oxford Economics entitled “The Impact of Selective Food and Non-Alcoholic Beverage Taxes,” 12 evaluated the different factors that influence the effectiveness of selective food and non-alcoholic beverage taxes (“SFBT”) on two policy objectives: improving public health and raising government revenues. It concluded that the evidence “suggests that the impact of introducing SFBT can be wide-ranging and highly uncertain. Very few studies provide a robust and complete account of the effects of such taxes, meaning that governments seeking to introduce them are doing so in a highly speculative context.” 13 • Recent Cornell University (US) research showed that subjects showed a tendency to substitute taxed soft drink purchases with beer purchases. Consumers who were charged a 10 percent tax on soft drinks showed no decrease in purchase of soft drinks at three and six months compared to the control group not charged the tax. Further, in beer-purchasing households, the tax led to significantly increased purchases of beer so that calories purchased were not lowered and alcohol consumption likely was raised. 14 This research is notable because it is a controlled experiment conducted to evaluate the real-time effect of soft drink taxation, as compared to the body of economic estimates and projections research. 10 NZIER, “Sugar taxes: A review of the evidence,” at ii (2017), available at https://nzier.org.nz/static/media/filer\_public/f4/21/f421971a-27e8-4cb0-a8fc-95bc30ceda4e/sugar\_tax\_report.pdf (last accessed February 12, 2018). 11 Id. at i-ii. 12 Oxford Economics and International Tax and Investment Center, “The Impact of Selective Food and Non-Alcoholic Beverage Taxes” (June, 2016), available at http://www.oxfordeconomics.com/my-oxford/projects/341055 (last accessed February 13, 2018). 13 Id. (emphasis added). 14 B. Wansink, A. Hanks, and D. Just, “From Coke to Coors: A Field Study of a Fat Tax and Its Unintended Consequences” (May, 2012), available at http://www.jneb.org/article/S1499-4046(13)00284-4/pdf (last accessed February 12, 2018). 7 ICBA Asia Pacific Regional Group 2 Allen Street SYDNEY AUSTRALIA 2017 www.icba-net.org/regional-groups/asia-pacific/ • Finally, the very highly-regarded McKinsey Global Institute’s 2014 Report similarly found that taxing sugar is one of the least effective interventions in combating obesity. This study reveals that out of more than 40 modeled interventions, taxation was not even in the top ten interventions. And even at this level of ineffectiveness, the science supporting taxation as an effective policy intervention was deemed weak (ranking 1 on a scale of 1-5, with 5 being the best science). 15 According to the McKinsey Global Institute, the most effective ways to combat obesity include reformulating drinks, offering smaller portion sizes and providing better education, all of which our industry is committed to supporting. D) Taxing SSBs will lead to unintended budget and economic problems. The United Kingdom’s experience with its recently implemented Soft Drinks Industry Levy highlights clearly the unintended budget and deeper economic consequences of introducing a tax. The Government Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR ) found that the increase in price of soft drinks due to the tax will raise inflation. This food inflation in turn will raise the cost of interest payments on index-linked payments by the Government by approximately £1 billion in 2018-19. Net-net, the new soft drink tax will cost the Government approximately twice as much as it raises in revenues, and do even less for the taxpayers having to foot this bill 16 . The tax (levy) hurts the poor and low-income consumers the worst as they spend more of their disposable income on food and beverage than the affluent. Now, in addition to bearing a disproportionate burden of paying soft drink tax, these same poor and low-income consumers will have their health care threatened as the sugar-sweetened soft drink tax reduces overall government resources by ratcheting up inflation, meaning fewer resources to support existing programs. Similar negative impacts on jobs, GDP and economic growth have been reported by government entities in Vietnam and the Philippines. 15 R. Dobbs et al., “Overcoming obesity: An initial economic analysis,” McKinsey Global Institute (November, 2014), available at https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Business%20Functions/Economic%20Studies%20TEMP/Our%20I nsights/How%20the%20world%20could%20better%20fight%20obesity/MGI\_Overcoming\_obesity\_Full\_report.ashx (last accessed February 13, 2018). 16 ‘Unintended consequencyes of the sugar tax’, http://www.taxpayersalliance.com/unintended\_consequences\_of\_the\_sugar\_tax, (last accessed April 30 2018). Leading economic think tanks including NZIER, the International Tax and Investment Centre, the McKinsey Global Institute and Cornwell University clearly shows taxes to be weak public policy and more efficient alternatives such as reformulation, portion control and education have a greater return on investment. 8 ICBA Asia Pacific Regional Group 2 Allen Street SYDNEY AUSTRALIA 2017 www.icba-net.org/regional-groups/asia-pacific/ 2. Water Management and Usage As a peak regional body representing all non-alcoholic beverage manufacturers including bottled water companies, we are proud of our industry’s stance on water and environmental stewardship. Like SSB taxes, we understand that small but vocal community groups have raised concerns over water extraction and permit issues relating to bottled water companies. As an industry peak body, we would contend that the existing status quo regarding permit fees remain in place. This is based on some foundation facts relating to the bottled water industry, in particular: a. The NZ bottled water industry is a small user of groundwater; b. The NZ industry delivers a significant contribution to local and national economies; c. Groundwater is different to other ‘resources’ currently subject to royalties; d. Industry capacity to absorb any further costs is limited. A) The New Zealand Bottled Water Industry Impact on the Environment is Small The bottled water industry in New Zealand is estimated to be $163.7 million or 162.9 million litres. Five trillion litres of water is consumed every year through irrigation – substantially more than the amount used by the bottled and packaged water industry 17 It is estimated that 0.02% of the daily amount of consented consumptive, non-hydroelectric water is allocated for water bottling. 18 B) The New Zealand Bottled Water Industry Provides Significant Economic Benefits It is estimated that the economic benefit from the bottled water industry is $60.7 million per annum based on return on capital and labour 19 . Water bottling operations generate approximately $28 million dollars in profit between 2016 and 2017. 20 C) Water is Different than Resources that Currently Require Royalties to be Paid The Crown Minerals Act 1991 requires royalties to be paid for extraction of oil, gas and mineral resources. The payment of royalties for these resources ensures fair return is created from the extraction of non-renewable resources. Freshwater is not considered to be owned, unlike the resources outlined above. It is a renewable source with New Zealand’s estimated rainfall being 500 trillion liters. Only 163 million litres is consumed by the bottled water industry. 17 https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/97796506/The-biggest-users-of-New-Zealand-water 18 Information provided to the NZBC by the Ministry for the Environment 19 Water Bottling in New Zealand: Industry overview and initial analysis of potential charge. Ministry for the Environment and Deloitte, January 2018 20 Ibid 9 ICBA Asia Pacific Regional Group 2 Allen Street SYDNEY AUSTRALIA 2017 www.icba-net.org/regional-groups/asia-pacific/ D) There are not Sufficient Margins in Bottled Water for Royalties to be Paid Earnings before tax of 5% to 30% was reported for the bottled water industry in analysis by Deloitte. This small percentage would make it challenging for manufacturers to absorb any royalty without passing it onto the consumers. Due the high elasticity of bottled water it is estimated that a one percent increase in the price of water could lead to a 1.17 percent reduction in the demand for water. 21 The imposition of a water royalty on exported bottled water would make New Zealand bottled water significantly less competitive on international markets. 3) Conclusion The ICBA APAC Group sincerely appreciates the consultative approach of the Tax Working Group in allowing comments and providing a clear channel for communicating our Members’ concerns. We encourage the Working Group to focus on fact-based investigations and to consider any interventions that are based on irrefutable scientific research in the field of public health and environmental stewardship. It is important that any consideration in relation to tax, royalty or levy on non-alcoholic beverages, including bottled and packaged water, does not prohibit the industry from being competitive both in domestic and overseas markets. We value the opportunity to provide our responses in this document to an important review which will shape the future of New Zealand, and we look forward to continuing productive discussions in due course. Please do not hesitate to contact me directly should you wish to discuss this correspondence in more detail.

SUBMISSION: Tax Working Group – The Future of Tax Date: 29/04/2018 Name of Submitter: Irrigation New Zealand Incorporated Postal Address: Lincoln Research Centre, PO Box 69119, Lincoln, CHRISTCHURCH 7640 (Andrew Curtis, CEO Irrigation NZ) IrrigationNZ (INZ) would appreciate the opportunity to engage with the Tax Reference Group around our submission. We would be happy to do this as part of a wider discussion with the primary sector. \[1\] Summary 1. INZ’s submission focuses on the possible introduction of a water tax/ royalty as an environmental tax. We have summarised our comments below. A water tax would act in opposition to how an environmental tax should work and does not create an incentive to stop pollution 2. Water quality issues like nitrogen, phosphorus and poor macroinvertebrate health affect both regions with significant irrigated land area and regions with little irrigation. While we acknowledge that land use on irrigated land can contribute to poor waterway quality, at a national level the data does not support the idea that irrigation is the main cause of poor river quality throughout New Zealand. In fact, Ministry for the Environment data shows that regions with more irrigation have more swimmable rivers than regions with less irrigation 1 . Other water quality issues (like nitrogen, phosphorus, sediment and heavy metals) affect both regions with more irrigation and with little irrigation 2 . 3. The implementation of an environmental tax should result in the polluters being forced to bear the cost of their activities and the tax should also create an incentive for them to reduce pollution. 4. Over 80% of a water tax on irrigators would be raised in four regions (Canterbury, Otago, Marlborough and Hawkes Bay) which all have rivers rated more swimmable than the New Zealand average. This money would then be transferred to regions with little irrigation (like Auckland, Northland and Waikato) that have less swimmable rivers than the New Zealand average. A water tax would therefore function in opposition to how an environmental tax should work, and results in regions with less swimmable rivers being “rewarded” with a wealth transfer from irrigators in other regions. There are serious equity issues with this. A water tax may not encourage efficient water use 5. From a 2017 INZ irrigator survey on how irrigators would fund the additional cost of a water tax, there is a significant risk that imposing a water tax may encourage more intensive farming as farmers could change land uses to pay the extra cost. These land use changes often create more environmental challenges and greater demand for water. 6. Irrigators also indicated that they would look to reduce investment in more water efficient modern irrigation systems as the additional cost of a water tax may make the significant capital investment required for this more challenging. The imposition of a water tax may make the switch from older flood and spray irrigation systems to modern spray and drip unaffordable. This is an important consideration as it is well documented a move to more efficient irrigation system is the most significant change irrigators can make to reduce their water use and nutrient losses. 1 www.mfe.govt.nz/fresh-water/state-of-our-fresh-water/water-quality-swimming-maps 2 http://archive.stats.govt.nz/browse\_for\_stats/environment/environmental-reporting-series/environmental- indicators/Home/Fresh%20water.aspx A water tax would be complicated to design and difficult to implement fairly 7. Internationally, the idea of a water tax/ royalty has been considered by many countries but abandoned in all cases due to the complexity of designing and implementing such a charge. 8. To introduce a water tax, we need to confirm: a. Who would pay the tax and who would be exempt (or what activities would be exempt) b. How and by whom would the tax be collected (nationally or regionally) c. On what basis would it be collected (actual use or allocation) d. If actual use the monitoring accuracy required (Weights and Measures Act and Regulations) e. What is the tax rate and does it vary (activities and regional variations in water use) f. How it would be spent 9. Through the National Water Measurement Regulations 2010, all water users have been required to measure their water takes since 2012. Eight years on, there is still no national set of accounts for the approximately 12,500 irrigation take consents in New Zealand, despite irrigators having provided annual and in some cases live telemetered data to regional councils during this period. This task is far less complex than designing, implementing and monitoring a water tax on all water users nationally. The burden of a water tax would predominantly fall on a small subset of farmers in east coast regions using irrigation who are already investing a significant amount to improve water quality. This is not an equitable way to fund improvements to rivers nationwide 10. Around 60% of a water tax cost would be paid by just 12,500 irrigators, based on current consented water use data 3 . These irrigators are predominantly located in small number of regions – Canterbury, Otago, Marlborough and Hawkes Bay. This is very narrow tax base to bear much of the tax cost. 11. This group of irrigators is currently allocating a significant amount of their income to meet new regulatory environmental requirements with the intent of improving water quality locally. Is it fair or reasonable to impose a major new tax on this small group of businesses to pay for improvements to waterways across New Zealand when this small group is not the cause of water pollution nationally? Irrigation already creates wealth for society and tax income for the government 12. Depending on the tax cost, we note that many irrigated farms could face an annual cost of $20,000 (based on $0.02 m 3 ) or more in a water tax. This level of additional tax would reduce farm profitability and also result in reduced employment and spending in local communities. It is important the net impact of introducing a water tax is fully understood – increased income from a water tax versus reduced income from a decrease in PAYE, GST & Business Income tax. 3 www.lawa.org.nz/ 13. For example, in a 2014 study NZIER estimated that irrigation adds at least $5.4 billion to New Zealand’s GDP 4 . Catchment specific analysis on the socio-economic value of irrigation 5 have shown that adding 1,000 hectares of irrigated land creates an average of 50 additional full-time jobs for pastoral industries and over 500 for permanent horticulture. Creating additional jobs and income is beneficial for rural communities and for the government as it generates additional Business Income Tax and Income Tax income. We would question whether there is a case to tax irrigators given the broad socio-economic benefits irrigation already provides? About IrrigationNZ 14. INZ represents over 3,500 irrigator members nationally, including irrigation schemes and individual irrigators. Our members include a wide range of farmers/ growers – dairy and cropping farmers, horticulturalists, winegrowers. We also represent over 120 irrigation service industries – manufacturers, distributors, irrigation design and install companies, and irrigation decision support services. 15. As an organisation we actively promote best practice irrigation and carry out a range of training and education activities. Over the last 5 years we have trained over 3,000 irrigators on different aspects of irrigation best practice to improve water use efficiency. 16. INZ members share the same goals as other New Zealanders: a. to see improvements to their waterways b. to make a contribution to their communities c. to make a living for themselves and their families. Objectives and criteria of the review 17. We agree that New Zealand is facing a number of challenges, such as an aging population demographic creating more demand for superannuation spending. Therefore, it is timely for the government to review the existing taxation system. 18. We agree with the Living Standards Framework’s broad approach to assessing wellbeing, and that the criteria of efficiency, equity, revenue integrity, fiscal adequacy, compliance and administration costs and coherence should be used as the basis to assess any future tax proposals. Environmental Taxes 19. The section of the paper dealing with environmental taxes mentions a water tax or royalty as one of the possible environmental taxes being considered. Our submission will explore the idea, implementation and impact of a water tax in New Zealand. 20. We have provided some background information on how water and irrigation is used towards the end of our submission, which is important to consider in any discussion of a potential tax. 4 NZIER, Value of Irrigation in New Zealand, 2014 5 https://www.irrigationnz.co.nz/news-/Article?Action=View&Article\_id=13 21. The Future of Tax paper states that “Environmental taxes are charges levied on tax bases that have a proven, specific negative impact on the environment. They include both charges on pollution (for example, a landfill waste levy) and charges on resource use (for example, a water consumption charge when the supply of clean water is limited (page 49).” The paper also states that, “Environmental taxes can be a powerful tool to efficiently reduce pollution and encourage better use of natural resources (page 49).” 22. Various forms of environmental taxes are discussed in the paper. From the points raised in the Future of Tax paper, the following points are worthy of discussion in relation to water tax or royalty: a. Is the supply of water limited in New Zealand? b. Is there a link between water use and water pollution? c. Would a water tax/ royalty encourage more efficient water use? Is the supply of water limited in New Zealand and should a royalty be charged? 23. Based on the latest 20 years of data, NIWA estimates that New Zealand receives about 550,000 million m 3 of precipitation in an average year – 9 times the volume of Lake Taupo. About 80% of this flows-out to sea, supporting river ecosystems. Approximately 18% of rainfall evaporates after it lands. 6 Human use of water (including for irrigation) is equivalent to around 2% of our national rainfall total. 7 Water use varies by region – so for example in Canterbury 74 billion m 3 of water falls as rainfall each year, and 6.8 billion m 3 (or an equivalent of 9% is abstracted by humans). 8 In comparison with many countries internationally, New Zealand is considered to have ample renewable water resources per capita (see map below from Water for a Sustainable World - UN World Water Development Report). 9 24. Despite this, there are some areas of New Zealand where river or groundwater resources have been overallocated. In all cases, processes are underway to resolve this issue through setting river flows and groundwater extraction limits. These processes are informed by science and carried out in consultation with communities. The TANK process in Hawkes Bay, the Land and Water Plan in Canterbury and the replacement of deemed permits in Otago are examples of this occurring. Using a collaborative process allows a range of factors to be considered, including environmental and community impacts. Parties seek to achieve win-win solutions that work for all involved. Taxing water does not create a framework which encourages group solutions to be found which enable farmers to remain in business as well as achieving good environmental outcomes. 25. Where water resources are under pressure there is often a requirement for irrigators to invest in modern efficient irrigation systems to achieve goals around efficient water use. This comes at a significant cost (typically between $5,000 - $10,000 per hectare depending upon the irrigation system type installed). Introducing a new tax or royalty on water will reduce the funding available to make these investments. 6 NIWA – The Water Accounts of New Zealand, https://www.niwa.co.nz/freshwater-and-estuaries/freshwater-and-estuaries- update/freshwater-update-70-august-2016/the-water-accounts-of-new-zealand 7 LAWA – Water Quantity data https://www.lawa.org.nz/explore-data/water-quantity/#/tb-region 8 LAWA – Water Quantity – Canterbury, https://www.lawa.org.nz/explore-data/canterbury-region/water-quantity/ 9 https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/1711Water%20for%20a%20Sustainable%20World.pdf 26. As noted in the 2018 NZIER Taxing Times report that was prepared for a range of Primary Sector partners, water is a renewable resource. Water is unlike finite minerals like oil and gas resources. Water is part of a cycle. Water that is taken from anywhere in the cycle (including drinking and irrigation) will be returned to the cycle in some form. 27. Economic rents or royalties are often applied to finite resources to ensure the community gains a fair return from their use. Typically, finite resources generate super profits (the price at which it can be sold, in relation to its abstraction and processing costs, is beyond a normal return) and resource rents have been applied to address this. Using water for agricultural purposes is capital intensive as it requires investment in water storage and conveyance infrastructure, irrigation application equipment and ongoing operating costs. Water use, providing it is undertaken within sustainability limits is also intergenerational – it continues year after year. The return on this investment will not likely give rise to super profits and should therefore only be subject to business income tax. 28. While there are challenges in particular catchments of New Zealand, we do not agree that there a general case for introducing a water tax based on a shortage of water. Is there a link between water use and water pollution? 29. Maps taken from Our Fresh Water 2017 10 by the Ministry for the Environment follow. They indicate that water quality issues such as nitrogen, phosphorus, e.coli and poor macroinvertebrate scores affect both regions with significant amounts of irrigation as well as regions with little irrigation. For example, high nitrogen levels affect waterways in Waikato, Southland and Canterbury. High phosphorus is an issue in Waikato, Wellington and Hawkes Bay. Poor macroinvertebrate scores are found in Canterbury, Auckland and Wellington. 10 Maps sourced from “Our Fresh water 2017”, Ministry for the Environment, http://www.mfe.govt.nz/sites/default/files/media/Environmental%20reporting/our-fresh-water-2017\_1.pdf 29. INZ acknowledges that land use on irrigated land can contribute to poor waterways in some areas, however the data does not support the idea that irrigation is the main contributing factor to poor waterways across New Zealand, given that many regions with very little irrigation – such as Auckland, Waikato and Southland – also have significant problems with their waterways. 30. With regards to swimmability, we have summarised the Ministry for the Environment data 11 by region below, along with data on how much a water tax could potentially cost each region based on a calculation of irrigated land area and average water use per hectare of 4,000 m 3 (400 mm). At a regional level those regions with more irrigation actually have more swimmable rivers, while the regions with the most rivers graded poor for swimming (Auckland, Waikato, Northland, Southland, Taranaki, Manawatu-Wanganui) all have less than 2% irrigated land area. Region Irrigator water tax cost ($0.02 per 1,000 litres) Rivers graded poor for swimming Irrigated land in region Canterbury $40.5 million 4% 11% Otago $7.4 million 9% 3% Marlborough $2.5 million 1% 3% Wellington $1.4 million 6% 2% Hawkes Bay $2.3 million 2% 2% Auckland $0.6 million 62% 1.6% Nelson Tasman $1 million 1% 1% Manawatu-Wanganui $1.8 million 16% 1% Waikato $1.9 million 44% 1% Gisborne $0.5 million 0% 0.8% Northland $0.7 million 48% 0.7% Bay of Plenty $0.5 million 2% 0.6% Southland $1.5 million 29% 0.6% Taranaki $0.3 million 17% 0.5% West Coast $0.3 million 0% 0.2% 31. A water royalty/ tax would represent a wealth transfer from farmers in regions with more swimmable rivers to regions with less swimmable rivers. This would be contradictory to the idea of an environmental tax because those regions with less swimmable rivers would be subsidised to clean up their rivers by farmers from regions with more swimmable rivers. 32. In regards to other water quality measures, farmers using irrigation would pay the water tax to subsidise the clean-up of rivers across New Zealand. The tax does not create a relationship between pollution and taxation as this money would need to be spent in regions both with significant areas of irrigation and with little irrigation. 33. There is no incentive created to reduce pollution through taxing water use as there is no penalty or charge for those ‘polluting’ water created through this tax. In fact, it could be argued that 11 Ministry for the Environment, Water quality for swimming (2017), http://www.mfe.govt.nz/fresh-water/state-of-our-fresh- water/water-quality-swimming-maps those responsible for creating water quality issues are being subsidised by irrigators to continue polluting. Would a water tax result in more efficient water use? 34. INZ is of the view that any assumption that introducing a water royalty/ tax would encourage more efficient use of water needs to be supported by evidence. The key driver for improving efficiency is setting the price of the water tax at a level which incentivises water use efficiency whilst at the same time ensuring business viability. However, given the extremely variable irrigation requirements at the sub-catchment scale, as a result of different soil types and rainfall bands, this is very difficult task to achieve. 35. We also note that there is the potential for a range of adverse effects to occur as the result of an introduction of a new tax. 36. INZ carried out an online survey of our member irrigators in 2017 on the potential impact of a water tax at a $0.02 per 1,000 litre rate. It should be noted that our membership is generally made up of medium to larger size properties rather than small or lifestyle properties. They told us that based on their water use: • 30% of irrigators would pay less than $10,000 per annum • 19% of irrigators would pay between $10,000 and $20,000 per annum • 29% of irrigators would pay between $20,000 and $40,000 per annum • 22% of irrigators would pay $40,000 or more per annum. 37. We are concerned at the significant financial impact on a small subset of the farming community (those 12,500 who have an irrigation consent) who may be asked to fund national waterway improvements with funding directed to areas far away from their homes. Most of these same irrigators are also investing significant funding and time to meet the recent introduction of regional standards aimed at improving water quality. 38. Responses from survey participants on how they would fund the costs of a water tax are below: • 40% of farmers said they would need to increase the number of stock on their farm to pay for the water tax • Of the 59 arable, sheep, beef or mixed cropping and sheep or beef farmers participating in the survey, 48% said they would consider converting their property to other uses, like dairying, dairy grazing, horticulture and more intensive activities to make their farms viable enough to fund the cost of the tax. Two property owners said they would consider selling up. • 63% of farmers said they would reduce their spending in local communities • 56% of said they would look at reducing debt payments and 35% of farmers said they would consider increasing debt. • 27% said they would have to look at either reducing staff hours or laying off staff to meet the tax costs 39. Impacts: a. Over 80% of the survey participants said they had already done one or more of the following – fenced off waterways, undertaken riparian planting, or undertaken some other kind of biodiversity enhancement work. b. 50% said they would reduce riparian planting, wetland restoration or other biodiversity enhancement work as a result of the tax. c. 45% said they would scale back investment in funding more efficient irrigation systems. 40. We would summarise our concerns about the introduction of a water tax and water use efficiency as follows: a. Introducing a water tax would reduce the funding farmers have available to convert to more modern irrigation systems. Shifting to a more water efficient system is the biggest change farmers can make to reduce their water demand and nutrient loses. b. Introducing a water tax may not reduce demand for water – sheep, beef and cropping farmers told us they would consider moving to more intensive farming models that would use more water to pay the tax costs. c. A water tax may reduce spending in rural communities, on farm staffing and on environmental initiatives. Would tax income be ring-fenced? 41. There needs to be clarity around the purpose of a water tax/ royalty, and how any funds raised would be used. Some of the issues that need to be addressed are: a. What is the purpose of this tax? We note that the idea to introduce a water tax originated from concerns about exporting bottled water not paying their way. If the concern is that water bottlers are not paying their fair share of taxes through the taxation system then this needs to be considered and any loopholes closed. b. Is a water tax aimed at encouraging more efficient water use? If yes, then how would the tax be set to ensure it would be effective given the considerations in paragraph 34? c. Would funds from a water tax be used to improve water quality? If yes, what other options are available to improve water quality and would they be more effective? We note that regulatory mechanisms to improve waterways which impose significant costs on farmers (and irrigators) are already showing they are having a positive effect. 12 d. If funding is to be used to improve water quality then we need to understand if water users are causing all the water pollution and if not, why are they being targeted to pay for improvements to water quality across New Zealand? e. If a water tax/ royalty is not to be ringfenced for improving water quality then: ▪ How would the funding be used? and ▪ Why is this tax being introduced when other renewable natural resources are not taxed? f. Finally, what is the impact of the tax on those who would pay it? 12 https://www.lawa.org.nz/get-involved/news-and-stories/national-news/2018/april/new-zealand-river-water-quality-trends- show-cause-for-optimism/ A water tax/ royalty assessed against other tax criteria 42. The working party’s paper identifies six criteria for assessing taxes against and we have included comment on each below: a. efficiency b. equity c. revenue integrity d. fiscal adequacy e. compliance and administration costs f. coherence Efficiency 43. Should a water tax be imposed on all water users then it may be seen as an efficient tax. However, if exemptions are made, for example for stockwater use or those on Council municipal water supplies and not for irrigation then this could lead to inconsistencies and changes in behaviour. For example, many farmers use water both for stock and irrigation from the same source and it would be difficult to measure and charge for use for each purpose. Equally, many lifestyle properties source water for irrigation from Council supplies while other lifestyle properties have their own irrigation consent. Given that in both examples property owners would be carrying out the same activity and use similar amounts of water but rely on different water sources, it would be inconsistent to charge a water tax/ royalty for one activity but not another. Equity and coherence 44. A tax on water would need to be applied on all water users otherwise it would not be equitable. For example, a carwash business or a café in a city is using water for a commercial purpose - the same as an irrigated farm does. 45. Equally, water used for hydro-electric generation should not be exempt from a water tax. Although frequently described as non-consumptive, hydroelectric generation is a commercial use of water that generates significant profits for its shareholders. The use of water for this purpose means that water is not available to be used for other commercial purposes – it is exclusive. 46. We would also contend that if the aim of introducing a water tax is to provide funding to improve waterways across New Zealand, then allowing most of the burden of paying this tax to fall on a small group of farmers and growers (less than 2% of New Zealand businesses) raises significant equity concerns. These concerns are exacerbated by the fact that the group paying the tax have not been demonstrated to be the main cause of our water quality problem. 47. Over 80% of New Zealand’s irrigated land is located in four regions – Canterbury, Otago, Marlborough and Hawkes Bay. These regions have lower rainfall and drier climates and use irrigation to supplement their rainfall. There are significant costs with using irrigation including the cost of funding irrigation infrastructure, ongoing maintenance and electricity costs and the cost of meeting environmental and compliance costs needed for consents. Is it equitable to tax water use by farmers and growers in these regions while those farming in other regions enjoy free access to higher rainfall which they also use as part of their farming operation to improve their productivity? 48. Taxing water use for irrigation cannot simply be seen as a “gain” for the tax system. Taking a significant amount of additional tax from irrigators reduces the amount of Business Income Tax they would contribute to the government. Given that larger farms could be paying in the order of $20,000 or more per year in a water tax, for some farmers this may turn a comfortably profitable farm into a marginal business. Based on farmer survey responses reducing staff hours (PAYE), reducing the number of staff employed (PAYE) and reducing spending in local communities (GST and Business Income Tax) as well as the intensification of farming are all potential outcomes from introducing a water tax/ royalty. Revenue integrity and Fiscal adequacy 49. We note that there would need to be clarification as to whether a water tax/ royalty would be levied based on consented water allocation or actual usage. If the tax is based on actual use there is likely to be significant variation in the income season to season. With over 75% of New Zealand’s irrigated land located in Canterbury and Otago, a wet South-Island summer could result in significant drop in annual revenue, creating uncertainty about future revenue levels. 50. We would have significant questions about whether charging for water based on consented use is equitable, given that actual use is generally significantly lower for irrigators. To provide water supply reliability, allocations are typically based on a 1 in 10 year drought scenario. Furthermore, consents are not created equal, some farmers and growers in a catchment are not able to use their full water allocation most years due to different minimum flow or ground water level restrictions. They instead have to build water storage or source alternative water supplies to provide their required water supply reliability. The question is should these businesses, who have invested to a much greater level, have to pay the same rate as others? 51. Finally, designing a suitable water tax/ royalty system which would avoid opportunities for tax evasion would be challenging. Compliance and administration costs 52. Much of the complexity of introducing a water tax would relate to its design and implementation. In order to impose a water royalty/ tax, a number of issues need to be clarified: a. who would pay the tax and who would be exempt (or what activities would be exempt) b. how and by whom would the tax be collected (nationally or regionally) c. on what basis would it be collected (actual use or allocation) d. if actual use the level of accuracy required (implications of Weights and Measures Act and Regulations and the costs associated with this) e. what is the tax rate and does it vary (activities and regional variations in water use) f. how it would be spent and where 53. The introduction of a water tax/ royalty has been considered in many other countries, but none have decided to adopt such a charge, mainly because of the administrative complexity of designing and implementing an equitable water tax/ royalty system. 54. For example, if domestic water use was exempted from a tax, then how would rural households who use water for irrigation and for household use from the same source be treated? If urban townships are exempted this creates anomalies as many semi-rural (lifestyle) properties use water for irrigation from a Council water supply to carry out the same activities on farms, but would escape a water tax, while farms would pay a tax. Would stock water be charged? And if not, how is water race water which is used for both stock use and irrigation treated? 55. Equally, in regions where water is scarce like Central Otago, a higher charge could be imposed but this may make farming unviable. In drought prone regions farming is already challenging. Imposing a significant new tax may result in farming becoming uneconomic. This has flow-on effects on the local economy as well as the environment, for example, through not having farmers available to carry out pest control activities or graze land resulting in a higher fire risk. Iwi rights and Interests 56. INZ notes there are complications with establishing a water tax/ royalty with regard to iwi rights and interests. The government implementing a water tax/ royalty implies ownership – whereas the Crown’s stance to date has always been one of ‘nobody owns water’. Iwi rights and interests in water would therefore have to be resolved as part of implementing the water tax/ royalty. Other taxes 57. INZ supports the submissions of Federated Farmers and HorticultureNZ with regard to the other taxes contained in the Future of Tax paper. The cumulative effect of taxes 58. We would like to highlight that the cumulative effect of the financial cost of regulatory requirements, as well as the combined impact of new taxes on irrigators and farmers more generally need to be considered in terms of equity and ability to pay. 59. Potentially there are a range of new taxes which could affect irrigators – additional fuel tax, a water tax, a land tax, and a carbon emissions tax. These are in addition to the substantial costs they will need to fund to meet new regional environmental regulatory standards being implemented as a result of the Freshwater Management National Policy Statement. Existing regulatory requirements and costs 60. A proposal to introduce a significant new tax needs to be considered in light of the existing compliance costs those potentially paying it are facing. 61. We will use the example of Canterbury irrigated farms, as just over 60% of New Zealand’s irrigated land is located in this region. 62. Environment Canterbury recently introduced a requirement for most of the farms in the region (including irrigated farms) to prepare Farm Environment Plans 13 . 3,000 farms have recently prepared their plans or are in the process of doing so. Around another 1,000 plans will need to be developed by 2020. 63. The plans need to show how farmers will manage and reduce nutrient losses over time, manage effluent (for dairy farms), show they are using irrigation efficiently through metered data and practices, and undertake other actions to protect and enhance the environment (like riparian planting). The goal of a Farm Environment Plan is to improve water quality. The plans are regularly independently audited, with the frequency depending upon their performance – for example a B Grade property is audited every two years. 64. The external cost to have a farm environment plan, including a nutrient budget, prepared is around $4,000-$5,000. They must also submit a consent to Environment Canterbury to have their plan approved at a cost of $1,700. An independent audit costs around $1,200, with annual water meter and telemetry costs around $500. 65. Each farm will identify a series of actions they must undertake to meet environmental standards – for example upgrading their dairy effluent treatment, installing soil moisture monitoring technology, undertaking staff training on how to use their irrigation system, fencing and planting waterways. The costs and staff time of undertaking these actions is an additional cost they must meet which will vary from farm to farm. Meeting new nutrient limits will be challenging for farmers and may require trialling different crops or in some cases reducing stocking which may reduce their farm income. 66. Some farmers are also required to invest in more modern irrigation systems to improve water use efficiency as a requirement of regional rules. Under Plan Change 5 requirements, Aqualinc provided evidence that showed $86 million was required to be spent to modernise irrigation systems in Canterbury to meet new regional rules. 67. Further south in Otago, many irrigators currently use water based on historical permits dating from gold mining days. These permits will expire in 2021 and will need to be replaced with resource consents under the Resource Management Act. Through the consent application process, applicants need to show they are using water efficiently. Many existing irrigators will need to shift from older flood irrigation systems to modern spray systems. Shifting from a border dyke to modern spray system reduces water wastage by around 20% but there is also a significant capital costs in this upgrade ($5,000 - $10,000 per hectare depending on system types 13 https://www.ecan.govt.nz/your-region/plans-strategies-and-bylaws/canterbury-land-and-water-regional-plan/ and topography). Introducing a new water tax reduces farmers ability to afford irrigation modernisation. 68. Canterbury farmers are not the only areas where there is a requirement to prepare a Farm Environment Plan – this is required in Horizons, some areas of Hawkes Bay, Otago and soon the Waikato. In many regions there is also a requirement for farmers and growers to show they are using water efficiently. 69. Irrigators who are members of irrigation schemes often have additional consent requirements or voluntary initiatives to provide environmental benefits. For example, the Central Plains Water Scheme provides funding for community planting projects. 70. Future spending needs to be viewed in light of other investment. DairyNZ surveyed farmers and found in 2015 that dairy farmers spent an average of $90,000 per farm on environmental initiatives in the period from 2010 to 2015. Environmental initiatives they had invested in included effluent management, stock exclusion, riparian planting, upgrading systems and investing in technology, retiring land and developing wetlands. 14 More recently the Ministry for the Environment calculated that farmers must spend $135 million per year until 2040 on mitigations required under regional rules to improve river swimmability. These mitigations include excluding stock from waterways, riparian planting, and the management of farm dairy effluent. 15 71. A recent report looking at water quality measures for the period 2007-2016 has indicated that more sites are improving than degrading across all measures – clarity, phosphorus, e.coli and nitrogen (see summary below from LAWA). 16 A range of actions have contributed to these improvements, with the investment to date by farmers playing an important role in this. According to Environment Canterbury, in Canterbury where over 50% of irrigated land is located, more sites at monitored rivers are also now improving than degrading. 17 14 https://www.dairynz.co.nz/news/latest-news/dairy-farmers-spend-over-1-billion-on-the-environment/ 15 Ministry for the Environment (March 2018). Regional information for setting draft targets for swimmable lakes and rivers. http://www.mfe.govt.nz/sites/default/files/media/Fresh%20water/Regional%20information%20for%20setting%20draft%20targ ets%20for%20swimmable%20lakes%20and%20rivers-final.pdf 16 https://www.lawa.org.nz/explore-data/river-quality/#/tb-national 17 https://bit.ly/2Hksovc Percentage of NZ sampling sites with improving or degrading trends 2007-2016 (LAWA) 72. Many of the environmental requirements are new and the effects of changing farming practices are starting to show an effect with further effects to be seen in the future. However, we need to consider whether it is fair to tax farmers and growers using water in order to fund water quality improvements when they are already investing significant time and money in initiatives to improve water quality? These are resulting in improvements to waterways and are expected to create further improvements over time. Can a small subset of farmers afford these additional costs and still remain viable? How do we improve water quality and encourage water use efficiency? 73. If a water tax aims to raise funds to improve waterways we need to examine if this is the best approach to achieve this goal. We offer two examples of areas which have successfully implemented changes to improve local waterways. Waterway improvements in the Manawatu-Wanganui Region 74. The Horizons region recently released a study showing there was strong statistical evidence of reductions in sediment (suspended sediment, water clarity and turbidity), as well as E.coli, in local waterways. Modelling showed there has been a 5 to 8% improvement in "swimmability" in the region in the decade ending in 2016. 18 75. The Council took an approach of working side by side with farmers and others on practical solutions, tailored to each catchment and informed by science. 76. 683 farm environment plans, covering more than 500,000ha, advice on 'best' farm practice, the planting of 14 million trees and more than 570 km of waterways being fenced off are some of 18 http://www.horizons.govt.nz/HRC/media/Media/Water/Horizons-Ecoli-Sediment-Trends\_Final-2018.pdf the major components of the plan. Targeted action on highly erodible land, upgrading point source discharges and planting stream margins were other actions undertaken through the plan. Waterway improvements in North Canterbury 77. Another example of a successful initiative to both improve water use efficiency and improve water is underway in North Canterbury. 78. To improve the efficiency of the Amuri Irrigation Scheme, over 20,000 hectares of the scheme area were converted from flood irrigation to more efficient spray irrigation in the decade before 2016, with over $100 million spent on farms in that modernisation process. In 2016 the scheme began replacing the water race irrigation network with a piped network at a cost of $85 million. The open water race network saw around 30% of water being lost due to leakage and operational by-wash. The reduction in demand for water allowed the scheme area to expand to cover an extra 5,860 hectares, with the expanded area using the same amount of water. 79. The shift from flood to spray irrigation has also been key to the success of irrigators efforts to improve their local river. In 2001, an algal bloom was found in the Hurunui River and Environment Canterbury identified that the problem originated in the Pahau River, a tributary which flows into the Hurunui. Farmers who were part of the Amuri Irrigation Company formed the Pahau Enhancement Group. They worked to reduce the amount of run-off water from farms containing phosphorus, sediment and E.coli, in order to improve the river. 80. Some farmers chose to convert to spray irrigation while others decided to develop ponds to capture and recycle irrigation water. They undertook a range of other work including riparian plantings and fencing off waterways from stock. Amuri Irrigation established the Amuri Irrigation Environmental Collective in 2013. All scheme members are required to be part of the collective and must complete audited farm environment plans. The collective has provided support to help develop the plans as well as education and training opportunities for farmers, such as field days. 81. Analysis work on the Hurunui River and its tributaries has shown that between 2005 to 2017, nitrogen loads from the Amuri Basin during the irrigation season have been trending down. Phosphorous loads are also strongly trending down. This reduction has been achieved despite a 50% increase in the dairy platform area over the same period. The trends for phosphorus loads are attributed to the reduction in flood irrigation by-wash water - the main phosphorus source from the Amuri Basin. Median annual loads are now three to four times lower than in 2001 to 2006. 19 82. The Pahau River was named most Improved River at the 2017 River Awards, based on data showing there had been a 15.6% year on year trend reduction in E.coli levels over the previous ten years. 19 https://www.irrigationnz.co.nz/Attachment?Action=Download&Attachment\_id=414 What makes these projects successful? 83. The two examples above indicate that improvements to waterways require collaboration, access to science and technical support, alongside a significant investment of time and resources on farm. It also takes time for changes to be implemented and have an effect. 84. A water tax would reduce the funding available on farms to take the necessary actions to see an improvement in water quality, like irrigation modernisation. 85. Environmental interventions need to be targeted to specific areas of need, and solutions identified that are based on science and are tailored to the specific issues within that catchment. A generic water tax/ royalty does not achieve this and is therefore not a ‘fit for purpose’ approach for addressing water quality issues in NZ. Background on irrigation and water use in New Zealand How water is used in New Zealand 86. Based on LAWA data, consented water use in New Zealand is currently used for: • Irrigation 62% - 6.8 billion litres • Industrial use 4% - 0.4 billion litres • Stock 17% - 1.8 billion litres • Town water supplies 10% - 0.3 billion litres • Other uses 7% - 0.8 billion litres 87. Globally, around 70% of water is used for agricultural use, 19% for industrial use and 12% for town use 20 . While water use by New Zealand’s agricultural sector is slightly higher than the global average, water use for irrigation is not excessive as agricultural production and agricultural exports are a significant part of New Zealand’s economy. Relative to many countries New Zealand also has plentiful water resources. 88. As we noted previously, New Zealand has a plentiful supply of rainfall. According to NIWA, New Zealand currently receives an average of 550 billion m 3 of rain each year, or which 80% flows out to sea supporting river ecosystems along the way. Around 2% is used for irrigation, urban and industrial use, with the remaining rainfall evaporating. 20 http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/tables/WorldData-Withdrawal\_eng.pdf Irrigated land in New Zealand 89. There are estimated to be around 12,500 irrigators with a consent to use water in New Zealand, (based on LAWA data 21 along with estimated consent numbers from Otago). In total there were estimated to be approximately 58,000 farms in the 2012 Agricultural Production Census. 22 What does irrigation contribute? 90. Irrigation plays an important role in food production. Worldwide, around 20% of agricultural land is irrigated, however this land helps produce 40% of the world’s food supply. 23 91. Irrigation helps ensure that produce can be delivered to specific quantity and quality standards for export and domestic use. Over the past summer, where New Zealand experienced record- breaking dry periods coupled with deluges, irrigation played an important role in ensuring food remained affordable and in stock in local supermarkets. 21 LAWA – Water Quantity, https://www.lawa.org.nz/ 22 http://archive.stats.govt.nz/browse\_for\_stats/industry\_sectors/agriculture-horticulture-forestry/2012-agricultural-census- tables/farm-counts.aspx 23 Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/irrigationdrainage/treemap/index.stm 92. The photo below was taken on a Canterbury farm in early January 2018. The section of the paddock with crop growth was irrigated, while the areas with virtually no crop growth were not reached by the irrigator and shows the effects of several weeks of dry weather on crop growth. 93. The demand for irrigation comes both from farmers, but also from suppliers who want security of food supply to meet consumer demand. 94. With climate change expected to bring increasingly severe droughts, along with more intense rainfall events, water storage and irrigation is a sensible and necessary approach to managing through the effects and providing national food security. 95. Irrigated land employs considerably more people than unirrigated land. New Zealand socio- economic studies of a number of irrigation schemes have shown that an average of 50 additional full-time jobs are created when 1,000 hectares of land installs irrigation. For high-value industries such as horticulture, up to 500 jobs per 1,000 hectares are created when irrigation is added to land. 24 96. NZIER estimated in 2014, that based on there being 720,000 hectares of irrigated land in New Zealand, irrigation adds $4.8 billion to New Zealand’s GDP 25 . There is now an estimated 800,000 hectares of irrigated land in New Zealand that is irrigated. 97. The cost of installing irrigation is largely borne by farmers, however the benefits from this investment, whilst obviously accruing to the irrigating farmer, also accrue more widely to surrounding farmers, rural communities, regional government through increased rates, and the government through more employment and more taxable income. 24 https://www.irrigationnz.co.nz/Article?Action=View&Article\_id=13 25 https://www.irrigationnz.co.nz/Attachment?Action=Download&Attachment\_id=24

We support the review of New Zealand’s tax system to ensure it is fit for purpose and sustainable going forward. Notwithstanding our comments here, the IoD may make further and broader comment as the review progresses. About the Institute of Directors The IoD is a non-partisan voluntary membership organisation committed to driving excellence in governance. We represent a diverse membership of over 8,600 members drawn from listed issuers, large private organisations, small and medium enterprises, state sector organisations, not-for-profits and charities. Our Chartered Membership pathway aims to raise the bar for director professionalism in New Zealand, including through continuing professional development to support good corporate governance. Background The last tax review in New Zealand took place in 2009/2010 (see A Tax System For New Zealand’s Future published by the Victoria University of Wellington Tax Working Group). A lot has happened since then and it is timely for the tax system to be re-examined. The Tax Working Group, established by the Government, has been tasked in its Terms of Reference with considering further improvements to the structure, fairness and balance of the tax system. Currently, the tax system supports Government spending of approximately 30 per cent of GDP and a key focus of the review is to maintain this level of revenue. IoD Commentary New Zealand has a highly regarded tax system with many strengths including its relative simplicity. However, we recognise that New Zealand can’t rest on its laurels in this time of rapid change and uncertainty. It is an appropriate time to stand back and consider what is working well and what can be improved to future proof the tax system. We appreciate the complexity of the review for the Group and the challenges around achieving consensus among different stakeholders. What makes a good tax system was well summarised by the previous Tax Working Group: “A good tax system should minimise the harm it does to growth; minimise impediments to people working, saving, investing and innovating; minimise distortions to investment allocation decisions; and maximise the integrity and fairness of the taxation system so that there is widespread trust in it and that taxes paid reflect ability to pay and not opportunity to avoid. A good tax system should also be flexible enough to meet future government 2 funding needs and respond to changing international developments.” (A Tax System For New Zealand’s Future, the Victoria University of Wellington Tax Working Group at p 59) A good tax system should also support business in New Zealand and aid our global competitiveness (eg it is important for organisations to be able to make business decisions with certainty of the tax implications). Tax is also a governance issue and it is critical for boards to be clear about their role in tax governance, understand potential risk areas, and ensure their organisations have a tax management strategy that sets expectations about policies and practices including disclosure to shareholders and stakeholders. Challenges, risks and opportunities The Group is exploring major challenges, risks, and opportunities facing the tax system including: • changing demographics, particularly the aging population and the fiscal pressures that will bring • te ao Māori and the role of the Māori economy in lifting New Zealand’s overall living standards • the changing nature of work • technological change and the different business models that will bring • falling company tax rates around the world • environmental challenges • growing concern about inequality and • the impacts of globalisation and changes in its patterns. Businesses and organisations are facing many of the same challenges. It is essential to take a long term approach to navigate the uncertainty and change on the horizon, and to achieve better business and societal outcomes. Review criteria New Zealand (and other developed countries) tax reviews have used the following criteria in analysing the costs and benefits of various reforms:  efficiency: minimise impediments to economic growth and avoid distortions (biases) to the use of resources  equity and fairness: achieve fairness including through ‘horizontal equity’ (the same treatment for people in the same circumstances) and ‘vertical equity’ (higher tax obligations on those with greater economic capacity to pay). Procedural fairness is also important for a tax system • revenue integrity: minimise opportunities for tax avoidance and arbitrage • fiscal adequacy: raise sufficient revenue for the Government’s requirements  compliance and administration costs: minimise the costs of compliance and administration, and give taxpayers as much certainty as possible  coherence: ensure that individual reform options make sense in the context of the entire tax system. These are well recognised principles and objectives and we support them in the context of this review. The Government’s new Living Standards Framework which consists of four capitals (physical/financial, human, social and natural capital) is referred to in the paper as a potential framework for thinking about taxes and wellbeing. This has the potential to bring about a more holistic review than previous reviews. 3 Broad-base and low-rate system New Zealand has a broad-based, low-rate tax system. It is described as broad base because GST, company and personal income tax account for more than 90 per cent of all tax revenue and there are very few exemptions. The broad-base, low-rate approach has many benefits including administrative simplicity. We believe that this should continue to be an underlying framework for New Zealand’s tax system. Company tax New Zealand’s company tax rate is relatively high (compared with OECD countries), and the proportion of company tax revenue to GDP is high. We welcome the Government’s initiative to explore the rate of company tax. It is essential that New Zealand remains a competitive place to do business (including in relation to Australia) and the company tax rate is an integral consideration in this examination. Goods and services tax New Zealand’s GST regime is world leading and we believe GST should continue to apply broadly with no new exemptions. Introducing exemptions would add complexity and undermine the strength of the current regime. Other observations Many parts of New Zealand’s tax system are working well and these should be preserved as much as possible. The Group is exploring the case for introducing new taxes (such as land and wealth taxes). New Zealand has had previous experience with such taxes and we encourage the Group to consider this experience where relevant. New taxes should not be introduced without comprehensive analysis and justification (eg examining the cost of implementation, collection and monitoring against the expected revenue), and consultation. This includes consideration of a capital gains tax (CGT). The costs and benefits of a CGT have been thoroughly examined in previous tax reviews. The last review raised “significant concerns over the practical challenges arising from a comprehensive CGT and the potential distortions and other efficiency implications that may arise from a partial CGT”. We acknowledge that there is work underway outside of the review and this should also enhance New Zealand’s tax system in the future. Specifically, Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation Programme, Base Erosion and Business Profits measures, and the consultation on introducing a research and development tax incentive. We look forward to the Group’s interim report to the Minister of Revenue in September and appreciate the opportunity to comment on behalf of our members.

Independent Schools of New Zealand – Submission to the “Future of Tax” review by the Tax Working Group Introduction Independent Schools of New Zealand (“ISNZ”) is the national body representing 46 independent schools in New Zealand which collectively educate around 88% of private school students in New Zealand. The role of ISNZ is to promote choice in education in its widest sense. This includes representing the independent school view on education committees, advocating choice in education to Members of Parliament and government officials, providing services for schools, influencing educational thinking and policy, organising professional development programmes, liaising with other education groups nationally and internationally, and generally providing a forum for joint action by ISNZ Member Schools. Independent schools spend approximately $489 million annually, directly contributing around $361 million to New Zealand’s economy with a total GDP impact (direct, indirect and induced impacts) of around $697 million. In 2015, independent schools received $42.2 million in government funding equating to $1,580 per student. This equates to a quarter of the funding of an equivalent student in the state school environment. It is estimated that independent schools save the government around $130 million per annum in salary and operational costs 1 . It is on behalf of our Member Schools that we make the following submission. Please note that our comments are limited to the tax issues with the provision of early childhood, primary and secondary education (i.e. education below a tertiary level), as these directly impact our members, their students and students’ families. This is not to say our proposed solution does not have wider application, but that it is not our area of expertise. General comments and summary ISNZ is grateful for the opportunity to provide input into the “Future of Tax” review by the Tax Working Group. We acknowledge the importance of this review and the challenges associated with ensuring that New Zealand has a fair, appropriate and sustainable system of taxation which meets the needs of New Zealanders by funding vital public services including healthcare, justice, welfare, infrastructure, and education. We are pleased to note that the Four Capitals approach as per the Treasury Living Standards Framework is highlighted in the Tax Working Group background paper as being relevant to any 1 Report on the Economic Contribution of Independent Schools in New Zealand, MartinJenkins 2016 2 analysis of the purpose and benefits of maintaining or amending the existing tax system. Human Capital, encompassing people’s knowledge, physical and mental health is one of the four core elements impacting New Zealanders’ wellbeing and contributing to our wider prosperity as a nation. With respect to encouraging the development of Human Capital, through the education system, which is so crucial for fuelling the success of all New Zealanders, we consider that the Future of Tax review provides a timely opportunity to address unfairness in the tax system as it relates to participating in education provided by independent schools. A focus on the taxation of education delivery is appropriate as part of the broader considerations being undertaken by the Tax Working Group, as the inconsistent application of the tax rules can adversely impact the availability of a parent’s and/or student’s choice of educational facility and accordingly, the wellbeing of New Zealanders. Within the Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper (the “Background Paper”), a series of specific questions are posed. ISNZ considers the question of whether the tax system should provide exemptions for certain goods and services from New Zealand’s Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) is directly relevant to the education sector. While we acknowledge it is often a choice for parents to send their children to a private or independent school, rather than a state school, we believe this choice should be neutral viz-a-viz tax considerations such as the GST treatment of private school fees (discussed below), such that an independent school option is accessible to as many families that would like to choose it as possible. We also note that a number of families who opt for a private education for their children do so because there is no viable alternative, for example for some children and families living in remote and rural areas. Further, private education institutions also provide alternatives for children of families whose beliefs, values or other specific needs cannot be met within the state school system. The population of students at independent schools is diverse as a result. It would be wrong to assume that only those parents with financial means can and choose to send their child(ren) to an independent school. The children attending independent schools are from a wide range of socio- economic backgrounds. Across the independent school network there are many parents who work multiple jobs and/or require financial support from extended family in order to pay for their child’s/children’s independent school education. We consider that New Zealand’s public policy needs to take into account the value of choice in education to achieve the aspirational goals of society as a whole. Specifically, recognising that the state school system does not suit all students and the increasing unaffordability of education alternatives, we request that the Tax Working Group consider remedying a disincentive to private school education by reducing the impact of GST on the cost of school fees, where a child attends an independent school. New Zealand’s GST is a broad-based value-added tax on general consumption, with very few exemptions. While this results in a relatively simple system that is easy to follow, ISNZ considers the application of GST to school fees promotes an inequitable system. The current system charges GST on tuition fees charged to parents of students at independent schools. A 2016 report on the Economic Contribution of Independent Schools in New Zealand by MartinJenkins, (the “2016 MartinJenkins Report”) found that in 2014 independent schools paid approximately $64 million in GST on fees. ISNZ Member Schools accounted for around 95% of that figure. This tax is an additional contribution that must be funded by parents of students attending 3 independent schools as state and integrated schools do not charge tuition fees. At a family level, this can be a significant barrier to educational choice outside of the state school system (and as noted above, this is not always a choice available to parents). ISNZ notes that state and state-integrated schools typically rely on the payment of donations to fund additional activities and expenditure. A tax rebate is available in relation to such payments. We support the availability of tax relief for contributions by parents to help fund a more holistic experience for their children. Independent schools provide a similar experience outside of the state education sector, catering for different educational needs. However, there is no tax relief for the cost of such an education (either through tax rebates or deductibility of school fees). The GST on school fees is an added disincentive. Recommendation The zero-rating of GST on tuition fees charged by independent schools would be a small but significant change to tax policy that would result in greater fairness for parents seeking choice, by educating their children outside of the state system. ISNZ recommends that the GST rules be amended to provide for the zero-rating of the supply of education, specifically tuition at early childhood, primary and secondary schools. Our detailed analysis, including consideration of the Tax Working Group’s objectives, and the different analytical frameworks follow. Tax Working Group objectives and framework ISNZ notes that the education sector has a key role in preparing young New Zealanders to face some of the challenges identified in the Background Paper. These include: • changing demographics – including an ageing population and an important role for the Maori and Pasifika communities, in particular, in fuelling NZ’s future prosperity; • the changing nature of work – with those growing up today expected to have “multi-stage” careers during their lifetimes, with various educational interludes in between as they retrain – partly, because of intensifying technological change. • environmental challenges and concerns about inequality – with our younger generation increasingly concerned about the state of the planet and societal structures they will inherit. Applying an educational lens to the challenges identified, the availability of a viable alternative to state schools is increasingly important to many New Zealanders. The role of independent schools is not to replace the state sector in the provision of education, but rather about providing greater choice for parents, who may wish to pursue different academic and other objectives for their children, with this challenging future environment in mind. Technological disruption, the changing nature of work and changing demographics all have an impact on the demand for different types of education solutions. Variance in school ethos, location, religious affiliation, academic and sporting focus, and underlying principles ensure that different schools are able to cater to an increasingly diverse population with differing requirements. While universal education is important so that all children have an equal opportunity for education and ultimately, contribution to society, the ability to select an educational facility based on desired outcomes or needs for a child is equally important. The availability of such choice also recognises 4 that Government does not have the ability to provide all New Zealanders’ educational needs itself and should not attempt to do so. Applying the Living Standards Framework ISNZ also strongly supports tools like the New Zealand Treasury’s Living Standards Framework in helping to analyse the trade-offs from different Government policies. In particular, the acknowledgement that all public policy, including education and the tax system, is ultimately aimed at improving the “wellbeing” of New Zealanders, which is wider than outcomes that can be measured financially, such as a person’s income or New Zealand’s Gross Domestic Product. (That said, positive policies are more likely than not to also lead to positive financial outcomes.) ISNZ further acknowledges that wellbeing can be difficult to measure quantitatively, but agree that their impact should be considered qualitatively. We have attempted to do this below. In ISNZ’s view, the application of the Living Standards Framework strongly supports the availability of quality educational alternatives to New Zealand children. While education touches on all elements of the Living Standards Framework, it is most closely aligned to the Human and Social capitals, of the Four Capitals: • Human capital – school plays a key role in developing an individual’s skills, competencies and knowledge at an early age, which in turn benefits society as a whole. Further, the school environment is important for supporting students’ physical and mental health and preparing them for their role in society. One of the potential measures of human capital development is students leaving school with NCEA (or similar) level qualifications. New Zealand academic results show that, on average, private schools outperform state schools of the equivalent decile level. According to the 2016 MartinJenkins Report commissioned by ISNZ, students from independent schools in New Zealand scored higher than state school students in international PISA tests across maths, reading and science literacy. That report also estimates that $110 million of New Zealand’s GDP growth can be attributed to the level of educational attainment at independent schools. • Social capital – in addition to promoting high educational standards, independent schools act as a community hub, providing facilities for various community groups to come together, they instil values in students which are beneficial to wider society, and provide opportunities for students from disadvantaged backgrounds to receive a high-quality education. All independent schools offer financial hardship scholarships to students to the extent they are able. Application of the Living Standards framework suggests that educational choice is a desired public policy outcome. This in turn supports the removal of financial barriers, including through the tax system, that make it difficult for those parents who would like to exercise their choice to educate their children outside the state school system (for whatever reason) to do so. Our concern is with the current inequitable treatment of fees paid by parents of children attending independent schools, which are not only not tax deductible (which compares with school donation tax rebates for state school contributions by parents) but are subject to tax (15 percent GST). 5 It is that latter feature of the current tax system that ISNZ’s submission is focussed on. The current GST treatment contrasts with positions taken in most other countries with a GST or Value Added Tax type, including Australia which does not apply its GST to education services (public or private). The Background Paper recognises that removing GST from some goods and services is often discussed in public debate as a way to ensure that people can afford more of these goods and services. We believe there is a clear public policy objective for encouraging greater choice in New Zealand early childhood, primary and secondary education, through the removal of GST on the cost of New Zealanders’ education, if they choose to attend an independent school. Applying the traditional tax policy evaluation framework We believe the argument for removing GST on school fees is also supported applying the traditional tax policy evaluation criteria: • Efficiency: An efficient tax will minimise the impact on economic decision making. The New Zealand GST is considered efficient, or at least more efficient than taxing capital or labour income directly. While we acknowledge that the GST’s broad base is seen as a key feature of its simplicity and, accordingly, its efficiency (i.e. if all goods and services are subject to the GST, then it does not distort behaviour in favour of certain goods and services), we do not believe that efficiency argument will be adversely impacted by removing GST (i.e. zero- rating) on the provision of education below a tertiary level. We note that there are precedents with provision of “financial services” and long-term rental accommodation currently outside of the GST net. Notwithstanding the exclusion of these activities, which will be much larger in scale than private education, New Zealand’s GST base is still considered far more comprehensive than any other country’s GST or VAT. In contrast, the net GST contribution from private/independent schools at around $64m per annum would not have any significant impact on the GST base (but will have a material impact for those parents who must pay an additional 15 percent on the cost of their child’s education). • Equity and fairness: we believe this presents the strongest argument for removal of GST on education costs. Taxpayers who choose to send their children to an independent school are effectively funding education twice. Firstly, through the payment of general taxes which fund and maintain the state school system, and secondly through the payment of private school fees through their after-tax income. ISNZ acknowledges that this is often a choice, but it does mean that from a ‘horizontal’ equity perspective a family that chooses to send their children to an independent school, by not participating in the state school system which their taxes fund, will face an additional cost that a parent of a state school child will not. While it could be argued that this additional cost is justified from a ‘vertical equity’ perspective for higher income parents and families, that have choices that may not be available to those from lower socio-economic backgrounds, not all children attending independent schools are from privileged backgrounds in the same way that not all children attending state schools are from lower income backgrounds. Our concern, from a tax fairness perspective, is that the application of GST to school fees creates an additional financial barrier to families (of whatever background) who are contemplating the benefits of independent schools for any number of reasons. Tax should not be a reason for limiting choice. 6 We note that Australia considered this issue and concluded that education services should broadly be GST-free, for equity reasons. A background policy document that drew on the Australian Labour Government’s 1985 Draft White Paper (“the Reform of the Australian Taxation System”), noted that: "Education services are provided by both government and private organisations; government- provided services are essentially free while private organisations charge fees (and are frequently in receipt of a government subsidy). It is not possible to apply a \[Goods and Services Tax\] directly to publicly-provided education services as there is no direct charge. Private education services could be included in the \[Goods and Services Tax\] base but to do so would no doubt be considered highly arbitrary and discriminatory." Compliance and administration costs: ISNZ understands that one of the key concerns with excluding items from the New Zealand GST base is the potential compliance costs for providers and consumers, and the administrative costs for Inland Revenue. ISNZ believes the introduction of GST zero-rating for primary and secondary education services would be administratively straightforward. There is already a zero-rating regime, and a definition of services, to which the following education services could be added: tuition provided by a private school that is registered with the Ministry of Education, and accommodation provided at a boarding facility operated by a registered private school. Fiscal adequacy: The annual contribution of approximately $64 million to New Zealand’s GST revenue is immaterial in the context of the approximately $18 billion collected in 2017 2 . Therefore, excluding private education services from the scope of New Zealand’s GST will not adversely affect the future revenue sustainability of that base in any material way. Discount on school fees for staff members’ children We note that another taxation issue of concern is the treatment of the discount on school fees to staff where their children attend the school at which they teach. The value of the discount is typically subject to Fringe Benefit Tax (“FBT”). The rationale for this treatment is that discounted school fees represent an employment benefit provided to the teacher by their employer, the school. While we acknowledge that there is a “private (economic) benefit” to the teacher, through reduced education costs, we believe that there are wider public policy benefits from treating such discounts as exempt from FBT. Often, a teacher will choose to teach at a particular school because it aligns with their personal values, beliefs and ethos and will generally wish their child to also attend that school for that reasons. ISNZ considers that there are strong non-tax reasons for not discouraging this via the tax system. ISNZ notes that there are number of benefits provided by employers “on premises” which are exempted from the FBT rules, for various reasons. This includes substantial benefits such as car parks. The provision of discounted school fees, in our view, is fitting of being included in the list of “on premises” benefits. 2 Source: Schedule of non-departmental revenue, For the year ended 30 June 2017, IR Annual Report 2017, pp144-145 7 Deborah James Executive Director Independent Schools of New Zealand Level 16, 142 Lambton Quay Wellington 6140 Phone: 04 471 2022 27 April 2018 \[1\]

On Taxing Sugar-sweetened Beverages as a Public-health Measure John D Potter MBBS PhD Centre for Public Health Research Massey University Wellington, NZ Sugar, rum, and tobacco are commodities which are nowhere necessaries of life, which are become objects of almost universal consumption, and which are therefore extremely proper subjects of taxation.

Consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) has risen substantially over the past 25 years. Seventeen percent of the total sugar intake of adults in New Zealand is from non-alcoholic beverages; this is higher among those aged 15-18. 2. SSBs cause dental caries and this is a particular problem among children. 3. Both added-sugar and SSBs are associated with a higher risk of disordered cardiometabolic function (including in adolescents), obesity and weight gain, visceral adiposity, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and non-alcoholic fatty-liver disease. 4. There is extensive evidence from econometric studies of price elasticity (PE) of demand – using real-world data over many decades and in many communities – that shows that the own-PE of SSBs is around -1.0. i.e., an increase of, say, 10% in the price of SSBs leads to an approximate 10% reduction in purchase. The recent Public Health England review concluded that “evidence suggests that increasing prices of high sugar foods and non- alcoholic drinks, potentially through taxation, may reduce purchases of these products proportionate to the level of the price increase imposed”. 5. Experimental studies show that increases in the price of SSBs can result in: a reduction of consumption of SSBs; a shift to non-SSBs; and a reduction even in non-taxed SSBs. A very recent online shopping experiment – in which participants received the groceries that they purchased – found that SSB taxes are an effective means of altering food purchasing with a 20% rate being sufficient to make a significant impact. 6. Real-world taxation is the most informative of all. For instance, the Finnish tax on confectionery, ice cream, and SSBs showed a continuing decline in consumption of high- sugar products with the imposition of steadily increasing taxes over consecutive years. There are similar data from other countries. A study followed the introduction of an SSB tax in Mexico – involving an approximate 10% increase in price – and reported a steadily increasing mean reduction of 6.1% over 2014: the average urban Mexican purchased about seven fewer 600mL bottles of taxed beverages than expected based on pre-tax trends. Over the following 2 years, purchases of taxed beverages decreased 5.5% in 2014 and 9.7% in 2015 - average 7.6%, whereas untaxed-beverage purchases increased 2.1%. These data confirm that the Mexican taxation policy has maintained its impact on consumption of SSBs over the medium term. The recent Berkeley study showed that a tax of one cent per ounce decreased consumption of SSBs in low-income communities and increased water consumption. 7. Reduction of consumption via a tax will probably be greatest among the households with the lowest disposable income. In New Zealand, Māori and Pacific will benefit strongly. 8. Manufacturers are able to respond in rational ways, for instance, by systematic reformulation of products that attract taxes to bring them below a relevant threshold – resulting, again, in lower sugar consumption. 9. SSB taxes do not cause unemployment. 10. There is substantial evidence from taxation policies in relation to tobacco to show that price increases change behaviour. Indeed, price is central in determining smoking uptake and smoking cessation. 4 11. Shifts in price are most effective in changing behaviour among young people – both for tobacco and sugar. 12. Whether there is halo effect that arises as a result of a government signal and public discussion about deleterious health effects remains to be clearly established. However, existing data on real-world taxation are consistent with there being a signal separate from the direct impact of the tax itself. 13. There is sufficient evidence to show that any tax has to be sufficiently large to actually motivate change. Twenty percent has been shown to be effective. As with tobacco, steady increases are likely to be of additional benefit. 14. John Gibson (Waikato University) has made the point (as yet unpublished) that price- elasticity-of-demand estimates from household-survey data conflate both quality and quantity choices that an SSB tax forces on a purchaser; this, in turn, would overstate the efficacy of price rises in reducing consumption. There are a number of responses to his argument but the most telling is that this applies only to “added value” taxes (i.e., a % tax on sales price). A tax based on sugar content (the UK solution) or a volumetric tax (e.g., $0.40 tax per liter for all SSBs irrespective of price) results in cheap drinks having a higher % tax and reducing the drive to consume SSBs of lower quality. 15. An SSB tax that results in lower consumption of empty calories – based on the relationship, in both adults and children, between energy balance and obesity and between SSBs and caries, obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, etc. – will, in turn, result in beneficial changes in average BMI, in overweight and obesity, and in the associated burden of morbidity and mortality. Over time, there may be, in New Zealand, 50 deaths “saved” per year, especially deaths due to diabetes and cardiovascular disease and it will save at least $6 million per year in health costs. More immediately, it will raise about $40 million in revenue. Over time, an SSB tax is likely to be cost-saving for the health system, as well as health improving. 16. An SSB tax is only one component of a comprehensive strategy to tackle obesity – including healthy school-food policies, restrictions on marketing to children, increased opportunities for physical activity, safer biking routes, clear policies and information for the public (including social marketing), incentives, controls, and nudges. 17. An SSB tax has the virtue of being an evidence-based action that can anchor and reinforce all other strategies. 5 Sugar-Sweetened Beverages and the Health of Adults and Children Consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) has risen substantially over the past 25 years. Seventeen percent of the total sugar intake of adults in New Zealand is from non- alcoholic beverages 1 ; among 15-18 year olds, that proportion is 27-29%, whereas in those over 71 years, it is 7–8% 1 . In 5-14 year olds, it is 14% 2 . In the US, of all food types, SSBs are the single largest contributor to total energy intake, accounting for 7% of all energy consumed daily in 1999-2001 compared with 2.8% in 1977-1978 3,4 . There is a clear causal relationship between consumption of SSBs and dental caries 5-7 ; this is a substantial problem among children 8 , in whom there is a dose-response between SSB consumption and caries 9 . A large randomised controlled trial conducted over 18 months has established that consumption of SSBs leads to weight gain in children 10 . Glucose and fructose occur separately but the major source of sugar in many human diets, sucrose, is one glucose molecule linked to one fructose molecule. After absorption, glucose is widely transported into most tissues, importantly into skeletal muscles, liver, adipose, and brain. In contrast, fructose (whether from sucrose, from fruit, or from fructose-dense sweeteners, as in high-fructose corn syrup) is largely taken up and metabolized in the liver where it induces lipogenesis 11 . In the liver, fructose, uniquely, is phosphorylated immediately by fructokinase. This induces a transient, but critical, decrease in intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and phosphate in liver cells. This stimulates the activation of AMP deaminase (AMPD) and an enzymatic cascade that terminates in elevated uric acid. Both AMPD and uric acid act to promote hepatic fat accumulation via mitochondrial oxidative stress and this contributes to insulin resistance 12 . High uric acid also raises blood pressure (perhaps via decreases in renal function or activation of the renin–angiotensin system) 13 and leptin levels 13,14 . Insulin resistance, fatty liver and elevated blood pressure are all hallmarks of metabolic syndrome. Furthermore, there is good evidence that consumption of both added-sugar and SSBs are associated with a higher risk of disordered cardiometabolic function 15-19 (including in adolescents 20-23 ), obesity and weight gain 24,25 , visceral adiposity 26 , cardiovascular disease 17,27 , type 2 diabetes 24,28-30 , and non-alcoholic fatty-liver disease 31-33 . At least some of this association may be due to high-fructose corn syrup, which is widely used in the USA (but not New Zealand) as a sweetening agent. However, fructose is one half of the sucrose molecule and both more disruptive of cardiometabolic function and under less metabolic regulation than glucose 34,35 . There are data that suggest that, in many ways, fructose behaves metabolically like alcohol 36,37 . Luo and colleagues compared fructose and glucose ingestion in a double-blinded, random- order cross-over study of 24 healthy volunteers Compared with glucose, ingestion of fructose resulted in smaller increases in plasma insulin levels and, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), greater brain reactivity to food cues. Further, fructose produced greater hunger and desire for food and a greater willingness to give up long-term monetary rewards to obtain 6 immediate high-calorie foods. The authors concluded that ingestion of fructose rather than glucose results in greater activation of brain regions involved in attention and reward processing and probably promotes feeding behavior 34 . There is still debate as to whether, in relation to cardiometabolic function, the effect of sugars is direct, indirect or both 14,38,39 . There is little debate, however, on the direction, strength, and consistency of these relationships. Price Elasticity of Demand Data relevant to the impact of tax-related price changes on products are found both in the epidemiologic/public health literature and in the economics literature. Price elasticity (PE) of demand is the degree to which consumption changes (either up or down) as a result of changes in price (down or up). Own price elasticity (own-PE) of demand is the impact of price changes on consumption of the product under consideration. Cross price elasticity (cross-PE) of demand is the impact of price changes on plausible substitutes for the product under consideration. Studies of price elasticity of demand do not necessarily ask specifically about the impact of taxes but rather ask a more neutral question about the impact of price variability from any cause. All such studies are useful because those of the impact of fluctuations in the market place provide data on real-world behaviour in the absence of any social/government signals related to possible deleterious consequences of consumption. In contrast, studies of “sin” taxes (e.g., such as we are used to seeing on tobacco and alcohol 40 ) and for which there are now real- world data on sugar-sweetened beverages (see below) provide data on the impact of both tax on own-PE as well as signals of such deleterious consequences. There is a possibility that taxation produces a larger effect than market fluctuations because there is a clear message in taxing something because it is unhealthy: a ‘halo’ effect, where increased taxation is associated with media attention and increased public awareness 41 . (Such taxes are also used, of course, to raise revenue, which may or may not be used to mitigate those deleterious consequences on society and individuals.) Here, we focus particularly on the own-PE of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) but canvass relevant data on PE of other commodities where these cast light on the principal question. Price Elasticity in the Real World There have been many studies on the price elasticity of demand for foods in a variety of cultural and geographic settings. A number of meta-analyses have been completed. Among the most useful is that undertaken by Andreyeva et al. 42 , which encompassed studies in English from 1938 to September 2007 done in the US and available in the peer-reviewed literature, in government reports, and in the grey literature more generally. The price elasticity (measured as the percentage change in consumption associated with a 1% change in price) ranged from -0.27 (eggs) to -0.81 (food away from home). The most elastic commodities (i.e., those for which purchasing behaviour is most subject to price change) were “food away from home”, -0.81; soft drinks, -0.79; juice, -0.76. The most inelastic were eggs, -0.27 and sweets/sugars, - 0.34. See Table 1. 7 Table 1. Absolute price elasticity of demand for various foods in the US (1938-2007) from a meta-analysis of a total of 160 studies Food and Beverage Category\* Value of Mean Price Elasticity† Estimate (95% CI) No. of Estimates Food away from home -0.81 (0.56-1.07) 13 Soft drinks -0.79 (0.33-1.24) 14 Juice -0.76 (0.55-0.98) 14 Milk -0.59 (0.40-0.79) 26 Cheese -0.44 (0.25-0.63) 20 Sweets/sugars -0.34 (0.14-0.53) 13 Eggs -0.27 (0.08-0.45) 14 \*Includes restaurant meals and fast food †The price elasticity of demand measures the percentage change in purchased quantity or demand with a 1% change in price. Adapted from Andreyeva et al. (2010) 42 Interpreting these findings specifically for SSBs, the authors concluded 42 , "Assuming no substitution of soft drinks with other caloric beverages and no change in other factors affecting purchasing behavior, our estimate of the price elasticity of soft drinks \[-0.79\] suggests that a 10% tax on soft drinks could lead to an 8% to 10% reduction in purchase of these beverages." As can be seen below, the estimates from other meta-analyses are similar and, thus, have similar implications for the impact of shifts in price. The meta-analysis of Eyles et al. 43 was structured similarly to that of Andreyeva et al. 42 but included studies across the OECD from 1990 to October 2011. The price elasticity of carbonated soft drinks was -0.93. The meta-analysis of Green et al. 44 encompassed studies from 1990 onwards: 136 studies undertaken in 162 countries. The focus of the study was the impact of rising food prices on countries and individuals at different levels of wealth. Nonetheless, it also informs the discussion here. The greatest impact of rising food prices was seen among poorer countries and among poorer individuals within countries. The absolute price elasticity of demand for a combined variable of sugar-sweetened beverages, sweets, and confectionery was, in low- income countries, 0.74; in middle-income countries, 0.68 and, in high income countries 0.56, paralleling differences in the flexibility of discretionary spending. The study of Cabrera Escobar 45 involved a meta-analysis of studies from the United States, France, Mexico, and Brazil from 2000 to 2013 and examined the effect of price of sugar- sweetened beverages on their own sales (own-PE) and the effect of the price of SSBs on BMI/overweight/obesity. In addition to own-PE, the meta-analysis reported on the impact on sales of other beverages (cross-PE). The own-PE of SSBs was -1.299 and the cross-PE (i.e., the change in consumption of another product in response to an increase in the price of SSBs) of fruit juice was +0.388; of milk, +0.129; and of diet drinks, -0.423. The 95% confidence limits on the first two estimates of cross-PE included zero, suggesting that there was only weak evidence 8 for substitution and the negative value for the diet drinks (and 95% confidence limits that excluded zero) means that consumption of these actually fell in parallel with the fall in demand for SSBs. In a recent systematic review, Thow et al. 46 explored the world literature on food taxes and subsidies from January 2009 to March 2012 – largely econometric modelling studies that used real-world data: on expenditure and consumption from household expenditure surveys; on reported population dietary behaviour; on sales data; on data from longitudinal studies; on studies of taxation; and on survey data regarding preferences rather than observed behaviour. They reported on both the peer-reviewed literature and the grey literature and included 16 studies on sugar-sweetened beverages. All 16 showed that SSB taxes from 5% to 30% resulted in reductions in consumption of between 5% and 48% and demonstrated that the reduction in consumption was proportional to the tax applied. Four of these studies modelled the impact of substitutions for SSBs (i.e., allowed for increase in consumption of other drinks in response to an SSB tax: low-energy drinks, milk, tea, and coffee) and showed that a 5% to 20% tax was associated with a 10% to 48% reduction in energy derived from SSBs in adults and a 5 to 8% reduction among children. Further, three of these four studies showed a reduction in total energy from beverages; the fourth showed a switch to milk in children with no reduction in energy. Six studies that did not investigate substitution showed a reduction in SSBs of 10% to 25% in response to taxes of 10% to 30%. Thow et al. 46 also specifically recapped the data from two longitudinal epidemiologic studies: the US CARDIA study showed that a 10% tax resulted in a 7% decline in consumption 47 and Wang et al. used data from the Harvard Nurses’ Health Study and the Coronary Heart Disease Policy Model to estimate that a 1-cent-per-ounce tax would be associated with a 15% reduction in consumption 48 . Powell and colleagues 49 examined the English-language peer-reviewed literature for empirical evidence regarding the impact of restaurant prices – of a variety of foods – on body mass and obesity between 1990 and September 2008. The literature search involved obesity/BMI crossed with price(s)/tax(ation)/subsidy and focused particularly on US data. The authors concluded that small taxes (such as are currently found in the US) are not likely to produce substantial changes in BMI or obesity. However, Powell and Chaloupka’s review of the wider literature concluded that “nontrivial pricing interventions may have some measurable effects on Americans’ weight outcomes, particularly for children and adolescents, low-SES populations, and those most at risk for overweight.” 50 Experimental Settings Epstein et al. 51 reviewed experimental studies involving direct price manipulation with increases and subsidies in cafeteria settings and farmers’ markets. They concluded that, overall, behaviour can be influenced by price in a direction consistent with the findings described above and noted, specifically, the study of Block et al. 52 , which showed that increases in the price of SSBs resulted in a shift to non-SSBs and that there was a reduction even in non-taxed SSBs. For most of the experimental studies, the exact effects that would best inform policy, including effects on reduction of, or substitution for, SSBs were often not established. One intriguing and important observation from the experimental studies is that taxes resulted in reduced energy 9 intake 53-55 and that subsidies resulted in increased energy intake 53 – again perhaps reflecting an impact on capacity for discretionary spending, even in a simulated setting. There is also evidence that less impulsive people are less influenced by price changes, whereas the more impulsive adjusted their calories to prices; this is a rather surprising finding 54 . A relevant report was recently released by the Centre for Health Economics at the University of York; it described an online shopping experiment in which participants received the groceries that they purchased. What they found was that SSB taxes are an effective means of altering food purchasing with a 20% rate being sufficient to make a significant impact 56 . The most recent experimental approach was a collaborative study between Dutch researchers and Cliona Ni Mhurchu from the University of Auckland 57 ; its aim was to examine the effects of a price increase on SSBs on beverage and snack purchases using a randomized controlled design within a three-dimensional web-based supermarket. There were two arms: the experimental condition with a 19% tax on SSBs (to reflect an increase in Dutch VAT from 6% to 19%); and a control condition with regular prices. One hundred and two participants were randomized and purchased groceries on a single occasion. Participants in the experimental arm purchased statistically significantly fewer SSBs than the control group (B = −0.90; 95% CI = −1.70 to −0.10 litres per household per week). There were no effects on purchases of other beverages or snack foods 57 . Taxation in the Real World In studies undertaken directly in relation to taxation, the Danish food-tax studies stand out. Jensen et al. 58 undertook a panel study in Denmark of 2000 households and showed that the introduced tax on fat produced a 10-15% reduction in consumption of butter, margarine, and oils between January 2008 and July 2012. The Danish confectionery tax showed a fall in demand following the tax imposition. The fall in demand (-11.2%) was greater for confectionery on which there was a tax increase of 8.4% than for chocolate where the tax increase was 0.6% and the consumption decline was 0.4% 59 . Following the abolition of the Danish saturated fat tax, demand did not return to pre-tax levels, suggesting that, at least over the short term, there were some lasting changes in behaviour. Again, the question arises as to whether this is the impact of some wider signal to the community, namely, that a tax on saturated fat means: “this is deleterious for health” or simply inertia because people had adopted new behaviours 41,59 . The imposition of sugar taxes in Hungary 59,60 are also informative. In 2011, Hungary increased taxes on prepackaged sweetened products, SSBs, jams and preserves, flavoured beer with added sugar(!), alcoholic soda drinks, alcoholic beverages, energy drinks, and excessively salty snacks. There were several important consequences: 1) after the tax was imposed, 40% of unhealthy product manufacturers changed the formulation (28% reducing the content of the deleterious ingredient and 12% eliminating it); 2) sales declined by 27% and prices rose by 29%; 3) 7 to 16% of consumers switched to "cheaper often healthier"; 5 to 16% reduced consumption of the taxed product; 5 to 11% changed to another brand or substituted an 10 "often healthier" choice; 4) changes were sustained in that 59 to 73% of people were consuming less in 2014 than in previous years. In its first four years, the tax raised more than US$200 million for public health spending. This was equivalent to 1.2% of all health spending in 2013 in Hungary 60 . One other lesson can be derived from the Hungarian experience: among those who stated that awareness of the negative health impact was what influenced their change, energy drinks declined 61%; this decline was 38% among those who said price was the cause of their behaviour change. For sugar sweetened beverages, the comparable estimates were 67% and 27% 60 . This argues that the impact of a tax on price and the signal that the product carries deleterious consequences both motivate change. The Finnish tax 59 on confectionery, ice cream, and SSBs showed marked effects and is informative. Table 2 (adapted from the ECSIP consortium report 59 ) shows the continuing decline in consumption of high-sugar products associated with the imposition of steadily increasing taxes over consecutive years. Note that ice-cream seems to be more inelastic than confectionery and SSBs. Note, also, that smaller taxes have smaller effects, suggesting, again, that the actual price increase is important even in the presence of clear signals about deleterious consequences. Table 2. Impact of the Finnish taxation policy on consumption of confectionery, ice cream, and sugar-sweetened beverages Tax Consumption 2011 2012 2013 2011 2012 2013 Confectionery +14.8 +6.0 +2.9 -2.6 -1.4 -0.1 Ice cream +15.7 +4.9 +2.9 -1.6 -0.9 +1.4 SSBs +7.3 +7.3 +2.7 -0.7 -3.1 -0.9 Adapted from the ECSIP consortium report (2014) 59 Fletcher et al. 61 undertook a study of the correlation between US state taxes on SSBs and obesity/overweight/BMI. They showed that soft-drink taxes are related to behaviour and weight but that the magnitude is small. An increase of 1% in the tax rate results in a decline of: 0.01% in obesity; 0.02% in overweight; and 0.003 points of BMI. They noted a greater association among lower-income individuals, such that the decline in obesity was 0.08% and in overweight 0.10%. They showed a bigger influence on the behaviour of women, the middle- aged, and older people. Colchero et al. took a pre-post quasi-experimental approach to the first data available following the introduction of the SSB tax in Mexico 62 . They used difference-in-difference analyses along with fixed-effects models. Their sample represents more than 16 million households (~90-100 million residents). They showed that, for taxed beverages, the absolute and relative differences between the post-tax volume and its counterfactual (based on pre-tax trends) widened over the 12 post-tax months from a reduction in consumption of 11 mL/capita/day (−5.6% relative to 11 the counterfactual) in June to a reduction of 22 mL/capita/day (−12% relative to the counterfactual) by December 2014. This represents a mean reduction of 6.1% over 2014. During that year, the average urban Mexican purchased 4241 mL (~seven 600 mL bottles) fewer taxed beverages than expected based on pre-tax trends. This was related to a 17% decrease in purchases of non-carbonated sugar-sweetened beverages and a 1.2% decrease in taxed sodas. For untaxed beverages, there was an average increase per person in the purchase of untaxed beverages of 36 mL/capita/day. Figure 1 from Reference 57 (4% relative to the counterfactual), which translates to the purchase of 12,827 mL (twenty-one 600 mL bottles) more untaxed beverages than expected. See Figure 1 from Colchero et al. The reduction was greatest among the households with the lowest socioeconomic status 62 . The Colchero et al. findings, published in the BMJ, have been subject to the expected distortions and misinformation that routinely characterizes industry response regarding tobacco, alcohol, sugar, etc 63 . In a follow-up study, Colchero et al. estimated changes in beverage purchases for 2014 and 2015, using Nielsen’s Mexico Consumer Panel Services data for 6,645 households in fifty-three cities (populations 50,000 to 8.9 million) from January 2012 to December 2015. Changes in 12 beverages – both taxed (carbonated sodas and noncarbonated sugar-sweetened beverages) and untaxed (carbonated drinks such as diet sodas; bottled water; and all other untaxed drinks) were estimated, comparing 2014/2015 purchases with predicted (counterfactual) purchases based on the trends in 2012–13. They summed the monthly household volume in each beverage category, then calculated the volume per capita per day. Their models adjusted for relevant economic factors and time trends. Purchases of taxed beverages decreased 5.5% in 2014 and 9.7% in 2015 - average 7.6%. Untaxed-beverage purchases increased 2.1%. Lowest SES households showed the largest decreases in purchases of taxed beverages in both years 64 . These data confirm that the Mexican taxation policy has maintained it impact on consumption of SSBs over the medium term. Berkeley, California instituted an excise tax of one cent per ounce on SSBs in March 2015. Falbe et al. 65 used a difference-in-differences approach to evaluate the impact on SSB consumption using a repeated cross-sectional design that examined changes in consumption between pre- and post-tax periods in low-income neighborhoods in Berkeley and compared these with behaviour in Oakland and San Francisco. A questionnaire on frequency of beverage intake was administered by interviewers to 990 participants before the tax and 1689 after the tax (approximately 8 months after the vote that approved the tax and 4 months after implementation) to examine relative changes in consumption. They found that consumption of SSBs decreased 21% in Berkeley and increased 4% in comparison cities (p = 0.046). Water consumption increased more in Berkeley (+63%) than in comparison cities (+19%; P < .01). This is a real world before-and-after comparison across similar low-income communities in Californian cities. The pre-tax data were collected in winter and post-tax data in summer when increases in beverage consumption might reasonably be expected. In reality, however, this was true only in the comparison communities and in water consumption in Berkeley, whereas SSBs declined by 21% in Berkeley. Furthermore, the water-consumption increases in Berkeley were in line with expectations associated with the seasonal differences and made up for the decline in SSBs. The researchers’ conclusion that the excise tax caused a reduction in SSB consumption in low-income neighborhoods in Berkeley seems appropriate. Cawley has shown that the actual pass-through of the Berkeley tax to consumers was, on average, 43.1% (95% confidence interval: 27.7-58.4%) 66 , suggesting that the impact of the tax on price is not as great as is often modelled. Nonetheless, the impact on consumption, even via this somewhat weaker agency, is clear and robust. Although it is not yet part of the real world of experience, the UK Government in 2016 proposed a tax on SSBs that is structured as high on drinks with >8 grams of sugar per 100 mL, moderate on 5–8 g, and none on <5 g. Briggs et al. 67 modelled the plausible effect – on obesity, diabetes, and dental caries – of responses likely to be made by industry to this tax. This is informative and useful because it provides some directions both for policy makers and for industry. They modelled three responses: a) reformulation by manufacturers to reduce sugar content (a response seen clearly in Hungary as reported above); b) increasing price; and c) inducing a change in the market shares of each class of SSB: high-sugar, mid-sugar, and low- sugar. For each, they defined better and worse outcomes for health, producing assessments of 13 the impact in the UK on the prevalence of obesity and the incidence of dental caries and type 2 diabetes. The underlying model combined data on sales and consumption of SSBs, disease incidence and prevalence, estimates of price elasticity, and estimates of the association between SSB consumption and disease outcomes. The strengths of association between SSB consumption and disease outcomes were drawn from the literature. They found that, for health, the best outcome was derived from reformulating SSBs (assuming a best-case scenario of 30% reduction in sugar concentration in high-sugar drinks and 15% for mid-sugar drinks). This would reduce: a) the prevalence of obesity by about 0.9% (95% uncertainty interval: 0.03-1.9%) overall but an approximately 10% reduction in obesity prevalence in 4-10 year olds; b) the incidence of type 2 diabetes by 31.1 per 100 000 person- years annually; and c) decayed, missing, or filled teeth by 4.4 per 1000 person-years) annually. The impact of increasing the price of SSBs in the better-case scenario would be less marked as would changes in market shares that increased the proportion of low-sugar drinks sold. The largest impact on obesity and oral health would be among those younger than 18 years; the largest absolute decrease in diabetes incidence would be in those older than 65 years 67 . The researchers noted that the health impact of a tax on SSBs is dependent on how industry responds. They conclude that the impact on health would be “maximised by substantial product reformulation, with additional benefits possible if the levy is passed on to purchasers through raising of the price of high-sugar and mid-sugar drinks and activities to increase the market share of low-sugar products.” 67 A Lancet Public Health editorial by Lennert Veerman that accompanied the paper noted that the most likely response from industry would be some as-yet-undefinable mix of the three responses modelled in the study. The editorial concluded, optimistically but for less than entirely clear reasons, that “the health impact of the UK SSB tax is likely to be considerably greater than Briggs and colleagues’ results suggest.” 68 Impact on Those with Low Income The study of Smed et al. 69 showed that there is a greater impact on those with low versus higher incomes when studying the Danish household panel data. These findings are consistent with those from the US 61,70 as well as more generally in the world 43 . Food pricing also affects the young more markedly than older adults (see below), an outcome that, in part at least, is also related to income. In New Zealand, there are specific benefits among Māori and Pacific 71,72 . The Berkeley study was undertaken specifically in low-income US communities 65 . The impact of any consumption tax is regressive 73 even when the tax is not being imposed to raise revenue (though it does) but rather to change behaviour. However, although it is economically regressive, the impact is greater – and therefore the health benefit is greater – in low SES groups 46 . Impact on Manufacturers Manufacturers are able to respond in rational ways over and above just passing the additional 14 cost to consumers – although they often do that also. In Hungary, for instance, there was systematic reformulation of products that had attracted taxes to bring them below the relevant threshold – resulting, again, in lower consumption 60 . Impact on Employment A recent modelling study of the 20% SSB tax in two US states, California and Illinois, found that, rather than causing unemployment, there would be increases in employment of more than 4000 (+0.06%) jobs in Illinois and more than 6000 (0.03%) jobs in California 74 . There were, indeed, declines in employment within the beverage industry but these were offset by new employment in other industries and in government. They conclude that claims by the beverage industry of employment losses due to proposed SSB taxes are over-stated and potentially misleading to lawmakers and voters 74 . Relevant Tobacco-taxation Data There is substantial evidence from taxation policies in relation to tobacco to show that price increases change behaviour 75,76 . Indeed, price is central in determining whether an individual starts smoking and in cessation 75 . Worldwide consumption of tobacco could be reduced by more than 30% by doubling the price of cigarettes 76,77 . Past, current, and future smoking behaviour are markedly malleable to price shifts, despite the fact that tobacco is highly addictive. The US 78 and the UK 79 took more than 30 years to halve cigarette consumption. In contrast, by aggressive taxation policies, South Africa 80 and France 81 each managed this change in less than 15 years. Data on the Young Shifts in price are most effective in changing behaviour among young people – both for tobacco 75,82 and sugar 69,70 . It has been suggested that this is the result of the young being less committed in their behaviours and life choices. As the young generally have lower incomes and wealth than older adults and as those adults who have fewer resources are also more sensitive to price 43,69 — and perhaps receive greater benefit 43 — this may simply be a matter of disposable income. In either case, the empirical observation is encouraging in relation to the potential for limiting both the uptake and the continuation of deleterious behaviours. It also suggests however, as we have seen with tobacco, the sooner we get started the better. Impact of Taxes Versus Market Fluctuations – is There a Halo Effect? At present, there are too few data on real-world taxation to determine whether there is a difference between the impact of price changes due to market fluctuations and the impact of direct taxation and whether, therefore there is a halo effect (i.e., the tax also sends a ‘signal’ to society regarding deleterious consequences). The recent Public Health England review 41 concluded that “evidence suggests that increasing prices of high sugar foods and non-alcoholic drinks, potentially through taxation, may reduce purchases of these products proportionate to the level of the price increase imposed”, a conclusion also consistent with the data presented above 41-46,50 . Whether there is halo effect that arises as a result of a government signal and public discussion 41 remains to be established but, as noted above, data both from Denmark 59 and Hungary 60 are consistent with there being a signal separate from the direct impact of the 15 tax itself. Size of the Tax There is sufficient evidence to show that any change in price brought about by taxation (or other causes) has to be sufficiently large to actually motivate change 50,83-85 . Although the exact level is hard to specify, there are both data and a general consensus that it has to be at least 10% and probably 20% to be effective 56 ; it would probably be a good place to start both in New Zealand 71 and elsewhere 84 and, clearly, we have not stinted, particularly lately, on the size of a tobacco tax. SSB Taxes Elsewhere At the present time, there are at least 13 countries with taxes on SSBs, not all of which are for the purposes of changing behaviour 86 . In addition, five Pacific countries have import duties on sugar or SSBs, including Cook Islands, Fiji, French Polynesia, Nauru, and Samoa 86 . Further, there are parts of both the US and the UK where local SSB taxes are in place 86 . As already discussed, the UK government has announced that there will be a two-tier tax on SSBs beginning in 2018 87 . The impact of a 20% tax on SSBs in New Zealand Ni Mhurchu et al. have estimated that a 20% tax on carbonated drinks would reduce daily energy intakes by 0.2% (20kJ/day) (because there tends to be no one-for-one energy substitution with a reduction in empty calories) and avert or postpone 67 (95% UI = 60-73) deaths per year from cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and diet-related cancers. This equates to 0.2% of all deaths in New Zealand per year, comparable to the number of annual deaths from cervical cancer 71 . The impact would probably be larger among Māori and Pacific because of the greater price elasticity among these members of the New Zealand population 72 . Obesity and overweight account for about 9% of all illness, disability, and premature mortality in New Zealand 88 . Approximately 66% of New Zealanders are overweight (35%) or obese (31%) 88 . New Zealand expenditure directly on health care is around $12.8 billion. Expenditure for the obese and overweight equals 9% of $12.8 billion, which is $1.152 billion. A 20% tax on sugar would reduce obesity by 1.3% (n=~14,000) and overweight by a further 0.9% (n=~11.000) 89 . A reduction of the overweight and obese population by about 1% represents a saving in health costs of around $6-11 million per year, depending on how many of the formerly obese will still be in the overweight category. New Zealanders consume 48.2 kg of sugar per year which equals 33 teaspoons per person per day 90 . As noted above, approximately 17% of the total sugar intake of adults in New Zealand is from non-alcoholic beverages 1 ; among 15-18 year olds, that proportion is 27-29% whereas in those over 71 years, it is 7–8% 1 . In 5-14 year olds, it is 14% 2 . Expenditure on sugar-sweetened beverages in New Zealand has been estimated at around $257 million per year 71 . Ni Mhurchu et al. further estimated that a 20% tax on this would raise about $40 million (even allowing for reductions in consumption following the introduction of the tax) 71,72 . 16 Some modelling studies have explored cost-effectiveness of taxes, all of which find them to have a favourable ratio. An Australian study compared a 10% tax on seven ‘junk food’ categories with mandatory ‘traffic-light’ labelling. Simulated steady-state policy scenarios were compared with current practice and were found to be cost-saving, with predicted reductions in health expenditures of $A5,550 (2003 prices) and $A455 million, respectively and DALY gains of 559,000 and 45,100 91 . A US study comparing a sodium tax (assumed to produce a 6% reduction in intake) with those of a voluntary sodium reduction programme by food manufacturers (assumed to produce a 9.5% reduction) concluded that both strategies were cost-saving, with reduced medical expenditures of $22 billion (2008 prices) and $32 billion, respectively, and QALY gains of 1.3 and 2 million, over the lifetime of a cohort of individuals aged 40 to 85 92 . Recent Policy Reviews and Recommendations A technical meeting of experts was convened by WHO on 5–6 May 2015 in Geneva to address member-country requests for guidance on the design of fiscal policies on diet; the purpose was to review evidence and existing guidance, discuss case studies, and provide input on scope, design, and implementation of fiscal policies on diet 93 . The meeting concluded that there was reasonable and increasing evidence that appropriately designed taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages would result in proportional reductions in consumption, especially if aimed at raising the retail price by 20% or more. They concluded that there was similar strong evidence for the effectiveness of subsidies on vegetables and fruit (V and F) and that a greater impact on net energy intake and weight may be accomplished by combining subsidies on V and F with taxes on target foods and beverages. They note, as have others, that vulnerable populations are “most price-responsive” and that their health benefits “most from changes in the relative prices of foods and beverages.” 93 They concluded that taxes that are based on nutrient content have greater impact and noted that advocacy should be included in the development and implementation of such policies. Most crucially, they underlined the importance of actively rebutting industry arguments and rebuffing efforts to oppose the development and implementation of tax measures. They might have warned us also about the same behaviour among some of our colleagues who work toward the same end, apparently without even having skin in the game. Nonetheless, the WHO meeting did acknowledge that there are evidence gaps that need to be addressed, including empirically by having more countries introduce relevant policies 93 . Beginning with the high and increasing prevalence of obesity among Australians, a recent report from the Grattan Institute, presented data on personal and third-party costs 94 . They estimated that third-party (largely government) costs of adult obesity in 2014/15 were more than AU$5 billion. They argued that the primary cause of the obesity epidemic is excessive consumption of unhealthy processed food, attributing this, in turn, to people: a) having a limited understanding of processed foods and of behavioural factors that can limit self-control; and b) “not bearing the full costs of over-consumption of unhealthy foods.” 94 Based on econometric modelling, they proposed that the Australian Government reduce third- party costs by imposing an excise tax on the sugar content of sugar-sweetened beverages 17 (SSBs) – specifically soft drinks, flavoured mineral waters, energy drinks, cordials, and fruit juices with added sugar. From this model, they argued that, although taxation by itself will not solve the obesity problem, a tax levied at a rate of about 40 cents per 100 grams of sugar in SSBs, would: a) increase the price of two litres of soft drink by about 80 cents; b) generate around AU$500 million per year; c) reduce consumption of SSBs by about 15 per cent; and d) lead to a reduction of about 2 per cent in the prevalence of obesity. They went further, noting that, as about 80 per cent of Australia’s sugar production is exported. Australia would need to export an additional 1% of annual sugar production to make up for the reduced domestic consumption, suggesting transition assistance for affected producers (making up for domestic consumption by increasing export feels a bit like, “My jewels are weighing me down to hell; I’ll give them to my sister,” but, in the absence of international consensus and coordinated action, what recourse does a national government have?) They proposed that the revenue could be hypothecated for obesity-reduction programmes or used just as general revenue 94 . The equivalent return in New Zealand would be perhaps NZ$100 million and we do not have a domestic sugar industry to nurture. The Committee of Presidents of Medical Colleges is the peak body that represents specialist medical practitioners in Australia. All of the specialist medical colleges support the following recommendations to tackle obesity 95 : 1. All Australians be actively encouraged to regularly monitor their weight and know about healthy limits; 2. Introduce a tax on sugar, and regulate fast food availability in schools; 3. Promote physical activity and better lifestyle behaviours; 4. Create better urban and regional plans which actively encourage daily exercise; 5. Enhance opportunities for health professionals to provide opportunistic advice and support. The need for more than legislation Consistent with this broader approach from the Australian Medical Colleges, a recent thoughtful discussion 96 of why the Danish tax on saturated fat was abolished concludes that if a tax is to survive it needs more than merely to be passed. Further, it probably needs to be politically supported for health, rather than fiscal, reasons. It also needs to be supported, or at least accepted, by prominent actors in the food arena, including researchers 96 . And it needs to be set within a broader set of policies, information (including social marketing), incentives, controls, and nudges 56,97 . For instance, the 2014 WHO Comprehensive Implementation Plan on Maternal, Infant and Young Child Nutrition 98 notes, “Trade measures, taxes and subsidies are an important means of guaranteeing access and enabling healthy dietary choices. They can be powerful tools when associated with adequate information for consumers through nutrition labelling and responsible food marketing, and with social marketing and promotion of healthy diets and healthy lifestyles.” Response to Gibson 18 Prof John Gibson of Waikato University, made the point – in a July 13, 2016 presentation at the Ministry of Health in Wellington that is currently still unpublished – that price-elasticity-of- demand estimates from household-survey data have a problem, namely that the usual use of budget-share data ignores the fact that these reflect, not just quantity, but both quantity and quality. Based on an insight from Prais and Houthakker 99 that household surveys do not provide data on expenditures on, and quantity consumed of, specific goods but rather on classes of goods (i.e., with no distinction between higher-cost and lower-cost versions of food that may represent plausible alternates), Gibson argued that, because there are many different varieties, brands, package sizes etc. within a commodity group, the purchaser faces choices both about quantity and quality (at least as determined by price per unit) of items; therefore, if demand estimates do not allow for both choices, there will be conflation of quality responses and quantity responses to changes in price and this, in turn will overstate the efficacy of price rises in reducing the quantity of the taxed item and therefore overstate the reduction in consumption of, say, sugar-sweetened beverages. He further showed that the assumptions underlying Deaton’s method 100 to untangle quality responses and quantity responses do not seem to hold in practice, although not everyone agrees with that assessment. He argued that, because part of the budget-share response to change in price is change in choice of quality, both prices and unit values are needed to get unbiased quantity elasticities from budget-share equations. Therefore, he concluded, the quantity of food and drink purchased is likely to be much less price-responsive than is suggested by the studies that underpin the introduction of taxes on SSBs. Gibson’s argument, based on Indonesian and other studies, if it holds, would mean that our traditional estimates of own-PE are overestimated by perhaps 5-fold (e.g., if we find an own-PE of -1.0, then it really is -0.2 (and, thus, any tax would be 80% less effective in its impact on purchase and consumption). However, there are a number of issues that Gibson failed to consider: i. This 80% estimate is derived from low-income country data. The recent Sharma et al. modelling study, using Australian data, puts it at more like 30% (own-PE of -0.63 allowing for the quality/quantity trade-off (endogeneity) v. -0.89 ignoring this problem) 101 . ii. The problem that Gibson is addressing is real but applies only to “valoric” or “added value” taxes (i.e., a % tax on sales price) – and indeed, an analysis of the impact of the added value sales taxes in Maine and Ohio showed that neither had a statistically significant impact on the consumption of soft drinks 102 . This difficulty can be easily disposed of with tax based on sugar content (the UK solution) or a volumetric tax (e.g., $0.40 tax per liter for all drinks irrespective of price) which results in cheap drinks having a higher % tax and reducing the drive to consume SSBs of lower quality 101 . 19 iii. Gibson is (again, correctly) identifying a downward bias in the own-PE. However, he did not speak to the bias that acts in the other direction. Specifically, econometric theory states that each time you subdivide a food group (e.g., break soft drinks into diet and sugary soft drinks) that the own-PE increases. This is because, if the price of sugary drinks, but not diet drinks, increases, the purchaser has a substitute to which they can move (i.e., diet instead of sugary beverage). It is highly likely that the own-PE of SSBs is greater than soft drinks overall. iv. Even with a valoric rather than volumetric tax, the quality-response issue becomes increasingly less important once SSB taxes are high enough so that non-SSB beverages are typically cheaper per litre than SSBs. In the initial stages – when SSB taxes are still low – setting minimum prices (by law) could help prevent a shift to lower-priced products. Although such a policy may reduce the revenue gain (again, revenue gain is not the primary aim), it may reduce industry opposition as supermarkets may increase profit. v. It is true that none of the studies cited above explicitly addresses the brand/quality issue that Gibson highlights but that could be addressed specifically in future experiments and perhaps also by analysing Nielsen NZ Homescan data. vi. Further, however, we need to consider the totality of the evidence in this area and not privilege one study or one study design over all others: a) the data on own-PE are widely consistent across geography and time; b) there have been, as noted above, a number of informative and, again consistent, experimental studies, using a virtual supermarket or other settings; c) the results following the introduction of SSB taxes in various cities and countries are arguably the strongest evidence available – these real-world data, again as noted above, are entirely consistent with the modelling studies; d) the details within the real-world findings (the persistence of behaviour after withdrawal; the shift by manufacturers; the evidence that there is a halo effect just from instituting a tax; the evidence from Berkeley that a decline can occur across a seasonal shift that should have produced a rise) are all reassuring observations that make nit-picking at the edges of the general argument hard to sustain. vii. Finally, it is worth considering, perhaps, how odd it is that, even though an SSB tax has more evidence (albeit still not 100% certain) than any of the other interventions in the current obesity-control plan, nonetheless, the idea of an SSB tax seems to be treated as not being evidence-based – at least by Gibson. Conclusions There is good evidence of price elasticity of demand for sugar-sweetened beverages, with observational data (from the real world) – involving both market fluctuations and taxation – and experimental data. The greatest benefit is likely to be among those on low incomes, among young people, and, in New Zealand, among Māori and Pacific. A small tax is likely to be less beneficial than a larger one but, from about 10% and up, the impact on population 20 consumption approximates the magnitude of the tax. There can be rational responses from manufacturers, resulting in product reformulation to reduce levels of sugar. Thus, taxing – or otherwise elevating the price of – SSBs results in market responses, a reduction in purchases, and lower consumption. An SSB tax that results in lower consumption of empty calories – based on the relationship, in both adults and children, between energy balance and obesity and between SSBs and caries, obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, etc. – will, in turn, result in beneficial changes in average BMI, in overweight and obesity, and in the associated burden of morbidity and mortality. Over time, there may be, in New Zealand, 50 deaths “saved” per year, especially deaths due to diabetes and cardiovascular disease and it will save at least $6 million per year in health costs. More immediately, it will raise about $40 million in revenue. Over time, an SSB tax is likely to be cost-saving for the health system, as well as health improving. Finally, it is worth noting that an SSB tax is only one component of a comprehensive strategy to tackle obesity – including healthy school-food policies, restrictions on marketing to children, increased opportunities for physical activity, safer biking routes, etc. – but it has the virtue of being an evidence-based action that can anchor and reinforce those other steps.

Justice and Peace Commission / Te Komihana Rongomau, Paetika Pompallier Diocesan Centre, 30 New St (Private Bag 47904), Ponsonby, Auckland 1144 www.catholicjusticeauckland.org.nz SUBMISSION of the Justice & Peace Commission of the Catholic Diocese of Auckland to the Tax Working Group April 2018 Contact information Name Peter Garrick, Executive Secretary Organisation (if applicable) Justice and Peace Commission, Catholic Diocese of Auckland Address Private Bag 47904, Ponsonby, Auckland 1144 Telephone Email COMMISSION STATEMENT The Justice and Peace Commission of the Catholic Diocese of Auckland is established to promote justice, peace, integral human development and the care of creation. It is committed to following in the steps of Jesus who stood with the poor and marginalised in society and spoke and acted in truth and courage. 1. What does the future of tax look like? The core role of any representative Government is to foster the common good of a ‘fair go’ society rather than encourage exploitative personal gain. To this end it has a particular responsibility to protect and support the poorest and most vulnerable in society by ensuring every family has a warm home, good health care, education opportunity and an adequate family income. It is important therefore that Government accepts its responsibility to focus on building a decent society where everyone has enough to participate fully and not just building a more productive and competitive economy to the possible detriment of the wider community. Governments obtain their resources to foster the common good and build a genuine participative society by taxing its citizens proportionate to their means and providing support according to their needs so as to bring fairness and a decent standard of living to all members of our society. Unfortunately this basic principle has been eroded over the past 30 years by changes made by various governments such as reducing tax rates for the highest income earners and reducing income support for people not in paid work. \[1\] \[1\] \[1\] 2 At the same time constraints have been placed on wage-earners to collectively negotiate fair wage increases and conditions of employment resulting in an increasing gap between what people earn and rising costs particularly for families. ‘Working for Families’ has helped mitigate the worst effects of this gap but has to some extent disguised the need to establish fair wage levels that would enable a family to support themselves and live in dignity. The result of both of these influences has contributed significantly to a rising inequality in New Zealand society for which it no longer rates well in comparison to other OECD countries. The recent Oxfam study ranked New Zealand 30 out of 35 OECD countries and 115 out of 152 countries when looking at the tax structure, impact of tax on inequality and potential tax revenue available (Oxfam, 2018). A major reason for New Zealand’s decline in this area and the failure of those earning the highest incomes to contribute more to funding essential public services like schools and hospitals, is the lack of progression in our tax system. The cumulative effects over many decades of those on the highest incomes (e.g. over $150,000) paying the same top tax rate as middle income earners (over $70,000) is there for all to see in terms of the large number of our families living in poverty with the resulting social costs that erode away the fabric of our society. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that high income earners are also most likely to be among the larger wealth holders that benefit from little or no tax on their wealth. The recognition by the Tax Working Group of the four areas of wellbeing identified through the Treasury Living Standards approach is a welcome step in the direction of redressing this imbalance. 2. What is the purpose of tax? We see tax as having two main purposes: (a) Raising revenue for the Government from its citizens according to their means and using this to provide the resources to cater for the education, health, welfare and protection of all its citizens according to their needs. This involves ensuring every family has a warm home, good health care, education opportunity and an adequate family income. (b) Supporting a structure that enables people to live their lives protected from • the unhealthy consequences of social hazards such as smoking, alcohol abuse and obesity, • the exploitation inherent in unaffordable house prices and rentals and • the suffocating consequences of the degradation of the environment. While it is important not to over-emphasise the role of tax in changing unhelpful behaviour, it is also important to make good use of its ability alongside good legislation and regulation, to make a significant difference to developing a healthy, well-functioning society. Too often taxes that could provide positive nurturing support for people in society are dismissed because ‘they wouldn’t bring in much revenue’. This is a one-eyed view of the powerful influence that carefully designed and progressively introduced taxation regimes can make to enable all New Zealanders to live happy, healthy and fulfilled lives. 3 3. Are we taxing the right things? Though Income, business and goods and services taxes continue to make up much of Government revenue, a progressively introduced excise tax on tobacco supported by advertising bans and ‘no smoking’ legislation has in a relatively short time made a dramatic reduction in the prevalence of smoking and its harmful consequences for individuals as well as mitigating significantly its immense cost to the health system. This suggests that applying this in a more coordinated way to alcohol and introducing a sugary drinks tax regime supported by advertising bans could have similar effects on the personal and socially corrosive effects of alcohol abuse and obesity. Similarly positive consequences for the protection of the environment could also be effected by the judicious introduction of a ‘polluter pays’ taxation and regulation regime. Providing tax breaks for moving to electric vehicles, and encouraging the private sector to invest in renewables such as photo voltaic panels would be a useful start. Unfortunately many multinational companies continue to pay little tax placing an additional burden on local companies and individual taxpayers. It is important that Government provides a suitable legislative structure and sufficient resources to IRD to effectively reverse the situation. One way of dealing with this recently introduced in Australia and the UK is a Diverted Profit Tax (DPT). If introduced in NZ it would help prevent large multinationals artificially diverting profits earned in NZ out of the country so as to avoid paying taxes due here. The Australian Government passed their Diverted Profits Tax Act on 4 April 2017. They also granted the Australian Tax Office (ATO) additional funding for compliance and enforcement and set up a special new ATO Tax Avoidance Taskforce to undertake this work. In Australia the tax applies to SGEs ( Significant Global Entities) who have a global income of $1A biilion and an Australian income of $A 25 million dollars. It taxes those entities who make payments to related overseas corporations or trusts in any income year 40% of the sum remitted. 1 In fact Andrew Little announced on 18 July 2017 that introducing a Diverted Profits Tax was part of Labour Party policy to introduce if it was elected. 2 New Zealand risks persisting with an inequitable tax system and missing out on increasingly valuable tax revenue if it doesn’t learn from the work done in the UK and Australia to ensure large companies pay an appropriate tax in New Zealand for revenue earned here. 4. Can the tax system make housing more affordable? The desperate situations of many vulnerable families living in overcrowded houses, garages and cars, especially in Auckland is a crisis that needs urgent action on many fronts. As the Church Leaders said in May 2017: ‘Ensuring that everyone has access to affordable housing is perhaps the most important means to lifting New Zealanders out of poverty and boosting the nation’s collective health and prosperity.’ 1 kmo.ministers.treasury.gov.au/media-release/055-2017/ 2 RNZ 18 July 2017 4 Many factors have contributed to this situation. While the absence of a specific capital gains tax or other wealth taxes continue to undermine the overall fairness and consistency of our tax system, the pre-occupation of the IRD with the lowest lying fruit for revenue-gathering may have led to a lack of investment by the IRD in the enforcement of present provisions in the tax system to see housing as a place to live rather than as any easy way to make a quick profit. This has contributed not only in the cost of housing rising to unaffordable levels for most families but also to an unhelpful diversion of investment funds into buying houses rather more productive areas of the economy. As pointed out above, the IRD has a duty not only to collect revenue but also to actively support and enforce a tax structure that enables people to live their lives protected from such things as the exploitation inherent in unaffordable house prices and rentals. Reviewing the tax deductibility of interest on rental properties for example could help create a more level playing field so first home buyers have more opportunity to purchase their own home. 5. What tax issues matter most to you? The measure of any decent society is the way it protects and supports the poorest and most vulnerable in its midst. Equitable taxes are one of the means of achieving this. For the good of society as a whole it is important that ways are found to ensure that high wealth holders contribute to the wellbeing of all through the tax system. Though wealth is much more unequally distributed than income, there are few policy measures in place in New Zealand that would change this. As Oxfam recently reported, the wealthiest 1% of New Zealand’s population in 2017 gained 28% of all wealth created in this country while the poorest third barely gained a mere 1%. This increasing inequality has a slowly corrosive influence on the overall quality of life in New Zealand that can to some extent be arrested by a judicious tax system that fosters the common good rather than encourages exploitative personal gain. The OECD’s recently released study on wealth taxes in the OECD concludes that countries like New Zealand that do not have significant taxes on personal capital income or inheritance taxes could benefit from a form of net wealth tax, an annual tax on individual wealth stocks net of debt. 3 One approach that has been suggested in various forms is a tax on the “deemed rate of return” on assets, that would encourage assets to be used for productive purposes instead of seeking passive returns by simply holding assets for capital gain. 4 The Tax Working Group could also look into the viability for New Zealand of introducing a Financial Transactions Tax that eleven European countries have been working to design and introduce. 5 . 3 http://www.oecd.org/tax/the-role-and-design-of-net-wealth-taxes-in-the-oecd-9789264290303-en.htm. 4 Bill Rosenberg, PSA 2017 https://www.psa.org.nz/media/news/progressive-thinking-ten-perspectives-on- tax/). 5 https://www.oxfam.org/en/pressroom/pressreleases/2017-07-05/top-financiers-call-europe-agree-robin- hood-tax 5 It is important that tax is not seen in isolation from other measures that build a decent society where everyone has the means to participate fully. The tax and transfer system for example plays a vital in ensuring the wellbeing of those facing disadvantage and vulnerability including those living on low wage incomes. Child wellbeing is particularly affected by the level of tax-funded assistance that is provided. The rules of eligibility for these need to be simple and easily implemented particularly in response to the rise of casualised work so that those who combine irregular work with needing to access welfare benefits do not miss out on much needed support. The Government’s focus on eliminating child poverty would be greatly helped by developing a more child-centred approach to tax policy by introducing measures such as a tax on sugary drinks to help reduce childhood obesity. To this end it is important that the Tax Working Group is not solely focussed on maintaining government expenditure at around 30% of GDP when other countries are able to sustain higher proportions of government spending (up to 40%) that also enable them to deliver much more effective public services and greater wellbeing for their citizens. In many areas we are in catch-up mode that requires additional expenditure to meet goals to reduce child poverty, increase the supply and quality of affordable housing, and respond to neglected needs in the health and education systems. Our tax system can help meet these needs if it is well-designed to tax people according to their means and cater for the education, health, welfare and protection of all its citizens according to their needs. At the same time it is important that IRD is given the resources to fulfil its responsibility to create a structure that enables people to live their lives protected from the unhealthy consequences of social hazards such as smoking, alcohol abuse and obesity, the exploitation inherent in unaffordable house prices and rentals and the suffocating consequences of the degradation of the environment.

Our tax system can help meet these needs if it is well-designed to tax people according to their means and cater for the education, health, welfare and protection of all its citizens according to their needs. At the same time it is important that IRD is given the resources to fulfil its responsibility to create a structure that enables people to live their lives protected from the unhealthy consequences of social hazards such as smoking, alcohol abuse and obesity, the exploitation inherent in unaffordable house prices and rentals and the suffocating consequences of the degradation of the environment. Thank you for the opportunity to make this submission.

Te Rōpū Pakihi was established in April 2002 by nine local Māori business operators. The purposes of the network include the establishment, growth and support of Māori enterprise. Te Rōpū gives effect to these purposes through regular meetings for membership luncheons, and evening hui for workshops or presentations by speakers. Te Rōpū Pakihi was incorporated as a society in 2007 and is governed by an Executive Committee. Te Rōpū Pakihi is one of four Māori business networks currently active in the Te Taihauauru rohe that meet to collaborate on planning, event promotion and government engagement. The network has a current database of 140 Māori enterprises that it engages with regularly. The organisation has provided mentoring and support to both start up and new business operators for the past sixteen years in addition to running five Māori business awards programmes, three Māori business expos, business workshops and leadership forums. We appreciate that the Tax Working Group has identified Māori business as an important sector for consultation. While Te Rōpū Pakihi is prepared to share its views with Inland Revenue through this submission process, this participation must not be seen as a substitute for discussions the Crown should have with Māori directly. Te Rōpū Pakihi wants to see more resources and support made available for Māori SMEs, particularly at start up. Network members attended a workshop held at Massey University in Palmerston North with Hinerangi Raumati and others from the area. Following the workshop, Te Rōpū Pakihi members recommend that the TWG consider the following matters: • New taxes, such as a capital gains tax or a land tax, will impact on Māori and it is important to ensure that these impacts are assessed appropriately. • A capital gains tax was supported in principle, but at a relatively low rate and only on gains received from commercial activities. In addition, the group called for the exemption of any tax on personnel gains from the sale of the whānau home or Māori lands. • “Anything that happens on our land is cultural”. The group considered that tax revenue generated from any land tax associated with a particular region should go back to that region by way of the marae or the District Māori Councils under the Māori Community Development Act 1962. • Revenue generated from any environmental tax should be redistributed to/by Māori for Māori investment in the restoration of the environmental resource through the Māori Community Development Act mechanism above. • There was support in principle for taxes on the commercial use of water. Any water tax should also only be imposed on the biggest water users, by having a tax-free threshold of water use below which no tax would be imposed. This would ensure that SME’s drawing on water for, as an example, a coffee shop, will not be disadvantaged. • Resource consents for the commercial use of water (for example, irrigation) can be quite valuable, so there is a need to consider the tax treatment of those consents. • GST should be removed from bottled water so that it is a more attractive option for consumers in relation to unhealthy drinks. • The cost of fresh fruit and vegetables was raised as an issue, and there was support for removing GST from fresh fruit and vegetables to make them comparatively cheaper. • There was support within the membership for a tax on single-use plastic shopping bags. • Tikanga Māori has a place in designing all policy and administrative solutions fit for Māori. • The suggestion of a tax on certain elements of settlement redress is strongly opposed by the membership. It is impossible for the nation to arrive at a value for the taonga assets of Māori and any form of tax on those assets would be inappropriate. • The definition of “koha” should be determined by tikanga Māori, rather than loose, equivalent western concepts. • Māori voluntary contribution or volunteerism should be encouraged and tax barriers should be minimised as much as possible. For example, how should we treat koha (money or in-kind gifts) that is provided to kaumatua who help groups to understand or carry out Māori customary practices i.e. powhiri? The group suggested a form of “charitable status” or “exemption” attached to those who undertake voluntary work of this nature. • The casualisation of the labour market is a particularly vexing issue for Māori, as it can create instances of over-taxation at source especially if a person has a number of part-time jobs – these problems relate to secondary tax i.e., caregivers. • Tax is complex for start-up firms and education and mentoring should be offered to these entrepreneurs so that they get it right from the start. In addition, it is not just about tax, financial literacy is an important issue for Māori start-up firms. • A SME tax regime with a lower tax rate was supported. It was also pointed out however that greater awareness of existing range of business vehicles would help SMEs and start-up companies. • Charitable status of marae is an important issue for Māori in the regions. There are barriers for marae to de-register from the Charities Register because of the requirement to value their physical assets on exiting. More clarity is required for Marae in this area. • Charities law is too restrictive in terms of the kinds of activities a charity can carry out. For example, rules prohibiting making grants to whānau businesses. Some small transfers of this kind should be allowed without affecting the entity’s charitable status. Alternatively, iwi/hapū could be considered to be within one circle of membership. • The requirement to file tax returns even if you only receive a small Māori authority distribution imposes undue compliance costs. An exemption from filing a return was proposed if the total amount of Māori authority distributions received in a year falls below a certain threshold. • Intangible cultural assets (for example, the haka) should be protected. The use of intangible cultural assets by non-Māori should be taxed on the value created for the business and/or their brand as a result of the use of such assets. Currently cultural assets are used to derive profits, and no value is returned to the owner(s) of those cultural assets. • Tax concessions should be offered to social enterprises to reflect the social good provided by the entity. • The Māori Authorities tax rate should be reduced to reflect the important role that these authorities play within their iwi and communities. Members of Te Rōpū Pakihi appreciate the opportunity to engage in this consulation process and are available for further discussions if necessary.

Kiwi Property is the largest listed property vehicle and a member of the S&P/NZX 15 Index. Kiwi Property invests in a diversified portfolio of retail and office assets, with a total value of $3.1 billion and has over 1,000 tenants. Kiwi Property would like to reiterate the following points in support of the PCNZ submission: Fairness and current inconsistencies On the issue of fairness of the current tax system, a key tax distortion, which disproportionately impacts Kiwi Property and all other entities and individuals owning commercial property, was the 2010 removal of tax depreciation on non-residential building structures. That change has resulted in real economic costs for building owners, as there is no tax recognition for economic depreciation on building structures, unlike every other business asset, or for the cost of required capital upgrades – for example, to seismically strengthen building structures to prevent loss of life or to incorporate new building technologies. Local authorities in provincial areas rely on commercial property rates income from typically older building stock which is often unreinforced and lacking seismic resilience. If this building stock is not strengthened a significant portion of their rating base will be removed and these older buildings will potentially fall into disuse. In relation to seismic upgrades, it is only since the devastating events in Christchurch that this serious and fundamental tax anomaly, which Inland Revenue officials have conceded exists with the removal of depreciation for the building structure, has come to light. It is therefore deeply concerning that, on present track, it continues to be ignored. Continuing failure to address this anomaly acts as a tax disincentive to earthquake strengthening and prolongs the uncertainty for property owners who are already incurring costs in the expectation of a future legislative fix, while making any fix increasingly retrospective so as to deal with past expenditure. Put simply, it is untenable that commercial property owners can currently claim a tax deduction for a building that collapses as a result of an earthquake (and maybe kills people) but tax law does not take into account the costs of strengthening a building so that it does not collapse (and saves lives). Commercial building structures do become obsolete over time and need replacement or upgrading. Obsolescence of commercial buildings occurs as business needs, tenant expectations, seismic and building resilience standards, environmental performance standards and technology changes over time. Tenants, notably including central government tenants, expect existing buildings to meet seismic resilience standards equivalent to 80% of New Building Standard (NBS) or greater which is significantly above the minimum requirement of the Building Act of 34% NBS. 2 Tenants will not lease space in commercial buildings which they do not consider to be safe or seismically resilient and obsolete buildings do not meet this requirement. Increasingly tenants also have a desire for environmentally sustainable buildings. Kiwi Property believes the 2010 tax change to remove tax depreciation of building structures was largely the result of a fiscal balancing exercise by the then Government, rather than for principled tax policy reasons as non-residential building structures clearly do depreciate due to obsolescence and other factors. Therefore, Kiwi Property strongly urge the Tax Working Group to recommend the reinstatement of tax depreciation for non-residential building structures. Other tax bases – capital gains tax, land taxes and stamp duties One of the questions posed in the submissions background document is whether New Zealand needs additional tax bases, including to improve fairness in the tax system. In principle, Kiwi Property agrees that a comprehensive capital gains tax would improve fairness in the tax system. Our concern (borne out by international experience) is that real world capital gains taxes tend to be sub-optimal, both in terms of their coverage and ability to be a viable and stable revenue source. At the outset, the consideration of a capital gains tax by the Tax Working Group is hamstrung by it not being able to be applied to the family home. This is the most tax advantaged asset, per the Tax Working Group’s own analysis in its submissions background document. This is particularly relevant as one of the key questions asked is whether a capital gains tax would improve housing affordability. Kiwi would like to draw a clear distinction between the residential property market and the non-residential (i.e. commercial, industrial and retail) property sector. Addressing the housing affordability objective for the former should not result in a general application of any solution to the latter. The practical design issues with a capital gains tax also cannot be extricated from whether a capital gains tax is an appropriate tax reform. In Kiwi Property’s view, key design issues that would need to be resolved are: • over-taxation due to a capital gains tax taxing inflationary gains (particularly relevant for long-lived assets, such as property): • double taxation of shares (in the absence of imputation or similar, to offer relief); • integration with the current Portfolio Investment Entity tax regime; • reinvestment of capital proceeds triggering tax labilities (which will be the case in the absence of any “rollover relief” in these circumstances); and • potential ring-fencing of capital losses (while this is the approach with offshore regimes, this will add to complexity and the unfairness). Kiwi Property does not consider that the trade-offs that would be required to make a general capital gains tax workable justify the fairness objective, which would be incremental at best in our view, or the alternative tax base objective. However, we acknowledge that this will be a balancing exercise for policy makers. Therefore, if a capital gains tax is considered necessary, on balance, to address fairness or other concerns, then its workability is paramount. The key design issues identified above should be clearly addressed. 3 Kiwi Property also considers that other tax base broadening options, such as a land tax or stamp duties, suffer from similar drawbacks to a capital gains tax that excludes the family home (and the land below it) from the base. These other types of taxes have the added distortion that they would apply to only a single asset class – non-residential land or property – which raises significant fairness concerns. Kiwi Property therefore does not support the introduction of either tax type. Taxation of savings Kiwi Property agrees with comments in the submissions background document that the current differential tax treatment of different savings should be made more consistent. Listed property vehicles, such as Kiwi Property, give a range of New Zealanders (from institutional investors, such as Kiwi Saver funds, to super annuitants to ordinary “mums” and “dads”) exposure to an asset class that they would not otherwise have access to. It should be noted that many investors, including retirees, typically favour NZ commercial property investment as it provides a relatively low-risk return and a regular income stream (rather than for capital returns, which can be volatile). This is important both for the diversification of their financial risk and New Zealand’s macroeconomic risk from over exposure to housing. Kiwi Property recommends that the Tax Working Group differentiates between residential and commercial property investment. Commercial property investment provides the infrastructure of business and services the savings industry by producing rental returns (upon which income tax is paid). Investment in residential property is very often undertaken for the purposes of seeking capital gain, upon which historically little or no tax has been paid. Kiwi Property strongly supports the current Portfolio Investment Entity tax regime, in that regard, recognising that this was an attempt at the time to level the tax playing field. We note that the 2012 Savings Working Group concluded that this change did not go far enough. Kiwi would support further changes aimed at improving the consistency in the taxation of different forms of savings. Kiwi Property would like to thank the Tax Working Group for the opportunity to submit on the discussion questions. If you would like to discuss any aspect of our submission with us, please do not hesitate to contact Gavin Parker on We would also welcome the opportunity to meet with members of the Tax Working Group in person. Yours sincerely Gavin Parker Chief Operating Officer \[1\] \[1\] \[1\] 30 April 2018 Tax Working Group Email: submissions@taxworkinggroup.govt.nz Dear Tax Working Group members, SUBMISSION: Tax Working Group Discussion Questions 1. Recommendations 1.1. Property Council New Zealand (“Property Council”) supports the intention of the Tax Working Group to review our current tax regime. We wish to thank the Tax Working Group for the opportunity to submit on the discussion questions. 1.2. We understand the complicated task of meeting all the needs of a good tax system. To assist your consideration of the system, Property Council’s key comments and suggestions are: a. We support the ‘broad-based, low-rate’ approach recognising that all economic activities are broadly taxed on a similar basis; b. Commercial and residential property are different. The tax system should recognise commercial property as a business asset and it should be treated as such; c. Reinstating depreciation on commercial property. By not recognising that commercial building structures become obsolete and depreciate, our current tax law is acting as a disincentive to continuous improvement of New Zealand’s building stock, particularly in relation to seismic performance; d. We conditionally support a capital gains tax if it were to account for capital losses and allowed for depreciation of commercial property; e. We strongly support the current PIE taxation regime and recommend that the findings of the Savings Working Group 2010 in relation to the PIE tax rates be considered; f. We do not support other transactional taxes as they are inefficient and insufficient funds are likely to be collected to make them viable; and g. Land taxes could be a blunt instrument likely to have many negative unintended consequences, including a significant drop in property values. If the Working Group were to consider other taxes targeted at property, such as value capture taxes to fund infrastructure, Property Council would like to discuss how those taxes could be made to work with minimal perverse consequences. 2. Introduction 2.1. Property Council is a member-led, not-for-profit organisation offering a collective voice for the commercial property industry. The property industry is currently the largest industry in New Zealand with a direct contribution to GDP of $29.8 billion or 13%. In a sense the property sector is a foundation of New Zealand’s economy and caters for growth by developing, building and owning the buildings that house businesses. \[1\] 2.2. Our membership is broad and includes some of the largest commercial property holders in New Zealand, including several significant NZX listed companies. These companies own commercial property providing reliable rental income return on savings invested by retirees through Kiwisaver and other superannuation funds. Our members include companies that undertake a range of large-scale residential and commercial development projects, including large commercial buildings, industrial parks, and retail precincts. 2.3. Property Council suggests that any changes to the taxation of such an important economic sector should be carefully considered. 2.4. Our views on the tax system are set out below. We have also attached more detailed analysis in support of our submission (Attachment A: Property Council TWG Detailed Analysis Submission – April 2018). 3. Overall Design of the Tax System 3.1. Property Council supports the ‘broad-based, low-rate’ approach being that all economic activities are broadly taxed on a similar basis. We also note that our broad-based approach is simple and particularly attractive to offshore investors. 3.2. By its nature the commercial property sector is extremely capital intensive, with developments and buildings worth billions of dollars. Overseas investment is an important source of capital given the limitations of New Zealand's small capital market. Our simple tax system can be attractive to this overseas investment and we would be reluctant to see this change. 4. Differentiating Commercial Property 4.1. Commercial and residential property are different, both as property and why investors typically invest in property. Commercial property squarely fits in the physical capital sphere of the productive economy. It is designed to meet the needs of the businesses and industries it accommodates. Property Council recommends that the Tax Working Group differentiates commercial and residential property in its considerations. 4.2. Commercial property investors typically invest to secure a rental or income return. A large proportion of the capital invested in commercial property comes from retirees (Kiwisaver and superannuation funds) investing savings to produce regular income to support their retirement. Commercial property investors provide the infrastructure of business and, in exchange for that accommodation, those businesses pay rent which provides the desired income return that investors are seeking and upon which income tax is paid. 4.3. However, some investors in residential property may do so for the purposes of capital gain in a market. This can come about through demand exceeding supply for housing or house prices steadily increasing over time. Investing in residential property for rental or income return often makes little sense because rental returns on residential property are typically very low as a percentage of the property’s value. After the costs of ownership, the net income return can be even lower. Investors in residential property are motivated by the historical significant capital gains that can be available, which often has no tax paid. 4.4. Property Council recommends that the Tax Working Group also differentiates between residential and commercial property investment. Commercial property investment provides the infrastructure of business and services that the savings industry uses to produces rental returns (upon which income tax is paid). However, investment in residential property is often undertaken for the purposes of seeking capital gain, upon which historically little or no tax has been paid. 5. Depreciation 5.1. As the Tax Working Group will be aware the previous government removed the ability to depreciate commercial property. Property Council believes the decision conflated residential and commercial property as a single asset type and did not recognise the different economic roles they play. Property Council does not believe that it was a principled tax decision because depreciation of business assets used to generate taxable income is a cost of doing business. We believe it is illogical for one business asset to be treated very differently from other business assets. The decision made New Zealand one of only a handful of countries in the world that does not allow depreciation of commercial property. 5.2. Commercial building structures, like machinery and durable consumer goods, become obsolete over time and need replacing or upgrading. Building structures, including their services and fitouts all become obsolete over time. Obsolescence of commercial buildings occurs as business needs, tenant expectations, standards (building and environmental) and technology changes over time. 5.3. An obvious demonstration of this obsolescence was the failure of many building structures during the 2011 Canterbury and 2016 Kaikoura earthquakes. 5.4. Further, r esearch following the Canterbury earthquakes has shown that a yellow sticker on an at-risk building can lead to a significant devaluation instantly of up to 50 per cent of its original value, “First, buildings that have been declared earthquake-prone prior to the time of sale experience a statistically significant reduction in sale price following the Christchurch earthquakes. Second, this effect was more pronounced in the CBD than in suburban areas”. 1 . Yet the tax system disincentivises building owners from earthquake strengthening their buildings. A perverse outcome of the current tax system is that if a building falls down in an earthquake the loss is tax deductible but work to strengthen a building is not. 5.5. Tenants, including central government tenants, expectations around existing buildings have also changed since the earthquakes. They now expect buildings to meet seismic resilience standards equivalent to 80 per cent of the New Building Standard (NBS) or greater, which is significantly above the minimum requirement of the Building Act of 34 per cent NBS. Tenants will not lease space in commercial buildings which are not considered safe or seismically resilient. Obsolete building structures do not meet this requirement. 5.6. Commercial building structures also become obsolete as business needs and tenant expectations around what they need from their commercial space change. Such changes include, desire for modern services, better inter-tenancy connectivity, better building energy and other environmental performance, and general functionality. It is common for buildings that were considered ‘prime’ when built to slowly descend the building quality matrix to ‘A’ grade, then ‘B’ grade etc. As this happens, the building's rental income and building value typically declines, when absent of any further capital improvements. 5.7. By not recognising that commercial building structures become obsolete and depreciate, current tax law is acting as a disincentive to continuous improvement of New Zealand’s building stock. This has hindered building owners undertaking building upgrades and seismic 1 Timar, L., Grimes A., and Fabling R., Motu Working Paper, Before a Fall: Impacts of Earthquake Regulation and Building Codes on the Commercial Building Market, October 2015, pg 12. strengthening. This represents an economic cost in unrealised productivity increases and environmental gains that could be gained from the building stock 5.8. The previous Government removed depreciation on commercial building structures it said it was open to reconsidering if evidence showed that commercial buildings did depreciate. There is ample evidence from around the world and New Zealand, including research by KPMG and the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research (NZIER), which shows that non-residential buildings do depreciate (Attachments B and C: KPMG - Tax Depreciation - Non-residential buildings (8 February 2010) and NZIER report (8 Feb 2010)). 5.9. Property Council recommends that the Tax Working Group recommend reinstatement of depreciation on commercial property structure. This would recognise the contribution the commercial property sector plays in the productive economy, remove current disincentives to earthquake strengthening created by current tax law and promote safe and sustainable buildings. 6. Capital Gains 6.1. For a capital gains tax to work effectively in practice it needs to be universal. We note one of the key overriding drivers out of scope for the Tax Working Group’s terms of reference is that the family home is not to be considered. Given the complexity of designing a capital gains tax with all its intricacies, including carve-outs, Property Council doubts the benefits would outweigh the administrative and economic costs. 6.2. Property Council notes that significant consideration is being given in the Tax Working Group’s work to a potential capital gains tax. Property Council could conditionally support a capital gains tax if the tax system were to account for capital losses (and expenditure on capital upgrades) and allowed for depreciation of commercial property. 6.3. On balance if a capital gains tax were to be implemented we suggest it be triggered when a property is sold, with appropriate roll-over provisions. This would be the easiest to implement and would avoid adjustments required if estimates of unrealised gains are made. Property Council would also not like to see capital losses ring-fenced as it could disincentivise capital shifting from one asset class to another. 7. PIE Regime 7.1. Property Council is a strong supporter of the PIE taxation regime. This regime has helped collectivise commercial and industrial property investment to operate on a level tax playing field with other types of investment. 7.2. We also support the findings of the Savings Working Group 2010 in relation to the PIE tax rates recommending that the top PIE rate should be maintained at a minimum of five percentage points below the top personal marginal rate, and preferably 10 per cent points below. 7.3. Property Council also suggests that our current PIE regime approximates a “Exempt-Exempt- Tax” or a “Tax-tax-Exempt” models for taxing savings of other countries which helps keep New Zealand competitive and attractive to overseas investment. 8. Stamp Duties and Similar Taxes 8.1. Property Council notes that the Tax Working Group has asked questions considering other taxes such as stamp, cheque, gift and estate duties, and land tax. We note, due to it being an inheritance tax, estate duties are unlikely to be considered. 8.2. Stamp and cheque duties, being transactional taxes, have high efficiency costs although are unlikely to raise sufficient revenue to justify their administration if owner-occupier housing is excluded. We note New Zealand previously had these taxes and repealed due to insufficient funds collected and suggest nothing has changed currently to make them viable. 9. Land Tax, Rates, Value Capture Tax and Housing Affordability 9.1. Land taxes although believed by economists to be a leveller in any tax system, because taxing land is more efficient compared to taxing other things. Property Council believes this is not the case. 2010 IRD analysis suggested a land tax could potentially lead to a decrease in property values by up to 20 per cent. 9.2. Any land tax would need to interact with the local government rating system. Rates are a tax on real estate property used to fund local government services (in lieu of using general taxation). They are a significant portion of a council’s operating revenue. Introduction of a central government land tax could negatively impact that important stream of local government funding. 9.3. Land taxes could be used to counter land-banking to address one of the causes of housing affordability. However, a national land tax that applies to all land would be a blunt instrument likely to have many negative unintended consequences. Other more targeted instruments could better achieve that outcome. 9.4. We note that one such option, value capture taxes, is not discussed in the discussion document. Value capture is one way to fund infrastructure that enables both residential and commercial development. Value capture could be considered a form of a capital gains tax that allows the government to recoup value from the decisions (e.g. zoning) or investments (such as provision of infrastructure) that have driven, at least in part, capital appreciation of land. Value capture taxes can be complicated to design and risk unintended consequences. 9.5. If the Tax Working Group proposes changes to how property is taxed Property Council would like the Tax Working Group to provide more detailed analysis of all the taxes faced by property, including rates, and consult further on the design of any proposed changes (e.g. value capture) that will affect property. Our members are happy to work with the Tax Working Group to assist with this analysis. 10. Conclusion 10.1. Property Council thanks the Tax Working Group for the opportunity to submit on the discussion questions. We would also like to speak to our submission and ask that the Tax Working Group consider an oral submission. 10.2. We also wish to note our support for the BusinessNZ submission. 10.3.

Our primary goal is the creation and retention of well designed, functional and sustainably built urban environments that contribute to New Zealand’s overall prosperity. Property Council supports the formulation and implementation of a statutory and regulatory framework that enhances economic growth and development. To achieve these goals, our advocacy and research focus on urban strategy, infrastructure, regulation and compliance, legislation and capital markets. Over the years, Property Council has built and maintained a good rapport with central and local government agencies and is often relied upon for advice, comments and feedback on matters of local, regional and national importance. Our members drive economic and social growth – they are the infrastructure that houses the residential and commercial property sectors. General comments and summary Property Council is pleased to provide input into the “Future of Tax” review by the Tax Working Group. We agree that the tax system plays a vital part in supporting the wellbeing of all New Zealanders and it is important that it functions fairly, efficiently and is sustainable (both politically over time and in raising the required amount of revenue to fund government spending). Simplicity As an overarching comment, Property Council believes that it is highly desirable for New Zealand’s tax system to be as simple as possible for those participating in it to understand and comply with. We believe that the current system, in the main, achieves this objective. Therefore, when considering different reform options (and sets of tax polices), Property Council strongly urges this objective to be kept in mind. Fairness and current inconsistencies On the issue of fairness of the current tax system, we note that this appears to have become shorthand for “does New Zealand need a capital gains tax”? While we have considered whether New Zealand should implement a general capital gains tax (as well as certain other tax base broadening options), we are concerned that this has obscured other tax distortions and inconsistencies in the current system. A key tax distortion, which disproportionately impacts Property Council’s members, was the 2010 removal of tax depreciation on non-residential building structures. That change has resulted in real economic costs for building owners, as there is no tax recognition for economic depreciation on building structure, unlike every other business asset, or for the cost of required capital upgrades – for example, to earthquake strengthen building structures to prevent loss of life or incorporate new building technologies. In relation to the former, it is only since the devastating events in Christchurch that this serious and fundamental tax anomaly, which Inland Revenue officials have conceded exists with the removal of depreciation for the building structure, has come to light. It is therefore deeply concerning that, on present track, it continues to be ignored. Continuing failure to address this anomaly acts as a tax disincentive to earthquake strengthening and prolongs the uncertainty for property owners who are already incurring costs in the expectation of a future legislative fix, while making any fix increasingly retrospective so as to deal with past expenditure. Put simply, it is untenable that commercial property owners can currently claim a tax deduction for a building that collapses as a result of an earthquake (and maybe kills people) but tax law does not take into account the costs of strengthening a building so that it does not collapse (and saves lives). More generally earthquake non-performance of current building stock clearly illustrates that building structures do face obsolescence over time. This is driven by both improvements in building standards but also increased expectations from tenants around health and safety (which will often exceed the minimum standards). Similarly, demand for new building technologies and innovations, particularly “green” building technologies, mean that older stock faces technological obsolesce that requires a substantial outlay to remedy. Without such investment, the capital value of such buildings will be negatively impacted, as tenant demand is reduced. With the Prime Minister publicly stating that “climate change” is the nuclear issue of her generation, the demand for greater environmental sustainability in building design will only grow. The tax system unfortunately does not provide any tax recognition for this additional cost, which contributes to New Zealand’s overall public good. In fact, the current system actively discourages further investment in building structures that enhance the public good by improving building safety and utility. The 2010 changes have also, in Property Council’s view, resulted in unnecessary boundaries (such as what is “fit-out” and the building structure and what is feasibility expenditure and not) which have added to administrative and compliance costs. In our view, this has eroded the coherence of the tax system, as well as resulting in unfairness for commercial property owners in particular. Finally, Property Council believes the 2010 tax change was largely the result of a fiscal balancing exercise by the then Government, rather than for principled tax policy reasons as non-residential building structures clearly do depreciate due to obsolescence and other factors. Therefore, we strongly urge the Tax Working Group to reconsider this current tax policy setting of no tax depreciation for non-residential building structures. To be clear, this recommendation would not provide landlords with a tax incentive. It is simply about reflecting the true economic cost from technical obsolescence, for tax purposes, similar to any other business asset. Other tax bases – capital gains tax, land taxes and stamp duties One of the questions posed in the submissions background document is whether New Zealand needs additional tax bases, including to improve fairness in the system. In principle, Property Council agrees that a comprehensive capital gains tax would improve fairness in the tax system. Our concern (borne out by international experience) is that real world capital gains taxes tend to be sub-optimal, both in terms of their coverage and ability to be a viable and stable revenue source. At the outset, the consideration of a capital gains tax by the Tax Working Group is hamstrung by it not being able to be applied to the family home. This is the most tax advantaged asset, per the Tax Working Group’s own analysis in its submissions background document. This is particularly relevant as one of the key questions asked is whether a capital gains tax would improve housing affordability. Property Council would like to draw a clear distinction between the residential property market and the non-residential (i.e. commercial, industrial and retail) property sector, which our members are engaged in. Addressing the housing affordability objective for the former should not result in a general application of any solution to the latter. This was unfortunately the experience with the 2010 tax changes and we strongly urge the Tax Working Group to take note to avoid a re- occurrence. The practical design issues with a capital gains tax also cannot be extricated from whether a capital gains tax is an appropriate tax reform. In Property Council’s view, key design issues that would need to be resolved are: — over-taxation due to a capital gains tax taxing inflationary gains (particularly relevant for long- lived assets, such as property): — double taxation of shares (in the absence of imputation or similar, to offer relief); — integration with the current Portfolio Investment Tax regime; — reinvestment of capital proceeds triggering tax labilities (which will be the case in the absence of any “rollover relief” in these circumstances); and — potential ring fencing of capital losses (while this is the approach with offshore regimes, this will add to complexity and the unfairness). Property Council does not consider that the trade-offs that would be required to make a general capital gains tax workable justify the fairness objective, which would be incremental at best in our view, or the alternative tax base objective. However, we acknowledge that this will be a balancing exercise for policy makers. Therefore, if a capital gains tax is considered necessary, on balance, to address fairness or other concerns, then its workability is paramount. The key design issues identified above should be clearly addressed. Property Council has also considered other tax base broadening options, such as a land tax or stamp duties. Both of these suffer from similar drawbacks to a capital gains tax that excludes the family home (and the land below it) from the base. They have the added distortion that they would apply to only a single asset class – non-residential land or property – which raises significant fairness concerns. Property Council therefore does not support the introduction of either tax type. Taxation of savings The other area we have focussed on, in our submission, is the current taxation of savings. Property Council members include both NZX-listed and unlisted property vehicles. These give a range of New Zealanders (from institutional investors, such as Kiwi Saver funds, to super annuitants to ordinary “mums” and “dads”) exposure to an asset class that they would not otherwise have access to. It should be noted that many investors, including retirees, typically favour NZ commercial property investment as it provides a relatively low-risk return and a regular income stream (rather than for capital returns, which can be volatile). This is important both for the diversification of their financial risk and New Zealand’s macroeconomic risk from over exposure to housing. We agree with comments in the submissions background document that the current differential tax treatment of different savings should be made more consistent. Property Council strongly supports the current Portfolio Investment Entity (“PIE”) tax regime, in that regard, recognising that this was an attempt at the time to level the tax playing field. We note that the 2012 Savings Working Group concluded that this change did not go far enough. Property Council would support further changes aimed at improving the consistency in the taxation of different savings. Tax Working Group objectives Property Council fully supports the objectives the Tax Working Group has been asked to consider for the New Zealand tax system, including a tax system that promotes long-term sustainability and productivity of the economy, and treats all income and assets in a fair, balanced and efficient matter. Housing affordability objective We note that a specific focus of the Tax Working Group’s terms of reference include the tax treatment of residential property, specifically, in the context of housing affordability. The Tax Working Group’s analysis (illustrated in Figure 21 of the submissions background document) also suggests that owner occupied housing and, to a lesser extent, rental housing appear to be tax advantaged relative to other types of savings, including PIE investments. We note that a number of Property Council members operate PIEs and comment later on about the importance of the PIE regime in helping to alleviate current taxation distortions. Property Council does not have a view on whether the current tax treatment of residential property is adversely impacting on New Zealanders’ access to affordable housing. For example, Property Council has not attempted to analyse whether there is a role for a narrowly targeted capital gains tax aimed at improving housing affordability. As that stated objective is not fairness or revenue- based, a capital gains tax that applies only to residential housing may or may not achieve that objective. Similarly, whether a land tax may be effective in reducing “banking” of residential land has not been analysed. Property Council members provide critical infrastructure for “NZ Inc” Property Council members own and/or operate predominantly non-residential buildings (office, retail, other commercial and industrial real-estate). It is important that the dynamics impacting the residential property market are distinguished from those impacting non-residential property, which are business assets. While we are hesitant to use the distinction, Property Council members’ assets comprise the productive sector, providing the infrastructure that supports a range of New Zealand businesses (“NZ Inc”). The reason we raise this is that past tax reforms have tended, for largely opportunistic reasons (discussed in detail later on), to conflate all land and property as being of the same type. This has resulted in non-residential property owners disproportionately, and in Property Council’s view unfairly, bearing the cost of those reforms. We therefore urge the Tax Working Group to be objective in its analysis and bifurcate the issues facing the housing market (which it has specifically been asked to look at) from the wider commercial property market, which includes non-residential land and buildings. Property Council and its members are therefore keen to ensure that any tax proposals that, for example, may be aimed at improving housing affordability, do not cause collateral economic damage to the non-residential property sector, which forms the backbone of NZ business. Frameworks Property Council acknowledges the challenges, risk and opportunities facing New Zealand identified in the submissions background document. These include the impact of changing demographics, the nature of work, technological change, environmental challenges and concerns about inequality. While our submission does not directly address the impact of these issues on the tax system, our members play a vital role in providing the key physical infrastructure affecting the lives of all New Zealanders, be it where the work, study, shop, play or invest. Therefore, a number of these developments (be it changing work styles, greater focus on environmental sustainability, or social interaction) will directly impact the types of buildings and related infrastructure that New Zealanders (and the Government) will demand in future. Property Council strongly supports tools like the New Zealand Treasury’s Living Standards Framework in helping to analyse the trade-offs from different public policy settings, including tax policy. In particular, the acknowledgement that all public policy, including the tax system, is ultimately aimed at improving the wellbeing of New Zealanders, which is wider than just financial outcomes, but also encompasses more holistic concepts, such as New Zealanders mental and physical wellbeing (e.g. safety), a clean environment, and social trust and cohesion (through trust in and between communities, institutions and a strong rule of law). Property Council acknowledges wellbeing, applying these wide factors, can be difficult to measure quantitatively, but agree that their impact should be considered qualitatively. We have outlined below two examples of how our members are responding to and, in some cases, driving these wider changes/challenges in their developments. Earthquake strengthening to address structural obsolescence Following the events of Christchurch in 2011/12, which tragically led to loss of life, and more recently the earthquakes in the Kaikoura/greater Wellington region, resulting in business disruption (which in some cases is still ongoing) there has been a strong drive to upgrade (i.e. earthquake strengthen) building structures. This is needed to address both actual and perceived public safety concerns around building structure performance and potential for injury and loss of life during earthquakes (and other natural disasters). This illustrates, in a very real sense, the obsolescence of building structures, counter to the view that non-residential building structures do not depreciate. The retrofitting required to an existing building will often exceed the regulated new building standard, even accounting for upgrades to this minimum requirement following the Christchurch earthquakes. For example, in the case of the Recovery Plan for Christchurch, building owners were actively encouraged to exceed the code requirements for new buildings and when retrofitting existing buildings. In Property Council members’ experience, tenants are reluctant to renew existing, or enter new, leases unless buildings are retrofitted significantly above the new build standard. This is understandable given recent events and their consequences. At the same time, the ability to reflect these costs in rental returns is extremely limited. This economic cost is exacerbated by the tax system not providing any tax relief for these upgrade costs. This results in the perverse result that property owners can currently claim a tax deduction for a building that collapses as a result of an earthquake (and potentially kills people) but tax law does not take into account the costs of strengthening a building so that it does not collapse (and saves lives). Property Council members take their obligations as landlords extremely seriously. No one wants to see injury or loss of life. The concern is that while there is a clear public good to earthquake strengthening (and to above the minimum regulated standards), the tax system penalises building owners from actively doing so. Driving innovation through “green” building innovations and technologies “\[Climate change\] is my generation's nuclear-free moment, and I am determined that we will tackle it head on” Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, Labour Party 2017 election campaign launch There is a clear imperative for building owners to innovate in constructing more environmentally sustainable (“green”) buildings. This is typically driven by tenant demand, and the New Zealand Government is a key force in this regard. These developments reflect both societal and Government expectations about New Zealand’s future economic development needing to be more environmentally sustainable. This is not simply a case of being better for the environment, but also more cost efficient for building users (through more efficient use of lighting, heating and space and better amenities for habitants) and ultimately for all New Zealanders. The trend for “green” buildings again demonstrates that existing building structures, without green technologies and innovations, will become obsolete as tenant demand falls. Again, there is both a private and public good element to such building innovation which isn’t appropriately reflected in the return to building owners. And again, Property Council believes that the current tax system plays a role in increasing the overall economic cost by not providing appropriate tax recognition or relief for these additional costs. Applying the Living Standards Framework In Property Council’s view, the application of the Living Standards Framework strongly supports the development of safe, healthy and environmentally friendly buildings and structures. This is because they improve the wellbeing of New Zealanders, not just financially but more holistically. This touches on all Four Capitals of the Living Standards Framework: — Natural capital – by improving the quality of the natural environment, through buildings and structures that are efficient in their energy use and that promote a lower carbon footprint (helping New Zealand to meet its international climate change obligations). — Human capital – by enabling inhabitants (be it when they are at work, at school, or during recreation) to have peace of mind that the buildings they are occupying (in many cases for a large part of their day and lives) are safe and secure. — Social capital – buildings, unlike any other assets, are spaces for community engagement. Having confidence that the building structure is safe and environmentally sound improves not only connections between people (occupiers) but also trust in the “system” (i.e. that the Government and landlords are concerned for the common good). — Physical capital – having buildings that are resilient and economically efficient is ultimately good for “NZ Inc”. It allows Government to manage its risk, from not having to underwrite significant building non-performance in a natural disaster or fund this from existing fiscal baselines or borrowing. Similarly, business (from not having significant business disruption, which will impact their profitability and sustainability) is able to manage its risks. The business disruption as a result of the recent Kaikoura/greater Wellington earthquakes is an example of the potential economic risk. Accordingly, more resilient building stock should have a positive overall impact on NZ’s GDP and economic growth. It enables all New Zealanders to better cope with economic shocks as a result of unforeseen events. Property Council is not suggesting that the types of building expenditure outlined above are deserving of special tax treatment, although the Living Standards Framework would appear to support the case for such. Instead, the key point is that the tax policy framework should not create disincentives and distortions which actively discourages additional investment in building structures that enhance the public good by improving building safety and utility. Applying the traditional tax policy evaluation frameworks Property Council believes that the above conclusion is clear whether the Living Standard Framework, or more conventional criteria, is applied for considering the costs and benefits of a tax policy. That is, if the traditional efficiency, equity, revenue integrity/adequacy, compliance/administrative cost, and coherence axioms are applied. Economic efficiency A tax system that does not reflect the economic deprecation of business assets will not be efficient, as it economically distorts investment away from those types of assets (to less productive, but nevertheless more tax-effective, ones). At the margin, it also means that expenditure that would otherwise be incurred may not be because of the taxation cost. I.e. a non-marginal pre-tax investment becomes marginal post-tax. This is clearly not optimal from a “NZ Inc” perspective. Equity From a fairness perspective, again using depreciation as an example, there is no equity argument for treating different business assets differently. (In fact, the Tax Working Group’s objective is to ensure that all assets are treated fairly.) Property Council is aware of the argument that non-taxation of capital gains provides some support for not allowing depreciation on buildings. However, to apply this argument selectively to one asset class and not others is specious. The argument itself is flawed as other tax regimes operate tax depreciation/amortisation regimes alongside capital gain taxes. Integrity, compliance and administration costs Property Council is also concerned about the integrity of such a tax system, as it incentivises behaviours which are also not optimal from an administration or compliance viewpoint. An example is reclassification of otherwise capital (i.e. non-tax deductible) expenditure to revenue (deductible) expenses. This imposes both costs on Inland Revenue, from policing this boundary, and on taxpayers from seeking complex apportionments and advice to justify claims made. We outline below two examples to illustrate: Prior to removal of tax depreciation on buildings, many Property Council members simply depreciated “fit-out” items at the building rate. Post that change, additional measures (including a legislative definition of “fit out”) needed to be introduced to prevent, as Inland Revenue perceived it, re-characterisation of the building structure into still depreciable fit-out. That change, in Property Council’s view, reduced the integrity of the system as it introduced a new boundary which would never have existed in its absence. A similar issue arises in respect of the deductibility of “feasibility expenditure” 1 . At present, where the expenditure is incurred as part of a project to construct or acquire a building, its non- deductibility (if it is not preliminary enough in the decision making process to be a revenue expense or materially advances a particular project) makes a permanent difference to the tax treatment. Previously, if required to be capitalised, the cost while not immediately deductible would nevertheless have been able to be depreciated over time. Coherence As a matter of principle, Property Council believes that a coherent system should not have material differences in the taxation treatment of different asset classes. However, there is a difference between real and perceived coherence. We use the oft-touted lack of a capital gains tax to illustrate this. As members of the Tax Working Group would be aware, a common misconception is that absence of a capital gains tax means that all such gains are tax-free. This is simply not the case, due to specific provisions in the Income Tax Act which re-characterise capital gains as ordinary income in a number of circumstances. Many Property Council members, for example, will be acutely aware of New Zealand’s extensive rules for taxing certain land-based activities. More recently, the “bright-line” provision taxes residential investment property held for less than (previously two and now five) years. And as the terms of reference clearly point out, any form of taxation of the family home or the land sitting below it is outside the scope of the Tax Working Group’s consideration. In these circumstances, to what extent is the introduction of a general capital gains tax merely a case of “virtue signalling”, rather than a substantive reform. While this may increase perceived coherence, it is not clear that this will actually improve the system overall? Our submission considers the various practical issues of a capital gains tax in greater detail later on as that, in our view, directly affects its desirability. Current tax disincentives The key tax distortion the Property Council would like to highlight is the current tax depreciation treatment of building structures. By way of background, the previous Government removed tax depreciation on all building structures, from the 2011/12 income year. This was part of its implementation of the 2010 Victoria University Tax Working Group’s (the “2010 Tax Working Group”) reform recommendations. However, the specific recommendation of the 2010 Tax Working Group was: Removing tax depreciation on buildings (or certain categories of buildings) if empirical evidence demonstrates that they do not depreciate in value over time. (Emphasis added) At the time, Property Council engaged KPMG to carry out a detailed analysis of whether non- residential building structures depreciate (a copy of which is attached as an appendix to this submission). That included a detailed review of the international evidence, including various 1 This follows a NZ Supreme Court decision which narrowed the definition of (deductible) “feasibility expenditure”, which is not a legislatively defined concept. economic studies, and consideration of relevant qualitative factors (such as the impact on valuations of new building innovations including “green” technologies, changing occupant preferences, and technical obsolescence as evidenced by changes to building codes). The KPMG report concluded that international evidence (as well as Inland Revenue’s own analysis in 2004) overwhelmingly suggested that non-residential building structures did depreciate in value. These factors have been supplemented by the evidence of structural obsolescence following the Christchurch and Wellington/Kaikoura earthquakes, which is discussed in greater detail below. The KPMG report also highlighted that New Zealand would be an outlier internationally from removing tax depreciation on the building structure. Property Council also engaged with Inland Revenue and Treasury Officials, at the time, to provide New Zealand empirical evidence on commercial and industrial buildings, in support of the KPMG report findings. Technical obsolescence The technical obsolescence of building structures can be demonstrated by the need for a number of Property Council members to recently undertake significant seismic strengthening projects to ensure the continued economic viability of building assets. By way of an actual example, one of our members experienced first-hand the impact of structural obsolescence in relation to a commercial property located in Palmerston North. The property was assessed at 1-10% of the New Building Standard following the Canterbury earthquakes, with the tenant immediately vacating resulting in a $300,000 per annum rental stream void, and a write- down in the building value of $1.2 million. In order for the tenant to re-occupy, our member had to engage in a 15-month $1.5 million upgrade of the building structure. No tax recognition was able to be claimed for any of these costs and the costs did not increase the value of the property above its pre-seismic assessment value. There are numerous other public examples of commercial property owners having to undertake significant capital projects, and incur millions of dollars in costs, simply to maintain the capital value of their properties. While the previous approach to Officials was not successful, we understand, at least anecdotally, that the rationale for removing non-residential building structure depreciation was due to political/fiscal considerations. That is, it was necessary to partly fund the previous Government’s Budget 2010 company and personal tax changes 2 . In Property Council’s view, the 2011/12 removal of tax depreciation for non-residential building structures was therefore not a principled tax change. Building structures do depreciate. As a key objective of the current Tax Working Group is to consider fairness in the tax system, the removal of tax depreciation is explicitly counter to that objective. A further consequence of removing tax depreciation on building structures is that no tax recognition is given for landlords when faced with the decision of whether to upgrade their buildings for new structural standards (that is, earthquake strengthening). The Inland Revenue’s view is that earthquake strengthening expenditure is a capital expense 3 . This imposes all of the cost on building 2 Removal of building tax depreciation was estimated to result in a fiscal saving of over $1b, of which non- residential buildings comprised more than half. 3 This is despite strong arguments that the effect of earthquake strengthening expenditure is to bring a building to a condition where it can safely be occupied (i.e. back to its original income earning condition), rather than improving the building. This is borne out by the market value of buildings considered to be at risk owners. The capital commitment to upgrade will in the majority of cases be uneconomic, as there will be little to no financial return on the capital outlaid (i.e. it will typically not result in a higher rental stream over time) as evidenced by the example above. Financing the upgrade cost may also be an issue. This is notwithstanding there being strong public good reasons for encouraging this expenditure, let alone tax fairness considerations. Recommendation: Property Council urges the Tax Working Group to recommend the reinstatement of tax depreciation for non-residential building structures. To be clear, this recommendation would not provide landlords with a tax incentive. It is simply about reflecting the true economic cost from technical obsolescence, for tax purposes, similar to any other business asset. Therefore, reinstating tax depreciation for non-residential building structures would not be inconsistent with other reform options the Tax Working Group has been asked to consider, including a capital gains tax. Responses to specific questions in the Tax Working Group’s submissions background document We attempt to address below some of the Tax Working Group’s specific questions in its submissions background document. Please note that we have not attempted to answer all of the Tax Working Group’s questions. While these are important and relevant, we do not confess to be experts in all matters referred to in the submissions background document. Therefore, Property Council has limited its submissions to those areas where it is in a position to offer informed comment. Also, being a member-driven organisation, we are also cognisant of the need to highlight those issues which will directly affect our constituents and their investors, many of whom are ordinary New Zealanders. Question 1: Should New Zealand introduce a capital gains tax (that excludes the land under the family home)? If so, what features should it have? Property Council accepts that there is a strong equity (fairness) rationale for the introduction of a comprehensive capital gains tax in New Zealand. This is not a controversial statement. Most of the economic literature would support the inclusion of a capital gains tax, within a modern broad-based tax system. (We note there is an open question about relative taxation rates on capital and labour, from a tax efficiency perspective. However, that discussion is typically around the overall level of taxation of capital and labour, not the relative bases.) 2001 and 2010 Tax Review findings Where the theoretically sound argument for a capital gains tax becomes problematic is the inevitable real-world overlay. We note that this is the challenge that confronted both the McLeod Tax Review in 2001 and the 2010 Tax Working Group. The McLeod Tax Review’s conclusion in its final report of October 2001 4 was: 3.14 Nothing we have received by way of submissions has altered our view expressed in the Issues Paper that New Zealand should not adopt a general realisation-based capital gains tax. We believe that such a tax would not necessarily make our tax system fairer and more efficient, would not lower tax avoidance and would not raise substantial revenue that from a life safety perspective, in the event of an earthquake, being significantly reduced. Earthquake strengthening is required to simply maintain market values. 4 https://treasury.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2007-11/taxreview2001-report.pdf could be used to lower tax rates. Instead, any such tax would be more likely to increase the complexity and costs of our system. The experience of other countries (such as Australia, the UK and the US) supports that conclusion (Emphasis added) For completeness, we note that the McLeod Tax Review recommended that the tax system should address savings tax distortions. We note the subsequent PIE and Fair Dividend Rate taxation changes in 2007, the latter being based on the McLeod Tax Review’s Risk Free Return methodology, were an attempt to address some of the savings tax distortions. The 2010 Tax Working Group reached a broadly similar conclusion, albeit framed in the context of practical implementation issues with a capital gains tax, in its January 2010 Final Report – A Tax System for New Zealand’s Future 5 . The most comprehensive option for base-broadening, with respect to the taxation of capital, is for New Zealand to introduce a comprehensive capital gains tax. While the comprehensive nature of this option is seen as attractive and therefore its introduction is supported by some, most members of the TWG are concerned about the practical challenges and efficiency implications of introducing a CGT. These issues include the lock-in effects that can result from a realised CGT and the inherent complexity of a CGT. (Emphasis added) Design issues with a capital gains tax We discuss some of the practical challenges with implementing a capital gains tax below, as the case (or not) for such a tax cannot be separated from its design. Tax base Economists’ version of a capital gains tax is one that is comprehensive. It applies to all asset classes. However, the Tax Working Group’s terms of reference specifically excludes the family home and the land below it (which we refer to in this submission for ease of reference as “owner occupied housing”). The 2001 McLeod Tax Review initially suggested a form of capital taxation of owner occupied housing, but its final report steered well clear of this. The 2010 Tax Working Group, in its considerations, noted that a capital gains tax on owner occupied housing was not politically sustainable. This was another reason for its rejection of a capital gains tax 6 . These practicalities are also illustrated by the Labour Party’s capital gains tax proposal at the time of the 2011 and 2014 general elections, which excluded the family home, personal assets and collectibles, and certain small business assets. While this is not to suggest that those assets should be excluded, it highlights the political realities and likely lobbying for further exclusions. The issue that poses is the risk that the actual base of assets on which a potential capital gains tax can be applied will be significantly reduced. This is the real-world capital gains tax: a relatively narrow tax 5 https://www.victoria.ac.nz/sacl/centres-and-institutes/cagtr/pdf/tax-report-website.pdf 6 A key concern with a CGT is the treatment of owner-occupied housing. If comprehensive base broadening is pursued through the introduction of a CGT, then in principle owner-occupied housing should be within the CGT base. However, the Group recognises that this is unlikely to be the case as evidenced by the exemptions which operate in other jurisdictions. Introducing a CGT that excludes owner-occupied housing would create a new bias in the tax system. (At page 67 of the 2010 Tax Working Group Final Report.) base. This is consistent with international evidence that capital gains taxes simply do not raise significant amounts of revenue. Realisation basis for taxation The economists’ version of a capital gains tax also supports taxing gains on an accrual (i.e. unrealised) basis. This is to address the so-called “lock-in” effect, which incentivises deferral of capital gains that are taxed on realisation. However, Property Council is not aware of any country that has an accruals based capital gains tax. (Ironically, New Zealand’s financial arrangements rules and Foreign Investment Fund regime comes the closest to replicating such a tax.) For practical reasons, therefore, a realised based tax is the norm. At a practical level, it is not clear how a realised capital gains tax could be made to work for multi- rate PIEs, including unlisted property owning investment vehicles and KiwiSaver funds. These are a not insubstantial part of the NZ savings landscape. Multi-rate PIEs are required to attribute their income to investors on a “real time” basis. These entities currently do not have to worry about realisation based taxes but would under a realised capital gains tax. This is one of the many operational issues that would need to be resolved and the answer is not simply to levy tax on an unrealised basis in these circumstances. Other design issues There are a number of other practical aspects of a capital gains tax and its application that are of concern to Property Council. — A capital gains tax will tax both real and nominal (inflationary) gains, unless indexed. For assets that are held for the long term, such as land and buildings, the effective tax rate can be expected to be significant due to taxation of inflationary gains. This will be the case even with relatively low levels of inflation. Therefore, for a capital gains tax to be fair, it should tax the non- inflationary real gain, if any. However, this adds a layer of complexity which is why a number of countries with capital gains taxes either do not index at all (which is unfair) or apply differential (i.e. discounted) tax rates as a form of inflation adjustment. This discounting itself creates potential distortions. (For example, what is the correct discount rate?) — Property Council Submits there will be double taxation if a capital gains tax applies to shares in the absence of an equivalent to the imputation regime or a “final tax” (e.g. PIE-like) regime for capital gains. A number of Property Council members are NZX-listed entities, whose shares are traded regularly, and whose shareholders would be adversely impacted if a capital gains tax that applied to disposal of the entity’s underlying property assets was not creditable at the investor level. Again, this raises questions of fairness, but the trade-off for solving it is additional administrative complexity and compliance costs for shareholders. — The submissions background document asks whether there should be “rollover” relief from a capital gains tax, if the gains are reinvested in similar assets. Property Council submits that, if a capital gains tax is recommended by the Tax Working Group, there needs to be rollover relief if the capital gain amount is not distributed to investors. Economically, that capital gain has not been realised for the benefit of investors/shareholders and should not be taxed at that point. This is particularly important if a mechanism to alleviate double taxation is not feasible and/or there is no indexation of gains, due to complexity. We note that our Property Council members who are NZX-listed entities distribute most, if not all, operating cash flows but do not distribute any realised or unrealised gains. — The submissions background document notes that if capital gains are taxed on a realisation basis, there is a strong theoretical argument for “ring-fencing” of capital losses against capital gains only. This is due to the ability to bring forward realisation of losses, and defer tax on gains. The practical impact however is that it creates an artificial boundary between normal taxable losses (e.g. arising under the current land taxing rules) and capital losses, which could be problematic (particularly if the capital gains tax rate is lower than the normal income tax rate, to adjust for some of the issues noted above, such as lack of indexation). It also results in unfairness, particularly if the prospect of future capital gains is remote (e.g. if only a single capital asset is owned and that is disposed of for a loss). Property Council submits that capital losses should be available without restriction, if a capital gains tax is introduced, for simplicity and fairness reasons. However, if rollover relief is applied, the treatment should be symmetric – i.e. there should be a deferral of capital losses in the same way capital gains are able to be rolled- over. — Finally, we note a common difficulty with a capital gains tax is its implementation. The submissions background document outlines three options: bringing in existing assets at (1) their initial cost; (2) their valuation on the date of introduction; or (3) limiting it to new assets only. There are practical difficulties with all three options. Respectively, these are: (1) over-taxation depending on how long the assets have been held prior to the application date of the tax, (2) requiring arm’s length valuations without a sale or similar event, and (3) creating a class of capital gains tax “preferred” asset. Property Council’s concern is that none of these approaches is particularly principled. Further, they lend themselves to application to assets which are considered easy to value (such as listed shares and property) to the exclusion of other assets which are considered more difficult. This would not be a principled application, in our view. Conclusion In summary, as noted above, the decision on whether or not New Zealand should adopt a “general” capital gains tax cannot be extricated from the design of such a tax. That reality, unfortunately, would appear to be far removed from the theoretical optimum for the reasons outlined above. These are the difficulties that confronted the previous tax reviews, which they were unable to satisfactorily resolve. Property Council believes these are still relevant today. For that reason, Property Council questions the overriding objective for introducing a capital gains tax. If the objective is greater fairness in the tax system, that has to be evaluated against: (1) what will be outside scope, with owner occupied housing likely to be the starting point, not the end point; (2) the complexity of ensuring that a capital gains tax does not over or double tax (i.e. inflationary gains and share gains, respectively); and (3) implementation coverage (recognising that there are no easy options). If the objective is a sustainable alternative future revenue base to fund future government spending or to offset other tax reductions, the international experience is that a capital gains tax is not a dependable revenue source as revenue flows can be highly variable. This is much more so than other tax bases 7 . This is not conducive to Government budgeting, particular if an objective is to raise 30% of New Zealand’s GDP to meet future spending commitments. Property Council therefore does not consider that the trade-offs that would be required to make a capital gains tax workable justify the fairness objective, which would be incremental at best, or the alternative tax base objective. However, Property Council acknowledges that the case for a capital gains tax (and all tax reform options) will be a balancing exercise. Views may diverge on the importance/weighting of different (and conflicting) factors. We would also emphasise the need for any recommendation to be politically sustainable over time. If a capital gains tax is supported, on balance, by the Tax Working Group If, on balance, the Tax Working Group reaches a view that a capital gains tax is an appropriate addition to the New Zealand tax system, then Property Council considers that it is imperative that the above design issues are addressed to make the regime workable. In particular, we highlight the need for: — Rollover relief to ensure that any tax is only levied on actual distribution of capital gains by an entity to its investors. — Any capital gains tax proposal to integrate fully with the current PIE taxation regime. — Capital losses to be able to be offset against ordinary income. Question 2: Should New Zealand introduce a land tax (that excludes land under the family home)? If so, what features should it have? The case, as we understand it, generally put forward for a land tax is economic efficiency. The impact of a land tax is said by economists to be borne only by those who own the land at the time of introduction, with subsequent owners factoring this in by way of a lower purchase price. Note: this assumes the land tax applies on the unimproved value of land only, as applying the tax to improvements introduces inefficiency – i.e. it affects the decision to develop the land or not. A land tax is also suggested as a way of raising significant revenue. However, that assumes a universal land tax base, at low rates. This will not be the case as owner occupied housing is excluded from any potential tax base. Property Council submits this would put pressure on the rate of any land tax, to make up for any lost revenue. New Zealand’s previous experience with a land tax suffered from a narrow base. The most recent version, introduced in the early 1980s, was abolished in 1992 due to various exemptions resulting in the tax being considered uneconomic and inefficient 8 . Another major concern with a land tax is the magnitude of any reduction in the price of affected land at the time of introduction. Work done for the 2010 Tax Working Group suggested a 1% land tax could result in a fall of anywhere between 16.7% and 26.4% in affected land values (with Inland 7 For example see the volatility in Australian net capital gains income (refer Chart 1) in https://static.treasury.gov.au/uploads/sites/1/2017/06/03Clark.pdf . That paper concludes that “Volatility in CGT is a major driver of aggregate revenue volatility and revenue forecasting error”. 8 The McCaw Committee Report on tax reform noted that: In 1982, only five per cent of total land value was taxed, agricultural land being explicitly exempted and residential land effectively exempted by the exemption of $175,000 for all landowners. Revenue concluding at the time the lower estimate could be optimistic) 9 . If correct, this would be a significant de-valuation of existing assets, and is likely to create a significant economic shock. If a land tax is aimed at improving housing affordability, this may end up having a much smaller impact on residential land prices as owner-occupied housing will be excluded, but non-residential land which is not an area of concern will bear the full brunt of the price effects. This reflects the inherent unfairness of a land tax, as it targets a single class of capital asset (and non- residential land at that) and its holders. In this context, Property Council members (and their investors, which include super annuitants as well as ordinary “mums” and “dads”) would be disproportionately impacted by a land tax compared to most other taxpayers. It is unfair that investors in the non-residential property sector should be used as a further “cash cow” to fund other parts of the tax system, particularly when previous tax reforms have resulted in significant costs already being imposed on this sector. Conclusion Property Council strongly rejects the case for introducing a land tax for the reasons outlined above. For completeness we note that there was some support by members of the 2010 Tax Working Group, but this was subject to an important qualifier: a low-rate land tax as a means of funding tax rate reductions and improving the overall efficiency of the tax system. However, \[the TWG noted\] there are concerns over the political sustainability of such a tax. (Emphasis added) Question 3. Is there a case to consider the introduction of any new taxes that are not currently levied? In Chapter 6, the submissions background document notes that in previous reforms, New Zealand has eliminated land tax (considered above), estate duty, gift duty, stamp duty and cheque duty. The question is whether any of these alternative tax bases should be re-considered. Ignoring estate duties (which we understand are outside the remit of the Tax Working Group due to being an inheritance tax), both gift duty and cheque duty were abolished due to their low revenue potential relative to the compliance costs imposed. It is unlikely, in Property Council’s view, that this calculus will have changed since their repeal. Property Council notes that stamp duties are popular overseas as a way of raising tax revenue. In Australia, for example, stamp duties are a key contributor to Australian state coffers. However, a large chunk of Australian stamp duty revenue is from residential properties (approximately three quarters in 2013-14 10 ). A large part of that potential revenue base would not be available in New Zealand due to the carve-out of owner occupied housing from any tax reform. Therefore, the revenue potential (similar to a land tax excluding the land below the family home) is likely to be limited. 9 https://www.victoria.ac.nz/sacl/centres-and-institutes/cagtr/twg/publications/3-taxation-of-capital-gains- ird\_treasury.pdf 10 https://www.propertycouncil.com.au/Web/Content/Submissions/National/2016/Economic\_impact\_of\_stam p\_duty.aspx At the same time, studies have shown stamp duties to have particularly high economic costs. This is borne out by research conducted by the Property Council of Australia 11 . Conclusion Property Council does not believe that the re-introduction of stamp duty is warranted. Value capture taxes While not covered in the submissions background document, we note that the Government has expressed an interest in “value capture taxes”. We understand the aim of such a tax is to capture that portion of profit (in the form of any increase in value of land/improvements) to private landowners from proximity or access to public investments (such as roading, sewage and other public infrastructure). Property Council is unable to offer a view on the suitability of such a tax base, without any detail on how it may apply. If such taxes are likely to form part of the Tax Working Group’s future thinking, we would appreciate the opportunity to consider our position at the time. Question 4: Does the tax system strike the right balance between supporting the productive economy and the speculative economy? Property Council has considered this question in the context of taxes on savings (we refer the analysis on page 39 of the submissions background document and on “tax and retirement savings” on page 26). Effective tax rate analyses for different savings options One of the questions asked is whether certain businesses are benefiting from low effective tax rates, because of non-taxation of certain types of income. While we consider Figure 21 to be a useful discussion of the different effective tax rates on different types of savings, at present, we are aware some analyses have sought to highlight the effect of the lack of a capital gains tax on property investment and have made leaps in their conclusions as a result. One such analysis claims that NZX-listed property vehicles have considerably lower effective tax rates than the NZ statutory company tax rate (and their non-property NZX-listed peers) due to the lack of a capital gains tax. This is based on fair value revaluations of the underlying properties being “income” for accounting purposes but not tax purposes. Property Council is concerned that such an analysis paints an overly simplistic and misleading picture as fair value gains/(losses) of members would not be taxable, other than in an unrealised capital gains tax world (which no country has). While this results in artificially low effective tax rates in a rising market, during the Global Financial Crisis, for example, the listed property sector had effective tax rates significantly higher than the statutory tax rate (and their NZX-listed peers), applying the same analytical approach, due to large unrealised losses. In both cases, it is incorrect to say that the effective tax rate should be a function of unrealised property gains/(losses), which are not income under any sensible measure. Our concern is such analysis has the potential to abstract from genuine debate about whether different types of savings are over-or -under taxed. 11 Ibid Non-residential property is part of a balanced savings portfolio Commercial and industrial property is an important part of a balanced savings portfolio. Property Council members, which include the NZX-listed property vehicles as well as unlisted property owning vehicles, have a range of investors. These include super annuitants and “mum” and “dad” investors, alongside institutional investors, which include KiwiSaver funds. These investors typically invest for the safe (low-risk) and consistent rental return that non- residential property investment provides, rather than capital returns (which can be volatile). In the absence of collectivised investment options provided by Property Council’s members, many New Zealanders would simply not have access to this asset class, which is important to diversify their portfolio risk (and also for New Zealand’s overall macroeconomic risk, given the overexposure of New Zealand household balance sheets to housing assets). Property Council agrees with the Tax Working Group’s statement that “there is room for improvement to make our current system \[for taxing different types of savings\] more consistent”. And that “consistent treatment should improve both fairness and efficiency”. The importance of the PIE regime to the savings tax landscape Property Council notes that the PIE taxation regime has helped collectivised commercial and industrial property investment to operate on a level tax playing field with other types of collectivised investment. It should be noted that, in the main, the objective of the PIE rules was to remove tax distortions that previously resulted in direct investment being tax advantaged relative to investing through a collective investment vehicle (in property and other assets). The tax disadvantage previously faced by collective investment vehicles included the “claw back” of amounts that would otherwise not be subject to tax at the entity level (e.g. the benefit of tax depreciation claimed) on distribution to investors. This resulted in effective over taxation of investors. Property Council believes the PIE regime is particularly important as New Zealand does not have any special regimes, such as Real Estate Investment Trust rules. (In other jurisdictions, these would allow the income of the REIT to be flowed through to be taxed at the underlying investor’s level.) The key constraint is that the Tax Working Group is unable to change the taxation treatment of owner occupied housing, which results in other forms of savings being relatively tax disadvantaged. The response should not be to further increase this disparity by, for example, reducing or removing the effect of the PIE taxation regime. That tax distortion was considered by the 2010 Savings Working Group in its report – Saving New Zealand: Reducing Vulnerabilities & Barriers to Growth & Prosperity 12 . One of its recommendations was to reduce the inherent over-taxation of savings by, amongst other things, broadening and rationalising the PIE regime (refer page 81 of their report). The Savings Working Group (“SWG”) made the following comment about the PIE regime: While the original justification for the PIE regime was to try to apply investors’ expected personal tax rates on their direct investment income to income from investments held through collective vehicles, from a savings perspective it can be rationalised as a mechanism for reducing tax rates on income from a broad spectrum of saving. The SWG notes the \[2010 12 https://treasury.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2011-02/swg-report-jan11.pdf Tax Working Group\] recommendation that the capped top PIE rate should have been aligned with the top personal marginal rate, but the SWG considers that from a savings context (and absent Nordic and similar rate reductions on savings) the top PIE rate should be maintained at a minimum of 5 percentage points below the top personal marginal rate (and preferably 10 percentage points below). (Emphasis added) Property Council strongly supports the above view of the Savings Working Group in relation to PIE tax rates. The Savings Working Group noted that most other countries apply an “Exempt -Exempt-Tax” model for taxing savings. The current PIE regime, at best, is a “Tax-tax (small t) -Exempt” model. That is, it is not a highly concessionary taxation regime. Conclusion Property Council strongly supports the PIE regime and believes the current PIE policy settings are broadly appropriate. However, per the Savings Working Group recommendations above, there may be a case for further reduction in savings tax rates, including through a reduction in the PIE tax rate.

This analysis is prepared to help answer the question: do buildings (or certain categories of buildings) depreciate? It has been prepared on behalf of the Property Council New Zealand (PCNZ), a not for profit organisation that represents New Zealand’s commercial, industrial, retail, property funds and multi unit residential property owners, managers and investors. PCNZ represents all forms of commercial property and property investment in New Zealand. Its membership ranges from NZX-l isted property trusts (“LPTs”) to smaller commercial property investors. The commercial and industrial property sector is an important part of the New Zealand productive sector, providing vital infrastructure for New Zealand businesses (i.e. New Zealand Inc). 2 Summary of findings We believe the answer to the question posed by the TWG: do buildings depreciate, is they do depreciate, at least in the context of non-residential buildings (i.e. commercial and industrial property), which is the focus of our analysis. This conclusion is based on: • Our understanding of the international evidence, including the various economic studies since the late 1970s which have concluded that commercial and industrial buildings broadly depreciate at rates of between 2-4% per annum. These studies were noted in an Inland Revenue and Treasury issues paper on tax depreciation, released in 2004, which concluded that buildings do depreciate. • More recent international evidence that supports officials’ 2004 analysis. These studies suggest that rates for commercial and industrial rates could be higher (and the useful lives of buildings appear to be shortening). We have not found any studies that suggest buildings do not depreciate. • Qualitative factors, such as: the high-rates of re-development of commercial buildings (particularly in the Auckland and Wellington CBD areas); changes in building technology (i.e. the need to comply with new building standards); and changing tenant preferences (i.e. “Green” buildings for Government and changes in configuration over time, due to the move from individual offices to open plan) which mean that buildings can and do economically lose value over time. Buildings also move across different segments of the market, over their economic life (a prime building in the 1970s will typically be sub-prime property today, all other things held constant). PCNZ Tax Depreciation Analysis 100208.doc 3 ABCD We believe that the economic cost of removing depreciation on buildings will be borne primarily by the New Zealand business sector. This is based on a high-level breakdown of the $1.3 billion revenue estimate for removing depreciation. We understand approximately 70% of this estimate relates to non-residential property depreciation. In our view, property investors will account for a very small fraction of this (e.g. we have estimated the largest four LPTs, which are a fair representation of the New Zealand institutional property investor market, hold around 3 to 4% of the total building capital stock). The flow-on implications, from removing depreciation on buildings, will be lower quality of infrastructure (as there would be lesser incentives to reinvest in capital) or higher rents (as landlords look to recover the lost tax deductions). Neither will be a particularly desirable outcome. New Zealand would be an outlier internationally. We note that the majority of our trading partners, including Australia, Germany, Japan and the United States allow depreciation on (some or all) non-residential buildings. In the race to attract and keep capital, New Zealand would be at a significant disadvantage. 3 Scope of our analysis The scope of our analysis is limited to the depreciation question around non-residential buildings – broadly commercial and industrial property, such as office buildings, warehousing, manufacturing plant and shopping centres. This reflects the typical asset holdings of PCNZ members. We have not considered whether residential rental properties depreciate in value (note: hotel buildings and other buildings used for commercial residential accommodation would be treated as non-residential buildings under our definition). We note that there are different dynamics in the residential property market, the most significant being the owner-occupier versus rental dynamic, which may mean the results may be different for this sector. Our definition of building is the “shell” or physical structure. It does not encompass any chattels, including those attached to the building (such as lifts). We note that chattels are separately depreciable and would be unaffected by any changes to the depreciation of buildings. This paper also does not explicitly consider the various other property/land-centric taxing options considered by the TWG, such as a land tax or RFRM on residential property investment. The focus of this paper is purely on whether non-residential buildings depreciate, to answer the question posed by the TWG. 4 Depreciation for tax purposes Depreciable property is defined in the Income Tax Act 2007 as “property that, in normal circumstances, might reasonably be expected to decline in value while it is used or available for PCNZ Tax Depreciation Analysis 100208.doc 4 ABCD use in \[either\] deriving assessable income; or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving taxable income.” A number of the international studies, which are discussed later on, separate out the depreciation attributable to physical wear and tear (i.e. the deterioration in physical capacity of the building asset) with so-called economic depreciation (which relates to the ageing of an asset and is attributable to factors such as obsolescence). Depending on which type of depreciation is being discussed, the economic profile of loss in value may vary – we note the references to “one hoss- shay”, “straight-line” and “geometric” depreciation profiles in the literature. Similarly, we note that the economic literature discusses a range of available depreciation methods, including the “double declining balance” method, depending on the appropriate economic depreciation profile. The different international studies also use different methodologies – some use asset price models, which consider the price of used assets (estimating depreciation as the change in the price of the asset as it ages), while others use a retirement approach (which estimates retirements and withdrawals from the capital stock and use these to estimate the depreciation pattern and rate). Our definition of depreciation encompasses both the physical deterioration of a building and other environmental factors. As noted above, environmental factors can include changes in building technology, i.e. obsolescence, as well as changes in tenant preferences such as the configuration and internal specification of a building, which will affect a property’s value over time. We believe that our comprehensive definition is consistent with the tax definition. In summary, the value of a building is, broadly speaking, the net present value of the future cash-flows (or rents) that are expected to be derived from a property. Both physical deterioration and environmental factors will impact on this NPV calculation over time. In theory, the cost of repairing or maintaining a building should be treated as a deductible expense in the year such expenditure is incurred. However, if the work adds to or improves the asset, this may constitute capital expenditure, with the cost having to be capitalised and depreciated over future years. The issue of what constitutes repairs and maintenance and what is a capital improvement is, however, a significant area of concern which needs to be clarified. 5 Separating buildings from land One popular argument for removing depreciation on buildings is that when combined land and buildings generally appreciate in value; therefore allowing tax depreciation on the structure seems unreasonable. Such an argument is a significant oversimplification. Land is not depreciable property for tax purposes. To suggest that any appreciation in the value of land is somehow a justification for denying depreciation on the structure is wrong, from a policy perspective. The two should be considered as separate issues. We note that officials have previously supported this approach. PCNZ Tax Depreciation Analysis 100208.doc 5 ABCD 6 TWG analysis No empirical data on building depreciation rates is presented in the TWG report and there is very little analysis on the costs versus benefits of removing tax depreciation on buildings. We are also unable to find any TWG background papers, prepared by Inland Revenue or Treasury, on this issue. (We discuss in the next section some analysis carried out by officials in 2004.) 6.1 The rental housing tax bias The TWG’s depreciation recommendation appears to be linked to a perception by the Group that rental property investment is tax advantaged – we refer to the statement in the TWG report, widely quoted in the media, that: There is ... a very large investment in rental properties, where overall this $200 billion sector of the economy had a negative taxable return of about $500 million in 2008. In our view, the TWG’s building depreciation recommendation appears to be aimed squarely at addressing the perceived shortcomings in the taxation of residential rental housing. As noted earlier, consideration of whether residential rental investment is tax advantaged is outside the scope of our analysis. If there is an issue with the taxation treatment of rental housing, this should be addressed as a specific targeted measure. (We note, for example, that some other jurisdictions differentiate between residential and non-residential buildings, allowing tax depreciation only on the latter.) We believe a clear distinction needs to be drawn between the residential rental sector and the commercial and industrial property sector, which provides the core infrastructure for New Zealand’s businesses. In contrast to residential rental property owners, we understand the commercial and industrial property sector is a net tax payer and contributor to the New Zealand economy. Unfortunately, the perception is that all buildings should be included in the scope of any depreciation change. This is not helped by the fiscal implications being based not only on removing depreciation on residential rental properties, but all buildings – we discuss the costings in greater detail later on. This seems an illogical leap from the “solution” the TWG appears to be recommending to a very narrow problem. This is particularly so, given the various overseas studies which show that buildings do depreciate. We discuss some of this international evidence below. 7 Evidence from the 2004 officials’ issues paper on depreciation Our starting point has been to revisit the 2004 Inland Revenue and Treasury officials’ issues paper, Repairs and Maintenance to the Tax Depreciation rules. PCNZ Tax Depreciation Analysis 100208.doc 6 ABCD The issues paper reviewed the overall coherence of the tax depreciation framework with a focus on ensuring that the overall structure of the depreciation rules is as good as is practicable and that the detailed design of the rules can cope with the complex, real-world issues that arise. Among the issues considered were the competing investment biases created by inflation and depreciation loadings in favour of long-lived and short lived assets, respectively. Chapter 5 of the issues paper considered the tax depreciation treatment of structures. A key constraint was the lack of New Zealand studies on economic depreciation of buildings and/or sufficiently robust New Zealand data for modelling depreciation on building. In the absence of New Zealand data, a number of international studies were relied upon. The key international study relied upon was Hulten and Wykoff (1980) 1 which supports the view that buildings do depreciate. Hulten and Wykoff estimated diminishing value rates of depreciation for various building types, excluding rental housing of: 2.02 percent for retail stores, 2.47 percent for offices, 2.73 percent for warehouses and 3.61 percent for factories. A paper by Fraumeni (1997) 2 is also referenced. It indicated that the United States Bureau of Economic Analysis had estimated economic depreciation rates of 3.14 percent (based on a 31- year economic life) for industrial buildings and 2.47 percent (based on a 36-year economic life) for office buildings. Other international studies considered in the issues paper were a study by Deloitte and Touche (2000) 3 , which estimated economic depreciation rates of between 2.10 and 4.48 percent for different classes of building and a survey of various studies on economic depreciation for buildings by Gravelle (2000) 4 , which concluded that buildings probably depreciate at rates in excess of 2 percent, but probably less than 4 percent. In summary, none of the international studies quoted in the issues paper found that buildings (particularly non-residential structures) do not depreciate. Officials’ conclusion (in Chapter 9 of the issues paper), expressed in the context of removing depreciation on residential rental housing, was that depreciation for buildings should not be removed: 1 The Measurement of Economic Depreciation Using Vintage Asset Prices: An application of the Box-Cox Power Transformation, Hulten, Charles R. and Franck C. Wykoff, Journal of Econometrics 15 No. 8 (April 1981). 2 The measure of depreciation in the US national income and production accounts, Bardara M. Fraumeni, Survey of Current Business, July 1997. 3 Deloitte and Touche, Analysis of the Economic and Tax Depreciation of Structures, Washington DC, June 2000. 4 Depreciation and the Taxation of Real Estate, Gravelle, J. CRS Report to Congress (October 2000). PCNZ Tax Depreciation Analysis 100208.doc 7 ABCD Officials do not support the option of denying depreciation deductions for rental housing altogether, as such a measure raises a number of concerns. Property prices are typically made up of land and improvements (the asset – house – on that land and any improvements to that asset or the land itself). Denying depreciation deductions entirely might be suggested because properties often appreciate rather than depreciate, although depreciation deductions are aimed at reflecting changes in the value of improvements over time. If the overall value of a property does not change but improvements depreciate while land appreciates, failure to allow for depreciation deductions will discourage economically efficient investment in new improvements. Buildings are scrapped on occasion, and it is clear that at least these buildings have fully depreciated. The evidence presented in chapter 5 provides a rationale for some reduction to building depreciation rates but not for denying depreciation deductions altogether. \[Our emphasis added\] If the above analysis holds for rental housing, we believe it is no less applicable to non- residential buildings (it is arguably more applicable given the international evidence that commercial, retail and industrial buildings typically have higher rates of economic depreciation than residential property.) We note that concerns that the tax depreciation rate for buildings was too high, based on the international economic literature survey at the time, resulted in the 2005 rate change, from 4% to 3% (on a DV basis) (and 3% to 2% on a straight-line basis). In our view, this should be the extent of any change to the depreciation regime for non-residential buildings. We do not believe that there have been any developments since 2004 which rebut the international findings above on depreciation of buildings. (In the next section we provide some recent research which suggests that the building depreciation rate may in fact be too low in the case of commercial and industrial properties.) One of the ways forward identified in the issues paper was: “...using New Zealand data, if feasible, to test the reasonableness of depreciation rates. One option that is currently being explored is to use New Zealand valuation data on a sample of properties for which no consents for structural improvements have been given. This may be a way of finding how the value of improvements has changed over time without the data being biased as a result of structural improvements to existing properties.” Unfortunately, we note that the data issues that existed at the time of the 2004 review persist today – we discuss these constraints later on. 8 Other international evidence In addition to the literature on economic depreciation rates for buildings identified in the 2004 issues paper, we have conducted a new search focusing on non-residential buildings. The results of our review are summarised below: PCNZ Tax Depreciation Analysis 100208.doc 8 ABCD 8.1 Patry, A. (2007) Economic Depreciation and Retirement of Canadian Assets: A Comprehensive Empirical Study. Statistics Canada. Patry provides a comprehensive empirical study of the economic depreciation of a range of Canadian assets, including various types of non-residential buildings. Patry also provides a useful summary of the depreciation rate estimates from the literature (the rates for buildings are outlined in the table below) Table 2.1.1 Depreciation rate estimates from the literature (%) Range Assets/Studies Rate From To Office Buildings Hulten and Wykoff (1981a, 1981b, 1996) 2.5 Deloitte and Touche (2000) 3.5 Baum and McElhinney (1997) 1.6 2.9 Tanguay (2005) 5.9 Gellatly, Tanguay and Yan (2002) 7.6 Gellatly, Tanguay and Yan (2007) 7.4 Industrial Buildings Hulten and Wykoff (1981a, 1981b, 1996) 3.6 Deloitte and Touche (2000) 2.1 Tanguay (2005) 9.1 Gellatly, Tanguay and Yan (2002) 13.0 Gellatly, Tanguay and Yan (2007) 9.7 Patry’s empirical study of Canadian assets include a breakdown of 25 various types of commercial and institutional buildings, as well as 13 types of industrial buildings. The study estimates that the average ex-ante service life (similar to our estimated useful life concept) is around 32 years for buildings (however, more recently – between 1995 and 2001 – the average service life has fallen from nearly 36 years to 28 years). The ranges of diminishing value depreciation rates for commercial buildings vary from 6.2% to 8.9% with major outliers being a 4.4% rate for religious buildings and 10.6% for post offices. The depreciation rate for industrial buildings vary in range from 7.0% to 12.6% with the major outliers being warehouses at 6.0%, mine buildings at 17.5% and bunkhouses/dormitories and camps estimated at 16.1%. (The full estimated results are available in Annex D of the Patry paper). In summary, the average depreciation rate for office buildings is found to be 5.9%, with 6.4% for shopping centres and 9.9% for manufacturing plants – refer table below. The average depreciation rate for all non-residential buildings was found to be around 7.3%.

The increases are across the board with office buildings and shopping centres depreciating at close to 6.0% per year and manufacturing facilities depreciating close to 10% (compared to 2% and 3%, respectively under the official rates). Patry concludes that a valuation bias in older buildings caused by accumulated improvements may explain the lower economic depreciation rates in the existing literature, including Hulten and Wykoff. The model used to sample the data was similar to the other depreciation literature, including Hulten and Wykoff. 8.2 Baum, A. and McElhinney, A. (1997) The Causes and Effects of Depreciation in Office Buildings: a Ten Year Update This paper compares a study undertaken in 1986 by the same authors and estimates depreciation rates in office buildings in Central London ten years later. The 1986 study found that the average rate of rental depreciation of the 125 buildings in the study’s sample set was 1.1% while capital value depreciation was 1.6%. The most significant and important determinant of depreciation in rental value was found to be the configuration of the building, followed by the internal specification and external appearance (i.e. obsolescence related factors). Physical deterioration was found to be the least important. For explaining depreciation in capital value, internal specification and external appearance were most important; deterioration was again least important. PCNZ Tax Depreciation Analysis 100208.doc 10 ABCD In 1996, the average rental depreciation rate had increased to 2.2% with capital value depreciation increasing to 2.9%. The sample of 128 buildings included 82 buildings in the 1986 study. The highest period of depreciation in the 1996 study was found to be much earlier in the life of a building (ages 7 to 12) than in the 1986 study (ages 17 to 26 and 20 to 29 for rental and capital values, respectively). The study concludes that building lives are getting shorter (falling from around 40-45 years in 1986 to around 25 years in 1996) with depreciation for older property lower than depreciation on new property because older properties are closer to the end of their building lives and therefore close to their site (i.e. land) values. 8.3 Gort, M., Greenwood J. and Rupert, P. (1999) Measuring the Rate of Technological Progress in Structures The study analyses the degree of technical progress in structures; it notes that as each decade passes new technology enables advances to be made. The study uses price data to determine the impact of technological change on building rents, the hypothesis being that newer office buildings have new and improved technologies embodied in their structures and should therefore rent for more than old ones, when holding the general physical condition of the building constant (i.e. assuming buildings are continually kept in good repair). The study concludes that the rate of structure-specific technological progress is about 1% per annum. Due to technological progress buildings eventually become obsolete and need to be replaced. Economic depreciation in the model is estimated at 6.6% (compared to 1.9% for physical depreciation). 8.4 Gellatly, G., Tanguay, M. and Yan, B. (2002) An Alternative Methodology for Estimating Economic Depreciation: New Results Using a Survival Model This paper develops depreciation profiles and life assets for 8 different types of structures. Gellatly, Tanguay and Yan determine depreciation on office buildings at a rate of approximately 7.6% and industrial buildings at a rate of 13.0%. It is noted that substantial reductions in economic value are apparent early in life for many of the sampled structures. This study differs from Hulten and Wykoff, in that the model has a component included which calculates the ‘survival ratio’ of assets. It therefore incorporates the issue of retired assets, previously addressed as a limitation of Hulten and Wykoff in the work by Gravelle. 8.5 Dixon, T., Crosby, N. and Law, V. (1999) A critical review of methodologies for measuring rental depreciation applied to UK commercial real estate This paper provides an analytical review of the methodologies and results of a number of past depreciation studies, including Hulten and Wykoff . The paper provides a breakdown of PCNZ Tax Depreciation Analysis 100208.doc 11 ABCD depreciation rates on buildings from the studies examined and show a range of 1.1 to 3.0% for office buildings and 0.52 to 3.3% for industrial buildings. 9 Summary of the additional international evidence The additional evidence outlined above confirms the results of the international studies referenced in the 2004 officials’ issues paper – namely that buildings, and specifically commercial and industrial buildings, do depreciate. Importantly, we have not come across any studies which suggest that buildings do not depreciate. While there are differing ranges for depreciation rates (and estimated useful lives) for non- residential buildings, the studies indicate that the current 3% DV rate (and 2% straight-line) rate is broadly appropriate. The recent comprehensive Patry study suggests that depreciation rates for commercial and industrial buildings should be much higher. However, we note that the consensus appears to be around the (lower) Hulten and Wykoff estimates. 10 New Zealand evidence and issues One of the key constraints identified in the officials’ issues paper, which persists today is the lack of New Zealand data, or empirical analysis, on building depreciation rates. A potential concern with relying solely on international evidence may be that depreciation profiles for buildings may differ by geographic location (e.g. office buildings in London versus central Auckland or Wellington). However, we do not believe that any geographical differences would be sufficient to justify tax depreciation being removed for New Zealand buildings. This is because the factors underlying tenant (and owner-occupier) demand for non-residential buildings in New Zealand should be the same as in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, or the United States. We provide some qualitative analysis of the New Zealand commercial property sector below, supporting the international evidence that non-residential buildings do depreciate. This is based on our discussions with various PCNZ members on factors impacting on the New Zealand commercial and industrial property sector. 10.1 Higher rates of redevelopment for commercial buildings We note that a clearly observable phenomenon with commercial buildings in New Zealand is the high rates of redevelopment (or capital reinvestment) – note for example, how few office buildings in the Auckland and Wellington CBDs are older than 30 years, let alone ones which have not undergone any significant capital improvements to the building structure. This suggests that the average useful life of a commercial building is likely to be significantly less than the 50 year economic life used to set tax depreciation rates (we note that a number of PCNZ Tax Depreciation Analysis 100208.doc 12 ABCD international studies have found the average service life of buildings today to be lower than in, say, the 1980s). More importantly it shows that non-residential buildings are regularly being demolished to make way for newer buildings, when the opportunity cost exceeds the market value of an existing building. This strongly supports the assertion that these buildings depreciate due to obsolescence factors. 10.2 Changes in preferences and technology impact on capital values The impact of changes in tenants’ preferences on building values can also be readily observed. By way of example, we understand the New Zealand Government has recently introduced new “Green” (energy efficiency) requirements for office buildings leased by the various Government departments. Compliance with these requirements has required significant capital improvements by commercial landlords (including a majority of the LPTs) to a number of existing buildings. Similarly, the move away from individual offices to an open plan office environment has required reconfiguration of certain structures, to meet occupiers’ needs. In the absence of these improvements, the expected return on these properties will fall significantly (in turn impacting on buildings’ capital values). Drivers of technical obsolescence, in the commercial property sector, include changes to building standards. For example, office buildings constructed in the 1980s will have had significant structural improvements to bring them up to compliance with earthquake standards. Where such improvements are not cost effective, the building would have been demolished and new earthquake standard compliant structures erected instead. In our view, the above are very real examples of the economic depreciation of buildings. 10.3 Buildings move between different market segments Buildings also move across different market segments over their economic life, depending on their condition and suitability for use. For example, an office building developed in the 1970s may have been prime real estate at the time. However, if unimproved (but nevertheless reasonably maintained) the same building in 2010 will typically be sub-prime property due to changes in technology and tenants’ preferences. This lower status will be reflected in the much lower rental yields on the property compared to a newer, more technologically advanced, building. This movement of buildings across different segments of the market, over time, means that the analysis of capital values in aggregate (using for example, Quotable Value or Government valuation data) is inappropriate. Instead, the analysis needs to be done on a building by building basis, which we note would be a prohibitive exercise not least of which because the valuation data available does not separate out the value of capital expenditure over the life of a building. PCNZ Tax Depreciation Analysis 100208.doc 13 ABCD This makes any attempt to draw any conclusions from the changes in capital values inherently dangerous. The PCNZ has discussed in depth with CBRE, the available valuation databases to undertake empirical testing of whether buildings depreciate. Unfortunately, the databases available (i.e. QV, Government valuations, and the PCNZ Property Index) omit a number of key variables necessary to undertake any meaningful analysis. 11 Impact if depreciation on non-residential buildings was removed We provide below some analysis of the potential economic impact if tax depreciation on non- residential buildings is removed. We note that a more detailed report on the merits of the TWG’s property tax proposals will be prepared by the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research. 11.1 Breakdown of the fiscal implications Inland Revenue’s estimate of the additional revenue that would be raised by denying depreciation deductions on buildings is $1.3 billion per annum. We understand that approximately 30% of this revenue estimate relates to denying depreciation on residential properties (i.e. rental housing investment in the tax base). 70%, or approximately $900 million, would be raised by denying depreciation deductions to owners of non-residential buildings, including members of the PCNZ. Applying a 30% tax rate, this suggests that annual depreciation deductions for non-residential buildings amount to approximately $3 billion. We understand that the costing has been constructed using Statistics New Zealand capital stock data and fixed capital formation data for the 2008 year with various assumptions around the proportion of residential and non-residential buildings in the tax base (approximately 20% and 100%, respectively). The net capital stock of residential buildings in 2008, in current prices, was valued at approximately $267 billion, while non-residential buildings comprised approximately $110 billion. We have not seen the detailed costing work, but would assume that the above estimate is likely to (perhaps significantly) overstate the additional revenue from denying depreciation on non- residential buildings. For example, we note that capital stock is valued in current prices, whereas the depreciation base is historical cost (it is unclear whether any adjustment has been made to capital stock to compensate). Also, the assumption that most, if not all, non-residential property is in the tax base discounts significant property holdings by non-taxpayers (including the charitable sector and local and central government). If the revenue impact is unclear, there is a risk of policy decisions being made without the full costs and benefits being understood. PCNZ Tax Depreciation Analysis 100208.doc 14 ABCD 11.2 The impact will be felt predominantly by New Zealand businesses The largest 4 LPTs in the New Zealand market, which can be used as a reasonable proxy for institutional investment in commercial property, hold approximately $4.1 billion (excluding land value), or around 3 to 4%, of the total stock of non-residential buildings 5 . In total, these taxpayers have annual depreciation deductions of around $65 to $70 million per annum. This comprises approximately 2% of the $3 billion gross depreciation deduction that would be disallowed under any depreciation change. This leads us to conclude that the majority of the impact from removing depreciation on non- resident buildings will be felt by New Zealand businesses that own their premises. This will result in a real cash-flow cost to these businesses (which may or may not be compensated through other tax changes). We understand that some business owners, particularly in the SME sector, own premises as a form of collateral to secure bank financing for their operations. The loss of tax depreciation could raise the cost of capital to such firms (to the extent the tax benefit of depreciation deductions reduce their net financing costs) or reduce availability of credit. It also possible that removing a tax deduction in one area will simply refocus attention on other areas (e.g. the interest deductibility rules). To the extent gearing can be increased, the same after tax return profile may be able to be achieved. This would not be desirable from an economic perspective. 11.3 Impact on cost of, and investment in, commercial property infrastructure Removing depreciation on non-residential buildings will either reduce re-investment in this sector or increase rents for occupiers. Office buildings, manufacturing plant, warehousing, etc, are all part of the infrastructure of New Zealand Inc. Reduced investment in this infrastructure or a higher cost associated with its use will adversely impact on the competitiveness of New Zealand business. 12 Tax depreciation treatment in other jurisdictions The appendix to this report compares the tax depreciation treatment of buildings in a number of other countries – based on a survey of KPMG’s international network of member firms on depreciation and other land taxes. We note that, as a general rule, non-residential buildings receive some depreciation tax benefits (either as an explicit tax depreciation deduction or by way of capital allowances). 5 Kiwi Income Property Trust, Goodman Property Trust, AMP NZ Office Trust, ING Property Trust, based on First NZ Capital data. PCNZ Tax Depreciation Analysis 100208.doc 15 ABCD In particular, we note that the majority of our trading partners, including Australia, Germany, Japan and the United States allow depreciation of (some or all) non-residential buildings. The United Kingdom currently allows depreciation in respect of industrial buildings (called an industrial building allowance); however this is to be abolished from 2011. Removing tax depreciation for non-residential buildings would make New Zealand an outlier from a global taxation perspective. At a time when countries are increasingly competing for internationally mobile capital, the New Zealand tax system needs to provide the right incentives for business to stay in New Zealand and relocate here. Removing tax depreciation, when there is clear international evidence that buildings do depreciate, would be contrary to this objective. 13 Pressure on capital/revenue boundary The boundary for what is a capital expense and repairs and maintenance will need to be addressed. While an ongoing issue, currently, if maintenance expenditure (which should be deductible under ordinary principles) is not immediately expensed because it is classified as capital expenditure for tax purposes, it can nevertheless be claimed under the depreciation rules. If depreciation is removed, these amounts will be permanently non-deductible putting significant pressure on the boundary between what is, and is not, repairs and maintenance of a building. For the commercial property sector this is significant given the substantial sums that are spent on refurbishment and maintenance. 14 Conclusion The findings of the 2004 officials’ issues paper, and other international research on the tax depreciation of buildings, strongly suggest that buildings do depreciate. This is also supported by various anecdotal evidence on the need to replace and improve buildings. Further we have not found any studies which suggest buildings do not depreciate. We recognise that the Government is constrained fiscally, and any changes to the tax system will need to be self-funding. Removing depreciation on buildings would seem to be an easy (or at least an easier) option, to fund changes to tax rates. We do not dispute the need for reform of the tax system to address the various anomalies in the tax system (including rental housing, if there is a tax bias there). As far as we are aware, tax depreciation on non-residential buildings was not an area of concern for the TWG. There needs to be a compelling reason for change. Removing depreciation on buildings simply to fund other changes in the tax system, when there is considerable evidence that buildings do economically depreciate, is not such a reason.

Does your jurisdiction allow depreciation on non-residential buildings to be claimed for taxation purposes and, if so, are there special rules for depreciating structures? Industrial buildings which are used for qualifying manufacturing activities can claim tax depreciation at a rate of 4% p.a. straight-line. No. Tax depreciation is only allowed for industrial buildings that are used for qualifying activities (e.g. mill, factory, manufacturing, processing, warehousing, etc – this list is defined in the Income Tax Act). Such tax depreciation is known as industrial building allowance or IBA in short. No. Previously, tax relief was available in respect of expenditure on industrial buildings (know as industrial buildings allowance) but this is now being phased out and will be shortly abolished with effect from 6th April 2011. Yes, buildings are depreciated on a straight line basis. Yes, generally, 3% (in case of a building application till 31 March 1985: 4%) or the effective time of usage or declining-balance method (exception for some old cases) Tax allowances in respect of non- residential buildings and/ or structures located in Hong Kong are available under the profits tax regime, but not the property tax regime. In Malaysia, depreciation on buildings is generally not allowable for tax purposes. However industrial building allowances (i.e. a form of tax depreciation) may be claimed on the cost of a building which qualifies as an 'industrial building'. Examples of these include, amongst others, a factory/warehouse associated with a manufacturing activity, and by extension hospitals, hotels, buildings used for research, welfare or living accommodation for workers. Note however that the Minister of Finance is empowered to prescribe a building as an 'industrial building' which will qualify for industrial building allowances and to determine the rate of the allowance as well. In general commercial or residential buildings would not qualify as 'industrial buildings'. Yes - In general, buildings (except temporary/non-durable buildings) are depreciated at the rate of not more than 5% of the acquisition cost for corporate income tax purposes. There are no special rules for depreciating buildings. Non-residential buildings are depreciated on a straight-line basis over 39 years. IRC Section 168(b)(3)(A) Depreciation on most other types of depreciable property is claimed on a double (or in some cases 150%) declining balance method, switching to the straight line method only in the year in which the straight line method will yield a larger deduction. IRC Section 168(b)(1) 2. Does your jurisdiction allow depreciation on residential rental properties? Generally no. We had special incentives which are now being phased out which provide for tax relief on residential property that was located in certain areas No.No. Yes. For buildings used for accommodation (residential rental property), the annual straight-line depreciation rate is 2% (for buildings constructed before 1 January 1925: 2.5%) or effective time of usage. The alternative declining-balance method rates are according to the current tax law: - first 10 years: 4.00% - following 8 years: 2.50% - remaining 32 years: 1.25% The declining-balance method of depreciation is no longer available for buildings used for accommodation if the building was acquired or constructed after 1 January 2006. Residential rental properties in Hong Kong should qualify for commercial building allowances for profits tax purposes. No tax allowance, however, is available for property tax purposes. No. If the residential properties are rented out as part of the company's business, then it should be allowed a deduction for depreciation at the general rate for buildings (5% of the cost value) for the purpose of corporate tax calculations. However, depreciation deductions on residential property for personal use/non- business purpose is not permitted. Yes, residential rental properties are depreciated on a straight line basis over 27.5 years. IRC Section 168(b)(3)(B) 3. Is there any restriction on offsetting losses from residential property against other types of taxable income? Rental losses can only be offset against rental income. They cannot be offset against any other type of income. Losses from residential property are generally confined to being set-off against income from residential properties. However if the taxpayer is in the trade of renting both commercial and residential properties, the losses from residential property may be set off against gains from commercial properties For an individual letting property as part of a property business, losses cannot generally be set off against general income. Limited relief is available if the loss includes a capital allowances claim. Capital allowances cannot be claimed, however, in respect of residential property, so the point would not arise. There are baskets that segregate types of income for individual tax purposes. However, generally residential losses can be offset against salary and wages income. For corporations there are no baskets and everything is essentially taxed at the full corporate rate of approximately 42%. Yes, there are restrictions concerning the usage of tax losses in case of special tax models (“Steuerstundungsmodelle”), see Section 15b ITL Besides this special regulation, the general rules are applicable including minimum taxation pursuant to Section 10d ITL, which is applicable for Corporate Income Tax purposes and Trade Tax purposes, too. For profits tax purposes, rental losses arising from residential (and non- residential) property can be offset against other types of taxable income of that taxpayer. However, if a special purpose company is incorporated to hold the property, any income/ loss of that special purpose company cannot be offset against the income/ loss of any other group entities (i.e. there is no group relief available). Losses can be carried forward indefinitely for offset against future assessable profits, but cannot be carried back. There is no restriction in offsetting losses from investments in residential property against other types of taxable income. Losses can in principle be offset against the profit of the previous year as well as the nine following years. In 2009 and 2010 a prolonged carry back facility has been introduced from one to three years. If this facility is used, the carry forward period will be decreased to six years. Generally, losses from residential property would not be available to be set off against other types of taxable income unless viewed as losses arising from a business source (in limited circumstances) Deduction for depreciation of residential property used for business purposes is limited up to the amount of taxable income in that period (loss carry forward for 5 years). Yes, with respect to individuals, estates, trusts, personal services corporations and certain closely held corporation. The passive activity loss rules under IRC Section 469 limit such a taxpayer’s ability to offset other types of income with net passive losses. Any excess loss is carried forward to the following year or years until used, or until deducted in the year such a taxpayer disposes of its entire interest in the activity in a fully taxable transaction Rental real estate is generally considered a passive activity, giving rise to passive income or passive loss, with few exceptions. An individual who actively participates in the rental business may deduct up to $25,000 of rental loss against other income, even though the loss is passive. This deduction is phased out as the individual’s income rises and is subject to various other limitations. No - there are currently no restrictions in place. In the past, there has been various speculation as to whether the 'negative gearing' benefit associated with rental properties should be abolished again (having been abolished briefly in the 1980s and then reinstated shortly thereafter in response to significant political backlash 4. Are there different tax depreciation rates depending on building type and/or use (e.g. different rates for office buildings, factories, warehouses etc.) and, if so , what are the broad categories and rates? As noted above, industrial buildings qualify at a straight-line rate of 4%p.a. unless the office/warehouse is less than 10% of the total sq footage attributed to the industrial building no tax depreciation is available. In certain circumstances, other types may qualify and for ease, I attach a copy of the Revenue publication on this. Please note that a lot of these incentive allowances are being phased out. If the building qualifies for IBA, the taxpayer may claim an initial allowance of 25% of the capital expenditure incurred in the year and an annual allowance of 3% over until the expenditure is written off. No depreciation is available. I will follow up but yes. It doesn't actually differentiate on the use but rather construction method etc. For example concrete steel construction is about 40 years. I will follow up with some details on Monday. See answer to (2) above. According to the official publication of the German fiscal authorities, there exist special depreciation rates for immovable assets (other than buildings), for example: warehouse = 16 years light-metal-designed halls = 14 years silo = 17 - 33 years Buildings or structures are broadly classified into “industrial buildings or structures” and “commercial buildings or structures”, based on their usage. Generally, industrial buildings or structures qualify for an initial allowance of 20% and annual allowances of 4% over 20 years. On the other hand, commercial buildings and structures qualify for an annual allowance of 4% on a straight-line basis, but no initial allowance With regards to industrial building allowances, the rate of initial allowance (broadly given in the year of purchase) is generally 10% of qualifying expenditure and the rate of annual allowance is generally 3%. An initial allowance is claimed in the year the capital expenditure is incurred and the annual allowance is claimed annually until the tax written-down value (TWDV) (which is equal to the cost of the asset less allowances claimed) is nil or the asset is disposed of. Note however that certain specific categories of industrial buildings qualify for increased allowances. Examples of such industrial buildings include, amongst others, a warehouse used solely for the purpose of storage of goods for export/imported goods which are to be processed and distributed/re-exported, buildings used as schools/educational instituions, builidngs used for the provision of living accomodation for individuals employed in the business and etc. There are special rates for factory buildings owned by companies whose fixed assets (excluding land) do not exceed THB 2 million and employs not more than 200 workers to have an initial deduction of 25% of the acquisition cost, with the remaining cost value deducted in accordance with the general rate (i.e., 5%). Not generally. However, certain specified types of real estate may be depreciated more quickly. It is difficult to categorize these exceptions into broad categories or rates. For example, single purpose agricultural or horticultural buildings are depreciated over 10 years, retail motor fuel outlets are depreciated over 15 years, and gas pipelines are generally depreciated over either 7 or 15 years, depending on when placed in service and where located. Other special purpose structures may be depreciated at different rates. IRC Section 168(e)(3) We can provide a more detailed list if requested. Depreciation on such buildings is generally claimed using the double-declining (or 150%) balance method, switching to the straight line method only in the year in which the straight line method will yield a larger deduction. IRC Section 168(b)(1) Refer to summary table 5. How are tax depreciation rates set (e.g. has the tax authority undertaken studies of depreciation rates for buildings, or are rates set by reference to international evidence on building rates or rates for accounting? They are set out in legislation on the above basis. (Answer N/A) N/A The underlying principle is useful life. The rates set for tax are an attempt to estimate the useful life of the building. Hence, for example wooden structures have a much shorter depreciation life than steel and concrete. Whether that is actually correct from a life perspective may be debateable but that is the underlying philosophy. In the case of listed REITs for example they seek to limit depreciation so that they can increase the amount of accounting income. In such a case they typically try and get engineering reports to show that the life is say 50 years and depreciate over the longer of the default tax life or the life detailed in the engineering report. In that case tax would use the longer rate. It is possible for tax to use longer rates as it is increasing taxable income but the limiting factor is accounting. According to our understanding, the tax depreciation rates, set by the German fiscal authorities, are based on experiences during the tax audit of the German fiscal authorities. As the tax allowances for industrial/ commercial buildings or structures have been in place for many years, we are unable to locate the consultation papers, if any, in respect of the determination of the rates of allowances. It is envisaged that further research would be necessary in order to ascertain the basis by which the tax depreciation rates are set by the tax authority. No information - requires further research The depreciation rates, when enacted, were generally intended to match useful life. The Department of the Treasury is charged, under IRC section 168(i)(1) with monitoring and analyzing actual experience with respect to all depreciable assets. We are not, however, aware of the results of such monitoring or analysis (if it has been conducted). We could conduct additional research on this point if requested. The rates are legislated in Australia's Income Tax Assessment Act. 6. Are there rules for recovery of tax depreciation when a building is sold for more that it's depreciated book value? There is a clawback of the tax depreciation claimed up to the original cost of the building and this is taxed at the trading rate (generally 12.5%). Where there is a gain in excess of the cost of the building, this is taxed at a rate of 25%. New rules have been recently introduced to tax windfall gains at 80% that arise as a result of rezoning but I can send you something on this separately if required When a building is sold, a clawback of the allowances claimed will be made N/A The depreciated value becomes the basis for determining the gain on sale. There are no special rules for a recovery of tax depreciation for Corporate and Trade Tax purposes. However, in case of a sale of immovable property that is not used for business purposes, the tax depreciation, deducted in the past, increases the capital gain on the level of the individual for German Income purposes, see Section 23 ITL. If the sales proceeds arising on the disposal of an industrial/ commercial building or structure exceed the tax written down value of the property, the excess amount (limited to the total allowances claimed in prior years) will be clawed back and treated as taxable in the year of disposal. If a building is sold for more than its book value, the profit will be taxable against a CIT rate of 25,5%. It is however, under circumstances, possible to form a reinvestment reserve. In general the reserve needs to be used with the next three years and needs to be used for the purchase of real estate which has the same economic use as the sold real estate. For Malaysian tax purposes, the disposal of a building (for which industrial building allowances have been claimed) to a third party would trigger balancing adjustments depending on the TWDV of the asset and the disposal price/market value, whichever is higher. A balancing allowance arises when the market value or the sale price of the asset exceeds the assets TWDV. A balancing charge arises when the market value or sale price of the asset exceeds the assets TWDV. However the amount of the balancing charge to be imposed will be limited to the amount of allowances claimed on the asset prior to disposal. Any gain that is in excess of original cost may attract Real Property Gains Tax where the period of ownership is less than 5 years. Depreciation recapture (the difference between book value of asset and sale price) treated as taxable income for corporate tax purposes (no separate tax on capital gains). Not generally with respect to many buildings. IRC Section 1250. Note, however, that with respect to individual taxpayers, IRC Section 1(h)(1)(D), taxes any gain realized (the amount realized in excess of the depreciated basis) at a rate 10% higher than the normal long term capital gains rate of 15%. This additional tax may be thought of as a proxy for recapture. Corporations are subject to the same tax rate on capital gains and ordinary income so the entire gain (amount realized in excess of the depreciated basis) will be taxed at the same rate. In addition, for all taxpayers, any depreciation claimed in excess of the straight line method is recaptured and taxed as ordinary income. Such excess depreciation may be claimed in the case of buildings with a useful life (depreciation period) of less than 27.5 years and in some other cases. The disposal of buildings which have been depreciated by an owner will trigger a capital gains tax (“CGT”) event. Broadly, for buildings acquired post 13 May 1997, the building depreciation claimed by the owner will reduce the CGT cost base of the building, thereby increasing the amount of taxable capital gain to effectively recapture building amortisation. There are no such adjustments for buildings acquired pre 13 May 1997. The general rule for calculating the annual depreciation for tax purposes is to take the historical cost price minus the rest value divided by the lifespan of the building. It is not allowed to depreciate on land. As of 1 January 2007, based on Dutch tax law, limited depreciation rules apply on buildings. The limitation entails that depreciation may be taken up to a certain value. For investment properties (such as residential, office and commercial real estate), this minimum depreciation value equals the value established by the municipality under the Valuation of Immovable Property Act (“WOZ”), whereas for properties used as part of one’s own business (business premises), it will equal half the value under the WOZ. It is also possible to depreciate buildings to their lower value in use. It is also possible to depreciate investments in tenancy rights. There is no fixed depreciation rate applicable. This is decided by a case to case approach and is depending on the type of real state, state of maintenance, etc. Generally speaking, the annual depreciation rate is between the 0% and 4% Yes – Australia's income tax rules allow depreciation on both residential and non-residential buildings and structural improvements (referred to as "capital works"). Broadly, the following requirements must be satisfied in order to be eligible: ● the capital works must be used in a deductible way (i.e. used to produce assessable income or carry on R&D activities); ● the general rule is the legal owner of the capital works is entitled to depreciate (although if the costs are incurred by a lessee, the deduction will be available to the lessee); ● the deductions are not available for taxpayers who hold the capital works as trading stock; ● the deductions are not available until the construction of the capital works is complete. The quantum of deductions is based on actual cost (rather than purchase price) and, upon sale, a previous owner is required to provide details regarding capital works to the new owner. Various rules regarding what type of capital expenditure qualify for eligible expenditure. The rates are outlined at Q4. PCNZ Tax Depreciation Analysis 100208.doc 18 ABCD 7. Does your jurisdiction have a land tax (being an annual tax levied on the value of land)? At present we don’t have a land tax though rates are paid annually to the local county council. There’s property tax in Singapore. This tax is on all immovable properties in Singapore (land and buildings). Its currently at 10% of the annual value of the property. The annual value is the average annual rent that the property can fetch in the market. Local business rates are payable by the occupiers of commercial property (and council tax in respect of residential properties) Yes but they also levy one on the building portion. Every land and building (and apartment) in Japan has what we call a fixed assets tax assessment value. This is the basis for the charge. For land is not necessarily a reflection of the market price as it is done using a benchmark piece of land (which is valued) and adjustments are made based on a prescribed formula. In most cases it will be less than the actual value (for land). For buildings the value is based on the materials used and a rule of thumb is that the value is 70-80% of what it cost to build. This can be a real problem where you have something where the builder went overboard and you buy cheap because the assessment value does not change just because the asset is sold at a price significantly lower than its assessment value. One other thing that is useful to keep in mind in the context of Japan is that buildings (particularly residential but also true of office and other asset classes) have typically not been made to Yes. There is no land tax in Hong Kong. However, rates are charged at a percentage (currently 5%) of the rateable value and, for properties in the certain regions of Hong Kong with Government leases granted on or after 27 May 1985, Government rent calculated at 3% of the rateable value of the properties is also payable. The rates for the first two quarters of the 2009/10 financial year (i.e. the quarters ended 30 June and 30 September 2009) have been waived, subject to a ceiling of HK$1,500 per quarter. Based on Dutch tax law, land tax does not exist. There is however a property tax, based on the above mentioned WOZ value which is annually established by each municipality. In Malaysia there is property tax in the form of assessment rates and quit rent which are levied at varying rates. The amount of assessment tax and classification of properties varies from one local authority to another and the basis for calculating assessment tax may also differ from state to state. The amount of quit rent also varies from state to state. Yes - a House and Land tax is levied at the rate of 12.5% of the assessed rental value of the property. There are also land transfer fees/tax on the transfer of immovable property In the United States, property tax on real estate (an annual tax levied on the value of real estate, including land and buildings) is levied by local government, usually at the municipal or county level. The federal and state governments do not levy property tax. Yes – each Australian State and the Australian Capital Territory imposes annual land tax, payable on the unimproved value of land at certain dates. The rates vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. last. This is changing now but when you buy residential there is in fact a significant discount in most cases for older buildingsIn fact for residential houses the building is often not assigned any value where it is older and people just look at land value. Office too has tended to age very significantly in Japan. In that context it is very different from New Zealand (which I am assuming is like Australia) in that older houses in Japan are typically assigned no value. There are obviously exceptions where for example the building has some historical value but most of the home builders have not built things to last like they do in New Zealand. One of the reasons for this is to keep things turning over and the other is that they tend to spend a lot more money on gadgets in the home than western countries and the gadgets tend to age. The other is simply that the house is more integrated with the various attachments (rather than being more of a shell the inside of which can be updated).

Our analysis 1 shows that these recommendations: (i) Are inconsistent with the ‘good tax policy’ criteria set out by the Tax Working Group. (ii) May work against over-riding government objectives to become more internationally competitive in order to close the income gap with Australia by 2025. Removing depreciation on buildings would raise tax expenses for businesses. It would increase the effective marginal corporate tax rate from 30% to 32%. This is clearly against the Tax Working Group’s “critical concern” that “New Zealand relies heavily on taxes most harmful to growth – particularly corporate and personal taxes on capital.” In addition, depreciation of commercial buildings is common practice in the OECD. Removing depreciation in New Zealand would make us an outlier and reduce our international tax competitiveness. This could hamper already weak foreign direct investment into New Zealand, the health of the local capital market and erode export competitiveness. This is clearly counter to government policy objectives of making New Zealand a more internationally competitive economy and would place us at a further disadvantage to Australia. A land tax would be efficient and fair only if broadly and uniformly applied. New Zealand has a long history of land taxes beginning in the late 1800s. Exemptions and reductions have made land taxes politically unsustainable. They were finally repealed in 1990. We see no reason why a land tax in the future should be any more politically sustainable, particularly given the strong views of key stakeholder groups such as farmers, retirees and Iwi. A land tax would also impact on land prices. This would impact on banks – at least 2/3 of bank lending is to land based and housing segments. This could impact on the cost and availability of capital - and consequently on economic growth – perhaps for a protracted period. Our initial analysis strongly suggests that far more detailed analysis and rigorous debate is required before these ideas progress further. Otherwise potentially damaging policy decisions could be made. 1 Our analysis looks at these policy suggestions in isolation and not in the context of potentially offsetting policies.

Introduction The Property Council of New Zealand (PCNZ) has engaged NZIER to assess the merits of certain policy recommendations by the Tax Working Group (Buckle et al, 2010). We consider the merits of two particular recommendations in this report:  “Removing tax depreciation on buildings (or certain category of buildings) if empirical evidence shows that they do not depreciate in value.”  “...introduction of a low-rate land tax as a means of funding other tax rate reductions.” 2. Removing tax depreciation on commercial buildings “Removing tax depreciation on buildings (or certain category of buildings) if empirical evidence shows that they do not depreciate in value.” We assume that tax depreciation is removed from commercial property. Our analysis shows that:  depreciation of commercial buildings is common practice among OECD countries  removal of depreciation on commercial buildings would effectively increase the marginal corporate tax rate from 30.0% to 32.1%  to keep the tax bill for businesses the same, the corporate tax rate would have to be cut from 30.0% to 28.0%. The removal of commercial property depreciation would:  raise tax costs, which is clearly against the Tax Working Group’s “critical concern” that “New Zealand relies heavily on taxes most harmful to growth – particularly corporate and personal taxes on capital.”  violate some of the key criteria set out by the TWG, in particular economic efficiency and growth by reducing the incentive to invest  violate one of the key objectives of the Capital Market Development Taskforce (CMD) by effectively raising the cost of capital  violate the spirit and intent of the CMD and 2025 Taskforces by reducing New Zealand’s international competitiveness, by removing depreciation which is commonly in place in the OECD. 2.1 Depreciation of buildings common in the OECD A compilation of OECD country tax practices, summarised in Figures 1 and 2, show that New Zealand is similar to the OECD in the treatment of building tax depreciation. The real divergences appear to be in the absence of a capital gains tax, harmonisation of various tax rates and a higher value added tax. The analysis of OECD countries suggest New Zealand’s current rules on building depreciation are the norm. Removing this depreciation would impose a cost on New Zealand businesses that is not commonly found in the OECD. New Zealand would be less competitive in the global scene, and in particular less attractive relative to our NZIER – Depreciation and land tax 2 closest competitor Australia. New Zealand already allows less depreciation on buildings (2%) than Australia (2.5%-4.0%). This has the potential to weigh on foreign direct investment into New Zealand (which is already low).

The effect of depreciation is to reduce the tax burden (by reducing the taxable income by the depreciation amount) and lift after tax cash income. Removing depreciation on buildings would lift the effective corporate tax rate from 30% to 32%. Removing all depreciation (not just buildings) would lift the effective corporate tax rate to 42%. 2.2.1 Removing building depreciation lifts effective tax rate to 32% We estimate the removal of commercial building depreciation would levy large costs on New Zealand business (around $1 billion in 2008). This equates to effectively increasing the marginal corporate tax rate from 30.0% to 32.1%. Keeping the business tax bill the same would require a corporate tax rate of 28.0%.

While due care has been taken, the estimates are illustrative. We estimate the 2008 building depreciation amount by assuming it is 3% of the market value of non-residential buildings (the statutory rate is 4%, but this applies to historical cost, not market value). All data in Figure 3 relate to all businesses in New Zealand as recorded by Statistics New Zealand in the 2008 Annual Enterprise Survey. 2.2.2 Removing all depreciation lifts effective tax rate to 42% We also analysed a scenario where all depreciation is removed. While this was not a recommendation of the TWG report, it serves to highlight the significant divergences between industries. Capital intense buildings may face marginal tax rates in excess of 50%. Without any depreciation net cash income by businesses in 2008 would be $6b (or 11%) lower. This equates to an increase in the marginal tax rate from 30.0% to 42.2%. Supporting tables can be found in Appendix A. NZIER – Depreciation and land tax 5 2.3 Assessment against criteria Removing depreciation on commercial property does not stack up against the criteria and objectives set out by the TWG, Capital Market Development Taskforce and 2025 Taskforce. We consider the policy in isolation and not in the context of potentially offsetting policies. Figure 4: Stacked against criteria Group and criteria Meet? Comments Tax working group Efficiency and growth N Reduce economic efficiency and growth. Depreciation allowance typically promotes investment in capital. New Zealand’s low productivity growth and demise in economic leader-boards is in part explained by low capital intensity. Policies that discourage investment can be detrimental to economic growth. Equity and fairness N Puts NZ businesses at a disadvantage in an international context, given depreciation of buildings is generally allowed offshore. Fair within a domestic context as it does not discriminate by property type. Revenue integrity Y Removal of depreciation allowance on property would reduce a bias in investment in residential property. Fiscal cost Y Raise revenue by around $1.3b (about $1b from commercial property). Compliance and administration cost Y Would likely reduce compliance and administration. Coherence N Removal of depreciation on commercial property would move NZ away from the 'norm' in the OECD, and importantly Australia. Capital market development workforce Minimise the cost of capital N Removing depreciation would reduce future income from investments in property (due to reduced future income streams) and lower NPV (due to lower cash-flows in early years). This means the required rate of return for a given investment would rise. Capital flows to most valuable uses N This would create an artificial distortion to invest in other forms of assets (such as plant and machinery) relative to property. This is against the intent of a level playing field for all investments. 2025 Taskforce Sharpening private incentives to invest, to save and to work N Removing depreciation reduces the incentive to invest, as it lowers the future stream of income from the asset.

Imposing a low-rate land tax “A land tax is a highly efficient tax mechanism which could be introduced as part of a package of reforms to the New Zealand tax system.” (Policy advice division, IRD and The Treasury, 2009). A land tax is only efficient if it is applied broadly and uniformly. In the event of exemptions, the tax ceases to be efficient and becomes distortionary with economic costs. While it may begin as a broad and exemption-free tax, New Zealand’s long history of land taxes shows (Figure 5) that tinkering and changes are difficult to resist. A land tax would be a burden for the asset-rich-cash-poor segments of society, including farmers, Iwi and retirees. A greater immediate concern would be a loss of land value and its impact on the banking system. At least 2/3 of bank lending is to land based industries and residential property, so the impact on availability and cost of credit and the economy may be large. The land tax only stacks up under very special circumstances. Looking at it objectively against the criteria set out by the TWG, CMD Taskforce and the 2025 Taskforce, it seems unlikely that the main criteria can be satisfied over a reasonable timeframe. 3.1 Long history of land taxes New Zealand has a long history of land taxes. These became smaller through time as other taxes were introduced and exemptions were created. Even if introduced in a efficient fashion now, it is unclear if it can be politically sustainable.

In particular, the policies need to be applied broadly and uniformly. Otherwise, distortions create economic loss. Even if enacted as such in the beginning, it is unclear if it can remain free from political interference in the future. More worrying is the prospect of land value declines and the impact on the banking sector. This could impact on the cost and availability of capital and restrain economic growth for a protracted period of time. Group and criteria Meet? Comments Tax working group Efficiency and growth N A land tax would be efficient only if applied uniformly. This is unlikely over the medium term given vote-sensitive and asset-rich- cash-poor segments such as farms, Iwi and retirees. In the presence of exemptions the tax would be inefficient and distortionary. There could be a large impact on the banking sector, with at least 2/3 of their loans to land based industries and housing. This could raise the cost and availability of capital, weighing on future economic growth. Equity and fairness N It would be equitable and fair only if applied uniformly. However, it would adversely impact on the groups identified above. In the presence of exemptions, as happened historically, the tax would not meet this criterion. Revenue integrity Y If properly implemented revenue integrity should be maintained. Fiscal cost Maybe The impact is ambiguous, as it would depend on the rate of tax, if the tax is a deductible expense and how much land prices fall. There may also be wider financial and economic ramifications which cannot be predicted accurately. Compliance and administration cost Maybe Would likely reduce compliance and administration. Coherence N Only targets one class of wealth and is thus not coherent. Capital market development workforce Minimise the cost of capital N Declines in land prices could impact on the banking sector and thus the cost of capital. Capital flows to most valuable uses N Creates a distorting incentive to hold wealth in assets other than land. 2025 Taskforce Sharpening private incentives to invest, to save and to work N Creates a distorting incentive to hold wealth in assets other than land.
