Unclassified 1 INTERPRETATION STATEMENT: IS 17/02 INCOME TAX – DEDUCTIBILITY OF FARMHOUSE EXPENSES All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. Relevant legislative provisions are reproduced in the Appendix to this Interpretation Statement. This Interpretation Statement considers the deductibility of expenditure relating to a farmhouse that forms part of a farming business. The Interpretation Statement withdraws and replaces a number of Public Information Bulletin and Tax Information Bulletin items about certain expenses for which farmers can claim deductions (these are listed at \[24\] of this Interpretation Statement). According to these items, the Commissioner has permitted full-time farmers to claim full deductions for both rates and interest payable on farm mortgages, and has allowed all farmers to claim 25% deductions on expenses relating to the farmhouse. The Commissioner considers that the deductions allowed in those items are no longer appropriate and the general rules of deductibility and apportionment, as explained in this Interpretation Statement, will apply. However, in situations where the compliance costs of calculating the private use element far outweighs any likely deduction, the Interpretation Statement allows some sole traders and partners of partnerships to claim an automatic 20% deduction (a more realistic amount) for farmhouse expenses and 100% deductions for rates and interest. These deductions are allowed when the value of the farmhouse is 20% or less than the total value of the farm. This Interpretation Statement will apply from the commencement of a taxpayer’s 2017-2018 income year.

The Commissioner has a number of long-standing policies concerning the deductibility of expenses relating to farms and farmhouses. These policies appear to have originated in the 1960s at a time when farm ownership and operating structures were generally less complicated than they are today. As part of the process of reviewing the existing policies, the Commissioner has also sought to clarify the principles for deductibility across a variety of ownership structures. 2. In reviewing these policies, the Commissioner’s main concern is to allow farmers to deduct farmhouse expenses that are business related, while ensuring that deductions are not claimed for expenses that are private in nature. In undertaking this exercise, the Commissioner needs to balance the strict application of the law with the associated compliance costs of doing so, while maintaining equity between taxpayers and protecting the integrity of the tax system. 3. Farming businesses may be structured in many different ways. Whether farmhouse expenses are deductible will depend on a number of factors, including who owns the farmhouse, who operates the farming business, and who lives in the farmhouse. 4. Against this background, deductions being obtained for private expenditure is most likely in situations where:  the person incurring the farmhouse expenditure lives in the farmhouse; and  the value of the farmhouse represents a significant proportion of the total value of the farm. 5. A person living in the farmhouse and incurring the farmhouse expenditure will be a natural person and could be any of the following:  a sole trader (see \[77\]);  a partner in a partnership (see \[77\];  an employee or shareholder-employee ( see \[112\]);  a shareholder, beneficiary or other natural person not involved in the farming business (see \[114\]). 6. While the principles in this Interpretation Statement apply mainly to sole traders and partners in partnerships, a summary of the treatment of farmhouse expenses incurred by different entities in different situations may be found in the table at \[126\]. Unclassified 3 General principles 7. The deductibility of expenditure relating to a farmhouse (farmhouse expenses) must be determined under the general permission, general limitations and the specific deduction provisions in Part D of the Income Tax Act 2007. A deduction is available under the general permission only where the expenses have the necessary relationship both with:  the taxpayer concerned, and  the gaining or producing of their assessable income or with the carrying on of a business for that purpose.  It is a matter of degree and a question of fact whether a sufficient relationship exists. For example, a person operating a farming business may claim a full deduction for farmhouse expenses where the farmhouse is rented out or provided to an employee. 8. It is important to note that this Interpretation Statement is only concerned with farming operations that are businesses. For more information on what constitutes a business, please see the discussion of Grieve v CIR (1984) 6 NZTC 61,682 (CA) in the commentary to BR Pub 09/06: “Lease surrender payments received by a landlord – Income tax treatment” (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 21, No 6 (August 2009): 37). 9. If an expense satisfies the general permission, it may still not be deductible due to the application of the general limitations. For example, a person is denied a deduction for an expense to the extent to which it is of a capital nature. For farmhouse expenses, the private limitation may apply where the person incurring the expenses lives in the farmhouse. When a person lives in a farmhouse, any expense they incur on that farmhouse must be apportioned between business and private use based on the particular facts in each case. This is the same treatment that applies for expenses incurred by other taxpayers on private houses when they are used for business purposes, eg, home offices. 10. Some expenses may be deductible under a specific provision in Part D. For example, most companies need no nexus with income to claim a deduction for interest expenses. For other taxpayers, interest expenses will still need to satisfy the general permission to give rise to a deduction. 11. Generally, for all farming businesses, where it is possible to dissect an expense into deductible and non-deductible amounts, that method should be used first (see \[62\] and \[66\] below). Where an expense relates to both the business and private use of the farmhouse, dissection may be impractical or impossible. In this situation, the expense will need to be apportioned on some fair and reasonable basis between the business and private portions of the expense. Apportionment will be necessary when a farmer lives in the farmhouse and uses part of it for business purposes (see table at \[126\] below). This will generally arise, for example, when sole traders and partners of partnerships live in the farmhouse. The Commissioner considers that apportionment of farmhouse expenses based on time and space would generally be an appropriate method. This is consistent with other businesses. 12. On the other hand, some expenses will be incurred on the farm as a whole (including the farmhouse). In this situation, the proportion of the expenses that relate to the private use of the farmhouse must be determined. An apportionment based on time and space might not provide an accurate division between expenses that relate to the farmhouse and expenses that relate to the rest of the farm. The Commissioner considers that an appropriate method of apportionment is one that is based on the value of the farmhouse (being the value of the farmhouse, Unclassified 4 curtilage and improvements to the farmhouse) as a proportion of the total value of the farm and improvements. The Commissioner will accept a formal valuation or a reasonable estimate of the values of the farmhouse (including curtilage and improvements) and farm. The relative costs of the farm and farmhouse may be a reliable approximation of value at a particular point in time. 13. These general principles apply to all farming businesses, regardless of the type of entity incurring the expenditure and the ownership structure of the farming business. Reducing compliance costs where private element of farmhouse expenses is minimal 14. For larger farming businesses carried on by sole traders and partners in partnerships, the farmhouse may represent a small proportion of the overall value of the farm. In this situation, the private element of any expenses will be minimal. However, the compliance costs associated with calculating deductions for interest and other farmhouse expenses outweigh the tax consequences of any deductions available. Accordingly, this Interpretation Statement sets out circumstances in which the Commissioner will accept prescribed levels of deductions for farmhouse expenses incurred by sole traders and partners who live in the farmhouse. This is instead of always requiring deductions for farmhouse expenses to be based on actual use. 15. The Commissioner will accept a practical approach to apportioning farmhouse expenses in this situation. This approach has been developed to mitigate compliance costs for farms with a low private-use element. The approach is based on a new distinction between:  farming businesses where the value of the farmhouse (including curtilage and improvements) is 20% or less of the total value of the farm (Type 1 farms); and  farming businesses where the value of the farmhouse (including curtilage and improvements) is more than 20% of the total value of the farm (Type 2 farms). 16. The value of the farmhouse (including curtilage and improvements) and farm can be used to determine the extent of the private use of the farmhouse. The Commissioner will accept a formal valuation or a reasonable estimate of the values of the farmhouse (including curtilage and improvements) and farm. To reduce compliance costs, the respective costs of the farmhouse and farm may also be used to determine whether the farm is a Type 1 or Type 2 farm. 17. The term “curtilage” refers to the land surrounding the farmhouse that is used primarily for private purposes. The curtilage may be fenced (like a backyard) or not. If the curtilage is not fenced, the Commissioner will accept a reasonable estimate of the curtilage area and its value. 18. Farmers who live in the farmhouse on Type 1 farms may determine whether expenses are deductible under the general permission and general limitations as set out in this Interpretation Statement. However, the Commissioner will also accept that 20% of the farmhouse is used for business purposes without any supporting evidence. As a result, such farmers can claim 20% of all farmhouse expenses as deductible business expenses. In addition, these farmers may continue to claim 100% of the interest costs relating to the farmhouse and 100% of rates. Unclassified 5 19. Farmers who live in the farmhouse on Type 2 farms must determine whether expenses are deductible under the general permission and general limitations as set out in this Interpretation Statement. Telephone rental and fixed line charges 20. Farmers who operate their business from home may claim 50% of their telephone rental charges, unless they can show that the actual business use of the telephone is greater than 50%. This is the existing practice for other home based businesses. Approach in this Interpretation Statement 21. This Interpretation Statement applies the general principles to two broad situations:  a person who lives in the farmhouse and incurs farmhouse expenses (see discussion from \[74\] below); and  a person who does not live in the farmhouse and incurs farmhouse expenses (see discussion from \[116\] below). 22. The following diagram provides a general summary of the treatment of farmhouse expenses incurred by persons in various capacities. The diagram assumes that the other general limitations (other than the private limitation) do not apply. Unless otherwise indicated, a person can include a sole trader, partner in a partnership, trustee, or company. For more detailed summaries, please refer to the tables at \[111\] and \[126\]. Unclassified 6 Introduction 23. This Interpretation Statement is about the Commissioner’s long-standing policy to allow full-time farmers to claim full deductions for rates and interest and all farmers to claim 25% of the expenses relating to the farmhouse (eg, insurance, electricity, repairs and maintenance, etc). Many of these concessions were negotiated with the farming industry in the 1960s. This Interpretation Statement updates and replaces these concessions with a revised approach. 24. This Interpretation Statement supersedes all previous Inland Revenue statements on farmhouse expenses. The following publications state that the Commissioner will allow farmers to claim deductions for certain expenses incurred on the farmhouse:  ‘New Arrangements With Farmers — Some Further Deductions’, Public Information Bulletin No 14 (September 1964): 6;  ‘Farmers leasing Farm from Trust – Rental Portion Applicable to Dwellings’, Public Information Bulletin No 89 (January 1977): 4; Unclassified 7  ‘Policies We’re Reviewing’, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 4, No 8 (April 1993): 3 ;  ‘Farmhouse interior decoration expenses – deductibility’, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 6, No 14 (June 1995): 24; and  ‘Farm lease payments – deduction for cottage’, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 7, No 8 (February 1996): 32. 25. In addition to the specific deductions set out in these publications, it was generally accepted that the Commissioner would allow a deduction of 25% of farmhouse expenses to reflect the use of the farmhouse as an administrative base for the farm. 26. The following deductions for farmhouse expenses have generally been accepted as available to farmers:  mortgage interest on the farm, including the farmhouse, for full-time farmers (100%);  rates (100%);  home telephone rental for full-time farmers (100%);  electricity for the farmhouse (25%);  repairs and maintenance for the farmhouse (25%);  farmhouse interior decoration expenses (25%);  general deduction for expenses for the farmhouse (25%); and  rent applicable to a farmhouse when the farmer leases the farm (25%). 27. To the extent that they refer to these deductions, the publications listed at \[24\] are updated and replaced by this Interpretation Statement. 28. In addition, the policy statement on ‘Telephone rental deductions for businesses based at home’, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 5, No 12 (May 1994): 2, explicitly did not apply to farmers. The policy statement said that farmers could continue to claim 100% deductions for the cost of telephone rental for farmhouse telephones. This Interpretation Statement modifies that position and farmers are now allowed the same deductions as other taxpayers. All farmers who operate their business from home must now follow the existing practice of other home based businesses and claim up to 50% of the cost of telephone rental, unless they can show that the actual business use of the telephone is greater and a higher percentage is justified. Analysis 29. This Interpretation Statement considers the deductibility of farmhouse expenses. A farmhouse is one example of a building on a farm property. As with other types of expenses, the starting point is the general permission and general limitations. In addition, specific deductions may be available under other provisions in Part D. 30. The first part of this Interpretation Statement sets out the general principles of deductibility and discusses some of the specific deduction provisions that might apply to farmhouse expenses. In addition, this Interpretation Statement discusses some methods of dissecting and apportioning farmhouse expenses that are not fully deductible. This Interpretation Statement then applies these principles to two broad scenarios:  the farmhouse expenses are incurred by a person living in the farmhouse; and Unclassified 8  the farmhouse expenses are incurred by a person not living in the farmhouse. 31. The second part of this Interpretation Statement then sets out a practical approach to apportioning farmhouse expenses that the Commissioner will accept. 32. The final part of this Interpretation Statement sets out some examples that illustrate how the general principles and the practical approach set out in this Interpretation Statement apply to some common situations. Deductibility of expenses 33. There are many different ways that farming businesses are structured. Whether farmhouse expenses are deductible will depend on a number of factors, including who owns the farmhouse, who operates the farming business and who lives in the farmhouse. 34. It is important to note that this Interpretation Statement is only concerned with farming operations that are businesses. For more information on what constitutes a business, please see the discussion of Grieve v CIR (1984) 6 NZTC 61,682 (CA) in the commentary to BR Pub 09/06: “Lease surrender payments received by a landlord – Income tax treatment” (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 21, No 6 (August 2009): 37). 35. The general rules for deductions are contained in subpart DA of the Act. In short, the deductibility of an expense is determined as follows:  The general permission must be satisfied in any situation where a deduction is sought by a taxpayer (s DA 1).  Even if the general permission is satisfied, a deduction for such an expense may be denied if a general limitation applies (s DA 2).  However, the subparts that follow subpart DA provide for specific rules that may apply to supplement or override both the general permission and the general limitations (s DA 3(1) and (4)). 36. In addition, as will be discussed below, some expenses may need to be dissected or apportioned between deductible and non-deductible amounts. General permission 37. The general permission is contained in s DA 1. Section DA 1(1) and (2) provide: DA 1 General permission Nexus with income (1) A person is allowed a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss, including an amount of depreciation loss, to the extent to which the expenditure or loss is— (a) incurred by them in deriving— (i) their assessable income; or (ii) their excluded income; or (iii) a combination of their assessable income and excluded income; or (b) incurred by them in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving— (i) their assessable income; or (ii) their excluded income; or (iii) a combination of their assessable income and excluded income. General permission (2) Subsection (1) is called the general permission. Unclassified 9 38. Section DA 1 therefore provides two bases for deduction:  The first is for expenses or losses incurred by the person in deriving their assessable or excluded income (see s DA 1(1)(a)).  The second is for expenses or losses incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable or excluded income (s DA 1(1)(b)). 39. The leading authorities on the principles of deductibility are the Court of Appeal judgments in CIR v Banks (1978) 3 NZTC 61,236 and Buckley & Young Limited v CIR (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271. These cases are authority for the following principles:  A deduction is available under the general permission where the expense has the necessary relationship both with the taxpayer concerned and with either the gaining or producing of their assessable income or with the carrying on of a business for that purpose. This requires a focus on the relationship between the advantage gained or sought to be gained by the expense and the income-earning process, which in turn requires a focus on the true character of the payment made.  It is a matter of degree and a question of fact whether such a sufficient relationship exists.  The phrase “to the extent to which” contemplates that an expense may be apportioned between its deductible and non-deductible components. 40. For an expense to be deductible under s DA 1, a sufficient relationship (nexus) must exist between the expense incurred by the taxpayer and the deriving of assessable income or the carrying on of a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income. 41. It is important to note that in determining the deductibility of an expense, the focus is on the character of the expense from the point of view of the taxpayer who has incurred the expense. This may be determined by identifying the advantage gained or sought to be gained by the taxpayer in incurring that expense. 42. Whether an expense is deductible will depend on the particular facts of each case. In the context of farmhouse expenses, it will be necessary to determine who has incurred the expense and in what capacity. 43. However, a deduction is not available under s DA 1 to the extent the general limitations in s DA 2 apply. General limitations 44. The general limitations are contained in s DA 2. The limitations that will most commonly apply to farmhouse expenses are the capital limitation, private limitation and employment limitation. Section DA 2 relevantly provides: DA 2 General limitations Capital limitation (1) A person is denied a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is of a capital nature. This rule is called the capital limitation. Private limitation (2) A person is denied a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is of a private or domestic nature. This rule is called the private limitation. ... Employment limitation (4) A person is denied a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is incurred in deriving income from employment. This rule is called the employment limitation. Unclassified 10 .... Relationship of general limitations to general permission (7) Each of the general limitations in this section overrides the general permission. 45. This Interpretation Statement primarily considers the application of the private limitation and the employment limitation to determine whether an expense is deductible. Under s DA 2(2), a person is denied a deduction for an expense to the extent to which it is of a private or domestic nature. Under s DA 2(4), a person is denied a deduction for an expense to the extent to which it is incurred in deriving income from employment. 46. However, in any given situation, it is important to determine whether any of the other general limitations apply. This will depend on the particular facts of each case. For example, under s DA 2(1), a person is denied a deduction for an expense to the extent to which it is of a capital nature. The capital limitation is beyond the scope of this Interpretation Statement. For more information and analysis on the application of the capital limitation, please see IS 12/03: “Income Tax – Deductibility of repairs and maintenance expenditure – general principles”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 24, No 7 (August 2012): 68. 47. The general limitations override the general permission: s DA 2(7). However, the general limitations need not be applied unless the expense first has the requisite nexus with deriving income and satisfies the general permission. Special provisions relating to interest 48. Deductibility of interest is determined under ss DB 6 and DB 7. Section DB 6 overrides the capital limitation, but the general permission must still be satisfied and the other general limitations still apply: s DB 6(4). Section DB 7 (which applies to most companies) supplements the general permission and overrides the capital limitation, the exempt income limitation, and the withholding tax limitation. The other general limitations still apply: s DB 7(8). 49. Under s DB 6, a person is allowed a deduction for any interest incurred, except for penalty interest under s DB 1. An interest deduction is not subject to the capital limitation. However, any interest deduction must still satisfy the general permission in s DA 1 (ie, a nexus must still exist between the interest incurred and the assessable income derived) and is subject to the other general limitations (including the private limitation). 50. How the borrowed capital was used must be considered when determining whether interest incurred is deductible: Pacific Rendezvous Limited v CIR (1986) 8 NZTC 5,146 (CA); Eggers v CIR (1988) 10 NZTC 5,153 (CA); and CIR v Brierley (1990) 12 NZTC 7,184 (CA). As Richardson J suggests in Banks at 61,246, determining the deductibility of interest will ordinarily involve the same considerations as determining the deductibility of other expenses under the general permission. Under the current legislation, this is because interest expenses must satisfy the general permission to be deductible: s DB 6(4). 51. Under s DB 7, most companies need no nexus with income to claim a deduction for interest expenses. Where s DB 7 does not apply to a particular company (for instance qualifying companies), interest expenses will need to satisfy s DB 6 to be deductible. Deductions available under other regimes 52. The following discussion briefly explains some other regimes in the Act that may apply when considering the deductibility of farmhouse expenses. Unclassified 11 Employer pays employee remuneration 53. Expenses incurred by an employer on employee remuneration are generally deductible to the employer under the general permission. This is because employee remuneration expenses, such as salary and wages, are an ordinary incidence of carrying on a business. (However, some employee expenses may still be subject to the capital limitation: Christchurch Press Company Ltd v CIR (1993) 15 NZTC 10,206 (HC).) 54. Expenses incurred by the employer in providing accommodation to an employee in connection with their employment (s CE 1B) and maintaining that accommodation will also generally be deductible to the employer under the general permission. The value of accommodation provided to an employee under s CE 1B is income to the employee under s CE 1. Commissioner’s Statement CS 16/02 – Determining “Market Rental Value” of Employer-Provided Accommodation provides guidance on determining the value of farm housing provided to employees. Employer incurs expenses on account of, or reimburses, an employee 55. An employer may reimburse an employee for expenses the employee incurs in connection with their employment. Alternatively, an employer might pay for expenses incurred by an employee as “expenditure on account” of that employee. In both these situations, the employee has incurred the expenses. These amounts will be deductible to the employer if the general permission is satisfied. 56. These amounts will be exempt income to the employee to the extent the employee would be allowed a deduction if they incurred the expenses and if the employment limitation did not exist: ss CW 17(1) and (2). This is provided the expenses are not private or capital in nature. Where the expenditure on account or reimbursement does not satisfy ss CW 17(1) or (2), those amounts will be assessable to the employee under s CE 1. Employer provides employee with fringe benefit 57. Costs incurred by an employer in providing a fringe benefit will be deductible if the general permission is satisfied. 58. In some situations an employer may incur expenses to provide an employee with a non-monetary benefit in connection with their employment. An example might be where an employer incurs and pays the employee’s power bill (or other expenses for the private use of a farmhouse). The “on premises exemption” in s CX 23 does not apply because “premises of a person” is defined to exclude premises occupied by an employee of the person for residential purposes. Therefore the employee has received an unclassified fringe benefit under s CX 37. The employer will be liable for fringe benefit tax to the value of the fringe benefit. Company pays dividends to shareholders and shareholder-employees 59. Dividends paid by a company are not deductible. A dividend is a transfer of value from a company to a shareholder where the cause of the transfer is their shareholding in the company. An example might be where a company allows a shareholder (who is not an employee) to live in a farmhouse for no rent or for rent less than market value. Another example is where a company pays any private expenses on behalf of a shareholder in that company or incurs expenses that would have been private had they been incurred by the shareholder. Such amounts will be dividends to the shareholder. A divide nd derived by a person is income of the person: s CD 1. Unclassified 12 60. Section CD 20(1) provides that an unclassified fringe benefit provided by a company to a shareholder-employee may be treated as a dividend if the company so elects. Appropriate methods of apportionment 61. The general permission and general limitations use the phrase “to the extent”. It is well accepted that this phrase indicates that an expense may need to be apportioned into deductible and non-deductible amounts. An example is where the farmhouse is used for both business and private purposes. Apportionment may also be necessary under a specific deduction provision (if that provision does not override the general permission or general limitations). 62. The leading case on apportionment in New Zealand is Banks. In Banks, Richardson J drew a distinction between dissecting and apportioning expenses. This distinction was drawn from the Australian High Court decision of Ronpibon Tin NL v FCT (1949) 78 CLR 47 at 59. Where an expense has distinct and severable deductible and non-deductible components, it can be divided or dissected. An amount may be dissected where there are distinct and severable components that are subject to different tax treatments (such as assessable and non-assessable income, or revenue and capital, or private expenses). Dissection would be possible, for example, for a composite amount that relates to an itemised invoice or to several things or services with discrete parts. 63. In contrast, where a single outlay serves two or more objects indifferently, dissection is impractical. Here, apportionment on a fair and reasonable basis (such as time, area or some other quantifiable basis) applies. 64. In Buckley & Young, Richardson J considered at 61,282, what apportionment method would be appropriate for a house used for both business and private purposes: The circumstances of the particular case will usually determine what is the most apt way of deciding how much of the expenditure is attributable to the deductible item. For example, where an asset, such as a house or car, is used for both business and private purposes, the apportionment of total expenses may fairly be based on the use (and in some cases availability for use) for business purposes and private purposes respectively. Even so, it is impossible to prescribe any precise formula applicable to all cases. Each such case depends on its own circumstances. It is the yardstick of factual use, or availability for use for business purposes, that satisfies the requirements that the apportionment must be fair, not arbitrary, and must be done as a matter of fact. 65. The Commissioner considers that, based on Banks, a general rule of apportionment of farmhouse expenses is not appropriate and each case must be considered on its own facts. 66. The Commissioner considers that where it is possible to dissect expenses into deductible and non-deductible amounts, that method should be used first. This may be possible, for example, with premiums for insurance policies on wholly private assets, private toll calls, and rates charges that are specifically charged on private houses (ie, the amounts are charged per house). Where dissection is impractical or impossible, the expense will need to be apportioned on some fair and reasonable basis. 67. Where an expense relates only to the farmhouse, and cannot be dissected between deductible and non-deductible amounts, the expense will need to be apportioned. The Commissioner considers that apportionment of farmhouse expenses based on time and space will generally be an appropriate method. This was the method used by the taxpayer in Banks and accepted by the Court of Appeal. Such expenses would include household electricity, repairs and maintenance, telephone Unclassified 13 rental and fixed line charges, insurance policies that only cover the farmhouse and other expenses incurred only on the farmhouse. 68. Some expenses will be incurred on the farm as a whole (including the farmhouse). In this situation, the proportion of the expense that relates to the private use of the farmhouse must be determined. Also, some expenses will be calculated with reference to the value of the farm and improvements. In these situations, the Commissioner considers that an appropriate method of apportionment is one that is based on the value of the farmhouse (being the value of the farmhouse, curtilage and improvements to the farmhouse) as a proportion of the total value of the farm and improvements. This is because an apportionment based on time and space might not provide an accurate division between expenses that relate to the farmhouse and expenses that relate to the rest of the farm. An example where an area-based apportionment might not be appropriate is where the farmhouse is a small proportion of the area of the farm, but a high proportion of the value of the farm. 69. The Commissioner will accept a formal valuation or a reasonable estimate of the values of the farmhouse (including curtilage and improvements) and farm. In order to reduce compliance costs, the Commissioner will also allow farmers to use the respective costs of the farm and farmhouse. The costs of the farm and farmhouse must be comparable and show the relative market values at a particular point in time. 70. However, the time and space method could still be used to calculate how much of the farmhouse expenses are used for business purposes and are therefore deductible. Expenses that might warrant using such a method include mortgage interest attributable to the farmhouse. 71. In addition to the deductions allowed under the Act as set out above, the Commissioner will accept an updated approach to the apportionment of farmhouse expenses in place of the original policies. This approach is explained below under the heading ‘Practical Approach’ (see below from \[91\]). Application of the general principles 72. As noted above, the Commissioner’s various policy statements have applied for many years. Some of the policy statements assume that the farm is owned by an individual or partnership. These days, farm ownership is often more complicated, with companies and trusts involved in the ownership structure. Further, often the farming assets are not owned by the entity that carries on the farming business. All of these different structures and options make it difficult for the Commissioner to set out the correct tax treatment for each variation. 73. However, having considered a range of different structures, the Commissioner considers that the most useful distinction to draw for people incurring farmhouse expenses is between those where the person incurring the expenditure lives in the farmhouse and those where they do not. Farmhouse expenses incurred by a person living in the farmhouse 74. The following analysis considers the deductibility of farmhouse expenses incurred by each type of person living in a farmhouse. Because of similarities of treatment, they are grouped as follows:  sole traders and partners in partnerships who operate the farming business;  employees and shareholder-employees;  shareholders, beneficiaries of trusts and other natural persons who are not involved in operating the farming business. Unclassified 14 75. The occupants of the farmhouse might own or rent the farmhouse, or they might be provided the farmhouse as accommodation (eg, under a trust deed, or as part of their employment). 76. It is important to remember that for the general permission to be satisfied, the person incurring the expense must be deriving income from the farm or farmhouse. Sole traders and partners in partnerships who operate the farming business 77. Some farms are owned and operated by sole traders or partnerships. Such persons may live in the farmhouse and derive business income from the farm. The following analysis shows that where they incur farmhouse expenses:  expenses incurred on one’s own shelter are inherently private;  no distinction exists between full-time and part-time farmers; and  farmhouse expenses may be deducted to the extent that the farmhouse is used for the farming business. Expenses incurred on one’s own shelter are inherently private 78. In CIR v Haenga (1985) 7 NZTC 5,198, Richardson J in the Court of Appeal considered that an expense properly characterised as consumption (eg, food, clothing and shelter) is not incidental and relevant to the derivation of income merely because it is necessary in the sense that it maintains the individual and, in turn, his or her ability to perform his or her employment. 79. In Hunter v CIR (1989) 11 NZTC 6,242 (HC), the taxpayer sought to claim a deduction for the expenses he incurred in relocating to a new city where those expenses exceeded his reimbursement entitlement. The expenses related to the sale of his family home and the purchase of a new one. The issue was whether these expenses were private or domestic in nature and therefore not deductible. McGechan J in the High Court held that the relocation expenses were incurred primarily for private or domestic purposes. McGechan J suggested that determining where the line falls is an exercise of judgment based on the facts of the case, at 6,260: As Haenga's case illustrates, an expenditure which in its essential character may seem a paradigm case of private or domestic expenditure may as a result of other factors be characterised otherwise. It is useful to look for nexus between the expenditure, and the income production or intended income production. In the end, whether there is sufficient nexus to take an expenditure out of the private or domestic character and into a deductible work-related classification involves a value judgment. It may simply be putting the matter another way to apply a test distinguishing between pre-requisite to earning income, and actual participation in the income earning process. In the end, an overall view must be taken. As with the ancient jibe about obscenity, at times private or domestic expenditure can be difficult to define but not unduly difficult to recognise. 80. That a farmhouse is essentially private in nature is supported by the following Taxation Review Authority (TRA) decisions: Case E11 (1981) 5 NZTC 59,064; Case F47 (1983) 6 NZTC 59,801; Case G13 (1985) 7 NZTC 1,048; Case J33 (1987) 9 NZTC 1,190; Case K57 (1988) 10 NZTC 465. In addition, two TRA cases concerning private houses on business premises support this view: Case H12 (1986) 8 NZTC 168, and Case L81 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,468. 81. There is a clear prohibition in the Act for deductibility of an expense that is, in reality, of a private or domestic nature. The cases, including the Court of Appeal decision in Haenga, seem clear that expenses on food, clothing and shelter are private or domestic in nature when incurred by the person obtaining the benefit of the expenses. If the expense is private in nature, then no deduction is permitted Unclassified 15 for that expense because the general limitations override the general permission. Like the enquiry into statutory nexus, the enquiry into whether an expense is of a private or domestic nature is focused primarily on the advantage sought by the payer. 82. Despite clear authority for the proposition that an expense incurred on one’s own house is private or domestic in nature, it is sometimes suggested that farmhouse expenses are fully deductible on the basis that a farmhouse is a “necessary adjunct” to a farming business. It is argued that the farmhouse is the “headquarters” for the farm and is needed on the farm to allow the farmer to be available at all hours of the day to see to stock and machinery and to afford a measure of security against theft and vandalism. Some support for this argument is found in the TRA decision in Case N35 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,308. 83. In Case N35, the taxpayer was involved in a horticultural venture with her husband. One of the issues in this case was whether the deductions claimed for interest payments on the mortgage on the property should be apportioned to exclude any private or domestic expenses. Keane DJ acknowledged that the land was not fully committed to the income-earning process and observed that the “predominant use” of the land was for business purposes. However, Keane DJ went on to accept the taxpayer’s contention that the home was a “necessary adjunct” to the business. Keane DJ then concluded that the land devoted to the home “does not warrant separate treatment”. Keane DJ’s decision that no adjustment was required appears to be based on the view that the private use of the land was of a “de minimis” nature. 84. However, the general proposition is that an expense must be apportioned between business and private purposes. The Commissioner considers that the decision in Case N35 should be confined to its facts and should not be relied on as authority for the proposition that a farmhouse is a necessary adjunct to the farming operation. The Commissioner considers that proposition is not sustainable and is inconsistent with the cases mentioned above, including the Court of Appeal decision in Haenga. 85. Therefore, an expense incurred on one’s own house, including a farmhouse, is inherently private in nature. But, that is not to say that parts of a farmhouse cannot be used for business purposes. Like the home office in Banks, to the extent that a farmhouse is used for business purposes, the expenses incurred on the farmhouse will have the requisite nexus with the derivation of income. In this situation, the expenses on the farmhouse would need to be apportioned between business and private use. No distinction between full-time and part-time farmers 86. In the past, the Commissioner has allowed certain deductions based on whether a farmer worked on the farm on a full-time or part-time basis. However, there is no distinction in the Act between full-time and part-time farmers. 87. Instead, a deduction for an expense is allowed to the extent to which the general permission is satisfied and the general limitations do not apply. Therefore, if the taxpayer can prove that the expense has the requisite nexus with the derivation of income, then that expense will be deductible. The fact that a farmer only works part time on their farm is not relevant. Farmhouse expenses may be deducted to the extent that they are used for the business 88. Parts of the farmhouse may be used for business purposes. In this situation, an expense relating to a farmhouse needs to be apportioned between business and Unclassified 16 private use. An example might be where a farmer uses a room in the farmhouse as an administrative base for the farming business. 89. The farmhouse could have a designated room used for the farming business (eg, a home office). Alternatively, different parts of the house may be used at different times for business purposes. For example, the kitchen may be used to provide lunch to farm workers each day, or the dining room may be used to do the farm accounts once a week. 90. In these situations, there will need to be apportionment between business and private use of the farmhouse (see above from \[61\]). Practical Approach 91. Where it is possible to dissect an expense into deductible and non-deductible amounts, that method should be used first (see \[62\] and \[66\] above). For example, a telephone bill might list toll calls made. Only expenses relating to toll calls made for business purposes will be deductible. Where dissection is impractical or impossible, the expense will need to be apportioned on some fair and reasonable basis between the business and private portions of the expense. Apportionment will be necessary when a farmer lives in the farmhouse and uses part of it for business purposes (see table at \[126\]). This will generally arise, for example, when sole traders and partners of partnerships live in the farmhouse. 92. In reviewing the old policies, the Commissioner’s main concern is to allow farmers to deduct farmhouse expenses that are business related, while ensuring that deductions are not claimed for expenditure that is private in nature. In undertaking this exercise, the Commissioner needs to balance the strict application of the law with the associated compliance costs of doing so, while maintaining equity between taxpayers and protecting the integrity of the tax system. Against this background, the likelihood of deductions being obtained for private expenditure is greatest in situations where:  the person incurring the farmhouse expenditure lives in the farmhouse; and  the value of the farmhouse represents a significant proportion of the overall value of the farm. 93. As a result, a practical approach to apportionment has been developed to mitigate compliance costs for farms with a low private-use element. The practical approach has regard to the law and the Commissioner’s powers under s 6 and 6A of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This new approach is based on a distinction between:  farming businesses where the value of the farmhouse (including curtilage and improvements) is 20% or less of the total value of the farm (Type 1 farms); and  farming businesses where the value of the farmhouse (including curtilage and improvements) is more than 20% of the total value of the farm (Type 2 farms). 94. The respective values of the farmhouse and farm may be used to determine whether the farm is a Type 1 or Type 2 farm. Generally, the value of the farm will include assets attached to the land such as farm buildings, orchards, kiwifruit vines, grape vines and shelterbelts. The valuation of the land does not normally include stock and crops. Nor does it include items of specialised plant not attached to the land. The value of the farm includes all blocks of land (even if they are on different titles) farmed together as part of the same farming enterprise. 95. The Commissioner will accept a reasonable estimate of the values of the farmhouse and farm. In some instances the rateable value will be a reasonable estimate of Unclassified 17 the value. However, the usefulness of rateable value depends on the circumstances. For instance, although the value of the land plus capital improvements in a rates notice may be a reasonable approximation of the farm’s value, the value of the farmhouse may not be as readily ascertainable. This will be the case where the rates assessment only provides a single figure for “improvements” and it is not possible to separate the value of the farmhouse from other improvements such as farm structures, vines, fencing and so on. 96. Alternatively, a bank’s valuation for lending purposes or an estate agent’s appraisal may also provide a reasonable estimate. However, in some cases a formal valuation will be appropriate, particularly in circumstances where a farm is close to the Type1/Type 2 threshold and they seek to be a Type 1 Farm. 97. As an alternative to value, the Commissioner will allow farmers to use the respective costs of the farm and farmhouse to reflect the relative values of the farm and farmhouse at a particular point in time. Allowing farmers to use cost is intended to reduce compliance costs by avoiding the need for a formal valuation. In order to be used in the threshold calculation, the relative costs need to be comparable and contemporaneous (eg, the cost of a farm in 1990 and the cost of a new farmhouse in 2010 are not comparable or contemporaneous). 98. The term “curtilage” refers to the land surrounding the farmhouse that is used primarily for private purposes. The curtilage may be fenced (like a backyard) or not. If the curtilage is not fenced, the Commissioner will accept a reasonable estimate of the curtilage and its value. The curtilage must be taken into account when determining the value of the farmhouse as a proportion of the overall value of the farm. This is because the curtilage is generally used for private purposes and is not used in the farming business. The extent of the curtilage, and its value, must be measured on a fair and reasonable basis. The Commissioner will accept a valuation, a reasonable estimate of the value of the curtilage, or an apportionment based on land area (ie, on a value/cost per hectare basis). Any apportionment needs to be calculated on a reasonable basis and recognise the land value of the curtilage will often be proportionately higher than the rest of the farm. 99. The Type 1/Type 2 threshold calculation generally only needs to be done once, unless circumstances change. Examples of where the calculation needs to be done again are where a Type 1 farmhouse is extended or has private-use improvements added or where a Type 2 farmer purchases an additional farming block that is farmed together (with the existing farm) as part of the same farming enterprise. The farmer only needs to do the calculation in order to show they are a Type 1 farmer or that they remain so after a change in circumstances. Generally, changes due to market fluctuations and changes that merely confirm the current position (ie, a Type 2 farmer builds an extension on their farmhouse) will not require a further calculation. 100. The next step is to apportion expenses between the business and private use of the farmhouse. For farmers operating Type 1 farms, the Commissioner will accept that 20% of the farmhouse is used for business purposes. However, Type 1 farmers are entitled to do an actual use calculation if they consider that the business use of the farmhouse is greater than 20%. The appropriate methods of apportionment are discussed at paragraph \[61\] onwards. 101. Farmers operating Type 1 farms may continue to claim a deduction of 100% for interest relating to the farmhouse. (This is the same as the treatment for interest for full-time farmers under the old policies.) This is a practical approach recognising the complexity of financing arrangements for larger enterprises, difficulties with tracing how funds are applied and the potential compliance costs involved. Unclassified 18 102. Farmers operating Type 1 farms can also continue to claim a deduction of 100% for rates. The Commissioner understands that the majority of charges for Type 1 farms relate to the farming business (eg, bio-security, flood protection, rural roading charges). Further, rates assessments often do not distinguish the farmhouse from other improvements; this requires apportionment across all improvements. Also the charges themselves are often a uniform annual general charge levied against land generally and it is not possible to identify business and domestic charges. Allowing a 100% deduction is a practical approach that recognises compliance costs for Type 1 farmers outweigh any tax advantage. 103. For farmers operating Type 2 farms, there is no minimum percentage of the farmhouse that the Commissioner will accept as being for business purposes. Farmers operating Type 2 farms may only claim deductions for expenses, including interest, relating to the actual business use of the farmhouse. 104. For expenses that relate to the farm and the farmhouse (that cannot be dissected), the Commissioner will accept an apportionment of these expenses based on the values of the farm and the farmhouse (including the curtilage and any improvements made to the farmhouse). 105. When apportioning expenses between the business and private use of the farmhouse, Type 2 farmers must undertake a “home office” calculation like any other taxpayer who carries on their business from home. This calculation must be based on the actual use of the farmhouse (for example, on a time and space basis), regardless of whether there is a dedicated home office or different parts of the house are used in the business. 106. The “home office” calculation will, in most cases, only need to be done once (unless the business use of the farmhouse changes). Once calculated, the “home office” percentage can be applied to all general farmhouse expenses that cannot be dissected. 107. Section 71 of the Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Act 2017 has inserted a new s DB 18AA in the Income Tax Act 2007. This provides another option for calculating business use of a building that is used partly for business purposes and partly for other purposes. This calculation is well suited to situations where there is a dedicated home office. 108. The old policies distinguished between full-time and part-time farmers. As noted above, the fact that a farmer works part time on the farm is not relevant to applying the general permission. Telephone rental and fixed line charges 109. This Interpretation Statement replaces and updates the old policy allowing farmers who operate their business from home a 100% deduction for home telephone rental. Farmers should follow the existing practice of other home based businesses. The starting point is that farmers may now claim 50% of their telephone rental charges. Farmers can still claim a higher deduction if they can show that the actual business use of the telephone is greater than 50%. There may be situations where farmers use a home telephone solely for business purposes and a 100% deduction is still justified. 110. If the farmhouse has two telephone lines, one charged at a domestic rate and the other at a commercial rate, 100% of the commercial rental is an allowable deduction. In this case, no part of the domestic rental is deductible. Summary 111. The following table summarises the practical approach outlined above. Unclassified 19 Farm type Interest and rates charges General farmhouse expenses Fixed line telephone charges Type 1 farms 100% deduction for rates and interest expenses relating to the farm, including the farmhouse. Dissection where possible, then 20% deduction unless the taxpayer can substantiate a higher deduction. 50% of telephone rental charges used for both business and private purposes, unless the taxpayer can show that 50% is too low. Type 2 farms Dissection where possible, then apportion between farm and farmhouse on a fair and reasonable basis. Deduct amounts attributable to actual business use of the farmhouse. 50% of telephone rental charges used for both business and private purposes, unless the taxpayer can show that 50% is too low. Employees and shareholder-employees 112. Sometimes an employee will live in a farmhouse and incur expenses on that farmhouse for the farm business. For example, an employee might use a room in the farmhouse as an office for farm business and pay for the farmhouse utilities (eg, power, telephone or water). 113. Even if an expense incurred by the employee satisfies the general permission, employees are prevented by the employment limitation from claiming any deductions for farmhouse expenses that they incur. However, an employer could reimburse an employee for expenses they incur in connection with their employment. An example might be the portion of a power bill that relates to a home office. Such reimbursement payments are exempt income to the employee when the requirements of s CW 17(2) are met (and are deductible to the employer – see \[55\] above). Shareholders, beneficiaries of trusts and other natural persons not involved in the farming business 114. A company or trustees of a trust may operate the farming business and own the farmhouse. In these situations, a shareholder of the company or a beneficiary of the trust (not being employees) may live in the farmhouse and incur expenses on that farmhouse. 115. The shareholder and the beneficiary are not involved in carrying on the business (ie, they are not employees). As a result, the expenses they incur on the farmhouse have no nexus with deriving income. Therefore, the shareholder and beneficiary cannot claim deductions for expenses they incur on the farmhouse. Farmhouse expenses incurred by a person not living in the farmhouse 116. Sometimes a person will incur farmhouse expenses, but may not live in that house. Such persons could include a sole trader, partner in a partnership, trustee or company. The person incurring the expenses might rent out the farmhouse, or they might provide the farmhouse as accommodation to another person (under a trust deed, as part of an employment agreement or for some other purpose). The person incurring the expenses might own the farm and lease it out, lease the farm and operate it, or own and operate the farm. An example might be where a sole trader, who owns and operates a farm, provides a second farmhouse as accommodation to their employees. 117. The following scenarios are considered in this part of the analysis: Unclassified 20  an employer incurs farmhouse expenses;  a lessor incurs farmhouse expenses;  a person incurs farmhouse expenses where they provide the farmhouse in other circumstances (eg, to a person who is neither an employee nor a lessee). Employer incurs farmhouse expenses 118. An employer can be any entity: sole trader, partnership, trustee or company. The employer may provide the farmhouse to one or more employees. An example might be where a partnership leases a farm from a company, carries on a farming business, and provides accommodation to an employee in a farmhouse. 119. Where the occupants of a farmhouse are employees, any farmhouse expenses incurred by the employer on that farmhouse will generally be deductible. This is because expenses incurred on employees are an ordinary incident of carrying on a business and will generally have the requisite nexus with deriving business income (unless the capital limitation applies). 120. It should be noted that where expenses incurred on employees relate to a private benefit enjoyed by those employees, other regimes in the Act may also apply. Some examples include the provisions on employee remuneration under s CE 1 (eg, expenditure on account or any other benefit in money, such as reimbursement of a non-business expense), s CE 1B (accommodation provided by employers), or fringe benefit tax under subpart CX. Lessor incurs farmhouse expenses 121. A farmhouse might be owned by a natural person in their personal capacity, in partnership with another, or as a trustee. A farmhouse might also be owned by a company. In some situations, the owner may rent out the farmhouse. When the owner rents out the farmhouse, the owner will derive rental income. An example might be where a company owns a farm and leases it to partners in a partnership that carry on the farming business and live in the farmhouse. 122. If an expense incurred by the owner on the farmhouse has the requisite nexus with the income-earning process of deriving rental income, then that expense will be deductible under the general permission. The owner will not have to apportion the expense for any private use. Farmhouse provided in other circumstances 123. A farmhouse might be provided to a person who is neither an employee nor a lessee. This situation will usually arise where the occupant is a relative, beneficiary, shareholder or associated person. An example might be where a trustee, who owns and operates a farm, allows beneficiaries (who are not employees or otherwise involved in the farming business) to reside in a farmhouse in accordance with the trust deed. For example, such beneficiaries might be the former owners of the farm, now retired. 124. For most entities, expenses incurred by the owner, where the occupant is not an employee or lessee, will not satisfy the general permission. This is because there is no income (because the occupant is not paying rent) and the provision of the farmhouse to such a person has no connection with the farming business. In this situation the expenses will not satisfy the nexus test in the general permission. 125. However, where a company allows a shareholder, or a person associated with a shareholder, to occupy the farmhouse because of the shareholding, a dividend Unclassified 21 arises under s CD 6. In this situation, the dividend is not deductible. However, the dividend will be assessable to the recipient. Summary 126. The following table summarises the deductibility of farmhouse expenses in a number of different situations. The table does not include reimbursement payments made by a farming entity to the occupiers of the farmhouse for purely business related expenditure. This will usually be deductible. Entity/structure Interest Other expenses Partnership or sole trader owns/leases and operates farm Sole trader or partner lives in the farmhouse Apportionment is required. Determine whether the farm is a Type 1 or Type 2 farm and use appropriate method (see table at \[111\]). For Type 1 100% deductible. Sole trader or partner lives in the farmhouse Apportionment is required. Determine whether the farm is a Type 1 or Type 2 farm and use appropriate method (see table at \[111\]). Farmhouse provided to employee 100% deductible. Farmhouse provided to employee 100% deductible. Farmhouse rented at market value 100% deductible. Farmhouse rented at market value 100% deductible. Farmhouse provided for no consideration to someone who is not an employee No expenses are deductible. Farmhouse provided for no consideration to someone who is not an employee No expenses are deductible. Company owns and operates farm 100% deductible where requirements of s DB 7 met. Farmhouse provided to employee 100% deductible. Farmhouse provided to shareholder (not an employee) Not deductible as a dividend. Farmhouse rented at market value 100% deductible. Farmhouse provided for no consideration to someone who is not a shareholder or employee No expenses are deductible. Trust owns and operates farm (trading trust) Farmhouse provided to employee 100% deductible. Farmhouse provided to employee 100% deductible. Farmhouse rented at market value 100% deductible. Farmhouse rented at market value 100% deductible. Farmhouse provided to beneficiary who is not an employee No expenses are deductible. Farmhouse provided to beneficiary who is not an employee No expenses are deductible. Sole trader, partnership, company or trust owns farm, and farmhouse is leased to another entity at market value 100% deductible for the lessor. 100% deductible for the lessor. Lessee (natural person carrying on the farming business) must apportion rent and other expenses. Determine whether the farm is a Type 1 or Type 2 farm and use appropriate method. Application date of this Interpretation Statement 127. This Interpretation Statement will apply from the start of a taxpayer’s 2017-18 income year. Unclassified 22 Examples 128. The following examples are included to assist in explaining the application of the apportionment principles and the practical approach outlined in this Interpretation Statement. Please note that the figures used in the examples illustrate the principles explained in this Interpretation Statement and do not take GST into account. Example 1 – establishing whether farm is Type 1 or Type 2 129. Hayden is a sole trader who owns and operates a dairy farm. Hayden purchased the farm in the 1980s for $490,000. Hayden also purchased a run off block in 2001 for $30,000. Hayden demolished and replaced the original farmhouse with a new build in late 2016 in which he and his family live. The new farmhouse cost $460,000. Hayden wants to know how to work out whether he is a Type 1 or Type 2 farmer. 130. The respective values of the farm and farmhouse should be used to work out whether the farm is a Type 1 or Type 2 farm. Hayden has the option of using cost but in this case the cost is unhelpful as he would be comparing the historic cost of the farm with the recent cost of the new build farmhouse. 131. The $460,000 cost of the new farmhouse can be used as an approximation of the current market value. The farm’s updated 2017 rates bill has the rateable value of the whole farm as $4,300,000. Hayden considers that is a reasonable approximation of the market value and decides to use this figure for the threshold calculation. Although the rates bill is for 2017, the two values are sufficiently contemporaneous to use in the threshold calculation. 132. The run off block is on a separate title. However, as it is farmed together as part of the same farming enterprise it can be taken into account when calculating the farm’s value. The 2017 rateable value for the run off block is $45,000. The value of the farmhouse is $460,000 and the rateable value of the farm (including run off block) is $4,345,000. The farmhouse is therefore 10.6% of the value of the farm. Even allowing for the value of the curtilage, Hayden is a Type 1 farmer. Example 2 – Type 1/Type 2 distinction 133. Gerri and Warren own and operate a small kiwifruit orchard in Te Puke. They purchased the farmhouse in 2005 for $275,000 along with a 2 hectare block of green kiwifruit vines for $280,000. They are Type 2 farmers. 134. In mid-2017, they decide to increase their farming operation. They purchase a nearby 2 hectare production block of gold kiwifruit vines and farm the two blocks together as part of the same farming enterprise. Gold kiwifruit vines are worth considerably more than green kiwifruit vines and they pay $1,400,000 for the 2 hectares. 135. Gerri and Warren want to do a further threshold calculation to see if they are now Type 1 farmers. They could use the cost of the farm and farmhouse as an estimate of their respective values, but given the passage of 12 years, fluctuations in the value of kiwifruit vines and the fact they are close to the threshold they prefer to use current values. Unfortunately for Gerri and Warren, the rates notice for the farm is no use in establishing the value of the farmhouse as it merely includes a single figure for “improvements” and they cannot work out how much relates to the farmhouse. 136. Gerri and Warren decide to get a formal valuation. The farmhouse (including the curtilage) is valued at $420,000 and the green kiwifruit block at $445,000. The recent purchase price of $1,400,000 for the 2 hectares of gold kiwifruit is a Unclassified 23 reasonable approximation of market value for that block. The value of the farmhouse is 18.7% of the total cost of the farm. They are Type 1 farmers. 137. Soon after the farm’s expansion the global price of green kiwifruit falls because of bumper crop production in Europe and China. Gerri and Warren decide to gradually replace the green kiwifruit vines with the gold variety. Any decline in value of the green kiwifruit vines (and the farm) because of the global glut is not a change in circumstances requiring a further calculation because the decline in value is temporary in nature. Nor is replacing the vines with the more lucrative gold kiwifruit vines a change in circumstances requiring a further calculation because it merely confirms that Gerri and Warren are Type 1 farmers. Example 3 – Deductions for Type 1 farms 138. Carolyn is a sole trader who owns and operates a dairy farm in Taranaki. Carolyn does not really know how much of the farmhouse is used for business purposes. Carolyn wants to know what proportion of the farmhouse expenses she can claim as a deduction. Type 1 or Type 2 farm? 139. First it is necessary to determine whether Carolyn operates a Type 1 or Type 2 farm. Carolyn has a modest house on a reasonable sized farm. In determining the values of the farm and farmhouse, Carolyn considers that the original cost of the farm should reasonably reflect the relative values. The cost of Carolyn’s farm was $2.5 million and the cost of the farmhouse (including the curtilage) was $235,000. The farmhouse therefore represents 9.4% of the value of the farm. Therefore, Carolyn operates a Type 1 farm. Farmhouse expenses 140. For expenses that relate to the farmhouse, based on the policy outlined in this Interpretation Statement, Carolyn can claim a deduction of 20% of expenses to reflect the use of the farmhouse for the farming business. She does not need to provide evidence of the business use of the farmhouse. For instance, the power bill is for electricity used by the farmhouse only. Therefore Carolyn can claim a deduction of 20% of the power bill. 141. For expenses that relate to the whole farm or are calculated with reference to the value of the farm and cannot be dissected (eg, an insurance policy that covers the entire farm), an area apportionment will often give an unrealistically low proportion relating to the farmhouse. One way of working out a realistic proportion is to calculate the value of the farmhouse as a proportion of the total value of the farm and add back any business use of the farmhouse. The value of the farmhouse is 9.4% of the total value of the farm. The business use of the farmhouse is treated as being 20%. Carolyn can therefore claim 20% of the 9.4% proportion of the amount that relates to the farmhouse. This is in addition to the amount that relates to the farm business. Interest and rates 142. Interest and rates are 100% deductible for Type 1 farmers. Example 4 – Type 1 farm where the business use of the farmhouse is more than 20% 143. Assume the same facts as Example 3 except Carolyn calculates that she uses more than 20% of the farmhouse for business purposes. Carolyn uses the kitchen, dining room, and laundry for farm business. Carolyn calculates, on a time and space basis, that 25% of the farmhouse is used for business purposes. Unclassified 24 144. For expenses relating only to the farmhouse (such as the power bill), the proportion of business use of the farmhouse is 25%. Carolyn can therefore claim a deduction of 25% of the power bill to reflect the actual use of the farmhouse for the farming business. 145. Carolyn still claims 100% of the interest and rates charges that relate to the farm business and farmhouse. Example 5 – Type 2 farm with a home office 146. Anahera owns and operates a small sheep and goat farm that produces speciality cheeses that are sold at the local farmers’ market. Anahera lives in the farmhouse and uses a room in the house as an office for the farm business. Anahera wants to know if she can claim any deductions for the mortgage interest she pays for her farm and farmhouse. 147. Anahera uses the cost of the whole farm and the cost of the farmhouse (including the curtilage) as a way of establishing their relative values. The purchase price of the farmhouse was $200,000. Shortly after the purchase Anahera also made improvements to the farmhouse that cost $100,000 in total. As a result, the total cost of the farmhouse is $300,000. The total cost of Anahera’s farm was $700,000 (this includes the improvements made to the farmhouse). The value of the farmhouse is therefore 42.9% of the total value of the farm. Anahera therefore operates a Type 2 farm and must determine the deductibility of any farmhouse expenses under the general rules. 148. The value of the farmhouse is 42.9% of the total value of the farm. Anahera calculates her home office as being 9% of the area of the farmhouse. Therefore, Anahera can claim 9% of 42.9% of the mortgage interest. This is in addition to the mortgage interest that relates to the farm business. 149. The Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Act 2017 has inserted a new s DB 18AA in the Income Tax Act 2007 which provides another option for calculating home office deductions. From the 2017-18 income year, Anahera could choose to use this method which provides a deduction for mortgage interest, rates and rent based on the proportion of floor area used primarily in the business. An allowance for other expenses is calculated on a per- square metre basis at a rate set by the Commissioner. Example 6 – Type 2 farm without a dedicated home office 150. Anaru owns and operates a small free-range chicken farm in partnership with his wife, Angela. Anaru and Angela live in the farmhouse. The recent cost of the farmland was $1.5 million of which the cost of the farmhouse was $330,000. The value of the farmhouse (including the curtilage) is 22% of the total value of the farm. The partnership therefore falls into the Type 2 farm category and must apportion any farmhouse expenses based on the actual use of the farmhouse. 151. The farmhouse does not have a home office. Instead, Anaru and Angela hold business meetings at the kitchen table and manage the farm accounts from the family computer in the dining room. In addition, Angela sometimes prepares lunches for business visitors in the farmhouse kitchen. Anaru is aware that the partnership can claim deductions for the business proportion of expenses relating to the farmhouse. Anaru wants to know what the partnership can take into account when calculating the business proportion of those expenses. In particular, Anaru wants to know how much of the telephone bill, mortgage interest and rates the partnership can claim as a deduction. 152. The partnership’s telephone bill lists the toll calls made each month. Anaru and Angela can only claim a deduction for the calls made for business purposes. For Unclassified 25 the fixed telephone charges, Anaru and Angela can claim 50% of the fixed telephone charges unless they can show that the actual business use of the telephone is greater than 50%. 153. The floor area of Anaru and Angela’s house is 150m 2 . Together, the dining room and kitchen make up 40m 2 in total, or 27% of the floor area of the farmhouse. Anaru calculates, on a fair and reasonable basis, that these rooms are used for the farm business for 20% of the time. This means that the business use of the farmhouse is 5.4%. 154. For the expenses that relate to the whole farm, including the farmhouse (ie, mortgage interest and rates), Anaru should also calculate the value of the farmhouse as a proportion of the total value of the farm and add back any business use of the farmhouse. 155. The value of the farmhouse is 22% of the total value of the farm. The farmhouse is used 5.4% for business purposes. Anaru can therefore claim 5.4% of 22% of the mortgage interest. This is in addition to 78% of the mortgage interest that relates to the farm business. The rates bill for the farmhouse includes charges for certain services that are charged per house. The starting point is that those service charges should be dissected and are not deductible because they relate to the private use of the farmhouse. Conversely, any service charges (such as bio- security) that relate to the business use of the farm should also be dissected and can be deducted. 156. Rates charges that relate to the whole farm or are calculated with reference to the value of the farm (ie, the general and fixed charges on the rates bill) can be calculated in the same way as mortgage interest. The value of the farmhouse is 22% of the total value of the farm. This means that 78% of the rates charges relating to the whole farm will be deductible. Additionally, the farmhouse is used 5.4% for business purposes. Anaru can therefore also claim 5.4% of 22% of the rates charges that relate to the whole farm. Example 7 – Farmer works part-time 157. Gus owns and operates a small alpaca farming business and also works in the city four days a week. Gus’ farm is a Type 2 farm. Gus wants to know if he can claim deductions on any expenses for the home office in his farmhouse. The home office is where Gus does all the administration for his farm. Gus also wants to know if he can claim deductions for expenses relating to the spa pool and leather lounge suite in the farmhouse as these are sometimes used when business associates visit the farm. 158. Gus can claim deductions for the expenses that relate to the home office. Gus could use a similar calculation as Anaru in Example 6 to determine the proportion of private and business use of the farmhouse and farm. The fact that Gus does not work full-time on the farm does not affect the deductibility of the expenses for the use of the farmhouse in the farming business. Alternatively, from the 2017-18 income year, Gus could use the method set out in s DB 18AA of the Act. 159. The spa pool and leather lounge suite are essentially private in nature and not used as part of the farming business. Therefore, Gus cannot claim any deductions for these items. Example 8 – Farm employees live in separate farmhouse 160. Reggie owns and operates a large deer farm and lives in the main farmhouse. Reggie’s farm also has another house situated on it. Three of Reggie’s employees live in that farmhouse. Reggie wants to know what expenses are deductible for the employee farmhouse. Unclassified 26 161. Provided that none of the general limitations apply, all of the expenses incurred by Reggie on the employee farmhouse on the farm are deductible. This is because expenses incurred on employees are an ordinary incident of carrying on a business. Such expenses satisfy the nexus test in the general permission. As noted at \[54\], the value of this accommodation provided by Reggie is income to his employees. In addition, to the extent that Reggie also provides fringe benefits to these employees so that a liability for fringe benefit tax arises, the FBT will also be deductible. Fringe benefits provided to employees are discussed at \[57\] and \[58\]. Example 9 – Farmer leases farm from family trust 162. Tane is a sole trader who operates a dairy farm in the Waikato. Tane runs the farm from an office in the farmhouse that is dedicated to the farming business. Tane leases the farm and the farmhouse from his family trust and is obliged under the rental agreement to pay rates, insurance and other farmhouse expenses. Tane wants to know if he can claim deductions for these expenses and the rent payments made to the family trust. 163. The total cost of Tane’s farm to the Trust was $5 million and the cost of the farmhouse (including curtilage) was $450,000. These costs reflect the relative values of the farm and farmhouse. The value of the farmhouse is therefore 9% of the total value of the farm. Tane therefore operates a Type 1 farm. 164. The principles outlined in this Interpretation Statement apply equally to this situation. The Trust can claim deductions for expenses in line with the table at \[126\]. Tane may claim deductions for his expenses to the extent that they have the requisite nexus with the farming business. Farmhouse expenses 165. Based on the policy outlined in this Interpretation Statement, Tane can claim a deduction of 20% of the farmhouse expenses (such as the power bill) to reflect the use of the farmhouse for the farming business. However, Tane can claim more if he can show that the business use of the farmhouse is greater than 20%. Farm/Farmhouse expenses 166. For expenses that relate to the whole farm (ie, rent payments and insurance premiums that cannot be dissected) or are calculated with reference to the value of the farm, an area apportionment will often give an unrealistically low proportion relating to the farmhouse. One way of working out a realistic proportion is to calculate the value of the farmhouse as a proportion of the total value the farm and add back any business use of the farmhouse. 167. The value of the farmhouse is 9% of the total value of the farm. The business use of the farmhouse is treated as being 20%. Tane can therefore claim 20% of the 9% of the rent payments and insurance premiums. This is in addition to the expenses that relate to the farm business. 168. As the farm is a Type 1 farm, Tane is also permitted to deduct 100% of the rates charges.

(FBT) applies to 1. motor vehicles. A motor vehicle fringe benefit arises when an employer makes a motor vehicle 2. available to an employee for their private use, in connection with the employment relationship. Whether an employer has made a vehicle available for an employee’s private use 3. depends on the actions of the employer. An employer makes a vehicle available for an employee’s private use by giving the employee access to the vehicle and permitting their private use of that vehicle. Once the employer has made the vehicle available for the employee’s private use, it is irrelevant whether the employee actually uses the vehicle for private use. A motor vehicle fringe benefit arises when the vehicle is made available for private use, not when it is actually used for private purposes. The two factors that determine the amount of FBT payable on a motor vehicle 4. fringe benefit are:  the rate of FBT; and  the value of the motor vehicle fringe benefit (less any employee contributions). The rate of FBT payable depends on the frequency with which an employer elects to 5. file an FBT return and the payment option chosen. This is discussed in more detail at \[170\]. The value of a motor vehicle fringe benefit is calculated by multiplying the value of 6. the vehicle by the number of actual days in the relevant period that an employer has made a motor vehicle available to an employee for their private use, less any exempt days. A motor vehicle’s value is calculated using either the cost price of the vehicle or the tax value of the vehicle. If an employee makes a payment towards the cost of the benefit by paying for some of the vehicle’s fuel for example, then the value of the benefit is reduced by this amount. A motor vehicle fringe benefit does not arise on a particular day if the vehicle is: 7.  a work-related vehicle at all times during the day;  used by an employee to make an emergency call; or  used by a qualifying employee for certain business travel exceeding 24 hours. To be a work-related vehicle on any day, a vehicle must: 8.  be a “motor vehicle” as defined in s YA 1;  display, prominently and permanently, on its exterior, the form of identification that the employer (or if the vehicle is hired, the owner of the vehicle) regularly uses in carrying on their undertaking or activity;  not be a “car” as defined in s YA 1; and  not be available for the employee’s private use, except for private use that: o is travel to and from their home that is necessary in and a condition of their employment; or o other travel that arises incidentally to the business use. A vehicle will not be a work-related vehicle if it is available for general private use 9. on that day, regardless of whether the vehicle is actually used on that day. The work-related vehicle exemption is discussed in more detail from \[66\]. 4 UNCLASSIFIED An emergency call is a visit made from an employee’s home for the purpose of 10. providing emergency or essential services. If the vehicle is used for an emergency call at any time on a day, then that whole day is exempt. The emergency call exemption is discussed in more detail from \[116\]. The business travel exemption applies when an employee is required, in the 11. performance of their duties, to be absent from home with a vehicle for at least 24 hours. The exemption will only apply if the employee is required, in the performance of their duties, to use a vehicle and regularly be absent from home. The business travel exemption is discussed in more detail from \[144\]. The last step is to apply the FBT rate to the value of the motor vehicle fringe 12. benefit. The result of this calculation is the amount of FBT payable for that motor vehicle fringe benefit. This is discussed from (\[250\]). Close companies who provide motor vehicle fringe benefits to shareholder-13. employees may elect to apply the motor vehicle expenditure rules in subpart DE rather than the FBT rules. This is discussed in more detail from \[278\]. Introduction This Interpretation Statement explains when a motor vehicle fringe benefit arises. 14. It also outlines the three exemptions from FBT for motor vehicles and sets out how to calculate FBT on a motor vehicle fringe benefit. The Interpretation Statement also seeks to address some common misconceptions 15. about FBT and motor vehicles. For example, FBT applies to a motor vehicle when that vehicle is made available for an employee’s private use not when the employee actually uses the vehicle privately. In addition, some taxpayers think that merely signwriting a vehicle means that any private use can be ignored. This is incorrect (see from \[66\]). Examples are included throughout this Interpretation Statement to illustrate some 16. of the concepts discussed. The examples are based on the same set of facts which are set out at \[ 18\]. One of the aims of this Interpretation Statement is to update and consolidate all 17. previous Inland Revenue statements on FBT and motor vehicles. As a result, this Interpretation Statement replaces five items previously published by the Commissioner:  Four questions and answers from “Fringe benefit tax – questions and answers”, Public Information Bulletin No 137 (July 1985): 4–5: o question and answer 8: emergency calls o question and answer 9: emergency calls o question and answer 12: private use of large trucks o question and answer 15: emergency calls.  “Fringe benefit tax – cars left at airports – 24 hour exemption”, Public Information Bulletin No 144 (March 1986): 2.  “Station wagons and FBT”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 2, No 8 (April 1991): 2.  “Shareholder-employees and FBT on company vehicles”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 4, No 8 (April 1993): 3.  “What is an ‘emergency call’ for FBT purposes?”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 6, No 9 (February 1995): 21. 5 UNCLASSIFIED This Interpretation Statement uses the following case study to illustrate when the 18. provision of a motor vehicle is subject to FBT. Crossed Wires Ltd – the shareholders and the nature of the company Chris Cross and his sister Veri Cross are equal shareholders and managing directors of Crossed Wires Ltd (CWL). They are also employees of CWL. CWL offers computer solutions to medium-sized businesses. CWL specialises in customising, implementing and maintaining a range of third-party software. The company also sells and installs hardware. Chris and Veri started CWL a few years ago. The company employs four staff. CWL has an office in a commercial area close to Wellington. Chris and Veri travel frequently for work to meet with investors, clients and to attend conferences. Crossed Wires Ltd – employees Chris Cross and his wife own a private vehicle, which Chris’s wife mainly uses. Therefore, Chris uses his company vehicle for private travel whenever he needs to. Veri Cross and her partner own a private vehicle and a motorcycle. Veri also has a company vehicle but she is restricted from using it privately and does not use it privately. Veri’s company vehicle is garaged at CWL’s premises. Teuila is the sales executive. She travels extensively in her role, visiting clients and prospective clients and attending conferences and meetings. She does some work from home. Teuila needs to use a vehicle to undertake many of her employment duties. Garry is the installation specialist. He is responsible for all hardware installation and maintenance and assists with software issues. Most of his work is done on-site at clients’ premises. He needs a vehicle to undertake most of his employment duties. Spencer is a programmer. Spencer sometimes needs to visit clients’ premises to resolve issues. He will usually travel with Garry, but occasionally he needs to use a work vehicle on his own. Trevor is the office administrator and receptionist. Occasionally, Trevor needs to use a vehicle to get office supplies and run office errands. 6 UNCLASSIFIED Fringe benefit tax and motor vehicles Sections CX 2 and CX 6 determine when a motor vehicle is subject to FBT. 19. Section CX 2 defines “fringe benefit”, and s CX 6 explains when a motor vehicle fringe benefit arises. A fringe benefit is a benefit provided to an employee in connection with their employment Section CX 2(1) defines “fringe benefit”: 20. CX 2 Meaning of fringe benefit Meaning (1) A fringe benefit is a benefit that— (a) is provided by an employer to an employee in connection with their employment; and (b) either— (i) arises in a way described in any of sections CX 6, CX 9, CX 10, or CX 12 to CX 16; or (ii) is an unclassified benefit; and Crossed Wires Ltd – motor vehicles Two luxury vehicles for directors’ business use It is important to the directors that CWL is seen as successful. Therefore, CWL purchased two luxury vehicles for the directors’ business use. Chris and Veri held a board meeting before CWL purchased the vehicles. They agreed the reasons for the purchase and the intended use of the vehicles. They decided Veri’s vehicle should be used only for business purposes while Chris could use his vehicle for business purposes and personal travel. Chris and Veri recorded their decisions in the minutes of the meeting and drafted an agreement setting out how the shareholder-employees could use the company vehicles. Two sedans for staff business use CWL also had two sedans that were kept at the CWL premises for staff to use on business. The secure gated area behind the premises had room for only two vehicles (one sedan and Veri’s company vehicle), so the other sedan was parked in front of the premises. The sedan that was parked in front of CWL’s premises was recently stolen, and CWL received an insurance pay-out. However, the insurance company has now advised that it will not insure any vehicle left overnight in a commercial area, unless the vehicle is behind a locked gate. Both sedans had been in constant use. Teuila needed a vehicle to visit clients and Garry needed a vehicle for his installation work. From time to time, other staff also needed a vehicle, so would borrow Chris or Veri’s vehicles. Since the theft of the sedan, this use has occurred more frequently. CWL is now investigating the purchase of a new vehicle. 7 UNCLASSIFIED (c) is not a benefit excluded from being a fringe benefit by any provision of this subpart. For motor vehicles, there is a fringe benefit when: 21.  there is a benefit;  the benefit is provided by an employer to an employee;  the provision of the benefit is in connection with employment; and  s CX 6 is satisfied (s CX 6, referred to in s CX 2(b)(i), is the only section relevant for motor vehicle fringe benefits). Meanings of “benefit” and “provided” The meanings of “benefit” and “provided” were considered in the Question We’ve 22. Been Asked “QB 12/06: Fringe benefit tax – ‘availability’ benefits”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 24, No 4 (May 2012): 32 (QB 12/06). The Commissioner considers this analysis is still correct. Based on dictionary definitions and the decision in Case M9 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,069, 23. QB 12/06 defines “benefit” to mean (at 33): a particular “advantage” must be sufficiently clear and definite that it can reasonably, practically and sensibly be understood as a tangible benefit. And QB 12/06 defines “provided” to mean (at 34): 24. supplied, furnished or made available for use by the employee. Therefore, when an employer supplies, furnishes or makes a vehicle available to an 25. employee for private use, the employer has “provided” a “benefit” to the employee. In addition, if a person provides a benefit to an employee under an arrangement 26. with the employer, then s CX 2(2) deems the benefit to have been provided “by the employer”. Meaning of “in connection with employment” To be a fringe benefit, the benefit must be provided “in connection with” the 27. employment relationship. The meaning of “in connection with employment” was considered in the Question 28. We’ve Been Asked “The meaning of ‘benefit’ for FBT purposes”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 18, No 2 (March 2006): 26. The Commissioner concluded that a benefit is provided “in connection with” the employment relationship if the employment relationship is the reason for, or at least a substantial reason for, the provision of the benefit (at 27): In Smith v FCT 87 ATC 4883 it was held that a benefit was “in respect of, or for or in relation to” the employment where there was a connection between the benefit received and the employment. It was considered that in determining whether there was a connection between the benefit and the employment relationship it was appropriate to consider the reason for the provision of the benefit. Where the employment is a substantial reason for the provision of the benefit, there would be a relationship between the benefit and the employment. The phrase “in connection with” also requires a relationship between two things: Claremont Petroleum NL v Cummings (1992) 110 ALR 239; Strachan v Marriott \[1995\] 3 NZLR 272. The Commissioner considers that a benefit is provided “in connection with” the employment relationship if the employment relationship is the reason for, or at least a substantial reason for, the provision of the benefit. In most situations, when an employer provides a vehicle to a non-shareholder-29. employee, the required employment connection will be present. When a company 8 UNCLASSIFIED provides a vehicle to a shareholder-employee, it is deemed to be in connection with employment under s CX 17. A fringe benefit arises where a vehicle is made available to an employee for their private use Section CX 6(1) explains when a motor vehicle fringe benefit arises: 30. CX 6 Private use of motor vehicle When fringe benefit arises (1) A fringe benefit arises when— (a) a motor vehicle is made available to an employee for their private use; and (b) the person who makes the vehicle available to the employee— (i) owns the vehicle: (ii) leases or rents the vehicle: (iii) has a right to use the vehicle under an agreement or arrangement with the employee or a person associated with the employee. Section CX 6(1)(a) explains that for motor vehicles, the fringe benefit arises when 31. the vehicle is “made available” to an employee for their “private use”. The person who makes the vehicle available to the employee does not have to be 32. the employer. Under s CX 6(1)(b) the person can be someone who owns, leases, rents or has a right to use a vehicle (under an agreement or arrangement with the employee or a person associated with the employee). For ease of reference, we refer to the person who makes the vehicle available to the employee as the “proprietor” of a vehicle. Meaning of “made available” to an employee Before 2004, the definition of “fringe benefit” referred to the “availability” of a 33. vehicle, rather than to a vehicle being “made available”. While the courts have not considered the meaning of the words “made available” in s CX 6, the Commissioner considers that case law on the meaning of “availability” in the predecessor section to s CX 6 is relevant to the meaning of “made available” under s CX 6. The High Court and the Taxation Review Authority (TRA) consider that “availability” 34. means “capable of being turned to account, hence at one’s disposal, within one’s reach” (CIR v Yes Accounting (1999) 19 NZTC 15,296 (HC) and Case L86 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,492). Under s CX 6, a vehicle has to be “made available” to the employee by the 35. proprietor. This implies that the proprietor has taken some action to place the vehicle at the employee’s disposal. Therefore, whether a vehicle is “made available” must be determined according to the actions of the vehicle’s proprietor. This view is consistent with the relevant case law, which states that whether a 36. vehicle is “made available” cannot be determined by whether an employee could potentially access the vehicle. The case law confirms that to make a vehicle available, the proprietor’s actions must include:  granting permission for the employee to use the vehicle (Yes Accounting); and  ensuring the employee has practical and unconditional physical access to the vehicle (Case L86). 9 UNCLASSIFIED Case L86 suggests that a vehicle is not “made available” until the proprietor has 37. supplied practical and unconditional access to the vehicle. Even if an employer gives written permission to an employee to use a vehicle, the vehicle will not have been made available for use if the proprietor must take further steps before the employee can gain access to the vehicle. Where an employee has practical and unconditional access to a motor vehicle, there 38. is a presumption that the vehicle has been made available on a daily basis (see Case R37 (1994) 16 NZTC 6,208 and Case P26 (1992) 14 NZTC 4,196). However, in Yes Accounting, Anderson J confirmed that a vehicle cannot be available to an employee unless the employee has permission to use the vehicle (at 15,299): I find compelling ... that the word “so” in subcl (b) invests “availability” with connotations of permission by the proprietor of the motor vehicle. If this were not so an employer would be liable for fringe benefit tax because an employee could physically gain access to a vehicle and unlawfully convert it if the employee were so minded. Then fringe benefit tax would be payable by a motor vehicle renting company because the receptionist could physically gain access to a vehicle and take it for a joyride whenever such receptionist wished, notwithstanding an express prohibition against such conduct by the employer. That a person could be liable for fringe benefit tax because the circumstances would not prevent the tortious or criminal conversion of a motor vehicle by a dishonest employee is untenable. In summary, whether a vehicle has been “made available” depends on the actions 39. of the vehicle’s proprietor. Relevant case law supports the view that a vehicle is “made available” for use, within the meaning of s CX 6, when its proprietor supplies an employee with access to the vehicle and permits the employee to use the vehicle. The two-fold test for “made available” (access and permission) will be met when an 40. employee has permission to use the vehicle and takes possession of it. If an employee has possession of the vehicle but does not have permission to use that vehicle, then the vehicle has not been “made available” to that employee until they obtain permission. If an employee has permission to use the vehicle but has not taken possession of it, then the vehicle is “made available” when the proprietor has taken all steps necessary to enable the employee to take possession. A proprietor does not make a vehicle available to an employee when: 41.  the vehicle is in use by another person;  the proprietor has not supplied the means of operating the vehicle (for example, the vehicle’s keys);  the proprietor has not enabled physical access to the vehicle (for example, the vehicle is stored at a location inaccessible to the employee);  the employee is not permitted to operate the vehicle. 10 UNCLASSIFIED Has a vehicle been “made available” to the employee for their private use? Chris has permission to use his company vehicle for private purposes whenever he needs to. CWL therefore provides a motor vehicle fringe benefit to Chris. As Chris is a shareholder-employee, s CX 17 treats the benefit as provided in connection with Chris’s employment. CWL makes the vehicle available to Chris because he has physical access to the vehicle and is allowed to use the vehicle whenever he wants. Last month, Spencer asked for the keys to the office so he could come in on weekends to finish off some work. Chris and Veri agreed. One Sunday, Veri visited the office and noticed that although Spencer’s scooter was out front, he was nowhere to be seen and the office sedan was missing. When confronted, Spencer admitted he had been taking the key off the hook in reception and borrowing the vehicle in the weekends as it was difficult to do grocery shopping on his scooter. CWL followed its formal disciplinary process and issued Spencer with a written warning for taking the sedan without permission. Chris and Veri also took the opportunity to remind all staff that their employment agreements prohibited unauthorised use of company vehicles. Chris also moved the spare key from a hook in reception to a locked drawer that is unlocked only when Trevor or the directors are in the office. Question 1: Is Spencer’s use of the vehicle relevant for FBT purposes? Answer 1: No. CWL did not make the sedan available for Spencer’s private use. CWL did not take any steps to provide him with the vehicle, nor did CWL permit Spencer to use the vehicle. The directors were unaware of his actions and when they discovered what had happened they took steps to ensure the use did not continue. Question 2: What if Veri was the one borrowing the sedan on weekends, would her use of the vehicle be relevant for FBT purposes? Answer 2: It would be difficult to argue that CWL did not make the vehicle available for Veri’s use. Although Veri is a separate legal person to CWL, if she were to use the vehicle privately in the weekends, it could be inferred that she had permitted private use of a company vehicle in her capacity as director. Question 3: Chris decides to take his family to Fiji for a holiday. Chris drives to the airport and leaves his company vehicle in the long-term stay parking area. Does CWL need to pay FBT on Chris’s vehicle for the week he is in Fiji? Answer 3: Yes. Whether a vehicle has been “made available” for private use depends on the actions of the vehicle’s proprietor, not the actions of the employee. CWL has made the vehicle available to Chris for his private use. CWL has given Chris access to the vehicle and permission to use it. Chris’s own actions have resulted in him being unable to access the vehicle while he is in Fiji. However, this does not change the fact that CWL has made the vehicle available to him for private use during this week. 11 UNCLASSIFIED Meaning of “private use” If a motor vehicle has been “made available” to an employee, the next step is to 42. determine whether the vehicle was made available “for \[the employee’s\] private use”. This question is important in cases where restrictions are placed on the use of a vehicle. If a vehicle is made available on an unconditional basis, then it follows that the vehicle is available for any potential use, including “private use”. Section CX 36 defines “private use” for a motor vehicle: 43. CX 36 Meaning of private use Private use, for a motor vehicle, includes— (a) the employee’s use of the vehicle for travel between home and work; and (b) any other travel that confers a private benefit on the employee. Therefore, “private use” of a motor vehicle includes: 44.  travel between home and work; and  any other travel conferring a private benefit on the employee. The test is whether the vehicle has been made available for private use, not 45. whether the vehicle has actually been used privately. Question 4: Would the position be different if Chris left the vehicle at his house and caught a taxi to the airport? Answer 4: No. The same principles apply. CWL has made the vehicle available to Chris for his private use. Whether Chris leaves the vehicle at home or at the airport makes no difference. Question 5: This year the annual IT Industry Conference is being held in Sydney. CWL decides to send Chris and Veri to the conference. Chris drives them both to the airport and parks his car there. They leave on Tuesday, the day before the conference. They attend the conference on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, before departing late Friday night and returning to Wellington early Saturday morning. Does CWL need to account for FBT on Chris’s vehicle while he is in Sydney? Answer 5: CWL has required Chris to attend the business-related conference. This means that CWL has withdrawn Chris’s access to the vehicle for the three full days that Chris and Veri are in Sydney. CWL will still need to account for FBT on Tuesday (the day of departure) and on Saturday (the day Chris and Veri arrive back in Wellington). This is because Chris still has access and permission to use the vehicle on Tuesday and Saturday (he is not subject to a private use restriction). Therefore, only the three intervening days (Wednesday, Thursday and Friday) are exempt from FBT. Question 6: Chris’s vehicle has been in an accident. CWL arranges for the vehicle to be repaired. The vehicle is in the garage for two weeks. Does CWL need to pay FBT for those two weeks? Answer 6: No. While the vehicle is in the garage, the vehicle will be exempt from FBT. This is because CWL has not made the vehicle available to Chris for his private use. In this situation, CWL has removed Chris’s access to the vehicle. 12 UNCLASSIFIED Travel between home and work The Commissioner’s view of when travel between home and work is for “private 46. use” is set out in the Interpretation Statement IS3448 “Travel by motor vehicle between home and work – deductibility of expenditure and FBT implications”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 16, No 10 (November 2004): 31 (IS3448). The following paragraphs summarise that analysis. IS3448 considered the High Court decision in CIR v Schick (1998) 18 NZTC 13,738 47. (HC). Schick is the leading case on travel between home and work. In Schick, vehicles had been made available to employees of an earthmoving and transport business for travel between their homes and various job sites. The vehicles were stored at the employee’s homes when not in use. Gallen J held that the travel in Schick was not private use of the vehicles. The Commissioner had argued that there was a fringe benefit because the 48. employees used the vehicles to travel to and from their homes. However, Gallen J held that the first part of the definition (now at s CX 36(a)) was qualified by the second part of the definition (now at s CX 36(b)). His Honour stated (at 13,743): ...I agree with the Judge \[Judge Willy in the TRA – Case T5 (1997) 18 NZTC 8,024\] that the word “travel” where used in the definition of private use or enjoyment, is to be regarded as qualified by that qualification which appears in the second part of the definition and means travel which confers a benefit of a private or domestic nature. The court explained that travel between home and work is not “private use” of a 49. vehicle merely because the travel starts or ends at the employee’s home. “Private use” arises when travel between home and work confers a private benefit. Gallen J then considered the meaning of “home”. His Honour approved Judge 50. Willy’s view in the TRA (see Case T5 (1997) 18 NZTC 8,024) that a place would not be a “home” for FBT purposes if the home were also a workplace. In upholding the TRA decision that there was no private use, Gallen J concluded (at 13,745): I consider therefore it was open to the Authority to conclude on the facts before him, that there was in fact no benefit to the employees in this case and that the definition of “private use or enjoyment” was not sufficient to categorise the activities as taxable, either because that definition itself required a degree of benefit as far as the employee was concerned, or because the term “home” where used in that particular definition was not apt to include a starting point or destination which was for the reasons discussed, reasonably to be categorised as a workplace even if it also had the characteristics of a home. In summary, the main principles from Schick on the meaning of “private use” are: 51.  “private use” imports a distinction between work-related use and private use of a vehicle;  the first limb of the definition of “private use” is qualified by the second and does not refer to all travel between home and work;  “private use” includes only travel between home and work that confers a private benefit on an employee;  where a home is also a workplace and an employee is required for sound business reasons to travel to perform employment duties partly at the home workplace and partly at another workplace, then the FBT rules do not recognise any private benefit conferred by that travel. In most cases, travel between home and work will be “private use” of the vehicle. 52. However, travel between home and work will not be “private use” if the travel does not confer a private benefit on the employee. There will be no private benefit (and therefore no private use) where: 13 UNCLASSIFIED  sound business reasons arise from the nature of the work for the work to be performed partly at home (and therefore the need for the travel); and  the travel between home and work is “on work” (that is, there are work- related reasons for the travel and any private benefit received is incidental or minor). The test in the first bullet point at \[52\] above will not be satisfied if the reason the 53. employee is performing work partly at home is due to the personal preferences or choices of that employee. For example, if Teuila wanted to take some marketing work home in the evening to work on, her travel from work to home in a work vehicle would be private use of the vehicle. The need for the travel must arise from the nature of the work and not from the personal choice or circumstances of the employee. Vehicle taken home for storage IS3448 also explains that the fact a vehicle is taken to an employee’s home for 54. security reasons would not in itself make the journey work-related as a private benefit is still conferred. The Commissioner’s position is summarised in the following paragraphs from IS3448 at (49): Vehicle taken to home for security reasons The Commissioner considers that the fact that a vehicle is taken to an employee's home for security reasons would not in itself make the journey work-related travel (although this factor may be taken into account in conjunction with other factors). While the employer would receive a benefit from a car being taken home by an employee for security reasons, the employee would also receive a benefit from the use of the vehicle for travel to and from the home which is more than incidental to the benefit to the employer. Such travel would not be undertaken in the course of performing employment duties. Rather the travel would be undertaken in order to travel from home to work or from work to home. In Schick, it was acknowledged that the storage of the vehicle at home should not be given too much weight given that the issue being considered was whether the travel between home and work was private travel. Although in Case Q25 the TRA appeared to give some weight to the evidence that the vehicle was taken home because it was unsafe to leave it at the factory, other factors were present in the case which led to the conclusion that travel between home and work was work-related travel. Other travel that confers a private benefit Under s CX 36(b), “private use” of a vehicle includes other travel that confers a 55. private benefit on an employee (other than travel between home and work). Travel that is not work-related will be private use, while travel that achieves a work- related objective will not be private use. The distinction may not be as clear when travel achieves both a work-related 56. objective and a private objective. Although, ultimately, a question of fact in each case, for travel to confer a private benefit, the travel must achieve some non-work objective that confers a tangible benefit on the employee. Any incidental or minor benefits conferred by work-related travel (or from minor deviations to work-related travel) are not caught by s CX 36(b). In summary, if an employee receives a tangible benefit from travel, then the travel 57. will be “private use” of a vehicle unless:  the benefit is incidental to the work-related travel; or  the benefit arises from a minor deviation from the route required by the work- related travel. 14 UNCLASSIFIED Meaning of “motor vehicle” “Motor vehicle” is defined in s YA 1, for the purposes of the FBT rules: 58. Motor vehicle,— ... (b) in the FBT rules, and in the definition of car,— (i) is defined in section 2(1) of the Land Transport Act 1998; and (ii) does not include a vehicle the gross laden weight of which is more than 3,500 kilograms. Section 2(1) of the Land Transport Act 1998 defines motor vehicle: 59. motor vehicle— (a) means a vehicle drawn or propelled by mechanical power; and (b) includes a trailer; but (c) does not include— (i) a vehicle running on rails; or (ii) \[Repealed\] (iii) a trailer (other than a trailer designed solely for the carriage of goods) that is designed and used exclusively as part of the armament of the New Zealand Defence Force; or (iv) a trailer running on 1 wheel and designed exclusively as a speed measuring device or for testing the wear of vehicle tyres; or Travel that confers a private benefit Chris takes a week’s holiday, leaving Garry on call for the week. So he can respond quickly to any client calls, Garry is permitted to take the office sedan home. Garry’s employment contract prohibits private use of work vehicles. Garry receives two after- hours calls and travels from home to the client sites using the work vehicle. Garry used the vehicle to travel between home and work, but that travel did not confer any private benefit on Garry. The vehicle is therefore not treated as being available for private use during this period. Trevor needs to use the office sedan to pick up office supplies. Trevor knows he is not allowed to use the work vehicle for private use. However, he asks Veri if he can stop on the way and have lunch at his favourite café and pick up his dry-cleaning. Both the café and the dry-cleaners are in the same block of shops as the office supplies store. Veri emphasises to Trevor that the sedan is not available to him for private use. However, she notes that in this instance, Trevor’s journey to the café and drycleaners arises incidentally to the work-related use. Trevor’s travel confers a private benefit because he is able to get lunch and pick up his dry-cleaning. However, the benefit is an incidental one so the vehicle is not treated as available for private use under s CX 36(b). 15 UNCLASSIFIED (v) a vehicle designed for amusement purposes and used exclusively within a place of recreation, amusement, or entertainment to which the public does not have access with motor vehicles; or (vi) a pedestrian-controlled machine; or (vii) a vehicle that the Agency has declared under section 168A is not a motor vehicle; or (viii) a mobility device Therefore, a “motor vehicle” is a vehicle drawn or propelled by mechanical power, 60. including a trailer, and does not include vehicles with a gross laden weight of more than 3,500kg. Vehicles with a gross laden weight in excess of 3,500kg are likely to include larger trucks, buses and mobile homes. While a vehicle with a gross laden weight in excess of 3,500kg does not qualify as a 61. motor vehicle and will therefore not be subject to the rules for motor vehicle fringe benefits, in certain circumstances the provision of a heavy vehicle for private use could result in an unclassified benefit. If the heavy vehicle is designed principally for the carriage of goods, then under 62. s CX 19B no fringe benefit will arise where that vehicle is used to transport employees. An unclassified benefit could still arise if that vehicle is used for other purposes, such as the transportation of goods for private purposes (for example, if the employee uses the vehicle to transport some firewood for private use). If the heavy vehicle is designed principally for the carriage of passengers, then by 63. implication, any use of that vehicle would be subject to FBT as an unclassified benefit (s CX 37) (for example, if an employee is provided with a minibus so they can transport other employees to a remote work site or if the employee uses the minibus to transport firewood for private use). Three exemptions from fringe benefit tax for motor vehicles A fringe benefit arises when an employer makes a vehicle available to an employee 64. for their private use (s CX 6(1)). Section CX 6(1) is subject to three exemptions (also known as exclusions) in s CX 6(2) to (4): Exclusion: work-related vehicles (2) Subsection (1) does not apply when the vehicle is a work-related vehicle. Exclusion: emergency calls (3) Subsection (1) does not apply when the vehicle is used for an emergency call. Exclusion: absences from home (4) Subsection (1) does not apply when the employee is absent from home, with the vehicle, for a period of at least 24 hours continuously, if the employee is required, in the performance of their duties, to use a vehicle and regularly to be absent from home. The three exemptions are discussed in more detail in the next sections. 65. Work-related vehicle exemption The work-related vehicle exemption is an exemption based on classification. If a 66. vehicle is classified as a “work-related vehicle” for any day and provided to an employee, then an FBT liability will not arise on that day. 16 UNCLASSIFIED Meaning of “work-related vehicle” Section CX 38 defines “work-related vehicle” for the purposes of the FBT rules: 67. CX 38 Meaning of work-related vehicle Meaning (1) Work-related vehicle, for an employer, means a motor vehicle that prominently and permanently displays on its exterior,— (a) if the employer owns the vehicle, the form of identification that the employer regularly uses in carrying on their undertaking or activity; or (b) if the employer rents the vehicle, the form of identification— (i) that the employer regularly uses in carrying on their undertaking or activity; or (ii) that the person from whom it is rented regularly uses in carrying on their undertaking or activity. Exclusion: car (2) Subsection (1) does not apply to a car. Exclusion: private use (3) A motor vehicle is not a work-related vehicle on any day on which the vehicle is available for the employee’s private use, except for private use that is— (a) travel to and from their home that is necessary in, and a condition of, their employment; or (b) other travel in the course of their employment during which the travel arises incidentally to the business use. Therefore, to be a work-related vehicle, the vehicle must: 68.  be a “motor vehicle”, as defined in s YA 1;  display, prominently and permanently, on its exterior, the form of identification that the employer (or if the vehicle is hired, the owner of the vehicle) regularly uses in carrying on their undertaking or activity;  not be a “car”, as defined in s YA 1; and  not be available for the employee’s private use, except for private use that: o is travel to and from their home that is necessary in and a condition of their employment; or Work-related vehicles Garry (the installation specialist) needs a vehicle to transport hardware, tools and spare parts to client sites. Since the theft of one of CWL’s sedans, Chris and Veri have decided that CWL should purchase a vehicle for Garry to use. They are trying to decide whether to purchase a four-wheel drive vehicle, a station wagon or a double-cab ute. While wandering through a car yard Chris and Veri get talking to the salesperson, Jan, who suggests they consider classifying their new vehicle as a work-related vehicle for FBT purposes. Jan explains that if the vehicle is a work-related vehicle, then some private use would be permitted without attracting FBT. Chris and Veri decide to find out more about work-related vehicles. 17 UNCLASSIFIED o other travel that arises incidentally to the business use. Each of these conditions is considered separately below. 69. A work-related vehicle must be a motor vehicle A work-related vehicle must be a “motor vehicle”. As previously discussed from 70. \[58\], a “motor vehicle” is a vehicle drawn or propelled by mechanical power, including a trailer, which does not have a gross laden weight of more than 3,500kg. A work-related vehicle must display identification prominently and permanently If the employer owns the vehicle, the vehicle must prominently and permanently 71. display, on its exterior, the form of identification that the employer regularly uses in carrying on their undertaking or activity. If the employer rents the vehicle, the vehicle must prominently and permanently 72. display on its exterior the form of identification that the:  employer regularly uses in carrying on their undertaking or activity; or,  person from whom it is rented regularly uses in carrying on their undertaking or activity. Form of identification The definition of “work-related vehicle” in the Income Tax Act 1994 referred to “the 73. name, logo, acronym or other similar identification of the employer” (or owner), regularly used by the employer or owner in carrying on the employer’s activity or undertaking. The changes made to the “work-related vehicle” definition as part of the rewrite of the Act were not identified as intended policy changes in sch 22A of the Income Tax Act 2004. Therefore, it must be assumed that “form of identification” was intended to include a name, a logo, an acronym or other similar identification. The form of identification must be the identification regularly used by the employer 74. or owner in carrying on their business. It must identify the business or undertaking. It would not be sufficient to simply use the surname of a director or shareholder, if that surname were not the form of identification that the employer regularly uses in carrying on their business. Prominently and permanently displayed on the exterior of the vehicle The form of identification must be prominently and permanently displayed on the 75. exterior of the vehicle. This will be a question of fact in each case. The legislation does not provide a definition of “prominent”, “permanent” or 76. “display”. However, the Concise Oxford English Dictionary (12th ed, Oxford University Press, New York, 2011), defines those words as follows: display  v. 1 place (something) prominently so that it may readily be seen. permanent  adj. lasting or remaining unchanged indefinitely, or intended to be so; not temporary. Vehicle choices Chris and Veri are considering purchasing a four-wheel drive vehicle, a station wagon or a double-cab ute. These vehicles meet the definition of “motor vehicle” so would satisfy the first work-related vehicle condition. 18 UNCLASSIFIED prominent  adj. 1 important or famous. 2 projecting; protuberant. 3 particularly noticeable. The ordinary meaning of these words suggests that the form of identification must 77. be readily seen and particularly noticeable. The identification must be attached to the exterior of the vehicle in a lasting and not temporary way. The leading case on this requirement is Case J50 (1987) 9 NZTC 1,281. In this 78. case, the taxpayer operated a fleet of chauffeur-driven limousines. The limousines were available for public hire. The taxpayer displayed his business card on the inside of the windscreen of each vehicle. In addition, a Ministry of Transport vehicle authority sticker was permanently attached to the exterior of the windscreen, showing the name of the business. A loading authority (containing the business name) was stapled to the upholstery of the interior of all the limousines. The taxpayer explained that the business cards were not permanently affixed to the 79. car for reasons of discretion. Customers would hire the vehicles to impress their business associates and would want those associates to believe that the vehicle belonged to them and not the taxpayer. Judge Barber held that the limousines were not work-related vehicles, nor were 80. they cars. Instead, the limousines satisfied the definition of “taxicab”. Judge Barber found that the notices, whether considered individually or collectively, had not been prominently or permanently displayed on the exterior of the vehicles. Judge Barber stated that the name of the business had been displayed with much discretion and in a low-key manner (at 1,282): I find the evidence to be quite clear that the objector’s displays of identification on (or in) his said limousines are most certainly not “prominent”. They are discreet. Judge Barber accepted the taxpayer’s submission that relevant identification did not 81. need to be “emblazoned” over the motor vehicles in question. He concluded that a balance was needed between the requirements of the legislation and the discreet service required by the taxpayer’s customers. Judge Barber also concluded that only the vehicle authority (which was attached to 82. the exterior of the windscreen of the motor vehicle) could be regarded as “permanently affixed” to the vehicle. However, the fact it was not prominently displayed meant the taxpayer’s case still failed (at 1,285): ...only the sticker on the windscreen could be regarded as “permanently affixed to the exterior ...” (even though it used to “drop off”) in terms of the definition of “work related vehicle”. (As mentioned above, it has since been stuck to the inside of the windscreen.) The loading certificate is merely stapled to part of the upholstery of the interior of the limousine, and the business card merely rests against the inside of the front windscreen. Accordingly, I find it to be quite clear from the evidence that the limousines are not work-related vehicles. 19 UNCLASSIFIED A work-related vehicle must not be a “car” A work-related vehicle must not be a “car”, as defined in s YA 1: 83. Car,— ... (b) in the FBT rules, and in the definition of work-related vehicle,— (i) means a motor vehicle designed exclusively or mainly to carry people: (ii) includes such a motor vehicle that has rear doors or collapsible rear seats: (iii) does not include a minibus, moped, motorcycle, or small passenger vehicle Identification prominently and permanently displayed Question 1: As a teenager, Chris was a professional motocross rider. His bikes and support vehicle were sign-written with his nickname – “ChrisX”. Chris still has the stencils used to create that sign. He wants to know if he could use the stencils to sign-write Garry’s vehicle to satisfy the “form of identification” requirement for work-related vehicles. Answer 1: This would not satisfy the “form of identification” requirement. Although Chris is a shareholder and employee of CWL, “ChrisX” is not the form of identification that CWL uses in carrying on the company’s business. Question 2: Veri wants to know if they could use the personalised number plate “XWIRES” instead of sign-writing the vehicle. The plate comes with a surround (or frame) that could be printed with the phone number and web address for CWL. Veri notes that plates could be easily and cheaply removed when the vehicle is eventually sold, while removing sign-writing for re-sale could be expensive. Answer 2: Personalised number plates do not satisfy the requirement for the “form of identification” to be prominently displayed. The details of the business would be visible only from the front and back of the vehicle and only from up close. The details would not be readily seen or particularly noticeable. The plates would also fail the “form of identification” requirement as “XWIRES” is not the form of identification regularly used by CWL in carrying on its business. Question 3: Chris and Veri are considering whether to lease a vehicle for Garry rather than buying one. Leased vehicles can be work-related vehicles but they must still have either the employer or the owner’s form of identification permanently and prominently displayed. The car lease company will not permit Chris and Veri to sign-write their vehicle. Chris suggests that CWL could get some custom-made magnetic signs for the lease vehicle. The signs would prominently display the “Crossed Wires Ltd” name and contact details, but could be easily removed when the lease ends without damaging the vehicle. Answer 3: Magnetic door signs would not satisfy the requirement for the form of identification to be permanently displayed; neither would removable sign-written wheel covers or removable ute canopies. 20 UNCLASSIFIED If a motor vehicle is designed exclusively or mainly to carry people, then it will not 84. qualify as a work-related vehicle. This includes vehicles that have rear doors or collapsible rear seats. The definition of “car” expressly excludes a minibus, moped, motorcycle or small 85. passenger vehicle. These vehicles could qualify as work-related vehicles, even though they are designed exclusively or mainly to carry people. Meaning of “designed exclusively or mainly to carry people” Whether a motor vehicle is designed exclusively or mainly to carry people was 86. considered in Tisco Ltd v CIR (1991) 13 NZTC 8,049 (HC). Barker J considered the meaning of the phrase “designed principally or exclusively for the carriage of passengers”, which was how the test was worded in the Income Tax Act 1976. The taxpayer in Tisco was in the business of installing and servicing electrical and 87. technical appliances. The taxpayer operated a fleet of Toyota Corolla station wagons that its employees used to make service calls to customers’ premises and to transport items from customers’ premises to the taxpayer’s workshops. Tool kits, service instruments and spare parts were carried in the vehicles to help with repairs. The Commissioner considered that the vehicles were motorcars (being principally 88. designed for the carriage of passengers), so subject to FBT. The taxpayer disagreed. In the High Court, Barker J stated that whether a vehicle was designed principally 89. for the carriage of people is ultimately a question that relates to the construction of the vehicle and not to its intended use (at 8,051): From cases based on similarly worded legislation, it is clear that the question whether a vehicle is designed principally for the carriage of persons is a question relating to the construction of the vehicle, not a question of the owner’s use or intended use of the vehicle. However, any alterations or adaptations to the vehicle made by the owner must be taken into account when considering the question of design. On the facts, Barker J was satisfied that the particular model of station wagon was 90. not a motorcar because it was not designed principally or exclusively for the carriage of people. The vehicle could comfortably transport passengers, provided they were small enough to sit in the back seat. However, it was equally designed to carry goods (the model of station wagon had a particular type of suspension that made it suitable for carrying heavy loads of tools and equipment). Barker J concluded that if a vehicle is designed equally for two purposes then neither purpose can be called the “principal” purpose (at 8,052): From the manufacturer’s point of view and hence the designer’s point of view, the uses of this particular vehicle are both for passenger use and for goods use. It must be a matter of indifference to the manufacturers who buys the vehicle. One imagines that Toyota was trying to cater to as wide a market as possible. Nonetheless I think there is some force in the argument of counsel for the objector that if a vehicle is designed equally for two purposes then neither purpose can be called the “principal” purpose. \[Emphasis added\] Barker J explained that his decision was based purely on the facts of this particular 91. model of station wagon. The three main principles from Tisco are: 92.  The question of whether a vehicle is designed principally to carry people is a question relating to the construction of the vehicle. It is not a question of the owner’s use or intended use of the vehicle. 21 UNCLASSIFIED  Any alterations made to the vehicle since its manufacture must be taken into account when considering the question of design.  If a vehicle is designed equally for two purposes, then neither purpose can be called the principal purpose. The Commissioner considers that station wagons will typically be “cars” as they are 93. designed exclusively or mainly to carry people. This will be the case unless there is specific evidence to show that a station wagon has been designed equally to carry people and goods or if the necessary alterations have been made to the vehicle to convert it into a vehicle designed equally (or exclusively or mainly) to carry goods. In Case Q25 (1993) 15 NZTC 5,124, the taxpayer was a company that 94. manufactured clothing. The shareholder-employees were a husband and wife and they regularly took items of clothing home to work on. The company provided the couple with hatchback vehicles to transport the clothing from the workshop to their home. When in use, the vehicles had the backseat folded down with a plywood floor covering the rear portion. The issue for the TRA was whether the hatchback vehicles were work-related vehicles. Judge Willy decided they were. Case Q25 was appealed to the High Court in CIR v Rag Doll Fashions (NZ) Ltd 95. (1995) 17 NZTC 12,104 (HC). Morris J endorsed the principles from Tisco. He noted that when the vehicles were manufactured they could be regarded as designed “exclusively or principally for the carriage of persons”. However, the design of the vehicles had been altered for the taxpayer’s business (at 12,106): I am in no doubt when these vehicles came from the factory they could properly be regarded in no other way but vehicles designed principally or exclusively for the carriage of persons. But alterations were made to them. True, not major. The design of the vehicle was, without question, altered. There is a significant difference between a vehicle with the back seat up and available for passengers and one where a shaped and fitted plywood cover extends from the back of the front seat to the tailgate. With that cover in place the rear seat cannot be raised or used. This alteration enabled carriage of company products. Therefore, Morris J was satisfied that there was sufficient evidence before the TRA 96. to conclude that the vehicles were not designed “exclusively or principally for the carriage of persons” and could be categorised as “work-related vehicles”. The two main principles from Rag Doll are: 97.  An alteration to the design of a vehicle, even if it is not “major”, can change the vehicle from one that was principally designed to carry people to a work- related vehicle.  An alteration could involve the disabling of rear seats so that they cannot be raised or used to carry people. The Commissioner’s view is that any alterations to the design of a vehicle must be 98. permanent in nature in order to satisfy this work-related vehicle requirement (see “FBT and work related vehicles – Court decision in Rag Doll Fashions case” in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 7, No 13, (May 1996): 19). The definition of “motorcar” has changed since Tisco and Rag Doll. A “car” is now 99. defined in s YA 1 as a motor vehicle “designed exclusively or mainly to carry people” rather than “designed principally or exclusively for the carriage of passengers”. In the Commissioner’s opinion, “mainly” has the same meaning as “principally” in this context, so the High Court’s reasoning in Tisco and Rag Doll is still applicable. 22 UNCLASSIFIED “Includes such a motor vehicle that has rear doors or collapsible rear seats” Paragraph (b)(ii) of the definition of “car” in s YA 1 states that a “car” “\[i\]ncludes 100. such a motor vehicle that has rear doors or collapsible rear seats”. The Commissioner considers that para (b)(ii) must be read subject to para (b)(i). 101. The focus under para (b)(i) is on whether the vehicle is designed exclusively or mainly to carry people. If this is not the case (as was the decision in Tisco), then the presence of rear doors or collapsible rear seats will not deem the vehicle to be a car. For example, a vehicle such as a double-cab ute, which is not designed exclusively or mainly to carry passengers, will not qualify as a car simply because it has rear doors and collapsible seats. Exclusions from the definition of “car” The s YA 1 definition of “car” expressly excludes minibuses, mopeds, motorcycles 102. and small passenger vehicles. This means these vehicles may still qualify as work- related vehicles, even though they may be designed exclusively or mainly to carry people. A work-related vehicle must not be a “car” Chris and Veri have been investigating the purchase of a work-related vehicle for Garry. Garry needs to be able to transport hardware, tools and spare parts to client sites so he needs a vehicle that is suitable for this use. Jan, the salesperson from the car yard, suggests a few possibilities. Vehicle 1 is a large four-wheel drive vehicle. This vehicle has two rows of rear seats and can accommodate up to seven people, including the driver. The seats can be folded forwards to make a large storage space, which would be suitable for storing and transporting equipment. Assessment of vehicle 1: This vehicle is designed mainly for carrying people. The fact the seats can be folded down to make a large storage space does not change this fact. No alterations have been made to the vehicle since its manufacture that has changed this design. This vehicle is a car. Vehicle 2 is a station wagon. This vehicle is a typical station wagon with four doors and rear seats. The rear seats can be folded forward to increase the boot space. Assessment of vehicle 2: As with vehicle 1, this vehicle is designed mainly for carrying people. This vehicle is a car. Vehicle 3 is a second-hand modified station-wagon. This vehicle has had the rear seats removed and replaced with plywood work benches. Assessment of vehicle 3: This vehicle was originally designed mainly to carry people. However, post-manufacture, changes have been made to the vehicle to adapt it for a different use. The removal of the rear seats and the addition of plywood work benches have changed the design of the vehicle so that it is no longer designed mainly to carry people. This vehicle is not a car. Vehicle 4 is a double-cab ute. This vehicle is a four-door ute with rear seats and a tray. 23 UNCLASSIFIED A work-related vehicle is not available for private use, with exceptions Section CX 38(3) states that a vehicle is not a work-related vehicle on any day on 103. which it is available for private use, except for private use that is:  between home and work that is necessary in, and a condition of, the employee’s employment (s CX 38(3)(a)); or  other travel in the course of the employee’s employment, during which the travel arises incidentally to the business use (s CX 38(3)(b)). A non-work-related vehicle will be subject to FBT on any day that the vehicle is 104. available for the employee’s private use. However, a work-related vehicle may be available for the types of private use specified in s CX 38(3) without triggering an FBT liability. Meaning of “travel to and from their home that is necessary in, and a condition of, their employment” A work-related vehicle is not subject to FBT where the vehicle is available for the 105. employee’s private use, where that private use is travel to and from the employee’s home that is necessary in, and a condition of, their employment. The Concise Oxford Dictionary defines “necessary” to mean: 106. necessary adj. 1 required to be done, achieved, or present; needed. 2 inevitable: a necessary consequence. The definition of “necessary” suggests there must be a direct or needed relationship 107. between the employee’s travel to and from home and their employment. This may not necessarily be “essential”, but must certainly be “required or needed” in their employment (Re Wreck Recovery & Salvage Co (1880) 15 Ch 353, Knight v Demolition and Construction Co \[1953\] All ER 508, Europa Oil (NZ) Ltd (No 2) v CIR (1974) 1 NZTC 61,169 (CA) and Fitzpatrick v IRC \[1994\] SLT 836). If the travel is not necessary in the employee’s employment, then the travel will be subject to FBT. For example, if a receptionist is given a vehicle to travel between Assessment of vehicle 4: This vehicle is designed equally for carrying people and for carrying goods. The front half of the ute comprises the cab which has two rows of seats for carrying people. The back half of the vehicle is the tray, which is used for carrying goods. This vehicle is not a car. Vehicle 5 is a lease vehicle and a station wagon. Jan has a station wagon that she could lease to CWL. However, the rear seats would need to be disabled to ensure the vehicle was not classified as a “car”. Because this is a lease vehicle, CWL would not be able to remove the seats, but Jan says it might be possible to bolt the seats down so that they could not be used. Assessment of vehicle 5: The station wagon has been designed exclusively or mainly for carrying people. However, if the seats were permanently bolted down so that they could not be used, then this would change the design of the vehicle so that it was no longer designed mainly to carry people. If this occurs the vehicle would not be a car. 24 UNCLASSIFIED home and work, the employer would not be entitled to the benefit of the private use exclusion in s CX 38(3)(a), because the travel to and from home is not necessary to the receptionist’s role. Section CX 38(3)(a) also states that the travel must be “a condition of” the 108. employee’s employment. The Commissioner considers that “a condition of” means that the travel to and from home must be a requirement of that employee’s terms of employment. In summary, the requirements for the application of s CX 38(3)(a) are that an 109. employee cannot use a vehicle for private use except for travel to and from their home where that travel:  has a direct or needed relationship with the employee’s employment; and  is a requirement of that employee’s terms of employment. Meaning of “other travel in the course of their employment during which the travel arises incidentally to the business use” Section CX 38(3)(b) permits private use of a work-related vehicle where that use is 110. “other travel in the course of \[the employee’s\] employment during which the travel arises incidentally to the business use”. “Other travel” means travel other than travel to and from home. “Travel in the 111. course of the \[the employee’s\] employment” means other travel that has a nexus or proximity to their employment, where such travel arises incidentally to business use. “Incidentally” is not defined in the Act or in relevant case law. The Concise Oxford 112. Dictionary defines “incidental” and “incidentally” as: incidentaladj. 1 occurring as a minor accompaniment. occurring by chance in connection with something else. 2 (incidental to) liable to happen as a consequence of. incidentallyadv. 1 as an incidental comment; by the way. 2 in an incidental manner. The dictionary definitions suggest two alternative interpretations. First, the travel 113. could be “incidental” by reference to the distance or time of the travel, in comparison to the travel undertaken in the course of performing employment activities; the non-work travel being minor by comparison. Second, “incidental” travel could be a by-product or natural following-on of the travel undertaken in the course of performing employment activities. For example, an employee stops at a dairy for an ice-cream on the way to visit a client. Under this interpretation, the dairy stop is a natural following-on from the business use. The Commissioner considers that the natural following-on interpretation is the most 114. appropriate interpretation when considering whether the travel “arises incidentally to the business use”. In this context, the more natural reading of “incidentally” is that the private use follows as a consequence of the business use. Effect of the exemption and partial exemptions There is no FBT liability on any day that a vehicle qualifies as a work-related 115. vehicle. If an employer permits the vehicle to be available for some private use on certain days (such as weekends), then the vehicle will not be a work-related vehicle on those days and consequently, will be partially exempt. This means the employer will need to pay FBT for those days (whether the vehicle is used or not). 25 UNCLASSIFIED Work-related vehicle also available for private use CWL purchases a double-cab ute for Garry to use. This vehicle qualifies as a work-related vehicle. The ute has been sign-written and CWL’s name and contact details are prominently and permanently displayed on the exterior of the ute. The ute is a “motor vehicle” and is not a “car” as defined in s YA 1. The ute has been customised so there is safe and secure storage for transporting computer hardware, tools and spare parts. Arrangement with Garry: CWL requires Garry to garage the ute at his home as there is no secure parking available at CWL’s offices. This means using the ute to travel between home and work. Garry often travels directly to clients’ premises from home and occasionally responds to after-hours call- outs, so this use is necessary in his employment. Garry would like to be able to use his work-related vehicle for private use in the weekends. Garry is a radio- controlled sailboat enthusiast and would like to be able to transport his sailboats to regattas in the weekends. Some of his sailboats are up to two metres in length, so his work- related vehicle would be useful for this purpose. Garry asks CWL if he may do this. As Garry is a valuable member of the CWL team, CWL decides to permit Garry to use the work-related vehicle for private use on Saturdays and Sundays. This means that on Saturdays and Sundays the vehicle does not qualify as a work-related vehicle, and CWL needs to pay FBT on the vehicle for those two days. To ensure no further FBT liability arises, CWL makes it a condition of Garry’s employment contract that he must securely garage the ute at his home. Additionally, CWL writes to Garry prohibiting him from using the vehicle for private use at any other time and advising that CWL will carry out quarterly checks to ensure no private use is occurring. In these circumstances, Garry may use the vehicle to travel between home and work without generating an FBT liability for CWL. Garry also mentions that he might want to leave work early on some Friday afternoons to attend out-of-town regattas. CWL agree that Garry can do this as long as he seeks permission from the directors and notifies Trevor that the vehicle is being used for private purposes on that Friday. CWL will need to account for FBT for the extra day of private use. Question: During March, Garry takes annual leave and decides to take a train trip to Hamilton. The work-related vehicle is left at home during this period. CWL wants to know if they still need to account for FBT on the weekends that Garry is in Hamilton, as the vehicle is not being used for private use on those weekends. Answer: CWL must account for FBT on the weekends that Garry is on holiday in Hamilton. The work-related vehicle has been made available for Garry’s private use. The fact Garry did not use the vehicle on those weekends does not change the fact the vehicle has been made available for his private use. 26 UNCLASSIFIED Emergency call exemption Section CX 6(3) applies when a vehicle is “used for an emergency call”. 116. “Emergency call” is defined in s CX 34: CX 34 Meaning of emergency call Emergency call means a visit that an employee is required to make, to which all the following apply: (a) the employee makes the visit from their home in the course of their employment; and (b) the purpose of the visit is to provide— (i) essential services relating to the operation of the plant or machinery of the employer, or of their client or customer; or (ii) essential services relating to the maintenance of services provided by a local authority or a public authority; or (iii) essential services relating to the carrying on of a business for the supply of energy or fuel to the public; or (iv) emergency services relating to the health or safety of any person; and (c) the employer, their client or customer, or a member of the public requests the services; and (d) except when paragraph (b)(iv) applies, the services are required to be performed between the hours of 6.00 pm and 6.00 am on days other than a Saturday, Sunday, or statutory public holiday, and at any time on other days. An emergency call is therefore a visit that meets certain conditions. The conditions 117. relate to the purpose of the visit and the person who makes the visit (the employee). Simply being “on-call” would not be enough to satisfy this requirement. The purpose of the visit must be to provide services requested by the employer, 118. their client or customer, or a member of the public. The services must be “emergency services relating to the health and safety of any person” or “essential services”. If the purpose of the visit is to provide “essential services”, then these services 119. must be performed between 6pm and 6am on weekdays or on a Saturday, Sunday or public holiday. The essential services must relate to:  the operation of the employer’s plant or machinery or that of their client or customer; or  the maintenance of services provided by a local or public authority; or  the carrying on of a business for the supply of energy or fuel to the public. Emergency calls CWL is frequently required to make after-hours calls to client sites to perform essential services relating to the operation of CWL’s clients’ hardware and software. Chris undertakes most of these calls with Garry’s assistance when necessary. CWL wants to know whether Chris and Garry would qualify for the emergency call exemption. 27 UNCLASSIFIED Section CX 6(3) is satisfied when a vehicle is used for a visit that satisfies all the 120. conditions at s CX 34. Section CX 6(5) then deems the vehicle to be unavailable for private use for the entire 24-hour period of the employer’s FBT day (see \[143\]). A “visit” means a short stay of a temporary nature Section CX 34 defines an emergency call as a visit. The Concise Oxford Dictionary 121. defines the noun “visit” (as relevant) to mean “an act of visiting” or “a temporary stay at a place”. The verb “visit” is defined as “go to see for a purpose, such as to give professional advice”. The Commissioner considers that a “visit” may refer to short stays or it could 122. include stays lasting hours or even days. However, the stay must be of a temporary nature. It is not necessary for the employee to depart the workplace after the purpose of 123. the visit has been fulfilled. If an employee is on an emergency call to their workplace within the acceptable period, the fact they then stay on and complete a full day’s work does not prevent this exemption from applying. An employee must be required to make the visit For a visit to be an emergency call under s CX 34, the visit must be one that “an 124. employee is required to make”; and the employee must make the visit from home in the course of their employment. Whether these requirements are met will be a question of fact. The condition that the employee must be “required” to make the visit indicates 125. some element of compulsion must exist, either because the employer has directed the employee to make a particular visit or because the employee must respond to certain requests under the terms of their employment. The visit must be made from the employee’s home. If the employee is away from 126. home with the vehicle when they are obliged to make a visit, this requirement will not be met. The visit must also be made in the course of the employee’s employment. This 127. means there must be some nexus or proximity between the travel and the employment. The requirement will generally be satisfied when there is a relationship between the visit and the employee’s employment. The visit must be to provide emergency services or essential services A visit cannot be an emergency call unless the purpose of the visit is to provide 128. “emergency services relating to the health and safety of any person” or “essential services”. Where there is more than one purpose to the visit, the Commissioner considers that the reference to “the purpose” is a reference to the dominant purpose of the visit. (See CIR v National Distributors Ltd (1989) 11 NZTC 6,350 (CA), CIR v Walker \[1963\] NZLR 339 (CA), CIR v Hunter \[1970\] NZLR 116 (CA) and Wellington Regional Stadium Trust v A-G \[2005\] 1 NZLR 250 (HC).) It will not be sufficient that the specified services happen to be performed during a 129. visit. The provision of those services must be the purpose of undertaking the visit in the first place. The services must also be requested by the employer, their client or customer, or a member of the public. Meaning of “emergency services” One of the purposes of an emergency call must be to provide “emergency services 130. relating to the health and safety of any person”. 28 UNCLASSIFIED The Concise Oxford English Dictionary defines “emergency” to mean: 131. n. 1 a serious, unexpected, and potentially dangerous situation requiring immediate action ▪ \[as modifier\] arising from or used in an emergency. As “emergency” is used to qualify “services”, the ordinary meaning of “emergency 132. services” must be “services arising from a serious, unexpected and potentially dangerous situation requiring immediate action”. Under s CX 34(b)(iv), the services must also relate to health and safety. The Commissioner considers that the immediacy requirement will not necessarily be 133. one of factual urgency. A reasonable perception of urgency would satisfy this test, as “emergency” requires only potential danger. For example, if a doctor attends to a person exhibiting symptoms of a medical emergency, the emergency call definition would be met, even if the patient’s condition is found to be less serious than first thought. Meaning of “essential services” Another purpose of an emergency call is to provide “essential services”. The 134. Concise Oxford Dictionary defines “essential” (as relevant) to mean “absolutely necessary; extremely important”. This definition does not appear to impose an element of urgency. The word “essential” can be used without reference to time. For example, the Concise Oxford Dictionary provides the usage example, “fibre is an essential ingredient of our diet”. The Commissioner considers that the focus for essential services is on importance rather than urgency. This view is supported by the United Kingdom Court of Appeal (Civil Division) in 135. Tapsell v Cemery (1994) 27 HLR 114. The court considered whether work to be completed in improving a sea wall constituted “essential works” within the meaning of an agreement formed under the Mobile Homes Act 1993. The lower court had held that the sea wall improvements were “essential works”. In confirming the lower court’s decision, Butler-Sloss LJ explained that something can be essential without needing to be urgent (at 119): As my Lord said during argument, there is some confusion between “essential” and “urgent”. It is clearly not urgent because it has not yet been done. That does not mean that it is not essential. Section CX 34(b)(i)–(iii) requires that the services be “essential” in relation to any 136. of three specified activities:  the operation of the plant or machinery of the employer, their client, or their customer;  the maintenance of services provided by a local or public authority;  the carrying on of a business for the supply of energy or fuel to the public. Section CX 34(b) is not concerned with the importance of the activities in 137. subparas (i)–(iii), which are defined broadly. Instead, it focuses on the importance of the services provided in relation to the specified activities. The services must be “essential” to one or more of the activities specified at s CX 34(b)(i)–(iii). The Commissioner considers that a nexus must exist between the performing of the services and the relevant activity. The Commissioner also considers that the essential services must be sufficiently 138. important to the carrying on of the activity, to the extent that it would be very difficult or impossible to carry on the activity if the services were not provided. Under this approach, routine maintenance and testing services would satisfy s CX 34(b)(i)–(iii), provided the services are indispensable to the activity. The services do not need to relate to an imminent or existing disruption to the activity. 29 UNCLASSIFIED The activity described in s CX 34(b)(i) is the operation of plant or machinery of the 139. employer or their client or customer. For example, for an employer who carries on a business of servicing eftpos systems, the operation of an eftpos system by a client running a beauty salon would satisfy the activity described as s CX 34(b)(i). Whether eftpos servicing or beauty salons are “essential services” in ordinary usage is irrelevant. Whether the eftpos servicing qualifies as “essential” under s CX 34(b)(i) will require consideration of the importance of an eftpos technician’s services in relation to the beauty salon’s operation of their eftpos system. The Commissioner considers that “plant and machinery” includes things like fire 140. alarms. If an employee is required to visit their employer’s site or a client’s site after hours to service a malfunctioning fire alarm, then that visit would qualify as a visit to provide “essential services” relating to the operation of the employer’s or client’s plant and machinery. “Essential services” must be performed outside normal working hours Finally, s CX 34(d) requires that the essential services be performed between 6pm 141. and 6am or on a Saturday, Sunday or statutory public holiday. It is not enough that the services are merely performed within the s CX 34(d) 142. timeframes. The services must be “required to be performed” during the timeframes. There must be something inherent in the facts of the situation that drives the decision to perform the services within the identified timeframes. An urgent mechanical breakdown or stoppage would likely meet this requirement. However, as discussed above; essential services do not require urgency. Similarly, the employer does not need to prove that it was impossible to perform the services outside the stated timeframes. Provided there is a sound reason for why the services could not be performed on a normal business day (between 6am and 6pm), aside from a reduction in FBT, the timeframe requirement at s CX 34(d) will be met. A vehicle is used for an emergency call from the time an employee departs from 143. home in the vehicle until they arrive at the site of the emergency call. When a vehicle is used for an emergency call the vehicle is deemed to be unavailable for private use for the entire 24-hour period (see s CX 6(5) and from \[151\] for a more detailed discussion on the meaning of “day”). When the employer is calculating their FBT liability, that day will not count as a day on which the vehicle was made available for private use. The effect of the emergency call exemption is considered in more detail from \[151\]. 30 UNCLASSIFIED Emergency calls Question 1: Jobs R US Ltd (a recruitment company and client of CWL) has decided to update its computer terminals. Chris has agreed to come in after hours and replace the terminals and run a software update. His visit is scheduled for 11pm on Tuesday evening when the recruitment staff have left for the day. The timing of the update is to ensure minimal disruption to the recruitment company’s business. Chris travels from home to the offices of Jobs R US Ltd. Chris finishes up around 5am. He stays around afterwards to talk to the Jobs R US Ltd business development manager about selling the company some new accounting software. He leaves the Jobs R US Ltd offices at 9am. Does Chris’s visit qualify for the emergency call exemption? Answer 1: Yes. Chris’s visit would qualify for the emergency call exemption because:  Chris was required to make the visit because this was something that the client requested from CWL.  The visit was made in the course of Chris’s employment with CWL.  Chris made the visit in his vehicle from his home to the client site.  The principal purpose of the visit was to undertake essential information technology services in relation to the operation of the client’s plant and machinery, namely the computers that the client uses to undertake its business. The client could not undertake its business without the computers.  The work was scheduled and not of an urgent nature. However, urgency is not a requirement of the exemption.  Finally, the essential services were carried out on a week day between 11pm and 5am. This satisfies the timeframe requirements in s CX 34(d). A valid reason existed for the services needing to be carried out during this time – to prevent disruption to the client’s business. It is irrelevant that Chris stayed on after he finished performing the essential services to discuss the sale of new accounting software with the business development manager. It is not necessary for the employee to depart the workplace after the purpose of the visit has been fulfilled. This does not prevent the exemption from applying. Question 2: Garry’s vehicle is a work-related vehicle only from midnight Sunday to midnight Friday. This is because he is allowed to use the vehicle privately on Saturdays and Sundays. One Saturday afternoon while Garry is getting his groceries, he gets a call on his work cell phone from one of CWL’s clients, a boutique wool-dyeing business called Rainbow Merino. An employee has accidently knocked their wireless router into a vat of hot dye and they need it replaced immediately to keep the internet running so they can access new orders. After dropping his groceries home, Garry drives to Rainbow Merino’s premises in his work vehicle at 2pm on Saturday. Does Garry’s visit qualify for the emergency call exemption? Answer 2: Yes. Garry’s visit would qualify for the emergency call exemption because:  The visit was made in the course of Garry’s employment as an installation specialist with CWL.  Garry made the visit in his work vehicle from his home to the client’s site. 31 UNCLASSIFIED Business travel exemption Section CX 6(4) contains the business travel exemption: 144. Exclusion: absences from home (4) Subsection (1) does not apply when the employee is absent from home, with the vehicle, for a period of at least 24 hours continuously, if the employee is required, in the performance of their duties, to use a vehicle and regularly to be absent from home. Requirements of the exemption The business travel exemption applies when: 145.  an employee is absent from home with the vehicle for at least 24 hours; and  the employee is required to use a vehicle in the performance of their duties; and  the employee is required to be regularly absent from home in the performance of their duties. The employee is absent from home “with” the vehicle for at least 24 hours The business travel exemption will apply only where an employee is absent from 146. home “with” the vehicle. If the vehicle is parked at an airport while the employee travels by plane to another destination, then the vehicle is not “with” the employee and the exemption will not apply. The requirement for the employee to be absent from home “with” the vehicle was 147. introduced in 2004 and departs from the previous version of s CX 6(4), which did not contain this requirement. This change means the Commissioner’s statement published in “Cars parked at airport carparks”, Public Information Bulletin No 144 (March 1986) no longer correctly reflects the legislation. The Public Information Bulletin item concluded that the business travel exemption would apply when a  The principal purpose of the visit was to undertake essential information technology services in relation to the operation of the client’s plant and machinery (replacing and setting up the new router). The client could not undertake its business if Garry did not replace the router.  The services were requested by the client and were required to be performed on a Saturday because that is when the accident happened. While Garry’s vehicle is not a work-related vehicle on weekends (so is subject to FBT on those days), the fact he was required to make an emergency call on the Saturday means the emergency call exemption applies and CWL is not liable for FBT on that Saturday. This is despite Garry using the vehicle privately to get his groceries. Business travel Chris travels frequently for work. CWL has clients in different towns and cities and sometimes these jobs take more than one day. Chris wants to know if the business travel exemption will apply. 32 UNCLASSIFIED person travelled by air for business and left the vehicle at the airport, provided the vehicle was not available for private use on those days. Due to changes in the legislation, this view is no longer correct. This Interpretation Statement therefore withdraws and updates that advice. The employee is required to use a vehicle in the performance of their duties This requirement is a question of fact and self-explanatory. 148. The employee is required to be regularly absent from home in the performance of their duties The final requirement of the business travel exemption is that the employee must 149. be required to be regularly absent from home in the performance of their duties. The Concise Oxford Dictionary relevantly defines “regular” as follows: recurring at short uniform intervals: a regular monthly check. ▪ done or happening frequently. ▪doing the same thing often or at uniform intervals: regular worshippers... The Commissioner considers that in the context of s CX 6(4) “regularly absent from 150. home” should be interpreted as meaning travel that occurs with reasonable frequency or at short uniform intervals, such as monthly travel. Infrequent or occasional travel (for example, a yearly trip, even if the trip was for the same reasons, say attending an annual conference) would not satisfy this requirement. Business travel Question 1: Chris needs to visit some clients in Napier to help install new equipment and to investigate new business opportunities. He decides to make the four-hour journey in his company vehicle. He is in Napier for three days. Does Chris’s visit qualify for the business travel exemption? Answer 1: Yes. Chris is absent from home with the vehicle for more than 24 hours. In the performance of his employment duties, he is regularly required to use a vehicle and is regularly required to be absent from home. Question 2: Instead of travelling by car to Napier, CWL has Chris fly so he can maximise his time in Napier and visit some additional clients. He parks his company vehicle at the airport and makes the journey by plane. Can CWL take advantage of the business travel exemption? Answer 2: No. CWL cannot take advantage of the business travel exemption because Chris is not “with” the vehicle while he is absent from home. Because the business travel exemption cannot apply, whether a vehicle is subject to FBT on a day that the vehicle is parked at an airport must be determined according to whether the employer has made the vehicle available to an employee for their private use on that day. In this example, CWL has effectively removed Chris’s access to the vehicle by requiring him to fly to Napier on business. This means that CWL is no longer making the vehicle available to Chris for his private use. CWL still needs to account for FBT on the day of departure and the day of return, as Chris’s vehicle is not subject to a private use restriction. This means the vehicle is still made available to Chris for his private use on the day of departure and the day of return. Only day two is therefore exempt from FBT. Chris needs to document his travel and ensure this documentation is given to Trevor so he can accurately complete CWL’s FBT return. This is a similar outcome to the outcome in the Australian IT Conference example at \[41\] above. However, it differs from the family holiday example at \[41\] because in that example it was Chris’s own actions that removed his access to the vehicle, not the actions of CWL. 33 UNCLASSIFIED Effect of emergency call and business travel exemptions Section CX 6(5) explains how the emergency call and business travel exemptions 151. are implemented: Use on part of day (5) For the purposes of subsections (3) and (4), the whole of the day on which a motor vehicle is used as described in the applicable subsection is treated as a day on which the vehicle is not available for private use. To understand how s CX 6(5) applies, it is necessary to consider its relationship 152. with the emergency call and business travel exemptions – what is meant by “day”; and what is meant by a vehicle being “used as described”. These issues are discussed next. Vehicle deemed unavailable for private use for that day Section CX 6(5) is a deeming provision. If a vehicle has been made available for 153. private use but the vehicle is subsequently used for an emergency call or for business travel, then that vehicle is deemed to be unavailable for private use for the whole of that day of use. Actual private use of a vehicle is not relevant in this context. A fringe benefit arises 154. when a vehicle is made available for private use, and FBT is calculated according to the number of days the vehicle is made available for private use in a return period. Section CX 6(5) operates to exempt a day from the FBT calculations when a vehicle is used for an emergency call or for business travel. This means no FBT is payable for that vehicle for that day. Meaning of “day” Under s CX 6(5), the whole of the day on which a motor vehicle is used for an 155. emergency call or business travel will be treated as being a day on which the vehicle is not available for private use. “Day” is not defined for the purpose of s CX 6(5). Section RD 30 defines “day” for 156. the purposes of the FBT calculation in s RD 29. Section RD 30(1)–(3) allows employers to choose the start or end of their “day” for FBT calculation purposes: RD 30 Private use of motor vehicle: 24-hour period When this section applies (1) This section applies for the purposes of a calculation of the value of a benefit under section RD 29. Meaning of day (2) In section RD 29(5)(a) and (b), in relation to a motor vehicle and the item days in the formulas, a day is— (a) a 24-hour period starting from a time in a day that a person who owns or leases the vehicle chooses; or (b) a 24-hour period starting at midnight if paragraph (a) does not apply. Choosing starting point and notifying Commissioner (3) For the purposes of subsection (2)(a), the person must— (a) choose a starting point for the day that is a whole number of an hour after midnight; and (b) notify the Commissioner of their election when filing the next return relating to the vehicle. 34 UNCLASSIFIED Elections (4) An election under subsection (2)(a) — (a) is effective from the start of the quarter, income year, or tax year to which a return relates; and (b) applies to all vehicles in relation to which the person files a return. Hour applying for 2 income years (5) If the person chooses under subsection (3)(a) a particular hour in the 24-hour period as the starting point of the day, that hour continues to apply to the use of the vehicle from the start of the relevant quarter, income year, or tax year, as applicable, for a minimum period of 2 income years. When circumstances change (6) An employer may apply to the Commissioner to amend the starting point of the 24- hour period, or to treat the election as revoked, if the employer’s circumstances have changed in a way that— (a) is more than minor; and (b) makes the starting point no longer relevant to the employer’s business. The Commissioner considers the word “day” in s CX 6(5) must mean the day 157. described at s RD 30(2) for any given employer (see from \[212\]). In other words, for an employer who has not made an election under s RD 30(2)(a), “day” in s CX 6(5) means any ordinary calendar day. For an employer who has made an election, a “day” is a 24-hour period starting on any calendar day at the time selected by the employer under s RD 30(2)(a). As mentioned at \[156\], an employer may elect to change their FBT “day”. The 158. adoption of a non-standard FBT day might benefit an employer who occasionally allows an employee to take a vehicle home overnight. If the employer operates a standard FBT day (a 24-hour period from 12am to 12am), this would result in two days of private use. This means the employer would be liable for two days of FBT on that vehicle. However, by electing to start their FBT day at 5 pm, the employer would only be liable for one day of FBT when they permit the employee to take a vehicle home overnight. However, if an employer makes an election under s RD 30, that election applies 159. across all of the employer’s vehicles. An election is made by notifying the Commissioner of this election when filing an FBT return. The election is effective for a period of two income years from the start of the quarter, income year or tax year to which the FBT return relates. If an employer’s circumstances change in a way that is more than minor and makes 160. the starting point no longer relevant to their business, then the employer may apply to the Commissioner to amend or revoke that election (s RD 30(6)). Emergency call exemption “day” A vehicle is treated as unavailable for private use on a day if the vehicle is used to 161. make an emergency call visit. If at any time during a day an employee uses a vehicle to make an emergency call visit, then s CX 6(5) treats the vehicle as unavailable for private use for that 24-hour period. The exemption applies when the vehicle is being used to make a visit, not when an employee is performing the services of an emergency call. Generally, a vehicle is used to make a visit from an employee’s home when an 162. employee drives the vehicle from home to the location being visited. The period of time the vehicle is “used” to make the visit spans from departure (from home) to arrival (at the location of the emergency call). 35 UNCLASSIFIED The Commissioner considers that s CX 6(5) exempts the day of departure. 163. However, in cases where an employee departs their home in a vehicle before the end of one FBT day (either midnight or an hour selected by the employer) and arrives at the emergency call site after that time (that is, on the next FBT day), both FBT days would be days on which the vehicle was used for an emergency call. Therefore, the employer’s vehicle would be exempt from FBT for both days. The exemption is triggered by the use of the vehicle to make a visit from an employee’s home, not the time of departure from the client site or the time of the emergency call. Business travel exemption “day” Unlike s CX 6(3) (the emergency call exemption), s CX 6(4) does not describe a 164. vehicle being used in a particular way. Instead, it describes a particular situation: when an employee (who meets certain requirements) is absent from home with the vehicle for at least 24 hours. However, the Commissioner considers that s CX 6(4) involves an implicit use of a 165. vehicle. The circumstances described are when the employee is absent from home “with” the vehicle. The Concise Oxford Dictionary defines “with” to mean: 1 accompanied by. ▪ in the same direction as. 2 possessing; having. 3 indicating the instrument used to perform an action or the material used for a purpose. The Commissioner considers that if an employee has been absent from home “with” 166. a vehicle, the employee must have used the vehicle during the absence. For an employee to be accompanied by a vehicle or have possession of it during an absence of at least 24 hours, the employee will generally have driven the vehicle to achieve the absence or in the course of the absence or both. Use of the vehicle by a qualifying employee who is absent from home with the 167. vehicle for at least 24 hours will attract the business travel exemption for that entire FBT day under s CX 6(5). How to calculate fringe benefit tax on a motor vehicle fringe benefit This part of the Interpretation Statement explains how to calculate FBT on a motor 168. vehicle fringe benefit. An employer who provides a motor vehicle fringe benefit to an employee is liable to 169. pay FBT under ss RD 27 to RD 57 (s RD 26(1)). The two factors that determine the amount of FBT payable on a motor vehicle fringe benefit are the:  rate of FBT; and  value of the motor vehicle fringe benefit (less any payments made by an employee for receiving the benefit (see \[243\])). Determining the rate of FBT FBT returns can be filed on a quarterly, annual or income-year basis. Under 170. s RD 26(2) an employer must choose one of the following four payment options:  single rate (quarterly);  alternate rate (quarterly);  close company (income-year); or  small business (annual). 36 UNCLASSIFIED Employers are required to file FBT returns quarterly, unless they are eligible to use 171. an income-year or annual method and elect to file on that basis. The option chosen will determine the rate of FBT that is applied to the value of the motor vehicle fringe benefit. Employers need to carefully consider which option best suits their particular 172. circumstances. Inland Revenue’s Fringe Benefit Tax Guide (IR409) explains that in deciding which rates to use, an employer should consider:  The additional time and possible set-up costs to complete the alternative rate calculations.  The impact of non-attributed benefits (if an employer provides a number of non-attributed benefits they should consider using the alternative rate calculation).  The amount the employees earn annually. The Guide suggests that an employer should consider using the single rate or the short form alternative rate for employees who earn over $70,000; or the full alternative rate calculation for employees who earn less than $70,000. These factors will be explained in more detail in the following paragraphs. 173. Single rate option Employers using the single rate option must pay FBT quarterly at the rate of 174. 49.25% of the value of the fringe benefit (s RD 58(1)). This is the highest FBT rate. The single rate option is the most administratively easy option, but it can result in 175. overpayment if employees earn less than $70,000 a year. (The rate of 49.25% is a “gross-up” of the top personal marginal tax rate of 33%.) Employers using this option may ask the Commissioner to replace their FBT liability 176. for the final quarter with an amount calculated using the alternative rate option \[see from \[179\]\]. The employer then has two months to provide the Commissioner with the necessary information to support the new FBT calculations for that quarter (s 46E of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA)). An employer selects this option when they file a return (IR 420) using the relevant 177. rate (s 46B of the TAA). The return due dates and payment due dates for quarterly options are 20 July, 20 October, 20 January and 31 May. Employers using the single rate option cannot change options once the return has 178. been filed (s RD 62(1)). Alternative rate option The alternative rate option is also a quarterly method. Employers who elect to use 179. the alternative rate option must pay FBT for the first three quarters at either 43% or 49.25% of the value of the fringe benefit (s RD 59(2)). For the final quarter of the tax year, FBT is calculated differently, depending on 180. whether the fringe benefit is an attributed benefit or a non-attributed benefit. (For the meaning of “attributed benefit” and non-attributed benefit”, see from \[186\].) The calculations are in ss RD 50 (for attributed benefits) and RD 53 (for non-181. attributed benefits) and are undertaken for the tax year. The FBT payable for the previous three quarters is then deducted from this amount (s RD 59(4)). Under the “short-form” alternative rate option, FBT is calculated at 49.25% on the 182. value of the attributed benefits (s RD 50(5)). FBT for non-attributed benefits is 37 UNCLASSIFIED calculated at a rate of 42.86%, or 49.25% for an employee who is also a major shareholder (s RD 53(4)). This is a good option if the relevant employees earn less than $70,000 or if there are a number of non-attributed benefits. Under the “full” alternative rate method (which applies only for attributed benefits) 183. FBT is calculated using rates based on the marginal tax rate of the relevant employee (see sch 1, part C) less tax on cash pay (ie, cash paid to an employee during the year, excluding fringe benefits) (s RD 50(3)(b)). FBT paid in the previous three quarters for that employee is then subtracted from that amount (s RD 59(4)). As with the “short-form” alternative rate option, this is a good option if the relevant employees earn less than $70,000. However, this option can get complicated as it requires a separate calculation to be undertaken for each employee. To assist with these calculations, an alternative rate calculator is provided on Inland Revenue website: http://www.ird.govt.nz/calculators/tool- name/tools-f/calculator-fbt-multi-rate.html An employer selects this option when they file a return (IR 420) using the relevant 184. rate (s 46B of the TAA). The return due dates and payment due dates are the same as for the single rate option (see \[177\]). Employers using the alternative rate option cannot change options once the return 185. has been filed (s RD 62(1)). Meaning of attributed and non-attributed benefits For the purposes of the alternative rate option, an employer must attribute the 186. motor vehicle fringe benefit to the individual employee who receives the benefit (s RD 47(2)). This allows the employer to calculate FBT using rates based on the employee’s marginal tax rate. If the motor vehicle fringe benefit has been provided to more than one employee, 187. then the employer must attribute the benefit to the employee who mainly used or received the motor vehicle fringe benefit in the relevant period. If the employer cannot determine which employee mainly received the benefit, then the benefit is a non-attributed benefit and must be pooled (ss RD 48 and RD 53). This means the employer must group the value of the benefits into two pools:  The first pool is for an employee who is a major shareholder or a person associated with an employee who is a major shareholder.  The second pool is for all other employees. FBT is then calculated for the final quarter of the tax year at a rate of 49.25% for 188. the first pool and 42.86% for the second pool (s RD 53(4)). Close company option – for shareholder-employees “Close company” is defined in s YA 1 to mean a company that has five or fewer 189. natural persons who either hold voting interests or hold market value interests of more than 50% in the company. Under this definition, all associated natural persons are treated as one natural person. Under the close company option, an employer that is a close company can elect to 190. pay FBT on an income year basis (s RD 60). 1 An employer can use this option if it provided a fringe benefit to a shareholder-employee and for the previous year: 1 “Income year” is the year ending on a business’s balance date. This return covers the same period as an end-of-year income tax return. For example, if a business has a 30 September balance date, it would file an FBT return for the year ending 30 September. 38 UNCLASSIFIED  the employer’s gross PAYE and employer’s superannuation contribution tax did not exceed $1,000,000; or  the only fringe benefit provided was a motor vehicle fringe benefit and the benefit was only provided to shareholder-employees and was limited to one or two vehicles; or  the employer did not employ any employees. “Shareholder-employee” is defined in s YA 1 for the purposes of the FBT rules to 191. mean a person who receives or is entitled to receive salary, wages or other income to which s RD 3(2) to (4) (PAYE income payments) applies. Under this option, the employer must pay FBT on the motor vehicle fringe benefit: 192.  at the rate of 49.25% of the taxable value of the fringe benefit; or  by calculating the total pay of each employee under ss RD 50 and RD 53 (see from \[181\]). The benefit of this option is that it permits an employer to defer payment of FBT 193. until the end of the income year. Unlike the first two options discussed, the close company option requires an 194. employer to notify the Commissioner that it will be paying FBT under the close- company option no later than:  the last day of the first quarter of the relevant income year; or  the last day of the quarter in which the employer first started employing employees, if they had not employed employees in the previous year (s RD 60 of the Income Tax Act and s 46C of the TAA). Notifications may be made online using the Inland Revenue’s fringe benefit tax 195. election service: http://www.ird.govt.nz/online-services/service-name/services- f/online-fbt-election-ir414.html Section RD 62 permits employers using this option to change at any time to a 196. quarterly option. If the employer no longer meets the requirements of the close company option it must revert back to either the single rate option or the alternative rate option (s RD 62(2)). The employer’s FBT return (IR 421) and tax payable are due on the employer’s 197. terminal tax date (s 46C(3) of the TAA). Small business option – for employees Under the small business option, an employer may elect to pay their FBT liability on 198. an annual basis (s RD 61(2)). An employer may use this option if it provided a fringe benefit to an employee, and, for the preceding tax year:  the employer’s gross PAYE and employer’s superannuation contribution tax did not exceed $1,000,000; or  the employer did not employ any employees. The calculations are the same as for the close company option, but are undertaken 199. on an annual basis. 2 The benefit of this option is that it permits an employer to defer payment of FBT 200. until the end of the tax year. 2 An annual FBT return covers the tax year from 1 April to 31 March. 39 UNCLASSIFIED The small business option requires an employer to notify the Commissioner that 201. they will be paying FBT under the small business option no later than 30 June in the relevant tax year or the last day of the quarter in which the employer first started employing employees if they had not employed employees in the previous year (s RD 61(2) of the Income Tax Act and s 46C of the TAA). Notifications may be made online using the Inland Revenue’s fringe benefit tax 202. election service: http://www.ird.govt.nz/online-services/service-name/services- f/online-fbt-election-ir414.html As with the close company option, employers using the small business option may 203. change at any time to a quarterly option (see \[196\]). If the employer no longer meets the requirements of the small business option it must revert back to either the single rate option or the alternative rate option (s RD 62(2)). The employer’s FBT return (IR 422) and tax payable are due on 31 May following 204. the end of the relevant tax year (s 46C(4) of the TAA). Calculating a motor vehicle fringe benefit Once an employer has decided which option to use to account for FBT (and 205. therefore which FBT rate to apply), the next step is to calculate the value of the motor vehicle fringe benefit provided. Sections RD 28 to RD 32 explain how to calculate the value of a motor vehicle 206. fringe benefit. Section RD 29 sets out the relevant formulas: RD 29 Private use of motor vehicle: formulas What this section does (1) This section sets out the formulas for calculating the value of the benefit that an employer provides to an employee by making a motor vehicle available for their private use. Quarterly payment (2) If FBT is paid quarterly, the value of the benefit is calculated using the formula— days × schedule 5 amount ÷ 90. FBT filing options for CWL Trevor files CWL’s FBT returns quarterly. Trevor discovers that CWL could elect to use an annual or income-year option instead of paying FBT quarterly. CWL is eligible to use both the close company option (for shareholder-employees) and the small business option (for employees). This is because CWL’s gross amounts of PAYE and employer’s super contributions last year were less than $1,000,000. CWL decides that from 1 April 2017 it will elect to file and pay FBT annually using the close company option for Veri and Chris, and the small business option for CWL’s other employees. This means CWL only needs to file two FBT returns a year rather than four. Trevor uses Inland Revenue’s online fringe benefit tax election service to notify the Commissioner of CWL’s election. 40 UNCLASSIFIED Annual payment (3) If FBT is paid on an annual basis, the value of the benefit is the total of the amounts calculated under subsection (2) for the 4 quarters in the applicable tax year. Payment by income year (4) If FBT is paid on an income year basis, the value of the benefit is calculated using the formula— days × schedule 5 amount ÷ 365. Definition of items in formulas (5) In the formula,— (a) in subsection (2), days refers to the number of days in the quarter on which the vehicle is made available for private use, reduced by the number of days on which the vehicle was a work-related vehicle, or 90, whichever is less: (b) in subsection (4), days refers to the number of days in the income year on which the vehicle is made available for private use, reduced by the number of days on which the vehicle was a work-related vehicle: (c) in subsections (2) and (4), schedule 5 amount refers to the amount calculated under schedule 5 (Fringe benefit values for motor vehicles) as the value of the benefit that would have been received for unlimited private use of the vehicle in that quarter or income year, as applicable. Test period (6) To calculate the value of the benefit, an employer may choose to use a test period under section RD 31 to establish private use. Put simply, the value of a motor vehicle fringe benefit is calculated by multiplying 207. the value of the vehicle (the schedule 5 amount) by:  the number of actual days in the quarter that an employer has made a motor vehicle available to an employee for their private use, less any exempt days or 90, whichever is less; or  the number of actual days in the income year that an employer has made a motor vehicle available to an employee for their private use, less exempt days. This amount is then divided by 90 (for quarterly and annual returns) or 365 (for 208. income year returns) to give the value of the motor vehicle fringe benefit. If an employee makes a payment towards the cost of the benefit, then the value of the benefit is reduced by this amount (see \[243\]). The formulas in s RD 29(1) and (4) have three components: 209.  90 (for quarterly and annual returns) or 365 (for income year returns);  the number of actual days in the quarter that the motor vehicle is made available to the employee for private use minus exempt days, or 90, whichever is less; or the number of actual days in the income year on which the motor vehicle is made available to the employee for private use, less exempt days; and  the schedule 5 amount. Number of days in the return period If an employer pays FBT quarterly, then the number of days in the return period is 210. 90 (s RD 29(2)). If an employer pays FBT annually, then the value of the benefit is calculated using the quarterly calculation for the four quarters of the tax year. If an employer pays FBT on an income year basis, then the number of days in the return period is 365 (s RD 29(4)). 41 UNCLASSIFIED These numbers do not change, even if the actual number of days in the return 211. period exceeds the fixed number (for example, the number of days in a leap year are 366, however the number of days in an income year will still be 365). Number of actual days the motor vehicle is made available to the employee for private use For employers returning FBT quarterly or annually, “days” means the number of 212. actual days in the quarter that the employer made the motor vehicle available to the employee for private use minus exempt days, or 90, whichever is less (s RD 29(5)(a)). Depending on the return period, the number of actual days in the FBT quarter might be 90, 91 or 92 days. For employers filing on an income year basis, “days” means the number of actual 213. days in the income year that the employer made the motor vehicle available to the employee for private use, less exempt days (s RD 29(5)(b)). Depending on whether it is a leap year or not, the actual number of days in the income year could be 365 or 366. The actual number of days may also vary depending on whether the employer has obtained approval from the Commissioner to change their balance date. This could potentially result in a longer or shorter income year. The number of days does not include days where the vehicle was a work-related 214. vehicle. In addition, the number of days does not include days where the vehicle was deemed to be unavailable for private use under the emergency call or business travel exemptions (s CX 6(5)). Therefore, a day is an FBT day where: 215.  a vehicle is made available to an employee for private use on that day; and  there is no exemption available for that day. “Day” is a 24-hour period An FBT day is a 24-hour period rather than a calendar day. An employer may 216. choose the start and end of their “day” for the purposes of the calculation in s RD 29. If an employer does not choose a “day”, then their “day” will be a 24- hour period starting at midnight (s RD 30). If an employer decides to choose the start and end of their “day”, they must choose 217. a starting point for the day that is a whole number of an hour after midnight. For example, 5am rather than 5.30am. The employer also needs to notify the Commissioner of their choice when filing their next return (s RD 30(3)) by writing the start time elected on the return. The “day” will apply from the start of the relevant quarter, income year or tax year 218. for a minimum of two years (s RD 30(5)). The “day” must be applied across all of the employer’s vehicles. If the employer’s circumstances change so that their “day” is no longer relevant to 219. their business, the employer may ask the Commissioner to change their “day” (s RD 30(6)). There is no prescribed form for this – employers can simply request this using the normal channels described in s 14C of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Use of a test period to determine the number of days a vehicle is available for private use An employer may use a test period to establish the number of days a vehicle is 220. made available for private use, rather than recording the actual days when the vehicle was available for private use (ss RD 29(6) and RD 31(1)). 42 UNCLASSIFIED If FBT is paid quarterly or annually, the test period is a quarter. If FBT is paid on 221. an income-year basis, the test period is three consecutive months of an income year (s RD 31(3)). The employer must record when the vehicle was available for use during the relevant period. The results from the test period can then be used to calculate FBT on that vehicle for three years (s RD 31(6)). The employer must choose a test period that fairly represents when the vehicle is 222. likely to be available for use by the employee over the three-year period. The employer is also required to keep a record of the test period, including accurate details of the days in the period on which the vehicle is available for the employee’s private use (s RD 31(4)). The number of days a vehicle is available for an employee’s private use in the test 223. period is the number of days to be used in the calculation in s RD 29(2). It is also the number of days (multiplied by four) to be used in the calculation in s RD 29(4). Provided the test period remains representative, the test period applies for three 224. years (s RD 31(6)). The three-year period starts on the first day of:  the test period, if FBT is paid quarterly;  the tax year in which the test period occurs, if FBT is paid annually; or  the income year in which the test period occurs, if FBT is paid on an income year basis. If the number of days the vehicle is available for private use increases by 20% or 225. more from the test period, then the three-year period will be reduced. The term will end on the last day of the quarter, year or income year, depending on when FBT is paid (s RD 31(7)). If a test period is no longer representative of days available for use, the 226. Commissioner may notify an employer that the test period will end on a particular date (s RD 31(8)). Following notification, the employer must not use that test period result again. The employer could revert to using actual days or they could run another test period. Schedule 5 amount The “schedule 5 amount” in the formulas in s RD 29(2) and (4) (see \[206\]), is an 227. amount calculated under schedule 5. Schedule 5 sets out the options for valuing the motor vehicle fringe benefit. An employer can choose one of two options:  the cost price of the vehicle; or  the tax value of the vehicle. An employer chooses an option by filing a return using that option to calculate the 228. value of the benefit (s RD 28(2)). An employer must use the chosen option from the end of the period of the first return until, the earliest of:  the date of disposal of the vehicle;  the date on which the vehicle ceases to be leased (if a series of leases was entered into, then switching between options can be done only when the last lease expires); or  five years after start of the period of the first return (s RD 28(4)). Following the end of the period, an employer may change options. The two options 229. are discussed in more detail from \[230\]. 43 UNCLASSIFIED Cost price of the vehicle Under the cost price option, the value of the motor vehicle fringe benefit is 230. calculated by reference to the actual cost price of the vehicle to the employer. If the vehicle is leased, then the value of the benefit is calculated by reference to the cost price of the vehicle to its owner at the time the benefit is provided to the employee (sch 5, cl 1). The cost price of a motor vehicle includes costs incurred to ensure the vehicle is in 231. a state where it can be used by the employee. In “Public Ruling BR 09/08: ‘Cost price of the vehicle’ – meaning of the term for fringe benefit tax purposes”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 22, No 1 (September 2010): 3 (BR 09/08), the Commissioner confirmed that cost price includes:  the purchase price of the vehicle;  the cost of initial registration and licence plate fees;  the cost of accessories, components and equipment (other than “business accessories” – see \[233\]) fitted to the vehicle; and  the cost of transporting the motor vehicle to the place where it is first used, including freight, insurance costs and customs duty. BR 09/08 also states (at 3) that the cost price of the vehicle will not include the 232. cost of:  annual vehicle re-licensing fees;  road user charges;  sign-writing the vehicle in the employer’s colours or style (in physical terms, the addition of paint or other graphics such as magnetic signs, decals or transfers);  “business accessories” fitted to the motor vehicle at the time of purchase or any time afterwards (see \[233\]); and  financing the purchase of the vehicle. The terms “business accessories” and “fitted to the vehicle” are also defined in 233. BR 09/08 (at 4):  The term “business accessories” means accessories, components and equipment fitted to the vehicle, required for and relating solely to the business operations for which the vehicle is used, and that are in themselves “depreciable property” for the purposes of the Act. Where powered, they will usually require the vehicle’s power source to operate them (for example, a two-way radio, roof- mounted flashing warning lights, and electronic testing or monitoring equipment).  The term “fitted to the vehicle” means permanently affixed to the vehicle. Permanency would not be negated if the accessory were removed from the vehicle on a temporary basis, for repair or maintenance, or on the removal of the accessory at the time of sale or disposal of the vehicle or the accessory itself. 44 UNCLASSIFIED BR 09/08 considers cost price on a GST-inclusive basis. However, cost price may 234. also be calculated on a GST-exclusive basis (sch 5, cls 9 and 10). If a GST- exclusive cost price is used, an adjustment is required to ensure the cost price is equivalent to the GST-inclusive cost price (sch 5, cl 10). Similar provisions apply for the tax value option. The cost price of the motor vehicle will be treated as being equal to the vehicle’s 235. market value (sch 5, cl 8(c)):  where the vehicle is acquired for no cost;  where the cost price is unable to be established to the satisfaction of the Commissioner by the person who acquires the vehicle; or  if at the time the vehicle was acquired, the cost price to the person who acquired the vehicle is less than the market value because of an arrangement between that person and an associated person, and that arrangement has the purpose of defeating the intent and application of the FBT rules. If a vehicle is owned by an employer (or if it is leased or rented), the cost price of 236. the vehicle will be:  for a quarter, 5% of the GST-inclusive cost price or 5.75% of the GST- exclusive cost price;  for a tax year or income year, 20% of the GST-inclusive cost price or 23% of the GST-exclusive cost price. Tax value of the vehicle A motor vehicle’s tax value is: 237.  the cost price of the vehicle, less the total accumulated depreciation of the vehicle at the start of the FBT period; or  the cost of the vehicle if acquired after the beginning of the tax year. Under the tax value option, the value of the motor vehicle fringe benefit is 238. calculated by reference to the vehicle’s depreciated value as determined under subpart EE, at the start of the tax or income year (sch 5, cl 3(a)). If a vehicle is acquired during the year, the value of the fringe benefit is calculated by reference to the vehicle’s cost price (sch 5, cl 3(b)). The motor vehicle fringe benefit is valued at a higher rate under the tax value 239. option than under the cost price option. This is necessary to produce the same overall tax result, as the rate takes into consideration all the costs, including Cost price of a vehicle CWL has purchased a double-cab ute for Garry to use. When the vehicle is delivered, Chris notices that it has an in-built GPS system but no reversing camera. For safety reasons, CWL decides to get a reversing camera installed. The cost price of the vehicle for FBT purposes will be the total of the purchase price (which includes the in-built GPS system), the cost of purchasing and fitting the reversing camera, and all on-road costs - such as the initial registration costs and licence plate fees. Including these costs brings the GST-inclusive cost of Garry’s ute to $43,000. 45 UNCLASSIFIED depreciation, over the average period the vehicle is held for (five years). This means that the overall FBT liability is higher in earlier years under the tax value option and lower in later years. Under the tax value option, there is a minimum tax value of $8,333 (sch 5, cl 13). 240. This means that when the tax value of a vehicle falls below $8,333, the taxable value of the vehicle must be calculated on $8,333. This amount reflects the ongoing benefits that an employee receives from the provision of the motor vehicle, even when that vehicle has depreciated significantly. If a vehicle is owned by an employer (or if it is leased or rented), the tax value of 241. the vehicle will be:  for a quarter, 9% of the GST-inclusive tax value or 10.35% of the GST- exclusive tax value; and  for a tax year or income year, 36% of the GST-inclusive tax value or 41.40% of the GST-exclusive tax value. Cost price or tax value? Trevor is trying to decide whether CWL should use the cost price or tax value method for Garry’s new ute. Trevor knows that different methods can be used for different vehicles, but once he chooses a method for Garry’s ute, CWL needs to use that method for the next 5 years or until CWL sells the vehicle if that happens sooner. Trevor undertakes both calculations in a spread sheet to see which method gives the best result. Trevor produces the following table using: the GST inclusive cost of Garry’s vehicle of $43,000; the depreciation rate of 30% for motor vehicles; the annual rate of 20% for the cost method; and the annual rate of 36% for the tax value method: Trevor notes that under the cost method, the Schedule 5 amount remains the same over the period the vehicle is owned. The tax value method has higher values in the earlier years, but reduces down to become a lesser constant amount when the tax value of the ute goes below $8,333 (see \[240\]). By looking at the total amounts paid under each of the methods, Trevor sees that by the end of year 5, CWL would pay the same amount of FBT regardless of which method is used. Trevor puts these figures into the following graph to show Chris and Veri. Cost method Tax Value method Cumulative Cost Cumulative tax value 143,000 8,600.00 15,480.00 8,600.00 15,480.00 230,100 8,600.00 10,836.00 17,200.00 26,316.00 321,070 8,600.00 7,585.20 25,800.00 33,901.20 414,749 8,600.00 5,309.64 34,400.00 39,210.84 510,324 8,600.00 3,716.75 43,000.00 42,927.59 68,333 8,600.00 2,999.88 51,600.00 45,927.47 78,333 8,600.00 2,999.88 60,200.00 48,927.35 88,333 8,600.00 2,999.88 68,800.00 51,927.23 98,333 8,600.00 2,999.88 77,400.00 54,927.11 108,333 8,600.00 2,999.88 86,000.00 57,926.99 Annual Schedule 5 amountTax value of vehicle (GST incl) Year 46 UNCLASSIFIED Pooled vehicles If an employer makes a pool of vehicles available to its employees for private use, 242. then the “schedule 5 amount” is calculated as follows:  If the employee mainly uses the same vehicle, then the “schedule 5 amount” will be the value of the vehicle (sch 5, cl 2(a)).  If the employee: o does not mainly use the same vehicle; and o the employer’s business is selling cars; and o the vehicles in the pool are trading stock; then the “schedule 5 amount” will be the average value of all the vehicles in the pool (sch 5, cl 2(b)).  If the employee does not mainly use the same vehicle and the employer is not in the business of selling cars in the circumstances described above, the “schedule 5 amount” will be the highest value of any of the vehicles in the pool (sch 5 cl 2(c)). Employee contributions If an employee makes a payment for receiving the motor vehicle fringe benefit, 243. then the value of that benefit is reduced by the lesser of the value of the benefit and the amount paid (s RD 54(2)). Trevor explains to Chris and Veri that it makes sense for the first 5 years to use the cost method. If CWL retains Garry’s ute for the whole 5 years, the Schedule 5 amount will be essentially the same as under the tax value method. If CWL decides to replace Garry’s ute before the end of 5 years, the Schedule 5 amount will be less under the cost method. If CWL decides to hold onto Garry’s ute for more than 5 years, it will make sense to switch to the tax value method to take advantage of the effect of depreciation. $0 $2,000 $4,000 $6,000 $8,000 $10,000 $12,000 $14,000 $16,000 $18,000 12345678910 Annual Schedule 5 amount YEAR Comparing cost and tax value methods - $43,000 vehicle (GST incl) and depreciation 30% DV Cost method Tax Value method 47 UNCLASSIFIED Motor vehicle is part-owned by the employee or an associate If an employee (or an associate of an employee) part owns a vehicle, then an 244. adjustment must be made to the taxable value of the vehicle (s RD 55). If the employer has valued the motor vehicle on a GST-inclusive basis, then the 245. employer may deduct 2.5% of the employee’s contribution to the cost price of the vehicle (if filing quarterly or annually) or 10% of the employee’s contribution to the cost price of the vehicle (if filing on an income year basis) (s RD 56). If the employer has valued the motor vehicle on a GST-exclusive basis, then: 246.  if FBT is paid quarterly or annually, 2.5 + (2.5 x schedule 5 rate); \[2.875%\]  if FBT is paid on an income year basis, 10 + (10 x schedule 5 rate). \[11.5%\] Sale and buy-back arrangements Specific vehicle valuation rules exist when an employer (or an associate) purchases 247. a vehicle, sells the vehicle and then re-purchases it within two years. For example, Company A and Company B are associated. Company A buys a motor 248. vehicle on 1 July 2015 for $25,000 and sells it to an unrelated party (Company Z) for $23,000 on 1 October 2015. On 1 April 2017 Company B buys the motor vehicle from Company Z for $15,000. The relevant period in this example is 1 April 2015 to 31 March 2017 (sch 5, cl 3(c) explains that the relevant period is the two years immediately before the employer (Company B) most recently acquired the vehicle). As the vehicle was owned by an associated person of Company B during this period, Company B will need to determine the value of the motor vehicle to the employee. The Commissioner considered this arrangement in “QB 10/03: Fringe benefit tax – 249. value of motor vehicle previously owned by the employer or by an associated person of the employer”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 22, No 5 (June 2010): 52 (QB 10/03). QB 10/03 concluded (at \[4\] and \[5\]) that in determining the value of a motor vehicle:  If the cost price option is used, the starting point will be the highest cost price paid for the vehicle by the employer or the associated person on any acquisition. In the above example, this is $25,000, not the $15,000 the vehicle was subsequently purchased for (sch 5, cl 8(b)).  If the tax value option is used, the appropriate starting point is determined by sch 5, cl 4. Applying the FBT rate to the value of the motor vehicle fringe benefit To summarise, the value of the motor vehicle fringe benefit is calculated using the 250. formula in s RD 29: Employee contributions Garry decides to visit his friend in Rotorua. He drives there using his work vehicle. His petrol for this visit costs $120, which he pays for personally. The $120 may be deducted from the value of the motor vehicle fringe benefit. 48 UNCLASSIFIED Value of the benefit =days x Schedule 5 amount÷90 or 365 The final step in calculating FBT on a motor vehicle fringe benefit is to apply the 251. FBT rate to the value of the motor vehicle fringe benefit. FBT liability = value of the benefit x FBT rate Goods and services tax on fringe benefits If an employer is registered for GST they will usually need to account for GST on 252. the taxable value of the fringe benefit and/or any amount the employee has contributed. To the extent an employee has paid an amount for the receipt or enjoyment of that 253. benefit, that amount will be subject to GST (s 8 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985). To the extent the employee has not paid an amount for the receipt or enjoyment of 254. that benefit, the provision of a motor vehicle fringe benefit is deemed to be a supply of goods and services made by the employer in the course or furtherance of their taxable activity under s 21I(1) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. The consideration for the supply is deemed to be the taxable value of the fringe benefit. The time of supply is deemed to be the time the fringe benefit is provided or granted (s 21I(3)). Calculation of FBT on Crossed Wire Ltd’s v ehicles Trevor needs to file CWL’s quarterly FBT return for the quarter to 31 March 2017. 255. The only fringe benefits CWL provides to its employees are the motor vehicles. Therefore, Trevor needs to determine the FBT payable on each of CWL’s four vehicles:  Veri’s luxury vehicle;  Chris’s luxury vehicle;  the office sedan; and  Garry’s double-cab ute. Veri’s luxury vehicle Veri’s vehicle is used wholly for business purposes and private use is prohibited. The vehicle is garaged at CWL’s premises. Veri and her partner have their own vehicle and Veri also has a motorbike, so they do not need to use Veri’s company car for private use. As Veri’s company vehicle is not available for private use, no fringe benefit arises on this vehicle. 49 UNCLASSIFIED “days” for Chris’s vehicle = 90 – 27 = 63 Schedule 5 amount for Chris’s vehicle = $60,000 x 5.75% = $3,450 value of motor vehicle fringe benefit=days x schedule 5 amount ÷ 90 = 63 x $3,450 ÷ 90 = $2,415 Chris’s luxury vehicle Chris has unrestricted use of his vehicle. It is always available for private use. The value of a motor vehicle fringe benefit is calculated as: days x schedule 5 amount ÷ 90 Days “Days” for the quarter ending 31 March 2017 is 90 (this is the actual number of days in the first quarter of 2017) less the number of days for which an exemption applies. The work-related vehicle exemption is not relevant for Chris’s vehicle as it is a “car”. However, the emergency call and business travel exemptions could both apply. On checking the billing records, Trevor sees that Chris made five emergency calls during the quarter. These were all calls made at the request of CWL clients during the weekend. Additionally, Chris was out of town with his car for two days at a conference and a further three days helping CWL clients. Trevor determines that these 10 days qualify for the emergency call or business travel exemptions. In addition, Chris’s vehicle was unavailable for private use for 14 days when it was in the garage being repaired and for three days when he was required to attend a conference in Australia. Schedule 5 amount The cost method is going to be best for Chris’s luxury vehicle – particularly as Chris is likely to replace the vehicle within 5 years. Trevor notes that he can use the GST- inclusive price or the GST-exclusive price. Rather than try and find the original contract, Trevor uses the GST-exclusive amount of $60,000 shown in the fixed assets register. As Trevor is using a GST-exclusive amount, the value of the benefit for the quarter is calculated by multiplying the cost of the vehicle by 5.75%: Value of the fringe benefit This means the value of the benefit for Chris’s vehicle is: Value of the fringe benefit deducted from Chris’s current account As Veri’s vehicle is not available for private use she does not receive a motor vehicle fringe benefit. It is therefore agreed that Chris will pay CWL for the provision of the motor vehicle fringe benefit. This will ensure that they receive equal treatment. 50 UNCLASSIFIED Under s RD 54(2), if an employee pays an amount for receiving a fringe benefit, the value of the benefit is reduced by the lesser of the value of the benefit and the amount paid. Chris pays for the motor vehicle fringe benefit by having CWL deduct the amount from his shareholder current account. This means that the value of the benefit for Chris’s vehicle is $0. From 1 April 2017, CWL has elected to file annually using the small business option (for employees) and the close company option (for shareholder employees). If CWL continues to deduct the value of the motor vehicle fringe benefit from Chris’s current account and CWL pays no other fringe benefits to Chris and Veri, then CWL will need to file a nil close company FBT return. This will be an annual FBT return for the period ending 31 March 2018. days x schedule 5 amount ÷ 90 Schedule 5 amount for the office sedan = $20,000 x 5.75% = $1,150 value of motor vehicle fringe benefit = days x schedule 5 amount ÷ 90 = 10 x $1,150 ÷ 90 = $127.78 Office sedan The office sedan is used wholly for business purposes and private use is prohibited. However, recently Teuila needed to have her car repaired and Veri permitted her to use the office sedan while her car is in the garage. Teuila had private use of the office sedan for 10 days. Therefore, FBT must be paid for those 10 days. The value of a motor vehicle fringe benefit is calculated as: Days “Days” for the quarter ending 31 March 2017 is 10. Schedule 5 amount Trevor uses the GST-exclusive amount recorded in the fixed asset register for the office sedan. The value of the benefit for the quarter is calculated by multiplying the cost of the vehicle by 5.75%: Value of the fringe benefit The value of the benefit for the office sedan is: 51 UNCLASSIFIED FBT liability= Value of benefit x FBT rate = $127.78 x 49.25% = $62.93 Fringe benefit tax liability for this fringe benefit Finally, the value of the benefit is multiplied by the FBT rate (in this case, 49.25%), to give the FBT liability for the office sedan: days x schedule 5 amount ÷ 90 “Days” for Garry’s vehicle = 90 – 52 – 5 = 33 Schedule 5 amount for Garry’s vehicle = $43,000 x 5% = $2,150 value of motor vehicle fringe benefit = days x schedule 5 amount ÷ 90 = 33 x $2,150 ÷ 90 = $788.33 Garry’s double-cab ute Garry’s vehicle is classified as a work-related vehicle. This means FBT is not payable on any day that his vehicle is a work-related vehicle. Garry has permission from CWL Ltd to use the vehicle for private purposes in the weekend. The value of the benefit is calculated as: Days “Days” for the quarter ending 31 March 2017 is 90 (this is the actual number of days in the first quarter of 2017) less the number of days for which an exemption applies. Trevor has recorded that Garry’s vehicle was a work-related vehicle for 52 days in the quarter. Trevor also notes that Garry has been on five emergency calls during weekends in the quarter. Garry also attended a two-day training course out of town. The course took place mid-week, but given the vehicle was already a work-related vehicle on those days, the business travel exemption does not also apply. For the quarter, this means: Schedule 5 amount Garry’s vehicle has a cost price of $40,000 (GST inclusive). In addition to the cost price, Trevor understands he must add to this the cost of purchasing and fitting the reversing camera and the various on-road costs (see \[233\]). This gives a GST-inclusive cost price of $43,000. Value of the fringe benefit The value of the benefit for Garry’s vehicle is: 52 UNCLASSIFIED Evidence required to support a fringe benefit tax return The onus of proof for FBT self-assessments is with the employer. The employer 256. must ensure they have sufficient evidence to support the position taken in their FBT return. The employer must be able to:  identify the relevant motor vehicle (make, model, year of manufacture, registration number);  support the tax value or cost price of each vehicle;  have working papers showing how the days are calculated for each quarter, with supporting documentation for any exempt days (if there are no exempt days in a quarter the employer does not need to keep a record of days);  maintain copies of any private use restrictions;  include working papers showing how the total of any employees’ contributions for each quarter was calculated, with supporting documentation. Inland Revenue’s Fringe Benefit Tax Guide (IR409) contains further details on the 257. evidence required to support an FBT return. There are additional evidential requirements where an employer seeks to rely on a 258. private use restriction or an exemption. These are discussed next. Evidence required to support a private use restriction Employees For motor vehicle fringe benefits, it is presumed the vehicle is made available for 259. private use when an employee has been supplied with a motor vehicle, even if there is a clear business reason for the employee to use the vehicle. In the absence of any conflicting evidence, a clause in an employee’s employment 260. contract prohibiting private use will usually be sufficient evidence of a private use restriction. The Commissioner will also usually accept a letter from the employer to the employee, if the letter clearly prohibits private use of the vehicle. In both situations, the restriction on private use needs to reflect what occurs in practice. If the Commissioner has evidence that the employer knows the employee is using the FBT liability = Value of benefit x FBT rate = $668.33 x 49.25% = $329.15 Employee contributions Any employee contributions must be subtracted from the value of the fringe benefit. As discussed at \[243\], Garry travelled to visit a friend and paid $120 in petrol. This means the $120 must be subtracted from the cost of the value of the fringe benefit ($788.33 - $120 = $668.33). Fringe benefit tax liability for this fringe benefit Finally, the value of the benefit is multiplied by the FBT rate (in this case, 49.25%), to give the FBT liability for Garry’s vehicle: 53 UNCLASSIFIED vehicle privately and takes no steps to enforce the restriction then this might indicate that the employer has given implied permission and the vehicle is available for private use. The onus of proof lies with the employer to demonstrate that any private use restriction is genuine. It is therefore important that employers have a system in place to monitor the private use restriction. If the employer fails to satisfy the Commissioner that the private use restriction is genuine, then FBT will be payable. Inland Revenue’s Fringe Benefit Tax Guide (IR 409) (p 11) contains further details about the checks that employers may want to undertake to ensure that they can satisfy the onus of proof. Shareholder-employees While the private use restriction is no different for shareholder-employees than for 261. other employees, a shareholder-employee has a measure of control over their employer and in a typical New Zealand close company will also be a director. In many cases, when close companies own vehicles, it is necessary for the company to demonstrate that employees (in their capacity as directors of the company) prohibited themselves from using a vehicle in their capacity as shareholder- employees. Case law The TRA has considered the issue of whether a company has made a vehicle 262. available to the company’s shareholder-employees (Case T38 (1997) 18 NZTC 8,255, Case S26 (1994) 17 NZTC 7,182, Case R37 (1994) 16 NZTC 6,208 and Case P26 (1992) 14 NZTC 4,196). In these cases, the employee-shareholders were also the directors of the company. In all four cases, vehicles were garaged overnight at the private residences of the 263. shareholder-employee directors. The Commissioner sought to assess the companies for FBT on the basis that company vehicles were available for the private use of shareholder-employees on an unlimited basis. In each of the cases there was travel to and from the home that was considered travel “on work”. In Case P26, the taxpayer argued that the vehicle was available to the shareholder-264. employee and director of the company for private use on Saturdays and Sundays only. This was because the director worked long hours during the week, implying that the vehicle could not be available for private use when it was being used for business. The TRA found that despite the long hours worked by the director he was able to use the vehicle for private purposes on weekdays and did in fact do so (for example, he used the vehicle to do his weekly supermarket shopping). The director did not have a private vehicle. In Case R37, a husband and wife were shareholder-employees and sole directors of 265. a company. The couple wrote letters to each other prohibiting private use of two vehicles on any day except Saturday. The directors submitted that although Private use restriction CWL ensures that the employment agreements with each staff member prohibit any unauthorised private use of its vehicles. Following the incident with Spencer, Chris and Veri undertake quarterly spot checks to ensure the private use restriction is being followed. Chris and Veri also regularly remind staff by email that CWL’s vehicles are not to be used privately. 54 UNCLASSIFIED private use of the vehicles did occur on other days of the week, on average each vehicle was used privately on just one day per week. The directors did not have a private vehicle. Judge Barber disregarded the letters and concluded that on the facts both vehicles were available for private use at all times. In Case S26, the company was owned by husband and wife shareholder-266. employees. The company owned a vehicle that was garaged overnight at the home of the couple, because there was no secure garaging at the business premises. The couple also owned a private vehicle. It was agreed by the couple that the work vehicle was to be used for business purposes only and was to be unavailable for private use. The husband (in his capacity as director) wrote to his wife (in her capacity as an employee) prohibiting any private use of the vehicle. Judge Barber found that the taxpayers had demonstrated that the vehicle was not available for private use, stating (at 7,187): In my view, a vehicle cannot be available for private use if the employee is not only forbidden to use the vehicle, but does not use it and does not need to use it because of the availability at all times of the employee’s own private vehicle. In Case T38, the company owned two vehicles. One of the vehicles was available 267. for the employee’s private use. However, it was company policy that the second vehicle would not be available for the employee’s private use, although the vehicle was to be stored at the shareholder-employee’s home for security reasons. Judge Willy concluded that the company policy had been faithfully applied in this case, and the vehicle was never used for private purposes. This conclusion was supported by a letter written from the wife (in her capacity as director) to her husband (in his capacity as employee) that prohibited any private use of the vehicle. In summary, the TRA considered the following to be evidence of whether a vehicle 268. has been made available for the private use of a shareholder-employee:  Evidence relating to the company’s intentions as to what the vehicle would be available for (for example, letters from directors or evidence of the anticipated business use).  Evidence concerning the actual use of the vehicle, including log books and taxpayer statements.  Evidence that the shareholder-employees have access to an alternate vehicle for private use. The Commissioner agrees with the evidence requirements set out by the TRA. 269. Although the FBT rules are not concerned with use in the absence of availability, 270. evidence of use is considered evidence of availability when the individual using the vehicle is able to decide its availability in their capacity as a director. This is because the director is the person who determines access and permission. Private use restriction - Veri CWL ensures that Veri’s luxury vehicle is not available for private use by having Chris, as Director of CWL, write a letter to Veri prohibiting her from using any of CWL’s vehicles for private use. The letter also notes that Veri’s luxury vehicle is required to be garaged on CWL’s premises each night and cannot be taken home. The letter also observes that Veri lives in the city, has her own motorbike and private car and does not need another vehicle for private purposes. A copy of this letter is kept on file. 55 UNCLASSIFIED Evidence required to support an exemption claim Employers need to ensure they retain sufficient evidence to support any 271. exemptions claimed. Evidence required to support a work-related vehicle claim To support a work-related vehicle exemption claim, an employer should record or 272. retain:  a description of the vehicle to show that it qualifies for the exemption: o evidence to prove the vehicle is a motor vehicle and not a “car”; and o evidence to prove the vehicle prominently and permanently displays on its exterior the form of identification regularly used by the proprietor in carrying on their undertaking or activity;  the vehicle’s details such as make, model, year of manufacture and registration number;  a copy of the private use restriction, which could be a clause in the employee’s employment contract or a letter from the employer to the employee, explaining that as a condition of their employment, the only private use permitted is: o travel between home and work that is necessary in and a condition of the employee’s employment; and o travel incidental to business use;  records of quarterly checks (undertaken by the employer) to ensure the vehicle has not been used privately outside of the restrictions. The checks could involve, for example, a review of petrol purchases and logbooks;  the employee’s details. For work-related vehicles that are partially exempt (that is, private use of the work-273. related vehicle is permitted on certain days), additional evidence is required:  A copy of the written restriction permitting private use of the work-related vehicle on certain days (that is, in the employee’s employment contract or in a letter from the employer to the employee).  The actual days the vehicle is available for private use must be stated in the restriction (for example, Saturdays, Sundays or statutory holidays). It is not sufficient to simply state the vehicle is available for two days a week. This would mean that the vehicle could be available for private use on any day and FBT would then apply. Evidence required to support an emergency call exemption claim To support an emergency call exemption claim, an employer should record or 274. retain:  the purpose of the call;  details of the services provided;  when the services were performed – what time the employee left home, what time they returned home, the duration of the visit, and why the services had to be provided at that time;  the client’s or customer’s details;  the employee’s details; and 56 UNCLASSIFIED  the vehicle’s details such as make, model, year of manufacture and registration number. If a vehicle satisfies the requirements of the emergency call exemption, then the 275. vehicle is exempt from FBT for the whole of the day on which the vehicle satisfies the requirements. If the vehicle is also available for private use on that day, the availability for private use can be disregarded. Evidence required to support a business travel exemption To support a business travel exemption claim, an employer should record or retain: 276.  the purpose of the travel;  timing details – what time the employee left home and when they returned (that is, proof the travel was for longer than 24 hours);  the number of days the travel satisfied the requirements of the exemption;  the employee’s details; and  the vehicle’s details such as make, model, year of manufacture and registration number. If a vehicle satisfies the requirements of the business travel exemption, then the 277. vehicle is exempt from FBT for the whole of the day on which the vehicle satisfies the requirements. If the vehicle is also available for private use on that day, the availability for private use is disregarded. Motor vehicle expenditure rules Close companies (see \[189\]) who provide motor vehicle fringe benefits to 278. shareholder-employees may elect to apply the motor vehicle expenditure rules in subpart DE rather than the FBT rules (s CX 17(4B)). The amendments have been made to help reduce compliance costs for close companies. This means instead of registering for and paying FBT based on the availability of a vehicle for private use, close companies who provide motor vehicles to shareholder-employees for their private use can deduct motor vehicle expenditure according to actual business use. An election can only be made for motor vehicles acquired after the beginning of the 279. 2017-18 income year or when a motor vehicle is first used as part of the Evidence of exemptions For Garry’s ute, Trevor maintains the required details and the letter provided to Garry restricting his private use of the vehicle to weekends – Saturdays and Sundays only. Trevor will also need to retain evidence of any additional permissions that Chris or Veri have granted to Garry to allow him to use his vehicle for private use on a Friday to transport his radio-controlled sailboats to regattas. For the emergency call exemptions, Trevor records the evidence of these from the client job sheets and the billing system. CWL charges its clients for after- hours call-outs and Trevor uses these records for FBT purposes as well. For the business travel exemptions, Trevor maintains these records from the client job sheets and billing system for travel relating to out-of-town jobs. For travel relating to conferences and other training, details are recorded at the time of the course. 57 UNCLASSIFIED employer’s business after the beginning of the 2017-18 income year. The election only applies to close companies where the only fringe benefit provided is the provision of one or two motor vehicles to shareholder-employees for their private use. Once an election is made, it will continue to apply until the close company stops using the motor vehicle for business use or until it disposes of the motor vehicle.

The compulsory zero-rating of land (CZR) rules treat certain supplies involving land between registered persons as zero-rated supplies. The CZR rules were introduced to assist in combating so-called phoenix schemes and to help streamline GST cash flows. Most transactions between registered persons involving supplies of land or interests in land are captured by the CZR rules. Cash flows from residential tenancies and commercial leases are generally excluded, although some transactions involving assignments or surrenders of leases may be covered by the CZR rules. 2. Under the CZR rules, a vendor who is a registered person must charge GST at the rate of 0% when:  making a supply wholly or partly consisting of land to a purchaser who is a registered person;  the supply is made in the course or furtherance of the vendor’s taxable activity;  the purchaser intends using the goods (including the land) for the purpose of making taxable supplies; and  the purchaser (or a relative of the purchaser) does not intend using the land (or any part of it) as their principal place of residence. 3. When a supply wholly or partly consists of land, the purchaser must notify the vendor of certain information at or before settlement. The vendor uses this information to determine the correct GST treatment of the supply. Special rules exist for resolving situations where a supply involving land is incorrectly zero-rated or standard-rated. 4. When a supply between two registered persons is zero-rated, the vendor does not pay output tax for the supply, and the purchaser cannot claim an input tax deduction for the purchase. 3 IS 17/08 UNCLASSIFIED For example, a GST-registered vendor agrees to sell some land with a warehouse on it to a GST-registered purchaser. Before settlement, the purchaser informs the vendor in writing that they intend using the land and warehouse as their business premises. The notice also confirms the purchaser has no intention of living on the land or in the warehouse. Applying the CZR rules, the supply of the land and warehouse must be zero-rated, so the vendor must charge GST on the supply at 0% and include it as a zero-rated supply in their GST return. This means the vendor will not pay any output tax for the supply, and the purchaser cannot claim an input tax deduction for the purchase. Introduction 5. The CZR rules came into effect on 1 April 2011. The intention of these rules is to improve the efficiency of the GST system and remove the risk to the tax base from phoenix schemes. Phoenix schemes typically involve land being sold between associated entities. The purchaser receives a refund of GST, but the vendor deliberately winds up their entity before paying the GST output tax. 6. This interpretation statement addresses the operation of the CZR rules. The examples (from \[84\]) at the end of the statement illustrate how the CZR rules apply in common situations. The examples along with the flowchart in Appendix 1 are to help taxpayers understand their GST obligations when their supplies involve land. 7. In this interpretation statement, the supplier is usually referred to as the “vendor” and the recipient of the supply is usually referred to as the “purchaser”, even though in practice, the recipient of the supply may be the purchaser’s nominee. A vendor who is a registered person is usually referred to as a “GST-registered vendor” and, similarly, a purchaser (or their nominee) who is a registered person is referred to as a “GST-registered purchaser”. The CZR rules as they relate to nominees are discussed at \[24\] and \[57\]. Analysis What are the CZR rules? 8. Put very simply, the CZR rules require a supply between two registered persons that wholly or partly consists of land to be zero-rated, if at the time of settlement certain requirements are met. 9. When the CZR rules apply, a vendor must include the zero-rated supply in their GST return, but they do not return any output tax for the supply. In turn, the GST- registered purchaser does not claim an input tax deduction for the purchase. 10. The CZR rules effectively streamline the GST cash flows for transactions involving land and, in so doing, are intended to protect the tax base from phoenix schemes. How do the CZR Rules work? 11. Usually, a registered person making a supply in the course or furtherance of their taxable activity charges GST at the prevailing standard rate on the supply (s 8(1)). In some situations, zero-rating rules apply, requiring the supplier to charge GST at the rate of 0% on the supply (s 11). 4 IS 17/08 UNCLASSIFIED 12. The core provision of the CZR rules is s 11(1)(mb). Section 11(1)(mb) provides: (1) A supply of goods that is chargeable with tax under section 8 must be charged at the rate of 0% in the following situations: ... (mb) the supply wholly or partly consists of land, being a supply— (i) made by a registered person to another registered person who acquires the goods with the intention of using them for making taxable supplies; and (ii) that is not a supply of land intended to be used as a principal place of residence of the recipient of the supply or a person associated with them under section 2A(1)(c); or 13. Under ss 8 and 11(1)(mb), a vendor must zero-rate a supply if:  the supply wholly or partly consists of land;  the vendor is GST registered (or either will be GST registered or will be treated as GST registered) at the time of settlement;  the supply is being made by the vendor in the course or furtherance of their taxable activity;  the purchaser is a GST-registered purchaser (or will be GST registered or treated as GST registered) at the time of settlement;  the purchaser acquires the goods (including the land) with the intention of using them (in whole or part) for making taxable supplies; and  none of the land included in the supply is intended to be used as the purchaser’s principal place of residence or the principal place of residence of a relative of the purchaser (see further at \[41\]). 14. If the supply is not made in the course or furtherance of a GST-registered vendor’s taxable activity, for example when a GST-registered vendor sells their private home, the supply is generally outside the GST rules. 15. Where a supply made in the course or furtherance of the vendor’s taxable activity wholly or partly consists of land, and the supply includes the provision of services, the supply of those services is treated as a supply of goods for the purposes of s 11(1)(mb) (see s 5(24)). What information must a purchaser provide to a vendor? 16. Under s 78F(2), whenever a supply wholly or partly consists of land, the purchaser must notify the vendor at or before settlement as to whether the purchaser:  is, or expects to be, a GST-registered person at the time of settlement;  is acquiring the land and any other goods with the intention of using them (wholly or partly) for making taxable supplies; and  intends using the land as a principal place of residence for themselves or a person associated with them under s 2A(1)(c) (that is, a relative). 17. This notice is required whenever a supply wholly or partly consists of land regardless of the vendor’s GST-registration status, because s 78F applies “where a supply wholly or partly consists of land”. In this context notification can take the forms specified in s 14C of the Tax Administration Act 1994, which essentially means notice needs to be given in writing by electronic means or by delivery of a handwritten or printed document. The vendor cannot waive the purchaser’s 5 IS 17/08 UNCLASSIFIED statutory requirement to notify them under s 78F (Y & P NZ Limited v Wang \[2017\] NZCA 280). 18. If the purchaser does not notify the vendor or supplies incorrect information, this will not prevent the CZR rules from applying to zero-rate the supply where, at settlement, the conditions for zero-rating in s 11(1)(mb) were met. This means corrections to the GST treatment of the supply may need to be made (by both the vendor and the purchaser) if a supply is incorrectly standard-rated. (See further at \[62\].) 19. The vendor is entitled to rely on the purchaser’s most recent notice when deciding whether to standard-rate or zero-rate the supply, as appropriate. The vendor’s obligations at settlement are discussed further at \[57\]. How does a purchaser provide the required information to a vendor? 20. In most cases, when a purchaser enters into a transaction with a vendor involving the supply of land, the notice requirements in s 78F are satisfied by the purchaser completing a schedule to the written sale and purchase agreement (for example, Schedule 2 to the standard form agreement for sale and purchase prepared by the Auckland District Law Society and Real Estate Institute of New Zealand). 21. The purchaser is required to notify the vendor at or before settlement (see s 78F(2)). Therefore, in practice, the information provided in the purchaser’s notice to the vendor is usually provided on a prospective basis; that is, on the basis of the purchaser’s best prediction as to their GST status and intentions at settlement. For example, if a purchaser is not registered for GST when they enter into the sale and purchase agreement but intends to register before settlement, they may indicate in their notice to the vendor that they expect to be registered for GST by the settlement date. 22. If, before settlement, a purchaser’s circumstances change so an earlier s 78F notice (eg, the notice provided in Schedule 2 to the sale and purchase agreement) is no longer correct they should notify the vendor in writing of the relevant changes to their circumstances at or before settlement (see Y & P NZ Limited v Wang \[2017\] NZSC 126). This will ensure the purchaser has complied with the requirements of s 78F(2) and will enable the vendor to apply the correct GST treatment to the supply for the parties. 23. A vendor should consider standard-rating a supply involving land if the purchaser fails to notify them in writing about their GST-registration status and their intentions for the land, unless the vendor is confident at settlement the CZR rules will apply to the supply. This ensures the vendor accounts for GST on the appropriate due date rather than having to correct the GST position later. Of course, in so doing, there is a risk a vendor may wrongly decide to standard-rate a supply and corrections will be needed. Therefore, overall, the best approach is for:  the vendor to insist on being notified in writing about the purchaser’s GST- registration status and their intentions for the land at or before settlement; and  the purchaser to provide the correct information in writing to the vendor, and update that information in writing before settlement if their circumstances change. 24. If the purchaser who contracts with the vendor does not intend to receive the goods (including land) themselves, but nominates or intends to nominate a third party to receive the supply, the purchaser may make representations on behalf of 6 IS 17/08 UNCLASSIFIED the nominated person (see s 78F(5)). A vendor cannot rely on a purchaser’s statement where a nomination has occurred, unless the purchaser’s statement is about the nominee’s position. Ultimately, it is the GST-registration status and intentions of the recipient of the supply that must be communicated in writing to the vendor before or at settlement. This same rule applies when the vendor is making the supply to a person acting as agent for an undisclosed principal who is purchasing the land. The notification requirements in s 78F(2) are met in that case if the agent notifies the vendor that the principal as purchaser will meet the requirements of s 11(1)(mb) at settlement (see s 78F(6)). In nominee or undisclosed principal situations, it is important that the notification requirements in s 78F are about the nominee or undisclosed principal’s position. It may be necessary for the s 78F notice to be updated to ensure the vendor has the correct information at settlement. 25. If a supply wholly or partly consisting of land is made by a lender under a power of sale in satisfaction of a debt (see s 5(2)), the purchaser must provide the information required under s 78F to the lender and not the borrower (owner). For example, the information should be provided to the bank under a mortgagee sale. This is because the sale is being undertaken by the lender. (However, for the purposes of determining whether the supply is zero-rated under the CZR rules, s 11(1)(mb) should be applied as if the supply were being made by the borrower (owner) and not by the lender (see s 5(22).) When will a supply wholly or partly consist of land? 26. Knowing whether a supply wholly or partly consists of land is important for determining whether the CZR rules apply to the supply. The term “land” is defined broadly in s 2 for the purposes of the zero-rating of land rules (that is, including for the purposes of ss 11(1)(mb) and 78F). The definition of “land” includes:  an estate or interest in land (for example, a freehold estate in land);  a right that gives rise to an interest in land (for example, a profit à prendre);  an option to acquire land or an estate or interest in land; and  a share in the share capital of a flat-owning or office-owning company, as defined in the Land Transfer Act 1952. 27. The definition of “land” excludes:  mortgages; and  leases of dwellings. 28. Most commercial leases are excluded from the CZR rules by s 11(8D)(b). As a result, most rental payments under commercial leases continue to be standard- rated. However, commercial leases with characteristics making them substitutable for land sales and transactions involving the assignment, surrender or procurement of commercial leases may be subject to the CZR rules if the conditions in s 11(1)(mb) are met (see s 11(8D)(a), (ab) and (c)). What if the land is only part of the supply? 29. A supply consisting wholly or partly of land must be zero-rated when the conditions in s 11(1)(mb) are met; even where the land forms only one part of the supply. This means all the components of a single composite supply must be zero- rated, not only the land component. For example, if land and other assets are sold 7 IS 17/08 UNCLASSIFIED in a single supply, the whole of the supply must be zero-rated when the conditions in s 11(1)(mb) are met for the land component. 30. Where there are multiple supplies within the same contract (compared with one single composite supply), the GST treatment of each of those separate supplies is determined separately. If any of those separate supplies in whole or in part include land, the CZR rules will need to be considered. Therefore, as a first step, before determining whether the CZR rules apply to a land transaction, it is necessary for the vendor to establish what supplies they are making to the purchaser. (For help on establishing what supplies are being made see Interpretation Statement 17/03: Goods and Services Tax - single supply or multiple supplies.) Supplies including a residence 31. There is a special rule for supplies which include a residence. Before s 11(1)(mb) is applied, a supply including a residence might be deemed to be made up of two (or more) separate supplies (see s 5(15)). Section 5(15) provides: 5 Meaning of term supply ... (15) When either of the following supplies are included in a supply, they are deemed to be a separate supply from the supply of any other real property that is included in the supply: (a) a supply of a principal place of residence: (b) a supply referred to in section 14(1)(d). 32. For the purposes of s 5(15)(b) “a supply referred to in section 14(1)(d)” is essentially a sale of a dwelling that has been used exclusively for making supplies of accommodation for five years or more before the date of supply. 14 Exempt supplies (1) The following supplies of goods and services shall be exempt from tax: ... (d) the supply, being a sale, by any registered person in the course or furtherance of any taxable activity of— (i) any dwelling; or (ii) the reversionary interest in the fee simple estate of any leasehold land,— that has been used by the registered person for a period of 5 years or more before the date of the supply exclusively for the making of any supply or supplies referred to in paragraph (c) or paragraph (ca): 33. A supply that includes a principal place of residence or a dwelling that has been rented out by the vendor exclusively for accommodation for at least the preceding five years is deemed to be a separate supply from the supply of any other real property included in the (larger) supply (see s 5(15)). 34. For example, when a farm (which includes the farmer’s house and its surrounding curtilage) is sold, under s 5(15) the supply of the farm house and curtilage is deemed to be a separate supply from the supply of the remainder of the farm. The GST treatment of each supply is then determined separately. Usually, the supply of a farm house and curtilage is not subject to GST on the basis the farm house is the farmer’s private asset (that is, outside the farmer’s taxable activity). (Occasionally, the farmer may have claimed an input tax deduction when they acquired the farm house. In that case, an output tax liability may arise on sale (see s 5(16) and (18).) The GST treatment of the supply of the remainder of the farm must also be established. If the conditions of s 11(1)(mb) are satisfied the supply of the remaining portion of the farm must be zero-rated. 8 IS 17/08 UNCLASSIFIED 35. The Commissioner’s view is as follows:  The phrase “principal place of residence” in s 5(15)(a) refers to a place occupied as a person’s main residence. The plain meaning of the phrase indicates a person may have more than one residence, but at any point in time they can have only one main residence.  The application of s 5(15)(a) is not restricted to a place occupied as the vendor’s main residence. It is possible for a vendor to supply a principal place of residence that is not their own residence (for example, a house that has been lived in by a farm manager).  Section 5(15)(a) is concerned with the supply of a principal place of residence. Therefore, for the purposes of s 5(15) the vendor’s use of the property is determinative rather than the purchaser’s intended use of the property. This is in contrast to how the phrase is used in s 11(1)(mb), which focuses on the purchaser’s (or their relative’s) intended use of the land (see further at \[44\]).  The inquiry in s 5(15)(a) is objective, based on the available information. What conditions need to be satisfied for the CZR rules to apply? 36. As stated earlier, certain conditions need to be satisfied for a supply made in the course or furtherance of a vendor’s taxable activity to be compulsorily zero-rated. Section 11(1)(mb) provides that a supply that wholly or partly consists of land must be zero-rated, if, at settlement date, the following conditions are satisfied:  GST registration: The supply is being made by a GST registered vendor (or a vendor who will be or who will be treated as GST registered) at the time of settlement to a GST-registered purchaser (or a purchaser who will be or who will be treated as GST registered) at the time of settlement.  Intention for using to make taxable supplies: The purchaser acquires the goods (including the land) with the intention of using them (in whole or part) for making taxable supplies.  No intention for using as a principal place of residence: None of the land included in the supply is intended to be used as the purchaser’s principal place of residence or the principal place of residence of a relative of the purchaser (see further at \[44\]). 37. These conditions for compulsory zero-rating are now considered in more detail. GST registration 38. For a supply wholly or partly consisting of land to be compulsorily zero-rated both parties must be registered persons (that is, the supply must be made by a vendor who is a registered person to a purchaser (or their nominee) who is a registered person). 39. A “registered person” is defined in s 2 as a person who is registered or liable to be registered under the Act. Therefore, if the parties to the supply are liable to be GST registered at the time of settlement (and the other conditions for compulsory zero-rating are met), the CZR rules will apply regardless of whether one or both are actually registered for GST at that time. 9 IS 17/08 UNCLASSIFIED Purchaser’s intention for using the goods acquired (including land) 40. The CZR rules require a purchaser who is a registered person to acquire the goods supplied (including land) with the intention of using them for making taxable supplies. For the purposes of applying the CZR rules a purchaser’s registration status is determined as at the date of settlement. In the Commissioner’s view, the requirement for the purchaser to intend using the goods acquired (including land) for making taxable supplies will be satisfied even where the purchaser does not intend using all the goods acquired for making taxable supplies (that is, the goods acquired do not need to be wholly applied to the purchaser’s taxable activity). This is consistent with the GST apportionment rules. Those rules require a purchaser to make an intial GST output tax adjustment where goods to which s 11(1)(mb) applies are acquired but not intended to be used wholly for making taxable supplies and then possible subsequent adjustments if actual use changes from what was intended (see s 20(3J)). This means that even if a purchaser intends using only some of the goods acquired (including land) for making taxable supplies, the CZR rules will still apply to zero-rate the whole supply if the other conditions of s 11(1)(mb) are met. Land not intended to be used as purchaser’s (or their relative’s) principal place of residence 41. A supply consisting of land between parties who are registered persons will not be compulsorily zero-rated if the purchaser intends using the land or any part of it as their principal place of residence or the principal place of residence of a person associated with them under s 2A(1)(c). 42. For the purposes of the CZR rules a person associated with a purchaser under s 2A(1)(c) is a relative of the purchaser. A relative is a person who is connected to the purchaser by:  blood relationship;  marriage, civil union or de facto relationship; or  adoption. 43. Effectively, this means the “principal place of residence" exclusion from the CZR rules is limited to purchasers who are natural persons, because only a natural person can have a principal place of residence or a relative. 44. The phrase “principal place of residence” is used differently in ss 11(1)(mb)(ii) and 5(15) (see \[35\]). In s 11(1)(mb)(ii), it is the purchaser’s intention for the land at the time of settlement that is relevant, rather than the land’s existing use in the hands of the vendor as it is under s 5(15). 45. While a person can have only one principal place of residence for their own occupation at any one time (that is, their main residence), s 11(1)(mb)(ii) also includes the situation where a purchaser acquires land intended to be used as a principal place of residence of a relative. When is a purchaser’s intention determined? 46. To know whether a supply involving land must be compulsorily zero-rated, the vendor needs to know how the purchaser intends to use any goods supplied (including the land). The purchaser’s intention at settlement for the goods (including the land) is relevant for the purposes of s 11(1)(mb)(i) and (ii) (see s 11(8B)). It also forms the basis of the statements made by the purchaser when 10 IS 17/08 UNCLASSIFIED they notify the vendor about their intentions at settlement for the goods (including the land) for the purpose of s 78F(2). 47. Usually the purchaser’s immediate intention for the use of the goods (including the land) once they have acquired them (ie, at settlement) will provide the best indication of how the goods (including the land) will be used for the purposes of s 11(1)(mb). However sometimes, at settlement, a purchaser may have a well- developed overall plan for the use of the goods (including the land) that clearly evidences how they intend to use them. Where that plan provides a fair and reasonable result for the purchaser’s intended use of the goods (including the land), it may be an appropriate indicator of how the goods (including the land) will be used for the purposes of s 11(1)(mb). This interpretation is consistent with the scheme of the Act, in particular with the apportionment rules and the requirement to make an initial adjustment under s 20(3J) based on intended use and possible subsequent adjustments if actual use changes from what was intended (see ss 20(3J) and 21 to 21H). 48. Where s 11(1)(mb) applies to zero rate the supply, s 20(3J) directs the purchaser to make an apportionment adjustment when acquiring a supply of goods and services for making mixed supplies (that is, for making some taxable supplies and some non-taxable supplies). Section 20(3J)(a)(ii) requires the purchaser to apply s 20(3G) to estimate how they intend to use the goods or services at acquisition. 49. Section 20(3G) requires the purchaser to use an approach that leads to a fair and reasonable result:: (3G) In determining the extent to which goods or services are used for making taxable supplies, a person must estimate at the time of acquisition how they intend to use the goods or services, choosing a determination method that provides a fair and reasonable result. The determination is expressed as a percentage of the total use. \[Emphasis added\] When should a purchaser make output tax adjustments for non-taxable use? 50. Purchasers who acquire goods (including land) that have been compulsorily zero- rated under s 11(1)(mb) may need to make output tax adjustments to account for any non-taxable use of the acquired goods. Adjustments may need to be made:  when the goods (including land) are acquired (s 20(3J)(a)); and  in later adjustment periods under the apportionment rules in ss 21 to 21H (s 20(3J)(b)). 51. At the time the compulsorily zero-rated goods are acquired, under s 20(3J)(a) the purchaser must identify the “nominal GST component” that would have been chargeable if the supply of goods had been standard-rated. This is done by adding GST at the standard rate to the agreed consideration for the supply. The purchaser is then required to determine the extent to which they intend to use the goods acquired for making taxable supplies and calculate the proportion of the nominal GST component for any non-taxable use of the goods. The non-taxable use proportion of the nominal GST component is an amount of output tax and must be accounted for by the purchaser in their GST return for the period the supply is attributed to (see s 20(4)). 52. To determine the intended non-taxable use of the goods acquired (including land) the purchaser needs to estimate at the time of acquisition how they intend to use the goods, choosing a determination method that produces a fair and reasonable result (see s 20(3G)). 11 IS 17/08 UNCLASSIFIED 53. Further output or input tax adjustments may be needed under the apportionment rules in subsequent adjustment periods (see ss 21 to 21H). This is done by comparing the intended use of the goods (including land) as determined at the time of acquisition against the actual use of the goods at the end of an adjustment period. Adjustments may not be required where the amounts involved are small (see s 21(2)). 54. Adjustments may be required under s 21E for the concurrent use of land where the purchaser is using the same area of land for making concurrent taxable and non- taxable supplies. What if the parties agree to treat the supply as a supply of a going concern? 55. The parties to a compulsorily zero-rated supply including land can also agree to treat the supply as the supply of a taxable activity as a going concern. This is because s 11(1)(m) (the going concern rule) and s 11(1)(mb) (the CZR rule) can both apply to the same supply. The application of s 11(1)(mb), which is an objective test, does not exclude the application of s 11(1)(m), or vice versa. 56. However, where both s 11(1)(m) and s 11(1)(mb) do apply to the same supply then the GST-registered purchaser may still need to make an output tax adjustment under s 20(3J). This is because a s 20(3J) adjustment needs to be considered whenever s 11(1)(mb) applies to a supply. The application of s 11(1)(m) in that situation does not prevent an adjustment under s 20(3J). What are the vendor’s obligations under the CZR rules? 57. When making a supply wholly or partly consisting of land, the vendor has to determine whether the correct GST treatment of the supply is that it must be zero- rated under s 11(1)(mb). To do this, the vendor must be aware of their own GST- registration status at settlement as well as that of the purchaser (or their nominee). The vendor should be notified by the purchaser (or their nominee) about the recipient of the supply’s registration status and their intentions for the goods (including land) being supplied. The vendor is entitled to rely on the purchaser’s notice to standard-rate or zero-rate the supply, as appropriate (see s 78F(3)). This entitlement is intended to make it easier for the vendor to determine their GST treatment of the supply. If the purchaser’s most recent written notice to the vendor indicates that the conditions in s 11(1)(mb) are or will be met at settlement, the vendor should generally zero-rate the supply. If the notice indicates otherwise, the vendor should generally standard-rate the supply. While the vendor is not required to rely on the purchaser’s notice, in the Commissioner’s view, a vendor should only depart from a purchaser’s s 78F notice if they know at settlement the departure will result in the correct GST treatment being applied to the supply at settlement. The Commissioner considers this situation will not be common because mostly the vendor should be able to rely on the information provided in the purchaser’s notice. 58. If the vendor incorrectly standard-rates or incorrectly zero-rates a supply, corrections to the GST treatment of the supply will need to be made (both by the vendor and the purchaser). (See further at \[78\].) What happens if the purchaser does not provide the required information? 59. If the purchaser refuses to or does not provide the required information about their GST-registration status and their intentions for the goods acquired (including land), it is recommended the vendor standard-rates the transaction, unless the vendor is 12 IS 17/08 UNCLASSIFIED confident at settlement the CZR rules will apply to the supply and that zero-rating is the correct GST treatment of the supply. By standard rating the supply in this situation the vendor ensures that any GST payable for the supply is accounted for by the vendor at the appropriate time. If it is subsequently found that the supply should have been zero-rated, then the GST cash flows can be corrected. What are the vendor’s record-keeping requirements? 60. Under s 75(3B), even where a supply is compulsorily zero-rated, the vendor must keep sufficient records to enable the following details in relation to the supply to be determined:  the name and address of the purchaser;  the GST-registration or tax file number of the purchaser (if known);  a description of the land; and  the consideration paid for the supply. 61. Where the vendor makes the supply to an agent for an undisclosed principal (the purchaser) they must keep sufficient records to be able to ascertain the name, address and GST registration or tax file number of the agent. In turn, the agent needs to keep sufficient records to do the same for the principal (see ss 75(3C) to 75(3E)). What happens if the GST treatment is incorrect? 62. Sometimes, for a variety of reasons, a vendor’s GST treatment of a transaction involving land may be incorrect. For example, a purchaser’s circumstances might change and they fail to notify the vendor of the change before settlement, or a purchaser might enter into an agreement on the basis they will not be GST- registered, but it transpires that, in fact, they will be or should have been GST- registered at or before the settlement date. Sometimes, the Commissioner will back-date a person’s GST registration. The consequences of an incorrect GST treatment depend on whether the mistake is discovered before or after settlement. The general rules for correcting incorrectly rated land transactions are summarised in the table at \[83\]. What happens if either party’s circumstances change? 63. For a supply to be zero-rated, the conditions for zero-rating in s 11(1)(mb) must be satisfied at the time of settlement. However, under the time of supply rules in s 9, often a vendor needs to determine whether the supply is standard-rated or zero- rated before settlement. 64. The vendor’s decision whether to zero-rate the supply is based on their knowledge of their GST-registration status and the information provided in the purchaser’s notice to them. Sometimes after contracting but before settling the transaction, the vendor’s or the purchaser’s plans or GST-registration status may change. In the Commissioner’s view, if the purchaser’s intentions or status changes after they provide the s 78F notice to the vendor, the purchaser (or their nominee) should notify the vendor in writing of any relevant changes before settlement so the vendor may reconsider whether the CZR rules apply. (Often this might also be a contractual requirement in the sale and purchase agreement.) The vendor should also advise the purchaser before settlement of any change in their GST-registration status from that notified in the sale and purchase agreement. 13 IS 17/08 UNCLASSIFIED 65. For example, when the purchaser entered into the sale and purchase agreement they may have notified the vendor that they expected to be GST registered at the time of settlement. The vendor relies on the purchaser’s notice and zero-rates the transaction when the deposit is paid (that is, at the time of supply under s 9(1)). However, after the time of supply but before settlement, the purchaser nominates a third person (the nominee) to settle the transaction. (For CZR purposes, the purchaser or the nominated person (the nominee) must provide the s 78F notice about the nominee’s circumstances (see s 78F(5)).) In this example, this means that an updated s 78F notice is required. The nominee notifies the vendor in writing they will not be a registered person at the time of settlement. The vendor must now standard-rate the supply. Conversely, a situation may arise where the parties become aware that at settlement a transaction should be zero-rated rather than standard-rated. 66. Changes in the GST treatment of a supply can affect the commercial pricing of the transaction. Whether this is the case will depend on the terms of the contract and whether the consideration is stated as being inclusive of GST or “plus GST, if any”. Also for a purchaser, the potential application of s 5(23) should be considered. 67. The time for testing the correct GST treatment of a compulsorily zero-rated supply is at the time of settlement (see s 11(8B)). Where the incorrect GST treatment was applied before settlement (for example, when the invoice was issued), the CZR rules do not require the parties to correct the treatment before the settlement date. However, if the mistake is discovered before settlement, voluntarily correcting the GST treatment prevents the GST treatment being incorrect at settlement and will also reduce any potential imposition of shortfall penalties (although the purchaser may still be liable to pay interest on any GST shortfall if a deposit was paid). How can the vendor correct the GST treatment before settlement? 68. Where the vendor incorrectly accounts for GST before settlement, voluntary corrections may be made to the parties’ tax positions using the credit and debit notes mechanism in s 25. Credit and debit notes are used to adjust the tax payable on supplies in certain situations, including where s 11(1)(mb) is incorrectly applied to the treatment of the supply. A vendor issues a credit note when the tax charged on the tax invoice exceeds the actual tax charged on a supply (that is, when a supply is incorrectly standard-rated). A vendor issues a debit note when the actual tax exceeds the tax charged in the tax invoice for the supply (that is, when a supply is incorrectly zero-rated). 69. Where s 25 applies, and the vendor has accounted for an incorrect amount of output tax, the vendor is required to make an adjustment in the GST taxable period in which it became apparent that the output tax was incorrect. 70. A purchaser must make an adjustment if they have obtained a deduction for an amount of input tax that exceeds the output tax properly charged. The excess is deemed to be tax charged in relation to a taxable supply made by the purchaser. The supply is treated as having been made in the GST taxable period in which the purchaser:  was issued with a credit note relating to the supply; or  received other notice or knowledge that the tax invoice they hold for the supply is incorrect. 14 IS 17/08 UNCLASSIFIED What happens if the supply was incorrectly standard-rated? 71. If, before settlement, it is found that a supply was standard-rated when it should have been zero-rated, the vendor should correct their GST position in accordance with s 25. If the vendor has issued an invoice showing the supply as standard- rated the vendor must issue a credit note to the purchaser for the GST incorrectly charged on the supply (s 25(3)(a)). If the vendor furnished an incorrect return, the vendor should claim an input tax deduction for the GST output tax they incorrectly paid (s 25(2)(b)). Payment of any resulting refund may be withheld pending any review of the transaction by Inland Revenue (s 46). Inland Revenue may amend the vendor’s assessment to ensure correctness. 72. The purchaser must account for output tax for an amount equal to any input tax deduction incorrectly obtained for the supply (s 25(4)). Depending on the underlying reason for the supply being incorrectly standard-rated, the purchaser may be liable for a shortfall penalty. What happens if the supply was incorrectly zero-rated? 73. If, before settlement, a supply is zero-rated when it should have been standard- rated, the vendor should issue a debit notice to the purchaser (s 25(3)(b)) and pay the correct GST output tax for the supply (s 25(2)(a)). If GST-registered, the purchaser may be able to claim a deduction for a proportion of the input tax paid in relation to the supply subject to the ordinary rules. How can the vendor correct the GST treatment after settlement? 74. Sometimes the correct GST treatment of a supply may not be established until after settlement. The consequences of correcting the GST treatment of a supply after settlement are set out below. What happens if the supply was incorrectly standard-rated? 75. When a supply that should have been zero-rated is standard-rated and the GST output tax has been paid, the vendor may correct their treatment for GST purposes in accordance with s 25. 76. This correction is made by the vendor issuing a credit note to the purchaser for the GST incorrectly charged (s 25(3)(a)) and by claiming an input tax deduction for the GST output tax they incorrectly paid (s 25(2)(b)). 77. The purchaser must account for output tax for an amount equal to any input tax deduction incorrectly obtained for the supply (s 25(4)). Depending on the circumstances giving rise to the error the purchaser may be liable for shortfall penalties. What happens if the supply was incorrectly zero-rated? 78. Where a supply is incorrectly treated by the parties as zero-rated instead of standard-rated (for example, the purchaser’s s 78F notice was incorrect and the vendor relied on it) then in that situation s 5(23) applies. Under s 5(23) the purchaser is treated as though they were the vendor, making the purchaser liable for the GST output tax for the supply on the date of settlement. Section 5(23) states: (23) If section 11(1)(mb) is treated as applying to a supply of goods and, after the date on which the relevant transaction is settled, it is found that the provision does not apply, the 15 IS 17/08 UNCLASSIFIED recipient of the supply is treated as if they were a supplier making, on the date of settlement, a supply of those goods that is chargeable with tax under section 8(1). 79. The value of the supply made under s 5(23) is equal to the consideration for the original supply (s 10(7B)). (For GST purposes, the consideration for the original supply is the full purchase price, even if the amount in the sale and purchase agreement is described as being GST inclusive). The supply is treated as being made at the date of settlement. The purchaser must include the GST output tax in their relevant GST return. The purchaser may be liable to pay interest on the unpaid amount along with any applicable shortfall penalties. 80. A purchaser who is treated as a supplier under s 5(23) and who is not GST registered on settlement date is treated as if they were registered at the date of settlement, and they must apply for registration (see s 51B(4)). If they fail to apply, the Commissioner may register them (see s 51(4)(b)). 81. The purchaser cannot claim an input tax deduction for any deemed supply made under s 5(23), unless they are entitled to remain GST registered or they become registered for GST at a later date and use the relevant goods for making taxable supplies (see s 20(4B)). 82. Once GST is accounted for under s 5(23), the purchaser may request that the Commissioner cancel their GST registration (see s 51B(5)). Usually a person cancelling their registration must account for output tax on any goods and services forming part of the assets of a taxable activity carried on by the person (see s 5(3)). However, under s 51B(6), the rule in s 5(3) does not apply, if:  the person seeks cancellation of their registration by the end of the taxable period in which they have accounted for output tax under s 5(23); or  the Commissioner agrees with the person’s application that s 5(3) should not apply. 16 IS 17/08 UNCLASSIFIED Summary of rules for correcting incorrectly rated land transactions 83. The following table summarises the rules for correcting the GST treatment of incorrectly rated land transactions: Treatment of supply BEFORE SETTLEMENT OF TRANSACTION AFTER SETTLEMENT OF TRANSACTION Vendor Purchaser Vendor Purchaser Supply treated as standard– rated when it should have been zero–rated Vendor issues a credit note under s 25(3)(a). If the vendor has furnished an incorrect return, the vendor should claim an input tax deduction for the GST output tax they incorrectly paid (s 25(2)(b) and s 20(3)). If the purchaser has obtained an input tax deduction, the purchaser makes a s 25(4) adjustment in the period they become aware the standard–rated treatment is incorrect. Vendor issues a credit note under s 25(3)(a). If the vendor has furnished an incorrect return, the vendor should claim an input tax deduction for the GST output tax they incorrectly paid (s 25(2)(b) and s 20(3)). If the purchaser has obtained an input tax deduction, the purchaser makes a s 25(4) adjustment in the period they become aware the standard–rated treatment is incorrect. Supply treated as zero–rated when it should have been standard– rated The vendor should issue a debit note (s 25(3)(b)) and pay the GST output tax for the supply (s 25(2)(a)). If the purchaser is not GST registered, no adjustment is necessary. If the purchaser is GST-registered they may be entitled to an input tax deduction, but only to the extent the goods are intended to be used for making taxable supplies. Where s 5(23) applies to the purchaser, the vendor is not required to make any correction. The purchaser is liable for output tax under s 5(23) where the parties have incorrectly treated the supply as zero- rated. The purchaser is not entitled to an input tax deduction for tax paid under s 5(23), unless they are entitled to remain or later become GST- registered, and then only to the extent the goods will be used for making taxable supplies (s20(4B)). 17 IS 17/08 UNCLASSIFIED Examples 84. The following examples illustrate how the CZR rules apply to common transactions involving land. They have been simplified to ensure the CZR principles are the focus of the examples. The examples include some GST inclusive transactions and some “plus GST, if any” transactions. This is to illustrate that different GST outcomes can arise for vendors and purchasers based on the different approaches to pricing. If in doubt, parties should seek professional advice before agreeing the purchase price for a supply. Example 1: Zero-rated supply of land to a purchaser’s nominee 85. Tidy Motors Limited is moving to bigger premises in Wiri and has agreed to sell its existing building to John. John intends to use the building as a place where he can carry on his joinery business. The agreement provides that the consideration for the supply includes any rates and body corporate fees previously paid by Tidy Motors Limited for the premises before settlement date, apportioned between Tidy Motors Limited and John at settlement. 86. When John agrees to purchase the new premises he completes the sale and purchase agreement as an individual. However, before settlement, he decides to nominate his company, Plane Joinery Limited, to be the actual purchaser. Accordingly, before settlement he notifies Tidy Motors Limited of this change and advises Tidy Motors Limited in writing that Plane Joinery Limited is GST registered, that the company intends using the premises for carrying on its business, and, as the purchaser is a company, no part of the premises will be a principal place of residence. 87. Under s 11(1)(mb), the supply of the premises must be zero-rated as the supply wholly or partly consists of land and:  Tidy Motors Limited and Plane Joinery Limited are both GST registered;  the building will be used for the purpose of making taxable supplies; and  it will not be a principal place of residence for the purchaser, Plane Joinery Limited. 88. The sale of the premises is a supply of land and Tidy Motors Limited treats it as a zero-rated supply (including the apportioned rates and body corporate fees). Tidy Motors Limited makes sure sufficient records about the sale are retained to satisfy its record-keeping requirements. Plane Joinery Limited does not claim an input tax deduction because the supply was zero-rated. Example 2: Standard-rated supply of a new house 89. Big Sea Developers Limited is a GST-registered property developer in Papamoa. It is in the business of building and selling new homes and has developed a new subdivision. Sally, a GST-registered hairdresser, loves the seaside lifestyle and agrees to purchase a new house from Big Sea Developers Limited. She intends to live in the house but does not intend working from home. Sally makes sure she notifies Big Sea Developers in writing about how she intends to use the property before settlement date. 90. Sally’s purchase of a new house from Big Sea Developers should be standard-rated for GST. The supply of the house by the developer is a taxable supply because the house forms part of the developer’s taxable activity, so is not an exempt supply. The CZR rules do not apply to zero-rate the supply because, although Sally is GST 18 IS 17/08 UNCLASSIFIED registered, she does not intend using the house to make taxable supplies and she will be using the house as her principal place of residence. Sally will not be entitled to claim a GST input tax deduction for the purchase because she will not be using the house in her taxable activity. Example 3: Standard-rated supply of bare land 91. Stephen, a GST-registered property developer, purchases land in his own name from a GST-registered vendor to build a three-storey building. The lower two levels of the new building will be used as Stephen’s business premises and the top level will be used as a residence for his son. The supply of the bare land will not be zero-rated because at settlement Stephen intends using part of the land as a principal place of residence for his son. Stephen completes Schedule 2 to the sale and purchase agreement ensuring the vendor knows about his intentions for the land before the settlement date. The supply of the land for the residence is not a separate supply under s 5(15) because the vendor is simply supplying bare land and not an exisiting principal place of residence to Stephen. The supply will be standard-rated. 92. Stephen may claim GST input tax deductions but only to the extent the land will be used for making taxable supplies (see ss 20(3) and 20(3C)). 93. If Stephen purchases the bare land through his development company rather than in his own name, the CZR rules would likely apply to zero-rate the supply, as Stephen’s son cannot be a relative of the company. The company cannot intend using part of the land as its principal place of residence. In that case, on acquisition, the company would need to make an output tax adjustment under s 20(3J) for the intended non-taxable use of the land and, subsequently, would need to consider whether any further adjustments are needed at the end of each adjustment period under ss 21 to 21D. Example 4: Supply of land, business and dwelling 94. Dylan owns a garden centre in Levin that he is selling to his neighbour Sharon. The agreement provides for all of the business assets to be transferrred to Sharon, including the garden centre land, the shop, and a small house and garden that Dylan and his family built when they established the business. Dylan has not treated the house and its curtilage as part of his taxable activity. 95. Both Dylan and Sharon are GST registered. Sharon advises Dylan in writing that she intends using the garden centre assets for the purpose of making taxable supplies. Sharon intends carving off some of the garden centre land adjoining her existing house next door to the garden centre to build a private garage. She also plans to convert Dylan’s house into a café, so no one will be living in the house after settlement. 96. Under s 5(15), where a supply includes a principal place of residence, the supply of the principal place of residence is deemed to be a separate supply from the supply of any other real property included in the supply. Accordingly, the supply of Dylan’s home and curtilage needs to be treated separately from the supply of the rest of the garden centre assets for GST purposes. 97. Under s 11(1)(mb), the whole of the remaining supply of garden centre assets (that is, other than the house and curtilage) must be zero-rated as the supply wholly or partly consists of land and:  Dylan and Sharon are both GST registered; 19 IS 17/08 UNCLASSIFIED  Sharon intends using at least some of the garden centre assets for making taxable supplies; and  Sharon does not intend to use the land acquired as a principal place of residence for herself or for any of her relatives. 98. The supply of Dylan’s house and curtilage to Sharon is not subject to GST because they never formed part of his taxable activity. Sharon may claim a second-hand goods input tax deduction for the purchase of Dylan’s house and curtilage because she will be using them in her taxable activity for making taxable supplies (see s 20(3)(a)(ia)). 99. Dylan returns the sale of the garden centre assets (other than his house and curtilage) as a zero-rated supply, and makes sure he keeps sufficient records about the sale to satisfy the record-keeping requirements. 100. Even though Sharon does not intend to use all the garden centre assets for making taxable supplies, the whole remaining supply of the garden centre assets (that is, other than the house and curtilage) must be zero-rated. 101. On acquisition, Sharon estimated (using a method that produces a fair and reasonable result (s 20(3G)) that she intends using 20% of the remaining garden centre land for her private purposes. On that basis, under s 20(3J), she calculated she needed to pay $30,000 output tax. Sharon accounts for the output tax in her return. Sharon then, in the future, needs to consider making further adjustments under the apportionment rules, if her actual use of that land is different from her intended use (s 20(3J)(b)). Example 5: Correcting an incorrectly standard-rated supply before settlement – plus GST, if any 102. Max, a GST-registered vendor, agrees to sell land to Geoff for $500,000 plus GST, if any. Geoff informs Max in writing that he does not expect to be GST registered at the time of settlement and has no intention of using the land for taxable purposes. 103. Before settlement, Max issues a tax invoice on the basis that the supply is standard-rated and GST of $75,000 is chargeable on the supply. The invoice triggers the time of supply, and Max pays $75,000 output tax. 104. Following the time of supply but before settlement, Geoff advises Max again in writing that his circumstances have changed and he will be registered for GST at the time of settlement, will use the land for making taxable supplies, and will not use the land as his or his relative’s principal place of residence. On this basis, the supply should be zero-rated at settlement. The parties want the correct GST position to be achieved before settlement. Therefore, Max issues a credit note to Geoff under s 25 and makes an input tax deduction of $75,000 for the amount of GST output tax already paid (s 20(3)(a)(iii)). (Note: payment of any resulting refund may be withheld pending settlement (s 46) to ensure the correct treatment has been adopted). 105. Settlement occurs and Geoff pays Max $500,000. Geoff’s first return period ends after settlement. Geoff claims no input tax deduction for the supply because it is a zero-rated supply. 20 IS 17/08 UNCLASSIFIED Example 6: Correcting an incorrectly zero-rated supply before settlement – plus GST, if any 106. Tamati, a GST-registered property developer, agrees to sell land to Graeme, who is not registered for GST, for $1 million plus GST, if any. In the sale and purchase agreement, Graeme specified that on settlement he would be registered for GST, would acquire the property with the intention of using it for making taxable supplies, and would not use it as his or his relative’s principal place of residence. Therefore, the parties treat the supply as zero-rated under the CZR rules. 107. Before the date of settlement, Tamati issues an invoice, triggering the time of supply. Since Tamati treats the transaction as zero-rated, he does not pay any GST output tax. 108. Following the time of supply but before settlement, Graeme informs Tamati that his circumstances have changed and that he will not be registered for GST at the date of settlement. As a result, the correct GST treatment of the transaction is to standard-rate the supply. 109. The parties want the correct amount of GST to be paid before settlement. Tamati issues a debit note under s 25 to Graeme showing the GST on the supply and pays GST output tax of $150,000. Graeme pays Tamati the $150,000 of GST but since Graeme is not registered for GST, he claims no input tax deduction for the purchase. Example 7: Correcting an incorrectly zero-rated supply before settlement – GST- inclusive contract 110. Troy, a GST-registered property developer, agrees to sell land to Gary, who is not registered for GST, for the GST-inclusive price of $1 million. In the sale and purchase agreement, Gary advises that on settlement he will be registered for GST, will acquire the property with the intention of using it for making taxable supplies, and will not use it as his or any relative’s principal place of residence. Therefore, the parties treat the supply as zero-rated under the CZR rules. 111. Before the date of settlement, Troy issues an invoice, triggering the time of supply. Since Troy treats the transaction as zero-rated, he does not pay any GST output tax. 112. Following the time of supply but before settlement, Gary informs Troy in writing that his circumstances have changed and that he will not be registered for GST at the date of settlement. As a result, the correct GST treatment of the transaction is to standard-rate the supply. 113. The parties want the correct amount of GST to be paid before settlement. As the parties agreed the purchase price includes GST, Troy issues a debit note under s 25 to Gary showing the GST tax fraction on the supply. Troy pays GST output tax of $130,435. This reduces the purchase price Troy receives for the sale to $869,565 (GST exclusive). Since Gary is not registered for GST, he claims no input tax deduction for the purchase. Example 8: Correcting an incorrectly standard-rated supply after settlement 114. Padma, a GST-registered vendor, agrees to sell land to Brent for $200,000 plus GST, if any. Brent informs Padma in writing that he does not expect to be registered for GST at the time of settlement and does not intend to use the land for taxable purposes. 21 IS 17/08 UNCLASSIFIED 115. Before settlement, Padma issues a tax invoice showing GST of $30,000 for the supply. The invoice triggers the time of supply and Padma pays the output tax. The parties settle the transaction. 116. Shortly after settlement, Brent is investigated by Inland Revenue and it is determined that, in fact, he has been carrying on a taxable activity and should have been GST registered since before he entered in to the sale and purchase agreement with Padma. His GST registration is backdated to before settlement. Since settlement Brent has been using the land for making taxable supplies and not as his (or his relative’s) principal place of residence. This means that at the time of settlement, all conditions in s 11(1)(mb) for zero-rating were actually satisfied, so the supply should have been zero-rated rather than standard-rated. 117. On being advised of the incorrect treatment, Padma issues a credit note under s 25 and claims an input tax deduction for the $30,000 output tax she paid before settlement in the return for the taxable period during which it became apparent that the output tax is incorrect. Padma also makes sure she keeps sufficient records about the sale to satisfy the record-keeping requirements for zero-rated supplies involving land. Since Brent has no input tax deduction, he is not required to make any adjustment when he receives the credit note. Example 9: Correcting an incorrectly zero-rated supply after settlement 118. Isla agrees to acquire land for a GST-inclusive price of $1 million. In the notice provided to the vendor, Isla indicates she is registered for GST, intends using the land for making taxable supplies and will not use the land as her own or any relative’s principal place of residence. On the basis of Isla’s information, the vendor zero-rates the supply. 119. The transaction is settled on 1 March 2016. However, after settlement it is determined Isla should not have been registered for GST at settlement as she was not carrying on taxable activity. As a result, the supply was wrongly treated by the parties as being zero-rated. The notice provided by Isla, and relied on by the vendor, was incorrect. The supply should have been standard-rated. 120. In those circumstances, under s 5(23), Isla is treated as making a supply of the land on 1 March 2016 (the date of settlement) and she is required to account for GST output tax on the supply at the standard rate. Isla is treated as if she is registered at the date of settlement and she must apply for registration under s 51(2) (see s 51B(4)). If Isla does not register herself, under s 51(4) the Commissioner will register her. 121. Isla must include the GST output tax based on the value of the supply in her GST return. In this case the value of the supply is an amount equal to the consideration for the original supply (see \[79\]). For GST purposes, the consideration is $1 million, even if described as a GST-inclusive amount. Therefore the GST output tax Isla must pay is: $1 million × 15% = $150,000 122. Isla is not able to claim an input tax deduction on the payment made under s 5(23) as this is denied by s 20(4B). 123. In the same taxable period in which Isla accounts for the output tax under s 5(23), she does not make any other taxable supplies. Therefore, under s 51B(5) she asks the Commissioner to cancel her registration. The Commissioner confirms that Isla’s 22 IS 17/08 UNCLASSIFIED deregistration relieves her from paying any additional tax on deregistration under s 5(3) (see s 51B(6)(a)). Example 10: Correcting a non-taxable supply after settlement 124. John and Kim have subdivided their lifestyle block into five sections. They are not registered for GST, and have recently just sold their first section privately to their neighbour Grant, who is GST-registered. The parties entered into a standard form sale and purchase agreement. Grant correctly completed the s 78F schedule to the sale and purchase agreement. He notified John and Kim that at settlement his intention was to use the land for making taxable supplies and he did not intend to use the land as his principal place of residence. 125. At settlement no GST was charged on the sale and Grant was preparing to claim a second hand goods deduction for the purchase price when Inland Revenue became aware of the transaction. It became apparent John and Kim should have been GST registered given their subdivision activities. Accordingly, John and Kim were registered with effect from when they began the subdivision activity. As a result, the sale of the section to Grant should have been zero-rated under s 11(1)(mb). This means Grant cannot claim a second hand goods deduction for the purchase.

(4B) A person who is treated under section 5(23) as a supplier of goods under section 11(1)(mb) is denied a deduction under subsection (3) in relation to the supply. However, this subsection does not apply to a person required to account for tax under section 5(23) who is either a registered person or later becomes a registered person and uses the relevant goods for making taxable supplies. 17. Section 25 provides a mechanism for issuing credit and debit notes: 25 Credit and debit notes (1) This section shall apply where, in relation to the supply of goods and services by any registered person,— (a) that supply of goods and services has been cancelled; or (aa) the nature of that supply of goods and services has been fundamentally varied or altered; or (ab) section 11(1)(mb) was incorrectly applied to the treatment of the supply, so that the supply was either zero-rated when it should not have been, or not zero-rated when it should have been; or (b) the previously agreed consideration for that supply of goods and services has been altered, whether due to the offer of a discount or otherwise; or (c) the goods and services or part of those goods and services supplied have been returned to the supplier,— and the supplier has— (d) provided a tax invoice in relation to that supply and as a result of any 1 or more of the above events, the amount shown thereon as tax charged on that supply is incorrect; or (e) furnished a return in relation to the taxable period for which output tax on that supply is attributable and, as a result of any 1 or more of the above events, has accounted for an incorrect amount of output tax on that supply. (2) Where a supplier has accounted for an incorrect amount of output tax as specified in subsection (1)(e), that supplier shall make an adjustment in calculating the tax payable by that supplier in the return for the taxable period during which it has become apparent that the output tax is incorrect, and if— (a) the output tax properly charged in relation to that supply exceeds the output tax actually accounted for by the supplier, the amount of that excess shall be deemed to be tax charged on a taxable supply made by that supplier and be attributable to the taxable period in which the adjustment is to be made, and not attributable to any prior taxable period: (b) the output tax actually accounted for exceeds the output tax properly charged in relation to that supply, that supplier shall make a deduction under section 20(3) of the amount of that excess. (3) Subject to this section, where a tax invoice has been provided as specified in subsection (1)(d), and— (a) the amount shown as tax charged on that tax invoice exceeds the actual tax charged in respect of that supply, the supplier shall provide the recipient with a credit note, containing the following particulars: (i) the words “credit note” in a prominent place: (ii) the name and registration number of the registered person: (iii) the name and address of the recipient: (iv) the date on which the credit note was issued: (v) either— (A) the amount of consideration for that supply contained in the tax invoice referred to above, the correct amount of consideration for the supply, the difference between those 2 amounts, and the tax charged 28 IS 17/08 UNCLASSIFIED in respect of that supply to the extent that it relates to the amount of that difference; or (B) where the tax charged in respect of the supply is the tax fraction of the consideration, the difference referred to above in this subparagraph and a statement that that difference includes a charge in respect of the tax: (vi) \[Repealed\] (vii) a brief explanation of the circumstances giving rise to the issuing of the credit note: (b) the actual tax charged in respect of that supply exceeds the tax charged shown on the tax invoice, the supplier shall provide the recipient with a debit note, containing the following particulars: (i) the words “debit note” in a prominent place: (ii) the name and registration number of the registered person: (iii) the name and address of the recipient: (iv) the date on which the debit note was issued: (v) either— (A) the amount of consideration for that supply contained in the tax invoice referred to above, the correct amount of consideration for the supply, the difference between those 2 amounts, and the tax charged in respect of that supply to the extent that it relates to the amount of that difference; or (B) where the tax charged in respect of the supply is the tax fraction of the consideration, the difference referred to above in this subparagraph and a statement that that difference includes a charge in respect of the tax: (vi) \[Repealed\] (vii) a brief explanation of the circumstances giving rise to the issuing of the debit note: provided that— (c) it shall not be lawful to issue more than 1 credit note or debit note for the amount of the excess: (d) if any registered person claims to have lost the original credit note or debit note, the supplier or recipient, as the case may be, may provide a copy clearly marked “copy only”: (e) a supplier shall not be required to provide a recipient with a credit note pursuant to paragraph (a) in any case where and to the extent that the amount of the excess referred to in that paragraph arises as a result of the recipient taking up a prompt payment discount offered by the supplier and that the terms of the prompt payment discount offer are clearly stated on the face of the tax invoice: (f) in the case of a supply to which subsection (1)(ab) applies, a credit note may not be issued after 7 years from the date of settlement of the transaction relating to the supply. (3A) Where a recipient, being a registered person, creates a document containing the particulars specified in this section and purporting to be a credit note or a debit note in respect of a supply of goods and services made to the recipient by a supplier, being a registered person, that document shall be deemed to be a credit note or, as the case may be, a debit note provided by the supplier under subsection (3) where— (a) the Commissioner has granted prior approval for the issue of such documents by a recipient or class or classes of recipients in relation to the supplies or class or classes of supplies to which the documents relate; and (b) the supplier and the recipient agree that the supplier shall not issue a credit note or, as the case may be, a debit note in respect of any supply to which this subsection applies; and (c) a copy of any such document is provided to the supplier and another copy is retained by the recipient: provided that— 29 IS 17/08 UNCLASSIFIED (d) where a credit note is issued pursuant to this subsection, any credit note issued by the supplier in respect of that supply shall be deemed not to be a credit note for the purposes of this Act: (e) where a debit note is issued pursuant to this subsection, any debit note issued by the supplier in respect of that supply shall be deemed not to be a debit note for the purposes of this Act. (3B) Where the Commissioner is satisfied that there are or will be sufficient records available to establish the particulars of any supply or class of supplies, and that it would be impractical to require that a credit note or a debit note be issued pursuant to this section, the Commissioner may determine that, subject to any conditions that the Commissioner may consider necessary,— (a) any 1 or more of the particulars specified in paragraph (a) or, as the case may be, paragraph (b) of subsection (3) shall not be contained in a credit note or, as the case may be, a debit note; or (b) a credit note or, as the case may be, a debit note is not required to be issued. (3C) Notwithstanding anything in subsection (3) where, in relation to any taxable supplies, or a class or classes of taxable supplies, made by a supplier to a recipient, or a class or classes of recipients,— (a) the supplier has provided, in terms of section 24, 1 or more tax invoices to a recipient in respect of those taxable supplies; and (b) the Commissioner is satisfied that there are or will be sufficient records available to establish the particulars of those taxable supplies to a recipient,— (c) the Commissioner may determine in respect of any recipient, or class or classes of recipients, that, subject to any conditions that the Commissioner may consider necessary, the supplier may issue 1 credit note or debit note to each recipient with respect to those tax invoices. (4) Where any recipient, being a registered person, has been issued with a credit note pursuant to subsection (3)(a), or has been notified, or otherwise knows that any tax invoice which that registered person holds is incorrect as a result of any 1 or more of the events specified in any of paragraphs (a), (aa), (ab), (b), and (c) of subsection (1), and has made a deduction of any amount of input tax in any taxable period in respect of that supply of goods and services to which the credit note or that notice or other knowledge, as the case may be, relates, the amount of the excess referred to in subsection (3)(a) shall be deemed to be tax charged in relation to a taxable supply made by the recipient attributable to the taxable period in which the credit note was issued, or that notice or, as the case may be, other knowledge was received, to the extent that the input tax deducted exceeds the output tax properly charged. (5) Where any recipient, being a registered person, has been issued with a debit note pursuant to subsection (3)(b), and has made a deduction of any amount of input tax in any taxable period in respect of that supply of goods and services to which that debit note relates, the recipient shall make a deduction under section 20(3) of the amount of the excess referred to in subsection (3)(b) in the taxable period in which the debit note is issued, to the extent that the output tax properly charged exceeds the input tax deducted. (6) Where any amount of tax charged is required to be shown on any credit note or debit note, and that amount consists of any number of dollars and cents together with any fraction or part of a cent, that fraction or part of that cent,— (a) if less than or equal to half of that cent, may be disregarded for the purposes of this section: (b) if in excess of half of that cent, shall be deemed for the purposes of this section to be an amount equal to 1 cent. 18. Section 51B(4) to (6) provides: (4) For the purposes of this Act, in relation to a supply to which section 11(1)(mb) applies, a recipient who is treated as a supplier under section 5(23)— (a) is treated as registered from the date of the supply under section 5(23); and (b) must apply under section 51(2) to the Commissioner for registration.

This Interpretation Statement considers the income tax treatment of amounts of money or property transferred to New Zealand resident taxpayers by a person overseas, including through inheritance. It addresses how to determine whether the person who transfers the money or property is a trustee of a trust and when a taxpayer will have derived either beneficiary income or a taxable distribution from a foreign trust. Key terms 2. This item discusses issues using several terms that may be unfamiliar to some readers. The following brief glossary is intended to assist by describing a few of these terms in a general way: Administrators are appointed by the court to administer an estate. Assent describes what occurs at the point of administration of an estate when, either expressly or by implication, personal representatives accept that estate property can be distributed or should be held on trust. Bare trust is a trust where the trustee has no duties to perform (aside from guarding the property) beyond transferring trust property to a beneficiary when required to do so. A bare trust is treated in the same way as a nominee for tax purposes. Beneficiary income is income derived by a trustee but vested in or paid to a beneficiary in the same year or soon after. Civil law countries have legal systems based on Roman civil law or law other than English law. Common law countries are countries where the legal system is based on English law rather than Roman civil law or other law. Corpus is the value (at the time of settlement) of property settled on a trust. Executors are appointed by a testator (a person who makes a will) to carry out the instructions in the will. Foreign trust means a trust that has had no New Zealand resident settlor. Non-discretionary trust is a trust where trustees have no discretion as to various matters for distributions to beneficiaries. Ordering rules are the rules in s HC 16 that specify what various elements of a distribution are to be treated as consisting of and in what order. Personal representatives are executors or administrators. Settlor is someone who transfers value to a trustee. 3 UNCLASSIFIED Taxable distributions are transfers of value to beneficiaries by trustees of foreign and non-complying trusts other than of things listed in s HC 15 (such as beneficiary income and corpus). Trust is not a description of an entity but a description of an obligation on someone to hold property for beneficiaries or objects (as discussed in this item). Trustee income is income derived by a trustee that is not beneficiary income. Summary 3. New Zealand residents are generally liable to income tax on income derived from sources in New Z ealand and worldwide. Their assessable income includes money or property transferred to them by someone offshore as “beneficiary income” or a “taxable distribution from a foreign trust”. 4. Both concepts require that the money or property comes from a “trust” as that term is interpreted for New Zealand tax law purposes. It follows that the person transferring must have held the money or property according to arrangements where the essential features of a trust under New Zealand law are present. The money or property must have been held by the person as trust property with an equitable obligation to deal with it for the benefit of a person or charitable object. Whether such an obligation exists turns on there being circumstances that give rise to something that would be within the concept of a trust were the issue to be decided under New Zealand law. Wherever in the world property is situated, if the legal basis on which it is owned or controlled and the surrounding circumstances are such that there are obligations that New Zealand law would recognise as trust obligations, then there is a trust. This is the case whether the law of another country would recognise the situation as a trust or not and whether the trust law of another country is the same as trust law here or not (see \[27\]–\[29\]). 5. Where a trust exists (unless it is a “bare” trust – see \[188\] to \[195\] below), a distribution from it will be “beneficiary income” if it is current year income derived by trustees but paid to a beneficiary in the income year (or within the extended time period provided by s HC 6(1B)). 6. For an amount that is not beneficiary income to be a “taxable distribution from a foreign trust”, the trust must have had no New Zealand settlor and the transfer must amount to a “taxable distribution”. 7. A transfer to a person as beneficiary of a foreign trust is a taxable distribution (unless it is current year income) if it is not within an exception in s HC 15(4) (such as for corpus and certain capital gains). However, the ordering rules in s HC 16 (see \[131\]) may apply and may override what would normally be the character of components of the distribution based on the terms of the trust or the description given of the distribution by the trust. To apply the ordering rules, good financial records for the trust are required, and the onus will be on the beneficiary to obtain that information. 8. An important exception to the requirement to apply the ordering rules is for distributions from non-discretionary trusts created by will or arising after intestacy (see \[133\]). 4 UNCLASSIFIED 9. Where the money or property transferred to a resident is an inheritance, it may be subject to tax if a foreign trust arises following administration of the deceased’s estate. This is unlikely to be the case (although it is possible) where the deceased was in a country that does not have the concept of a trust as part of its law. Where an inheritance does not come from a trust, there can still be New Zealand tax consequences for income that may be treated as derived by the inheritor from date of death because the law in the country concerned provides for immediate succession on death. 10. For estate administration in countries with legal systems like New Zealand’s, once personal representatives have ascertained the property available for distribution (residue), they either transfer it to beneficiaries or they vest it in someone acting in the capacity of trustee. Until they have assented to such transfer or vesting, the personal representatives have the legal and beneficial interests in the property comprising the estate and any trust provided for in the terms of a will (a testamentary trust) or under the rules governing an intestacy will not arise. 11. Where executors are also sole trustees of a testamentary trust, the residue (or part of it) will vest in themselves following assent and they will hold it on trust and in their capacity as trustees. Where separate trustees are named, the equitable interest in the property vests following assent but executors must do what is necessary to transfer legal title to the trustees. 12. A bare trust may mark the interval between assent and any beneficiary under the will taking legal title. Where a trust following assent is a bare trust, there is effectively no trust for tax purposes. 13. In contrast, testamentary trusts can take the form of express trusts, life interests and minority interests (see \[38\]–\[43\]) and will not be bare trusts. 14. When a trust arises from a deceased estate offshore, as for other foreign trusts outside the context of deceased estates, amounts subsequently distributed to beneficiaries in New Zealand may be beneficiary income or taxable distributions. Such amounts derived by an individual will not have income tax deducted at source and so will not be “reportable income” included as pre-populated income information for the automatically calculated assessments made and included in the individual’s tax return each year. It will need to be included separately as “other income” in the individual’s tax return. Introduction 15. In general terms, under New Zealand’s approach to taxation, residents are taxable on their worldwide income, and non-residents are taxed on New Zealand-sourced income: s BD 1(5). 16. Beneficiary income and taxable distributions from foreign trusts are income of a New Zealand tax resident. Determining whether money or property transferred to a resident is subject to tax as beneficiary income or a taxable distribution is often not simple. It requires consideration of all the circumstances of the transfer to the resident and the possible application of rules (ordering rules) that can override what might appear otherwise to be the nature of the transfer. 5 UNCLASSIFIED 17. Thought should be given to the possibility of income from a trust being derived whenever money or property has been transferred to a New Zealand tax resident by someone who is a non-resident. Trust income can arise wherever in the world the money or property may be situated and in a wide variety of trust arrangements. For example, taxable amounts might be received from a trust established by a relative who has never had any connection to New Zealand, or they might come from a trust settled offshore before a resident migrated to New Zealand. Trust income may arise when it is not immediately obvious that an amount has come from a trust. 18. Sometimes the result can be tax on distributions of assets from the overseas estate of a deceased person to a beneficiary of the estate. It does not necessarily follow from money or property being inherited and received from someone overseas that there is no tax liability. It also makes no difference that something might be described as a “gift” or a “bequest”. 19. Whether an amount is taxable can be difficult to determine and may depend on information that is hard for taxpayers to obtain. The tax treatment of amounts can depend on activity by the trustees since the trust began, and inadequate records of this activity can have the consequence of a distribution being treated as taxable (s HC 15(7) – see \[135\]). Further, the introduction of Common Reporting Standard and Automatic Exchange of Information arrangements means Inland Revenue is likely to have more information than it had in the past about amounts that are transferred to New Zealand tax residents from offshore trusts. The Commissioner, therefore, considers the guidance in this Interpretation Statement will be both useful and timely. 20. Note that this Interpretation Statement is not specifically concerned with trusts that might be affected by the foreign trust registration and disclosure requirements introduced early in 2017 (s 59B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and s HC 26 of the Income Tax Act are the main provisions), which are often referred to as “New Zealand foreign trusts”. They are a subset of foreign trusts that have a non-resident settlor, have at least one New Zealand resident trustee and enjoy an exemption from tax on foreign-sourced trustee income under s HC 2 6. The connection to New Zealand of most of this subset of trusts is simply having trustees here, so few are likely to make distributions to New Zealand residents. However, a distribution by such a trust to a New Zealand resident is covered by the discussion in this Interpretation Statement. Discussion Taxing beneficiary income and taxable distributions 21. This Interpretation Statement concerns the tax rules that apply when a New Zealand tax resident inherits or receives a distribution of money or property from someone overseas. 22. The money or property may be in New Zealand or in another country but if the transfer of money or property is from a trust, a potential tax liability arises for the New Zealand resident. 23. The tax rules applicable are discussed in more detail in Appendix A, but the tax liability will arise because the resident derives income in the form of beneficiary income or a taxable distribution. 6 UNCLASSIFIED 24. Whether amounts are beneficiary income or taxable distributions depends on establishing whether the money or property comes from a trust. Whether an arrangement is a “trust” 25. It will not always be clear that money or property is transferred from a trust. 26. Often, there will be a trust deed and an acknowledgement by the person who transfers property that they are transferring as a trustee. This acknowledgment will usually indicate the existence of a trust and the making of a distribution by a trust. 27. However, there may be circumstances creating doubt that the transfer is from a “trust”. For instance, some countries (such as civil law jurisdictions like France and Germany) do not have the legal concept of a trust. Also, some countries do not have the same laws concerning the establishment and validity of trusts or the administration of estates as we have in New Zealand. 28. Situations like this make it important to understand what is meant by the word “trust”. 29. Where the issue is whether money or property transferred to New Zealand residents by trusts should be treated as income, the starting point will be the application of the trust rules in the tax legislation. These rules apply where a “trust” exists. The question is the interpretation to be given to t he word “trust” in the legislation. 30. For reasons set out in more detail in Appendix A (see \[96\]–\[122\]), it is considered that the word “trust” in tax law has the meaning that it has under New Zealand general law. This meaning is that a trust is not an entity but a description of an equitable obligation the law imposes on a person holding property to deal with that property in a certain way; namely, for the benefit of beneficiaries or a charitable purpose. Circumstances will be found to give rise to a trust only where there is such a person (the trustee(s)), property that can be the subject of the trust, someone (one or more beneficiaries ) for whose benefit the property is held and where the law imposes the required obligation. It is an objective exercise to determine whether a trust exists and a court is likely to take account of the provisions of the Trusts Act 2019 which is intended to align with common law and equity while not being a code. 31. Money or property transferred to a New Zealand resident will, therefore, come from a trust when there exists an arrangement, the true nature of which is that the person transferring had a fiduciary obligation to hold property for the benefit of a person or an object. Whether such an obligation exists, turns on there being circumstances that give rise to something that has the essential features of a trust under New Zealand law; namely that a person (trustee) holds trust property and has an equitable obligation to deal with the property for the benefit of the beneficiaries or for a charitable purpose. Wherever in the world property is situated, if the legal basis on which it is owned or controlled and the surrounding circumstances are such that there are obligations that New Zealand law would recognise as trust obligations, then a trust exists for tax legislation purposes. 7 UNCLASSIFIED 32. Under the laws of countries like Australia, the United Kingdom and Canada, what amounts to a trust is very similar to the position in New Zealand. However, a trust may exist whether the law of another country would recognise the arrangement as a trust or not and whether the trust law of another country is the same as trust law here or not. The law of trusts varies between countries, s o where the circumstances are such that they would give rise to a trust that is valid in another country under that country’s law but that arrangement would not be a trust under New Zealand law, the trust rules will not apply. It is also possible that an arrangement may be considered a trust for New Zealand tax purposes and not be considered a trust under the laws of another country. This may be the case despite the concept of trusts not even being part of the law of such a country, as is the case for civil law countries. Deceased estates – when an inheritance will be a distribution from a trust 33. A New Zealand resident inheriting money or property on the death of someone overseas will often not have a tax liability for having derived beneficiary income or a taxable distribution from a trust. There may be several reasons for this. 34. First, no part of an inheritance may be a distribution from a trust because the administration of the estate does not give rise to a trust that includes the money or property in question. Or, secondly, as discussed from \[175\], money or property often ends up being held on a “bare trust” that will not be recognised as a trust for tax purposes. In that situation, income generated by the property while held on bare trust will be treated as income of the beneficiary, but the transfer of the property itself will not give rise to a tax liability under the trust rules. 35. Further, and even if the inheritance is received from a trust arising in the administration of a deceased estate, it may not be a taxable distribution when the trust rules are applied. Perhaps the ordering rules do not apply or, if they do apply, the ordering rules do not require the distribution to be treated as taxable. 36. However, an express trust may be provided for in a will or contingencies may give rise to a trust in some circumstances. Such a trust arising in the administration of the estate of a deceased person overseas means a possible tax liability for a person receiving a distribution. 37. A trust arising in the administration of an estate is a trust that the trust rules apply to in the same way as any other trust. It follows that when a New Zealand tax resident receives or becomes entitled to money or property from an executor or administrator (personal representative) of a non-resident deceased person’s estate, an important question is whether the personal representative is distributing as a trustee of a trust. 38. Just as when any property is transferred by someone overseas to someone in New Zealand, it is important to identify whether the circumstances are such that the estate property is held on a trust, whether this is a foreign trust and whether the distribution is a taxable distribution or beneficiary income. 39. As to whether the estate is held on trust, that will be when the legal basis on which what is distributed is owned or controlled and the surrounding circumstances are such that there are obligations that New Zealand law would recognise as trust obligations. 8 UNCLASSIFIED 40. In the context of deceased estates, whether a trust exists will turn on the basis on which the personal representatives in question hold the estate and make the distribution. Estate administration laws can determine that basis, so whether circumstances exist that they would give rise to a trust under New Zealand law will depend to some extent on what the estate administration laws of the other country are. 41. In New Zealand, on a person’s death, personal representatives acting in that capacity have the legal and beneficial interest in the estate property and do not hold the estate on trust for heirs. For reasons discussed in Appendix A (see from \[142\]), in New Zealand a trust arise s in the administration of an estate only once the personal representatives have given “assent” in relation to the property. An equitable obligation amounting to a trust, therefore, arises only following assent by the personal representatives to the property in question being held on trust by a trustee or trustees. Such assent can be express or inferred from the circumstances. 42. Even then, unless distributions are from trusts expressly provided for in a will, they may be by personal representatives holding on a “bare trust” (discussed from \[175\]) and will not be taxable distributions for that reason. 43. Common law countries such as Australia, the United Kingdom and Canada are likely to have similar estate administration laws to those in New Zealand. Trusts are, therefore, also not likely to arise until assent of personal representatives where an estate is administered in those countries. In situations such as heirs not being of age or a will providing for a life interest before distribution of property to heirs, where delays in distribution follow assent by personal representatives and property is not held on a bare trust, subsequent transfer to beneficiaries in New Zealand may be a taxable distribution. 44. Uncertainty around when the role of a personal representative becomes the role of a trustee will make the tax law difficult to apply in many situations. When a trust arises depends on the time of assent. That may not be easy to determine because there is no requirement (or general practice) to formally and expressly assent. It will often be a matter of inference from the circumstances. Once assent has occurred, estate property that continues to be held undistributed will be held on trust, with potential tax consequences if the trust is not a bare trust (see from \[180\]). 45. Distributions from estates of residents of civil law countries such as France, Germany and Switzerland are less likely to be from trusts. The general position in such countries is that heirs directly succeed to property on death and have a legal interest from that time. Personal representatives do not distribute anything to heirs that they do not already own. That does not mean the heirs can have no tax liability, they can still have New Zealand tax to pay on any income derived from their share of the estate. For example, interest from loans or rent from rental properties would be derived by the heirs as owners from the date of death. This may raise compliance (plus interest and possible penalty) issues in practice as heirs may not be aware of the details of their income until much later. Also, possible application of double tax agreements and foreign tax credits would be relevant to calculation of the tax liability. However, distributions will not be beneficiary income or taxable distributions from a trust unless the circumstances otherwise give rise to a trust. 46. In summary, a New Zealand tax resident will not derive anything that will be beneficiary income or a taxable distribution from a foreign trust unless: 9 UNCLASSIFIED • for common law countries, administration of an estate has at least reached the stage that personal representatives have assented to the property being held on trust; or • for civil law countries, something has happened to the property before transfer to the resident that New Zealand law would consider gives rise to a trust (f or instance, the property was transferred to someone in another country (a common law country) to hold on trust for the resident in New Zealand - a distribution made direct to the resident would not be a distribution from a trust). Examples 47. The following seven examples help to explain the application of the law. Some of the discussion is based on the analysis covered in Appendix A, which follows the examples. 10 UNCLASSIFIED Example 1: Whether there is a trust – United States “trustee” sends money to New Zealand tax resident 48. Adam is a wealthy United States (US) citizen. Five years ago, he set up a “living trust”, a common estate planning method in the US. He appointed himself trustee, and the trust deed recorded that the trust was revocable during his lifetime but would become irrevocable on his death. Until then, income from the property, if distributed, must be paid to him and nobody else. The property must be held in the trust, but he is able to have it transferred to him if he chooses or to any other person. Further, one provision in the trust deed allows Adam to absolve himself as trustee from any breaches of trust. 49. As trustee, and without breaching the income distribution clause, he sends some money to his son Orson who lives in New Zealand. The money is intended to be used by Orson to set up a business here. Orson wonders if the money is taxable in New Zealand. 50. Orson is a New Zealand tax resident, and there has been a transfer of value to him. However, he would, arguably, not derive a taxable distribution from a foreign trust. This is because the money may not have come from a trust. While Orson’s father’s revocable trust is a valid trust for the purposes of US law (although looked through for US tax purposes), the law of New Zealand would not necessarily recognise it as a valid trust. While Adam is alive, the essential features of a trust under New Zealand law are not present. This is not because the arrangement is “revocable” by Adam. Under New Zealand law, a valid trust can include one that may be brought to an end at any time. Instead, the important consideration on these facts is that, as trustee, Adam can effectively make a final distribution of all property held, he cannot effectively be called to account, and he did not intend to create a trust that would divest himself of the property in his lifetime. 51. The amount Orson received would be treated for New Zealand tax purposes as a gift, from his father in the US, from amounts that would have previously been taxed in the US to his father, if they were taxable there. Nothing in the facts suggests the amount is of an income character and subject to New Zealand tax in Orson’s hands. 11 UNCLASSIFIED Example 2: Whether there is a trust – property held in Switzerland transferred to New Zealand tax resident 52. Carl has lived in Switzerland all his life and has accumulated several properties that he decides to dispose of. One is an apartment in Zurich that he wants to keep in the family, so he transfers it to his brother Roger and they sign an agreement that Roger is responsible for maintaining it and meeting outgoings and can live in it or rent it out in the meantime but would transfer the apartment and any accumulated rental income to Carl’s daughter Ursula when she turns 25. In the event of Ursula dying before she turns 25, Roger is to give the apartment and accumulated rental income to his own children. 53. Ursula moves to New Zealand as a 20-year-old. Five years later (after she has lost her transitional tax resident status), and on the day she turns 25, Roger transfers title in the apartment to her. He received rental income on the apartment for three years, so he deposits that in her bank account in New Zealand. 54. The tax treatment of this for Ursula will depend on whether the arrangement between Carl and Roger has the essential features of a trust under the law of trusts in New Zealand. The full factual details would be needed to decide, but at first sight the obligations that Roger is under appear to be obligations that would be regarded in New Zealand as fiduciary in nature and there would be a trust under New Zealand general law, despite the arrangement being likely to be considered a contract under Swiss law. 55. Assuming the arrangement is a trust for New Zealand tax purposes, the ordering rules in s HC 16 would apply because although it is likely to be a non- discretionary trust, it was not created by will or on intestacy. Roger has kept very good records of his time owning the apartment, so the ordering rules would treat any current year rental income as beneficiary income (because it is income derived by the trustee and paid to Ursula), the apartment itself as corpus or capital gains (and so excluded by s HC 15(4) from being a taxable distribution) and the accumulated rental income as a taxable distribution (being income Roger, as trustee, derived in earlier income years). 56. Tax credits are potentially available for tax paid by Roger (if paid by deduction ie at source and not if paid by Roger as legal owner) in Switzerland to reduce Ursula’s tax liability on current year income. Art 22(1) of the double tax agreement (DTA) with Switzerland would seem to permit a credit for Swiss tax paid by deduction or by Ursula against New Zealand tax payable on the rental income distributed as beneficiary income or derived after title is transferred to her. The mechanism is via the domestic provisions such as ss LJ 1 and LJ 2. There is however no express recognition of fiscally transparent vehicles in the DTA with Switzerland so if Roger was assessed for Swiss tax then arguably it would not be treated as Ursula’s tax liability under that DTA. 57. No tax credits would be available for tax paid on Roger’s accumulation of rental income for previous years as a trustee. This would be treated as a taxable distribution if distributed in a lump sum to Ursula after her transitional resident status had ended. Under s LJ 6 only any tax equivalent to Non-R esident Withholding Tax deducted in Switzerland from a taxable distribution would be available as a credit in New Zealand. 12 UNCLASSIFIED 58. If the arrangement is not a trust, the transfer of the apartment and any rental income accumulated by Roger before Ursula turned 25 would likely not be treated as income in New Zealand. These two items would essentially be treated in the same manner as gifts. Because the facts do not suggest Roger is an agent for Ursula at any stage, current year rental income derived before Ursula was 25 would also not be taxable in New Zealand. Example 3: Ordering rules 59. In 2008, Charles, a celebrity chef, and Joanna, a successful banker, in the City of London, settle an investment portfolio and a house in the Cotswolds on a trust for their two children, Mary and Elizabeth. 60. In 2010, Mary moves to Australia. In 2012, Elizabeth moves to New Zealand, becoming resident here. Using the discretion given in the trust deed for the trust, in 2018 the trustees transfer the portfolio and accumulated income to Mary in Australia and the house to Elizabeth in New Zealand. 61. Although it is a discretionary trust, the trust is not a testamentary trust or created on intestacy so the tax treatment of the distribution for Elizabeth in New Zealand is going to depend on the application of the ordering rules in s HC 16. This means that Elizabeth will not be able to treat the distribution of the house to her as all being corpus and capital gains but must take account of the components of the investment portfolio. A proportion of the accumulated income in the portfolio would need to be treated under s HC 16(2) as income that the trustee derived and would be a taxable distribution under s HC 15(4). 62. For how the proportion should be calculated, see examples 21–23 and associated commentary in Interpretation Statement IS 18/01: Taxation of Trusts – Income Tax (IS 18/01, Inland Revenue 2018). Example 4: Overseas will trusts 63. David moved to New Zealand from Australia with his mother when he was 12. His parents had separated, and David was their only child. David’s father Joe was killed in a mining accident when David was 18. Joe’s will left David a specific legacy of a sum of money and a direction that a trust be created with the balance of his residuary estate (mostly comprising commercial properties in Perth) to be held by the trustee, accumulating rents and reinvesting until David turned 21. 64. David has now turned 21, and the trustee has sold the properties and sent everything to David in New Zealand. 65. Assuming the law of administration of estates in Australia not to be materially different to the law in New Zealand, the only tax implications for David when he receives the specific legacy will arise from the fact that the money in question effectively moved from Joe to David at the time of Joe’s death (under the “relation back” principle). If Joe invested the money in Australia before sending it to David, income may have been derived that would be taxable to David in New Zealand. If not, it could be argued a bare trust briefly existed with the executors’ assent inferred. However, the transfer of the specific legacy will not be recognised as a trust distribution for New Zealand tax purposes. 13 UNCLASSIFIED 66. The distribution from the testamentary trust created from the residuary estate, on the other hand, is likely to have tax implications for David under the trust rules. Current year investment income of the trustee distributed to David will be beneficiary income. The trust will be a foreign trust because Joe has never lived in New Zealand and he is the only person who has ever settled anything on the trust. The ordering rules in s HC 16 do not apply, assuming the trust meets the requirements to be a non-d iscretionary trust. Therefore, the income treatment will be determined by the relevant deed or the trustees’ determination. Accumulated rental and investment returns will be a taxable distribution, but the proceeds of sale of the properties will not, being excluded under s HC 15(4) as either corpus or capital gains. Example 5: Deceased in a civil law country 67. Thomas has lived in Germany for most of his life. His only son Joseph moved to New Zealand in 2005. When his wife died in 2010, Thomas made a will leaving all his property to Joseph. 68. When Thomas passes away in 2016, Joseph travels to Germany and discusses Thomas’s estate with the executor, Erich, a professional financial advisor in Berlin. Erich suggests it would be consistent with Thomas’s wishes that Joseph does not take the inheritance to New Zealand straight away but keeps it overseas. Erich’s advice is to appoint a company in the Cayman Islands to hold the estate on trust for Joseph’s family until the trustee determines they need it. 69. Circumstances change and five years later Joseph’s family is now short of money. The trust is wound up and everything is distributed to Joseph and his wife. 70. The tax effects of this for Joseph and his wife are very likely to be that they have derived beneficiary income and taxable distributions. Joseph may also not have been aware that, as a New Zealand resident settlor, he had an obligation to meet the trustee company’s New Zealand tax obligations on trustee income (s HC 25) and to disclose under s 59(1) of the TAA the particulars of the trust. Further, amounts distributed that are taxable distributions will not be from a foreign trust, instead they are likely to be from a non-complying trust, meaning a greater tax liability for them. Although Joseph inherited the estate from a deceased person in Germany, a civil law country without trusts and where Joseph directly succeeded to the estate on Thomas’s death, Joseph then settled on the Cayman Islands trust assets that had vested in him before the settlement. Joseph is a New Zealand tax resident, so the trust would be a non- complying trust and not a foreign trust (although an election to be a complying trust may be possible – see \[8.33\] of IS 18/01 and proposed amendments to s HC 33 in the Taxation (Kiwisaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Bill 2019). The same outcomes could be expected if Joseph had inherited the estate from a deceased person from a common law country. Example 6: Non-discretionary will trust 71. Cindy moves to New Zealand in 2005 from Canada. Her parents die in a car accident in 2012 leaving wills under which their executors are instructed to establish a non-discretionary trust to hold their estate for their seven children, six of whom have remained living in Canada. 14 UNCLASSIFIED 72. In 2018, Cindy receives a substantial payment from the trustees following the sale of some Canadian shares that were part of the estate at the time of her parents’ death. The trustees sign a formal resolution to the effect that the proceeds of sale should be distributed to the beneficiaries. 73. Because it is a non-discretionary will trust, the ordering rules in s HC 16 do not apply, and the trustee resolution will determine the tax effect for Cindy. This means there is no taxable distribution to Cindy because the proceeds will be both corpus of the trusts established under the parents’ wills and profits from realisation of capital assets (assuming the shares had increased in value since they were settled on the trusts). Example 7: Discretionary will trust – ordering rules and the importance of records 74. As in Example 6, Cindy’s parents die and leave wills, but this time the executors are instructed to establish discretionary trusts. 75. In 2018, Cindy asks the trustees for funds to support her daughter who is about to go to university. The trustees decide to sell some of the Canadian shares and distribute the proceeds to Cindy. They sign a formal resolution to this effect. 76. In this case, the result of the application of the ordering rules in s HC 16(2) may be that Cindy has received a taxable distribution. For this not to be the case, the records of the trust would need to show that there had been no income derived by the trustees in the current or earlier years that had not been distributed to beneficiaries earlier or at the same time. This is despite the distribution by the trustees being intended to be of corpus and capital gains. 77. Further, if Cindy cannot obtain adequate records to be able to determine the elements of the distribution under s HC 16(2), s HC 15(7) will apply to treat the entire distribution to her as a taxable distribution from a foreign trust. 15 UNCLASSIFIED Appendix A – Detailed analysis of applicable tax rules for distributions from foreign trusts 78. This appendix contains detailed analysis about the tax rules that apply when a New Zealand tax resident inherits or receives a distribution of money or property from someone overseas. A tax liability will arise because the resident derives income in the form of beneficiary income or a taxable distribution. Whether amounts are beneficiary income or taxable distributions depends on establishing whether the money or property comes from a trust. 79. All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 (the Act) unless otherwise stated. Relevant legislative provisions are reproduced in Appendix B. Tax for New Zealand residents generally 80. This Interpretation Statement is concerned with the tax rules that apply to a New Zealand tax resident. The Commissioner’s views on the test for whether somebody is tax resident in New Zealand are set out in Interpretation Statement IS 16/03: Tax Residence ( IS 16/03, Inland Revenue, 2016). 81. A tax resident of New Zealand is generally liable to income tax in New Zealand on income derived from sources in New Zealand and worldwide. An exception exists for exempt income and excluded income (although excluded income can be taxable under other provisions such as taxable distributions from non-complying trusts: s BF 1(b)). However, for a New Zealand tax resident, if an amount is income, it will not generally make a difference to taxability that it comes from overseas. 82. Further, an amount may be income derived by a New Zealand resident regardless of whether the amount itself ever comes to New Zealand. 83. This principle of taxing the worldwide income of New Zealand tax residents includes income from trusts established overseas. Taxation of income from trusts – overview 84. The laws dealing with trust taxation (referred to here, for convenience, as the trust rules) generally tax amounts derived through trusts as “trustee income” (taxable to trustees) as “beneficiary income” or as “taxable distributions”. 85. Trustee income is income derived by trustees that is not beneficiary income. Whether an amount derived by a trustee is trustee income or beneficiary income depends (broadly speaking) on whether the amount is income retained by the trustees (trustee income) or income transferred to beneficiaries soon after being derived (beneficiary income). 86. New Zealand tax residents (other than “transitional residents”) are taxable on beneficiary income from all trusts, whether the trustees derived the income from New Zealand or offshore. For transitional residents, foreign sourced beneficiary income is exempt income, that is, not taxable. 87. The trust rules classify trusts as complying trusts, non-complying trusts or foreign trusts. These classifications are relevant to determining whether distributions of amounts other than beneficiary income are taxable to New Zealand tax residents. 16 UNCLASSIFIED 88. Distributions to beneficiaries of complying trusts, other than of beneficiary income, are not taxable income of a beneficiary. 89. Distributions to beneficiaries of foreign trusts, other than of beneficiary income, corpus (value contributed to the trust fund) or certain capital profits, are called taxable distributions. They are taxable income of the beneficiaries when derived, as is any beneficiary income. These distributions from foreign trusts (both taxable distributions and beneficiary income) are the focus of this Interpretation Statement. 90. In most cases, a trust is a foreign trust where no settlor (that is, anyone contributing value to the trust fund) has been resident in New Zealand at any time since a settlement was first made on the trust. In some circumstances trusts can be complying trusts as well as foreign trusts (such “dual status” trusts, a re discussed from \[8.47\] of IS 18/01) and distributions from such trusts are not treated as taxable distributions. 91. Any trust other than a complying trust or a foreign trust is a non-complying trust. Beneficiary income from non-complying trusts is taxable, and distributions to beneficiaries, other than of beneficiary income and corpus, are also taxable distributions and are taxed at a penalty tax rate of 45%. Distributions from non- complying trusts are not the subject of this Interpretation Statement. 92. With some exceptions (see \[133\]), “ordering rules” override the nominal nature of distributions from foreign and non-complying trusts that would otherwise apply based on the trust deeds or the exercise of the trustees’ discretion. These are discussed in more detail from \[132\], but the ordering rules determine whether a distribution is treated, for tax purposes, as a distribution of income or capital gains of current or previous years or of corpus. They, therefore, determine whether a distribution will be a taxable distribution or not. For instance, the ordering rules mean current income is deemed to be distributed first, then retained income, capital gains and, lastly, corpus. This is regardless of what is stated in the trust minutes or records. 93. If the records of a foreign or non-complying trust do not allow for an accurate determination of the elements of a distribution (that is, current and previous years’ income or capital gains and the corpus), the distribution is treated as being entirely a taxable distribution. 94. A New Zealand resident beneficiary who receives beneficiary income or a taxable distribution from a foreign trust, including in some cases from an overseas estate, is required to complete a disclosure on Inland Revenue form IR307 Schedule of Beneficiary’s Estate or Trust Income for the income year in which they derive the distribution. Taxing beneficiary income and taxable distributions 95. This Interpretation Statement is concerned with money or property that is distributed or transferred to a New Zealand tax resident (other than through a sale or purchase or other transaction where the resident gives something in return). 96. The money or property does not have to be in New Zealand. It can be located offshore, for example in a bank account in the United Kingdom or in the form of a holiday home in Australia. 17 UNCLASSIFIED 97. Sections CV 13, HC 17 and HC 18 make beneficiary income and taxable distributions derived through foreign trusts “income”. 98. Under s CV 13, an amount derived is income if it is beneficiary income or a taxable distribution from a foreign trust: An amount derived by a person is income of the person if it is— (a) beneficiary income to which sections HC 6 (Beneficiary income) and HC 17 (Amounts derived as beneficiary income) apply; or (b) a settlement on trust of property of the kind described in section HC 7(3) (Trustee income); or (c) a taxable distribution from a foreign trust to which section HC 18 (Taxable distributions from foreign trusts) applies. \[Emphasis added\]. 99. Sections HC 17 and HC 18 confirm that beneficiary income and taxable distributions are income in the year they are derived. 100. Money or property, therefore, will not be taxable as beneficiary income or a taxable distribution from a foreign trust (or from a non-complying trust) if it did not come from a trust. For something to come from a trust, it must be established that the transfer is from something that amounts to a “trust” in terms of the use of that word in the Act. Whether an arrangement is a “trust” 101. The word trust is not defined in the Act (other than in a limited definition in relation to superannuation schemes and unit trusts). 102. Section 5(1) of the Interpretation Act 1999 stipulates how statutes are to be interpreted: The meaning of an enactment must be ascertained from its text and in the light of its purpose. 103. The Supreme Court in Commerce Commission v Fonterra Co-operative Group Ltd \[2007\] NZSC 36, \[2007\] 3 NZLR 767 at \[22\] commented on this: \[22\] It is necessary to bear in mind that s 5 of the Interpretation Act 1999 makes text and purpose the key drivers of statutory interpretation. The meaning of an enactment must be ascertained from its text and in the light of its purpose. Even if the meaning of the text may appear plain in isolation of purpose, that meaning should always be cross checked against purpose in order to observe the dual requirements of s 5. In determining purpose the Court must obviously have regard to both the immediate and the general legislative context. Of relevance too may be the social, commercial or other objective of the enactment. 104. In relation to the text, an important thing to consider is the natural and ordinary meaning of “trust”. The Oxford English Dictionary Online (accessed 10 December 2018) gives a few meanings but the only one that seems apt is the “law” meaning: an arrangement whereby a person (a trustee) holds property as its nominal owner for the good of one or more beneficiaries. ▪ A body of trustees. 105. The Trusts Act 2019 (the Trusts Act), which comes into force, for most purposes, from 30 January 2021, has a definition with more depth. This definition is regarded as consistent with the common law as it is currently but is not a codification of it. 18 UNCLASSIFIED 106. Section 12 specifies that, among other things, an “express trust” is a “trust” that must have the characteristics set out in s 14. These are: (a) it is a fiduciary relationship in which a trustee holds or deals with trust property for the benefit of the beneficiaries or for a permitted purpose; and (b) the trustee is accountable for the way the trustee carries out the duties imposed on the trustee by law. 107. To be covered by section 12, an arrangement must be a “trust”, an undefined term in the Trusts Act. Also, a lthough s ection 12 defines an “express trust” , it is only “for the purposes of \[the Trusts Act\]”. The consequence of this is that the provisions in the rest of the Trusts Act will not generally apply to arrangements that do not meet the definition of “express trust”. Therefore, such arrangements may still be trusts if they would be recognised as trusts under law other than the Trusts Act. In ss 5(8) and (9), the Trusts Act makes clear that it does not codify trust law and that common law and equity rules can still apply if they are consistent with the Trusts Act and other enactments don’t require otherwise. 108. For present purposes, the tax laws do not specify that the Trusts Act definition of “express trust” be adopted. This means that although a consideration of the definition of “express trust” is likely to assist with and influence determining what is or is not a “trust” for tax purposes, the meaning to be given to the word “trust” in tax legislation is not limited to the meaning given to “express trust” by the Trusts Act. It is still necessary to consider other possible meanings. 109. Law of Trusts (NZ) (online ed, LexisNexis NZ, accessed 4 June 2019) contains the following definition (at \[1.4\]): A trust has been defined as “an equitable obligation under which a person (‘the Trustee’) having the control of property is bound to deal with that property either: (a) for the benefit of definite persons (of whom the trustee may be one) and any one of whom may enforce that obligation; or (b) for some object or purpose permitted by law.” (Garrow and Kelly’s Law of Trusts and Trustees 7th ed, LexisNexis, Wellington, 2013) at \[1.1\]) Trusts can arise in the following ways (Garrow and Kelly at \[2.5\]) • An express trust A person (the settlor) creates an obligation during his or her lifetime. This is often done by the execution of a deed which names the settlor, trustees and beneficiaries and directs how the trust is to be administered. • An implied or presumed trust The intention to create a trust has not been expressed but is implied or presumed from the circumstances. This includes resulting trusts where property is transferred to trustees for a specific purpose and when the purpose is fulfilled there is a surplus left over. The trustees then hold this surplus for the creator of the trust. • The operation of law For example, constructive trusts, or in the case of an intestacy under the Administration Act 1969. In this case an intention to create a trust is imposed by the Court despite the fact that the person in whom the property is vested at the time had neither expressly nor impliedly undertaken any trust. 19 UNCLASSIFIED 110. Law of Trusts (NZ) also notes (at \[1.5\]) that “For an express trust to be valid the following three certainties must exist”: certainty of intention (to create a trust), certainty of subject matter (“there can be no trust without property”) and certainty as to the object of the trust (it must be clear who is intended to benefit and to what extent). 111. The following are described (at \[1.6\]) as “essential structural elements”: There are four essential structural elements of a trust: (Garrow and Kelly, at \[1.26\]) (1) There must be a trustee. If no trustee has been appointed or the trustee dies, refuses to act or is unable to act, then the Court will appoint someone to fill that office. Section 51 of the Trustee Act 1956 sets out a number of circumstances in which the Court will appoint a new trustee. There are however some circumstances in which a person nominated for the purpose in the trust instrument may appoint new trustees (see s 43). (2) There must be property of a nature capable of being settled on a trust. It can be real or personal but it must be alienable at law. (3) There must be a beneficiary or beneficiaries. A trustee can be a beneficiary, but must not be the only beneficiary. (4) There must be an obligation on the trustee to deal with the property for the benefit of the beneficiaries. The obligation is an equitable one. \[Bold emphasis added\]. 112. It can be noted that these descriptions of the legal concept of a trust appear materially very similar to the definition of “express trust” in the Trusts Act. It could therefore generally be expected that an arrangement that meets the Trusts Act definition of “express trust” would also be a trust for tax purposes while an arrangement that does not have the characteristics listed in s 13 of the Trusts Act would be highly likely not to be a trust for tax purposes. However, while it may reflect the current state of equity and common law on the concept of a trust and therefore influential, it is possible that court decisions in the future may move from the Trusts Act position so it should not be taken as determining whether an arrangement is a trust for tax purposes. 113. NZ Trusts and Asset Planning Guide (online looseleaf ed, CCH New Zealand, accessed 4 June 2019) notes (at \[120–201\]) that whether a trust arises is to be determined objectively: It is not necessary that at the creation of a trust, the settlor or testator should appreciate that their acts or words have the legal consequences inherent in a trust, for it to be valid. The assessment has been held to be an objective one, so that where a transaction objectively appears to be a trust, it will be held to be a trust, even if it is unclear whether the settlor actually intended for there to be a trust, and the settlor’s ignorance of the law of trusts would not necessarily be determinative: Ochi v Trustees Executors Ltd (2009) 2 NZTR ¶19-044 (HC) at \[30\]. \[Emphasis added\]. 114. The position under New Zealand law (generally and under the Trusts Act) is, therefore, that a trust is not an entity but a description of an equitable obligation the law imposes on a person holding property to deal with that property in a certain way; namely, for the benefit of beneficiaries or a charitable purpose. Circumstances will be found to give rise to a trust only where there is such a person (the trustee), property that can be the subject of the trust, someone (a beneficiary) for whose benefit the property is held and where the law imposes the required obligation. It is an objective exercise to determine whether a trust exists. 20 UNCLASSIFIED 115. The legal concept of a trust is consistent with dictionary meanings for present purposes. No other concept would be commonly understood to be a “trust”, in New Zealand at least. Other countries that have the concept of a trust have similar requirements for identifying arrangements as trusts. These circumstances suggest that the legal concept of a trust is likely to be what is intended generally in the trust rules in the Act when the word “trust” appears. 116. These circumstances also suggest that the natural and ordinary meaning of “trust” in the tax legislation is along the lines of what would be held to be a trust under New Zealand law; that is, a trust is not an entity but a description of the obligations and duties on persons who hold property for the benefit of other persons. 117. The trust rules include, relevantly, subpart HC, which contains most of the provisions concerning taxing trusts and distributions from trusts. Section HC 1(1) describes what these provisions do: (1) This subpart, together with the trust rules,— (a) provides for the taxation of distributions from trusts, for this purpose defining— (i) beneficiary income: (ii) a taxable distribution: (b) provides for the taxation of trustee income: (c) classifies trusts into the following 3 categories for the purposes of determining the treatment of distributions that are not beneficiary income: (i) complying trusts: (ii) foreign trusts: (iii) non-complying trusts: (d) determines who is a settlor, and sets out their income tax liability: (e) sets out the treatment of trusts settled by persons becoming resident in New Zealand. 118. In s HC 1(1)(c), trusts are said to be classified into three categories for the purposes of deciding the tax treatment of distributions (that are not of beneficiary income). Section HC 9 classifies a trust at the time of distribution: A trust is classified at the time it makes a distribution as— (a) a complying trust under section HC 10: (b) a foreign trust under section HC 11: (c) a non-complying trust under section HC 12. 119. There is no fourth category of “trust” that is not a complying, non-complying or foreign trust (other than “dual status” trusts mentioned above at \[ 89\] and discussed in \[8.14\] to \[8.47\] of IS 18/01). Each category is a classification of a trust, so this does not address whether something that would not be a trust according to New Zealand trust law, should be a trust for the purposes of the trust rules. 21 UNCLASSIFIED 120. However, nothing in the legislative context appears to suggest that the word trust is intended to have a special meaning when it is used in the sections dealing with “foreign trusts” or that there needs to be anything expressly describing something as a trust for there to be a trust. If the surrounding circumstances, considered objectively, show there is an arrangement with the essential features of a trust under New Zealand law, the property should be regarded as held on trust for the purposes of the trust rules. 121. This intention as to meaning can be illustrated by considering what the trust rules would clearly apply to and why. It is uncontroversial, for instance, that the trust rules apply to real estate situated in New Zealand held by someone on the terms of a trust deed, whether a New Zealand resident or not, and who holds it for the benefit of someone else. This is so whether the property is held for beneficiaries who are resident or not. The property would be regarded as held in trust for the beneficiaries under New Zealand law, and there could be no argument about the arrangement being treated as a trust that is subject to the trust rules. If there is a New Zealand settlor, then it would not be a foreign trust, but it would still be a trust. 122. The same applies to foreign property held by a foreign trustee. Provided there is a New Zealand resident beneficiary, distributions to New Zealand beneficiaries can be taxable if they satisfy the criteria in the relevant provisions of the Act. The location of the property, the settlor or the trustee need not make a difference. 123. Many of the provisions in the Act that are applicable to “foreign trusts” can be taken to assume that property in foreign jurisdictions can be subject to a “trust” or that New Zealand–situated property can have duties owed in respect of it by persons (trustees) wherever they might be resident (although the settlor must not be a New Zealand resident). For these provisions to have meaningful effect, it must have been intended that the “trust” concept not be limited simply because another jurisdiction might not have the same rules as to what is a trust or how they operate, or any rules for that matter. 124. It is New Zealand tax law that is being applied to a “taxable distribution from a foreign trust” and New Zealand tax law (the trust rules) that is being interpreted. It is, therefore, appropriate that it should be the New Zealand law concept of a trust that is applicable; that is, what is a trust according to the law of this country. Otherwise, any situation that would clearly be a trust under the law here could be argued not to be subject to the trust rules because the laws of another country would not recognise the situation as a trust. 125. Consistent with this is a proposition put forward in Bennion on Statutory Interpretation (7th ed, LexisNexis, London, 2017) at 544, that a “term is presumed to have its ordinary meaning in the territory to which an enactment extends, even if it applies in relation to a foreign context”. This is discussed in a comment (at 545) following the proposition: Difficulty may arise where a court is asked to construe an enactment which uses English words but applies in relation to a foreign context where the words have a different meaning. The presumption is that the words should be given ‘their ordinary meaning in the English language as applied to such a subject-matter’ (Clerical, Medical and General Life Assurance Society v Carter (Surveyor of Taxes) (1889) 22 QBD 444 per Lord Esher MR at 448). Here the reference to the English language means that language as understood in the territory to which the enactment extends. 22 UNCLASSIFIED 126. Identifying whether a distribution comes from a trust would seem to be a similar question to identifying whether an enterprise is a body corporate so as to be a “company”, a defined term for New Zealand tax purposes. Professor John Prebble, in “Recognition of foreign enterprises as taxable entities”, Cahiers de Droit Fiscal International Vol LXXIIIa (1988): 493 at 496, summarised what he considered should be the analytical steps to determine whether an entity organised under foreign laws met the requirements to be a company: That is New Zealand would refer to the foreign law to determine the nature of the entity, but would characterise the entity according to its own notion of what is, and of what is not, a body corporate. The question as to whether the participators were shareholders or partners, and, if the former, whether they had derived a dividend, would follow, more or less automatically, being determined in the same manner, by reference to rights and duties established pursuant to the foreign law, but characterised according to New Zealand law. 127. The cases of C L Dreyfus v IRC (1929) 14 TC 560 (CA) and Ryall v The DuBois Company Ltd (1933) 18 TC 431 (CA) are examples of the courts, for English revenue law purposes, giving significance to the way the law applies in a foreign jurisdiction. In the former case, the separate legal personality of an entity in France meant it was not a “partnership” for the purposes of the Income Tax Act, 1918 (UK). In the latter case, the court considered the German entity in question had similar attributes and was the same in nature as an English limited company. The decision was, therefore, that amounts received by the taxpayer in England were income from “stocks” or “shares” despite coming from an entity that was incorporated in a different jurisdiction. 128. In the Canadian case of Sommerer v The Queen (2011) TCC 212, the Tax Court of Canada considered that determining whether a foreign arrangement (an Austrian “foundation”) should be treated as a trust required identifying the essential elements of a trust under Canadian law and comparing the elements of the foreign arrangement with those elements. On appeal \[(2012) DTC 5,126\], the Federal Court of Appeal reached a conclusion in the case on different grounds but did not take substantive issue with the lower court’s approach on this point, preferring to express the test in terms of the property in question being subject to conditions that are “analogous to the legal and equitable obligations of a trustee in a common law jurisdiction”. 129. Conflict of laws principles may also offer some guidance. In Dicey and Morris on the Conflict of Laws (13th ed, London, Sweet & Maxwell, 2000), it is suggested that academic opinion favours a “domestic law of the forum” (or lex fori) approach as a solution to the problem of characterising the question to be decided and which law to apply. The following is said at \[2.009\]: If the forum has to characterise a rule or institution of foreign law, it should inquire how the corresponding or most closely analogous rule or institution of its own law is characterised, and apply that characterisation to the foreign institution or rule. 130. Unless an anti-avoidance provision applies, it is the true nature of the legal arrangements actually entered into and carried out that will determine the tax consequences and not their substance or what name the parties give to an arrangement: Marac Life Assurance Ltd v CIR \[1986\] 1 NZLR 694 (CA). 23 UNCLASSIFIED 131. As noted above, the legal arrangements can include the rights and obligations arising for the parties under the laws of a foreign jurisdiction. It does not follow, however, that all arrangements treated as valid trusts in a foreign jurisdiction will be trusts for New Zealand tax purposes, or vice versa. Moreover New Zealand is not a signatory to the Hague Convention and consequently is not obliged to recognise the existence of a trust because it is seen as such in a foreign jurisdiction. 132. Each situation requires analysis to determine whether it would give rise to a trust for New Zealand law purposes taking into account the rights and obligations arising under foreign law. For example, it may be an appropriate conclusion that an arrangement is not a trust because of the degree of control the settlor retains over trust property, including having it returned to the settlor or where a settlor/trustee has no accountability for what would otherwise be considered a breach of trust. 133. That successful arguments can sometimes be made that arrangements, described as trusts in documents, may not be treated as effective trusts can be illustrated by Re the AQ Revocable Trust, BQ v DQ \[2010\] 13 ITELR 260 (a trust valid under United States (US) trust law but not recognised as a trust by a Bermudan court) and Mezhdunarodniy Promyshlenniy Bank v Pugachev \[2017\] EWHC 2426 (Ch) (a UK decision where “trust” deeds establishing New Zealand for eign trusts allowed a former Russian oligarch to retain his beneficial ownership of assets and so were either bare trusts for his benefit or were a sham). 134. For the above reasons, it is, therefore, considered that the word “trust” is used in the Act to refer to the situation where the true nature of the arrangement is that there is a legal obligation of a particular type on someone who holds property for the benefit of a person or object. Whether such an obligation exists turns on there being circumstances that give rise to something that has the essential features of a trust under New Zealand law; namely that a person (trustee) holds trust property and has a fiduciary obligation to deal with the property for the benefit of the beneficiaries or for a charitable purpose. Wherever in the world property is situated, if the legal basis on which it is owned or controlled and the surrounding circumstances are such that there are obligations that New Zealand law would recognise as trust obligations, then a trust exists for tax legislation purposes. Beneficiary income and taxable distributions from foreign trusts 135. Having identified that money or property comes from a trust, the next question is whether anything is taxable in the hands of the recipient. This will depend on whether anything is “beneficiary income” and whether there has been a “distribution” and whether that distribution is a “taxable distribution” from a “foreign trust”. 136. Interpretation Statement IS 18/01: Taxation of Trusts – Income Tax (Inland Revenue, 2018) contains the following description of “beneficiary income”: 5.5 “Beneficiary income” is defined in s HC 6 as “income” derived in an income year by a trustee to the extent to which it: (a) “vests absolutely in interest” in a beneficiary of the trust in the income year; or (b) is “paid” to a beneficiary in the income year or within the extended time period described in s HC 6(1B). 24 UNCLASSIFIED 137. A “distribution” is defined broadly in the Act and in terms of a transfer of value. IS 18/01 discusses this: 8.7 A trustee makes a “distribution” when the trustee “transfers value” to a person because the person is a beneficiary of the trust (s HC 14). 8.8 “Transfers value” is defined in s YA 1. It is a net concept in the sense that it takes into account the market value of what is provided by, in this context, the trustee and the market value of what (if anything) is provided in return by the beneficiary. The definition is discussed in detail from \[2.20\] in the context of the definition of “settlor”. 138. IS 18/01 paraphrases the definition of foreign trust (at \[8.39\]): “Foreign trusts are trusts that have not had a New Zealand resident settlor at any time since 17 December 1987”. 139. In general terms, a “settlor” is anybody who has transferred value to a trust without getting something in return. Therefore, it will be important to know the background and where the property in the trust in question came from to determine whether it is a foreign trust. Under s HC 11, a trust will be a “foreign trust at a moment in time if no settlor is resident in New Zealand at any time in the period that starts on ... the date on which a settlement was first made on the trust; and ends with the moment in time”. 140. An amount of beneficiary income will be taxable to a New Zealand resident no matter what type of trust it comes from. Amounts other than beneficiary income that are distributions from a foreign trust will be taxable if they are a “taxable distribution” as defined in s HC 15. IS 18/01 states: 8.65 In relation to a foreign trust, a distribution is a taxable distribution to the extent to which it is not a distribution of: (a) an amount that is beneficiary income; (b) a part of the corpus of the trust; (c) a profit from the realisation of a capital asset or another capital gain (other than a capital gain or other capital profit made with an associated person); (d) a foreign superannuation withdrawal; (e) a payment or transaction that represents a distribution of either the corpus of the trust or a capital gain. 141. This legislative framework makes it important to identify how much of the distribution should be treated as corpus, capital and so forth. For this, the ordering rules in s HC 16 need to be applied to every foreign trust distribution that is not beneficiary income or from a trust that is within an exception to s HC 16. As explained from \[132\], the ordering rules can result in some or all of a distribution being treated as made up of income derived by a trustee. Any current year income will be beneficiary income and will be taxable as that rather than as a taxable distribution, if vested in or paid to a beneficiary in the same year as derived by the trustee or paid to a beneficiary within the extended time allowed by s HC 6(1B). 25 UNCLASSIFIED 142. Note: Section HC 15 (in relation to 8.65(c) as referred to in the quotation in \[128\]) has been changed to modify the associated person exception. The effect of section 209 of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018–19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019 is that distributions will not be taxable distributions just because they are of capital gains realised by the trustee on distributions of property to beneficiaries from a foreign trust or distributions of realised capital gains made when a trustee sells assets to associated parties including beneficiaries. This is effective from 18 March 2019, but if a taxpayer has taken a tax position before 18 March 2019 that is consistent with this change that will be treated as correct. Ordering rules (section HC 16) 143. The application of the ordering rules is a very important consideration for any taxpayer in determining whether they might have derived a taxable distribution from a foreign trust. The rules may characterise amounts distributed as something different to what the amounts are nominally. In other words, the ordering rules don’t have to respect the description a trustee gives to the distribution in question or what the relevant trust deed provides. 144. IS 18/01 outlines the rules and how they work: 8.108 Because some distributions will be taxable and some not, opportunities could arise for avoiding or deferring tax on income accumulated in trusts by distributing taxable amounts to non-resident beneficiaries or by distributing non-taxable amounts before taxable amounts. The ordering rules for distributions in s HC 16 limit opportunities for manipulating distributions from foreign and non-complying trusts in this manner. This is achieved by providing a series of ordering rules that determine the order in which amounts are treated as having been distributed from such trusts. 8.109 These ordering rules override the treatment of the distributions that would otherwise apply based on the terms of the trust or the exercise of the trustee’s discretion. The rules can affect whether a distribution is treated as a distribution of income, a capital gain or corpus, and so determine whether a distribution will be a taxable distribution or not. Therefore, as noted earlier, it is necessary to interpret the definition of taxable distribution and the ordering rules together. 8.110 The ordering rules in s HC 16 apply when a trustee of a foreign or non- complying trust makes a distribution to a beneficiary. The four exceptions to the ordering rules are discussed from \[8.143\]. 8.111 Where they apply, the ordering rules treat a distribution as being made up of the following elements in the following order: (a) income derived by the trustee in the current income year; (b) income derived by the trustee in an earlier income year; (c) a capital gain derived by the trustee in the current income year; (d) a capital gain derived by the trustee in an earlier income year; and (e) the corpus of the trust. 8.112 The ordering rules apply on an end of year basis. That is, a distribution is not characterised at the time at which it is made. Rather, distributions are characterised at the end of the income year in which they are made by reference to the total income and capital gains derived in that income year (and previous income years). When the ordering rules are applied, they are applied individually to each distribution made by the trustee in the order in which the distributions are made (subject to potential reordering under s HC 16(5), as discussed from \[8.129\]). 26 UNCLASSIFIED 8.113 The amount of each element (eg, current year income) is finite. Once an amount of an element has been treated under s HC 16 as included in a distribution that amount is no longer available to be treated as included in another distribution. This means that the order in which the distributions are made can be significant. 8.114 For each distribution, the elements must be applied in the order above. The next element is relevant only to the extent that the total of the available amounts in the elements so far considered is less than the amount of the distribution. 145. There are exceptions to the ordering rules. The most important for present purposes is the exception in s HC 16 for “non-discretionary trusts” arising on death. Where this section applies, the source of a distribution is determined by the terms of the trust or the trustee resolution making the distribution. IS 18/01 comments on the non-discretionary trusts exception: 8.146 Section HC 16 does not apply to a distribution if: (a) the trust is a “non-discretionary trust”; and (b) one of the following applies: (i) the trust was created by will or codicil (an amendment to a will) or by an order of court modifying a will or codicil; (ii) the trust was created on an intestacy or partial intestacy; or (iii) no settlement has been made on the trust after 17 December 1987. 8.147 A “non-discretionary trust” is a trust where the trustee has no discretion to determine the source, nature and amount of distributions to beneficiaries. This means, among other things, that the trustee has no discretion to classify trust property as capital or income. 146. If an exception to the ordering rules does not apply, a beneficiary needs information on the trust’s circumstances and history to be able to apply the ordering rules. Ideally, this information will be in the form of good financial records (modified as necessary to show current year income, accumulated income, capital gains and corpus according to New Zealand income tax law – see IS 18/01 at \[8.119\]) and should include details of all settlements on the trust, gains in value of trust property and distributions that have been made by the trust, in the year in question and in previous years. In the absence of financial statements, other material and evidence is potentially relevant but the onus is on the beneficiary to prove the elements of a distribution to a satisfactory level of accuracy. In \[8.157\] of 18/01, it is noted that if there are adequate records relating to corpus but not to income or capital gains, it will still be possible for a final distribution not to be taxable to the extent the amount does not exceed the corpus. 147. Therefore, where s HC 16 and the ordering rules apply, the recipient of a distribution must point to evidence that allows application of the rules. As IS 18/01 notes, if they can’t, the distribution will be deemed to be taxable: 8.155 If the records of a foreign or non-complying trust do not allow an accurate determination of the elements of a distribution under s HC 16 (ie, current and previous year income and capital gain amounts and the corpus of the trust), the distribution is a taxable distribution (s HC 15(7)). 148. The consequences of a distribution being taxable in this way will often justify a concerted effort on the part of a beneficiary to locate the required information. This may be difficult, but the onus is on the beneficiary to demonstrate that the ordering rules apply in the way the beneficiary contends. 27 UNCLASSIFIED 149. It should be noted that non-discretionary will trusts may still give rise to taxable distributions when distributing accumulated income and certain capital gains, but the records requirement is not as likely to be an issue as it would be for other trusts. This is because the ordering rules will not apply and it is potentially less complex to determine what has been distributed. Administration of estates 150. Different countries have different laws for the administration of estates. It follows that the legal basis on which property is owned or controlled may be different too and could lead to a different conclusion on whether a trust arises. However, many countries have laws like the laws in New Zealand, especially common law countries. Therefore, some discussion of the law here in New Zealand relating to the administration of estates is useful to illustrate when a trust (that is not a “bare trust” and ignored for tax purposes – see discussion at \[194\] below) might arise when a deceased estate is being administered overseas. New Zealand estate administration and trusts 151. When a person dies, the law determines what happens to the money and property that they owned (their estate) at the date of death. If the deceased died without a will (intestate), the law provides for the appointment of an administrator and succession to the estate (that is, who inherits) after a process of identifying and collecting assets, satisfying liabilities and distributing what is left (the residue). If the deceased made a will, the executors named in the will have the job of identifying, collecting, satisfying and distributing according to the instructions of the deceased in the terms of the will. 152. The instructions in a will may include paying out or distributing legacies or gifts of specific amounts or specific property to named people. These legacies or gifts may be referred to as specific legacies. 153. The instructions in a will may also expressly provide for trusts (testamentary trusts). This might be a direction to executors to hold property on trust for specified beneficiaries or it might be a direction to establish a trust to hold property for specified beneficiaries (for which a trust deed is usually formalised). If a distribution is made from a trust established under such instructions, the Act applies as it would for any distribution from a trust established by a person during their lifetime. 154. Whether the deceased left a will or not, and even for a will that does not expressly instruct for there to be a trust, a trust may still arise at some point. This may be because, for example, heirs are not yet of an age to inherit or there is a life int erest.. 155. However, a trust does not arise immediately on the death of the deceased. Tax Implications of Certain Asset Transfers (Officials’ issues paper, Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue, 2003) describes the legal process in New Zealand for property moving from a deceased person to beneficiaries (at 11 and 12): 4.4 On the death of a taxpayer, the estate can be dealt with in several ways, depending on whether a will exists and, when a will does exist, the taxpayer’s intentions as set out in the will (for example, whether there are to be a trust, legacies, and so on). Normally, it takes one to two years to wind up an estate and distribute the assets to the beneficiaries. There are several discrete points in this process at which a property disposition could be deemed to have 28 UNCLASSIFIED occurred – on death, on transfer from executor to trustee, or on distribution to legatees and beneficiaries. 4.5 A will usually provides for the appointment of one or more executors. In the absence of a will, a court will appoint someone to administer the deceased’s estate. Legal and beneficial ownership of the deceased’s property vests in the executors or administrators from the time of death through to the end of the period of executorship or administration. The beneficiaries have a right to have the deceased’s estate administered properly during this period but do not, with the exception of specific legacies, have more than an inchoate right in the assets. 4.6 The duties of the executor or administrator are to collect the assets of the deceased, pay all debts, testamentary expenses and taxes and to distribute the legacies. At the end of the period of executorship or administration, the executor or administrator becomes a trustee of the residual assets on behalf of the beneficiaries. 4.7 Property that has been bequeathed or devised under a will may be gifted as a specific legacy, general legacy or residuary gift. Under the “doctrine of relation back”, specific legacies take effect from the date of death, whereas general and residuary legacies vest in the beneficiary(ies) at the time of distribution. \[Emphasis added\]. 156. Other commentaries (and cases, for example, Commissioner of Stamp Duties (Queensland) v Hugh Duncan Livingston \[1965\] AC 694) confirm that, although executors and administrators are subject to fiduciary duties during the period of their executorship or administration, neither the beneficial nor the legal interest in the estate assets (that are not the subject of specific legacies) moves to those who stand to inherit. For instance, Laws of New Zealand: Trusts Part 1 (online ed, LexisNexis NZ, accessed 18 December 2018), under the title “Introduction to Trusts: Nature of Trusts and of the Trust Relationship”, says: Personal representatives and trustees. In a loose sense, a legal personal representative (while acting as such) is a trustee for the creditors and beneficiaries claiming under the deceased, as that personal representative holds the real and personal estate of the deceased for the benefit of the deceased and not for his or her own benefit. Moreover, in the Trustee Act 1956 the term “trust” extends to the duties incidental to the office of an administrator under the Administration Act 1969. However, during the administration of the estate of the deceased, whether a testator, or an intestate, no legatee, devisee, or next of kin has any beneficial interest in the assets being administered; he or she has merely an equitable right to have the estate administered properly. This right is enforced by means of a devastavit action. \[Emphasis added\]. 157. In England the position is similar. Williams on Wills (9th ed, LexisNexis Butterworths, 2008) notes (at \[1.8\]): Although the title to the assets vests in the personal representative and the will is said to take effect in equity only, the property comprised in residue is not held on trust for the beneficiary under the will so as to vest any equitable interest in him. It is in fact a fallacy to seek for the separate existence of the equitable beneficiary interest in the assets during the period of administration. ... Thus the legatee of a share of the residue has no interest in any of the property of the testator until the residue has been ascertained. ... It has been held that this right is in the nature of a chose in action. ... Likewise, persons entitled on intestacy have no interest in the deceased’s assets during administration. 158. Being an executor is not the same as being a trustee: In re Jane Davis, In re T H Davis, Evans v Moore \[1891\] 3 Ch 119. NZ Trusts and Asset Planning Guide (online looseleaf ed, CCH New Zealand, accessed 4 June 2019) notes (at \[123– 401\]) the difference between the two roles of executor and trustee and refers to authority as to the time at which an executor becomes a trustee: 29 UNCLASSIFIED An executor carries into effect a deceased’s will. The duties of an executor include to collect and get in the assets of the deceased, pay expenses and debts and discharge legacies under the will (Re Branson (Deceased) (1911) 31 NZLR 79, at p 82). In comparison, the essential duties of a trustee of a trust created under the will are to obtain possession or control of the trust property, get in funds due to the trust estate, preserve the trust property and to secure it from loss or risk of loss and to conform to and carry out the terms of the trust. “The change in character from personal representative (executor) to trusteeship occurs when the estate has been fully administered, in the sense that all the debts and liabilities have been discharged and the residue ascertained ...” (Hansen v Young \[2004\] 1 NZLR 37 (CA), at para \[29\]). 159. These comments suggest that, strictly speaking, any trust from which distributions are made to beneficiaries will arise only once the personal representatives are ready to distribute. This is because the law of estate administration in New Zealand is that personal representatives have the legal and beneficial interest in property passing on the death of a person, but they do not hold the legal interest on a trust under which those ultimately entitled to the property have a beneficial interest (or under which they might receive a distribution as a beneficiary of a trust). Such a beneficial interest does not arise, whether for particular property or the residual estate, until the personal representatives have completed their duties in the administration of the estate and there is a transition from the role of personal representative to the role of trustee. 160. This position is not altered by the fact that, under the Act, an executor or administrator is treated as a trustee (specifically, s YA 1 defines “trustee” to include an executor or administrator). Although a personal representative is to be considered a trustee for tax purposes, it does not follow that a trust arises on death or during administration. It just means that provisions referring to “trustee” may have a broader application than they otherwise would. Where a section refers to “trust” but not “trustee”, interpretation of the section requires consideration of the meaning to be given to the word trust. As noted, this would not generally include an estate during administration. 161. A personal representative will become a trustee at the point at which they have identified the residue of the estate and assent to the property in the estate becoming subject to a trust: Re McGregor (deceased) \[1960\] NZLR 220 at 229 (CA). The dispositions in the will become operative on such assent: George Attenborough & Son v Solomon \[1913\] AC 76 (HL). 162. Such assent can happen for property outside of residue and at different times for different property. The commentary in Laws of New Zealand: Trusts Part 1 set out above continues: When the personal representatives realise that specific property left on trusts is not going to be resorted to to enable debts, expenses, and liabilities to be satisfied, they may assent to that property being held on trust in the strict sense. It is often important to determine when a personal representative has completed his or her functions as such in relation to any property and holds the property solely as a trustee in the strict sense; this is because there are differences in the powers of personal representatives as such and trustees, and also the period of limitation applicable to an action may depend in certain cases upon whether the defendant holds the property which is the subject of the claim as personal representative or as trustee. Moreover, as the duty of personal representatives is owed to the estate as a whole, they, unlike trustees, do not have to hold the balance evenly between those interested in income and those interested in capital. \[Emphasis added\]. 30 UNCLASSIFIED 163. More explanation of “assent” can be found in Laws of New Zealand: Administration of Estates II – Assents (online ed, LexisNexis NZ, accessed 4 June 2019): 457. Necessity for assent. The bequest of a legacy, whether general or specific, or of real estate transfers only an inchoate property to the legatee: the executor's assent is necessary to render it complete and perfect. The right is one which devolves on the legatee's personal representatives should the legatee die before the assent is given. In the case of a release of a debt by will, the executor's assent is necessary, as the release in effect amounts to a legacy of the debt. The necessity for assent by an executor applies to residuary bequests and to interests arising under a partial intestacy. An executor may assent to part of a residuary gift without assenting to the whole. The assent of one of several representatives to a bequest of pure personalty is sufficient; even though the bequest is to that representative. An executor may assent before probate. The assent will not be affected by their dying without having obtained probate, provided the will is subsequently proved. An executor may be compelled by the legatee to assent should they refuse to do so without just cause. \[Emphasis added\]. 164. The assent need not be in any particular form and it is a question of fact whether assent has occurred: 459. Assent by implication. An assent to the vesting of real or personal estate may be express or implied; it need not be in writing nor need it be given in any particular form. Informal expressions, if sufficiently clear to indicate intention, may amount to an assent. The assent may also be implied from the executor's conduct: thus, the application in the maintenance of minors, of rents of leaseholds bequeathed to the executor in trust for maintaining them during minority, and afterwards in trust for the legatee on attaining their majority; allowing a legatee of a term to receive the income; the payment by the executor of rent, coupled with the charging of the legatee with the payments in account; or the payment of a charge subject to which a legacy is given; would amount to an assent to the bequest. However, an executor may, and often does, make general payments to a legatee without binding themselves to an assent; and the Court will not infer an assent in such circumstances unless there is evidence that the executor intended to assent as, for instance, by representations to that effect or by special payments out of or on account of rents to which the legatee would be entitled after assent. In case of dispute, the question whether there has been an assent or not is generally one of fact. An expression which is ambiguous and applies equally to either view is no evidence of an assent. \[Emphasis added\]. 165. The assent, once given in respect of property, vests title to a legacy immediately: 461. Irrevocability and relation back. The assent once given is irrevocable. The title to a legacy vests immediately upon the assent in the legatee; so as to enable them to bring an action at law against the executor or any other person in possession of the bequest. The legatee of a specific legacy has the right to recover the intermediate profits of the thing bequeathed. Where executors who are also trustees under the will have assented, they cease to hold the property as executors and from then on hold it as trustees. \[Emphasis added\]. 166. The power to assent belongs to a personal representative: 462. Assents in relation to trusteeship. The power to assent is confined to personal representatives. Difficulties can arise as to whether a personal representative who may have fully administered and become a trustee still has power to assent and whether they need to assent in their own favour as trustee. The capacities of personal representative and trustee are not mutually exclusive, and a personal representative who has fully administered the estate and holds the residue as a trustee is not thereby necessarily and automatically discharged from their obligations as personal representative. A personal representative retains their character as such (as distinct from their statutory powers of management) for all 31 UNCLASSIFIED time; or, in the case of a grant of administration for a limited period, until the termination of the period of the grant. 167. One of the ways a personal representative becomes a trustee is when they have assented: 463. When a personal representative becomes a trustee. If property is specifically devised or bequeathed to an executor upon trust they become trustee of it when they have assented; or when they have severed the property from the rest of the estate; or when they have executed a declaration of trust. As regards residue, the major change in character from representation to trusteeship occurs when the estate has been fully administered in the sense that all debts and liabilities have been discharged and the residue ascertained. When the trusts affecting the residue are designed to continue after completion of the administration, the executor should thereupon execute an assent to the vesting of the residue in themselves as trustee. \[Emphasis added\]. 168. Further discussion on testamentary trusts, “assent” and related aspects of administration of estates in New Zealand can be found in the cases of Re Estate Eagle; Barbalich v Kennedy (1997) 1 NZTR 7-003 (HC Auckland M721/97), Sullivan v Brett \[1981\] 2 NZLR 202, and Re Maguire (deceased) \[2010\] 2 NZLR 845. 169. The cases confirm that: • Until assent, beneficiaries do not have any proprietary interest in residue and residue is not held by the executors on trust in a relevant sense; • An executor, at some point, either transfers residue to beneficiaries or assents to the vesting of that property in someone, which can include themselves, acting in the capacity of a trustee; • Assent is evidence that an executor is ready to end their interest in the property in question and it can pass according to the terms of the will; • Assent can be in respect of particular estate property before residue is ascertained (an inference that assent has occurred can be made from the fact of distribution); • An express or formal assent is possible although not common in New Zealand; • Where there has been no formal assent, once administration has got to the point that all debts and legacies have been paid and residue has been “ascertained”, assent can be inferred; • The only action remaining following assent is for the personal representative to pass legal title to the beneficiaries of the will (or to a trustee to hold for beneficiaries that is to be someone other than the personal representative); • Whether there has been assent does not turn on what the personal representative believes or intends, it is what the facts demonstrate;. • If vested in a trustee, the trustee either holds the property on the trusts specified in the will (ie, testamentary trusts) or, if no trusts are specified, on trust according to the beneficiaries’ rights and interests under the will (this will be a bare trust). 32 UNCLASSIFIED 170. It seems reasonable to conclude that the certainties required before a trust arises will be present on assent. The existence and identity of property will have been established, as will the beneficiaries. Assent will provide certainty of intention to create a trust. 171. An equitable obligation amounting to a trust, therefore, arises only following assent by the personal representatives to the property in question being held on trust by a trustee or trustees. Such assent can be express or inferred from the circumstances. 172. If laws similar to the laws of administration of estates in New Zealand apply, where a testamentary trust or a life interest or a minority arises from a non- resident deceased’s estate, then following assent, the property will be held by a person (trustee) subject to that trust from assent. This may mean an executor changes “hats” (from assent) if they are going to be that ongoing trustee. Such a trust will be a foreign trust because the settlor is the deceased who is not a New Zealand resident and whose intentions to create a will trust are being carried out by the executors (an indirect transfer of value as provided for in s HC 27(4)). To determine the tax treatment of property or amounts transferred to a New Zealand beneficiary, the possibility that what is transferred to a New Zealand resident is a taxable distribution needs to be considered. However, the trust will often not be discretionary so that the ordering rules do not apply (as discussed in \[131\]). 173. Where a New Zealand beneficiary of a foreign deceased estate has a vested interest after assent, a “bare” trust will arise as a matter of law. As discussed from \[173\], this situation can be ignored for tax purposes. Although the personal representative will be a trustee according to trust law, they will be a bare trustee. They now hold the property subject to the direction and control of the beneficiary and, for New Zealand tax purposes, the beneficiary is treated as the owner of the property. Estate administration and trusts in other countries 174. The position outlined above for New Zealand estate administration and trust law is likely to be similar to the position in other common law jurisdictions such as Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States. However, some countries may have materially different laws of succession and administration of estates. As noted earlier, many countries do not have the concept of a trust and have laws different to New Zealand’s law governing devolution of property on death. In Switzerland (a civil law country like France and Germany), for example, the entire estate of a person passes automatically by way of direct succession to the heirs on the person’s death. This is so whether the deceased dies testate or intestate. Trusts are not recognised as a legal arrangement in Switzerland, although it does recognise the existence of trusts in other countries. 175. This means that the position in such civil law countries is materially different from common law jurisdictions like New Zealand. A trust will not arise on death or following estate administration as the heirs have a vested legal interest immediately on death. There is no “interregnum” when the executor has the legal interest as in common law countries. It also means that transfers by personal representatives in civil law jurisdictions will not be a “distribution” for New Zealand tax purposes because they do not transfer value to heirs. The heirs already own what they inherit. 33 UNCLASSIFIED 176. Further, the test discussed above for determining whether a “trust” exists was whether in all the circumstances a trust can be said to arise under New Zealand law. The facts relevant to concluding on that issue will include what legal obligations a person has in relation to property. In that case, the rules of another country as to what happens on death will affect legal obligations in relation to property. The fact that no property vests in a personal representative is critically relevant to the question of the existence or otherwise of a trust under New Zealand law. 177. As noted, a trust is an equitable obligation or set of obligations in respect of property under which a person holds property for the benefit of a person or object. The legal interest is held by one person, the beneficial interest by another. However, where the legal and beneficial interests in property move straight from a deceased to an inheritor, there will be nobody holding the legal interest in property other than the people who stand to inherit it. There will also be nothing that would expressly create a trust, such as a will or trust deed. 178. New Zealand law would not recognise a situation as a “trust” where the situation involves property that is not owned by someone who has obligations to deal with it for the benefit of someone else. The arrangements in civil law countries will not meet the requirements under New Zealand law to be a “trust” in that situation. 179. Depending on the situation in the particular country (and this would always have to be reviewed), it follows, therefore, that an amount distributed to a New Zealand heir from an estate administered in a civil law country, either in the course of or following administration, would not be a “taxable distribution from a foreign trust”. This is because it is not a transfer of value made because the recipient is a beneficiary of a trust. 180. As an example of this, suppose person A acts as administrator of person B’s estate on B’s death in Switzerland, a civil law jurisdiction. After several years, A carries out the instruction in B’s will and transfers the proceeds of the sale of shares in a Swiss company owned by B at his death, to person C who lives in New Zealand. The process of administering and maintaining the estate may have taken several years but a trust will not arise because A did not own the shares and the shares vested in C on B’s death. Therefore, the question of a taxable distribution from a foreign trust does not arise. 181. Likewise, there will be no distribution from a trust when A transfers to C the dividends that have accumulated on the shares during the administration. They will be treated as having been derived by C as taxable income from date of death, with A being a bare trustee, as discussed from \[175\]. Tax paid in Switzerland may be available as a credit against liability for tax in New Zealand. If C has not returned the dividends for tax in New Zealand, an adjustment to their assessments will be required. 182. The situation is likely to be different where a New Zealand resident receives a transfer from an estate being administered according to laws materially like the succession and administration laws here (for example, the laws in a common law jurisdiction). The transfer may be properly characterised as being “from a foreign trust” because the transferor is someone who has the legal interest in the property and has been holding it for the recipient who has the beneficial interest in it. 34 UNCLASSIFIED 183. The outcome would be different if the situation were similar to the example above, but B died leaving a will instructing establishment of a trust for C and the shares, A and B were all in Australia. The Australian laws on trusts and estate administration are like those in New Zealand, so a trust will have arisen once A assented to the shares vesting in a trust (which will not be a bare trust). Then, when a subsequent transfer of the sale proceeds for the shares and of the dividends to C occurs, the transfer would be a “distribution”. 184. In short, in some countries, the legal interest in property devolves directly to inheritors. In others, like New Zealand, the legal interest is vested in someone other than the inheritors for a while. It follows that in the context of inheritance, one relevant circumstance that needs to be considered to determine whether an amount is a distribution from a trust is the effect of applicable laws of other countries. Effect on tax status of deceased’s estate during administration 185. As noted above, in New Zealand a trust will arise only once personal representatives are ready to distribute and have assented. From that point, the beneficiaries have an equitable interest in property subject to a trust, either a bare trust (ignored for tax) or an express or implied trust. 186. Before then, although it seems they are sometimes referred to as holding property “on trust”, the legal position is that they hold both the legal and the beneficial interests in the estate property “in right of the deceased” (see Nevill’s Law of Trusts, Wills and Administration (12th ed, LexisNexis, 2016) at \[19.11.6\]). They do not hold interests in the estate as trustee for beneficiaries. Heirs do not have any beneficial interest and can rely on only their right to force the representatives to carry out their duties. It, therefore, seems more appropriate to consider the representatives not (yet) to be trustees. This is likely to be the position for deceased estates in common law countries in general but unlikely to be the position in civil law countries. 187. As a result, a New Zealand tax resident will not derive anything that will be beneficiary income or a taxable distribution from a foreign trust unless: • for common law countries, administration of an estate has at least reached the stage that personal representatives have assented to the property being held on trust; or • for civil law countries, something has happened to the property before transfer to the resident that New Zealand law would consider gives rise to a trust (for instance, the property was transferred to someone in another country (a common law country) to hold on trust for the resident in New Zealand - a distribution made direct to the resident would not be a distribution from a trust). 35 UNCLASSIFIED Bare trusts 188. Commentary referred to above also suggests that a trust can still arise by assent even though the personal representative has not got to the point of identifying the residuary estate. For instance, an executor may choose to distribute a specific legacy to the person named in the will as entitled to that legacy. Assent in relation to the property or amount forming that specific legacy would be inferred once the distribution is made and, technically, there might be a brief time when what is distributed is subject to a trust under general law. This situation would not give rise to a taxable distribution, however. This is for two reasons. 189. The first reason is because if it were a distribution from a foreign trust, it would be a distribution of corpus, being a specific legacy distributed from a specific non- discretionary trust created by will (and so excluded from the ordering rules in s HC 16 by s HC 16(6)(b)). 190. The second reason is because not every distribution that would otherwise meet the legislative definition of “taxable distribution” will necessarily be a “taxable distribution from a foreign trust”. If the property is held on a “bare trust”, s YB 21 would have the effect of deeming no distribution to have been made by the person holding the property. Section YB 21 provides: YB 21 Transparency of nominees Treatment of nominee (1) In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires, if a person holds something or does something as a nominee for another person, the other person holds or does that thing and the nominee is ignored. Who is a nominee? (2) A person holds or does something as a nominee for another person if the person acts on the other person’s behalf. However, a trustee is a nominee only if the trustee is a bare trustee. Nominal settlements (3) A person making a nominal settlement at the request of another person is treated for the purposes of this Act as a nominee in relation to the settlement. \[Emphasis added\]. 191. In practical terms, and in the context of trusts arising in the administration of estates, the consequence of a trust being “bare” is that inheritors would not derive beneficiary income or taxable distributions but they would derive any income from the property in question. 192. The principles developed through the courts on what amounts to a “bare trust” are summarised in “Interpretation Statement IS 12/01: Income Tax – Timing of Share Transfers for the Purposes of the Continuity Provisions” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 24, No 7 (August 2012):20: 112. Three principles can be distilled from these authorities: • A “bare trustee” is a person who holds property on trust for the absolute benefit and at the absolute disposal of other persons, and has no beneficial interest in the property. • A “bare trustee” does not have any duties to perform in regard to the property, except to convey or transfer it to a person entitled to hold it when required to do so. 36 UNCLASSIFIED • For a bare trust relationship to exist, the three certainties of a trust must be satisfied. 193. “QB 16/03: Goods and Services Tax – GST Treatment of Bare Trusts”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 28, No 5 (June 2016): 16 describes a “bare trust” as: 5. A bare trust is a type of trust under which the trustee holds property on trust without any duties to perform other than to convey the trust property to the beneficiary or as the beneficiary directs. The reference to “duties” in this definition is to duties that the settlor has specified. For example, the trustee may have been appointed to hold the property as nominee, or the settlor may have required that the beneficiary be maintained until becoming entitled to call for capital and income on reaching the age of majority. Once the beneficiary reaches the age of majority, the trustee no longer has a duty to maintain the beneficiary. In both situations, the trustee is “bare” of any duties specified by the settlor. However, so long as a trustee holds property on trust, they always retain their legal duty to take reasonable care of the trust property. The trustee cannot escape this duty: Herdegen v FCT 88 ATC 4995 (FCA); Waters’ Law of Trusts in Canada (4th ed, Carswell, Toronto, 2012) at 33–34. 6. Therefore, a bare trustee has not only a duty to transfer the trust property to the beneficiary (or as directed by the beneficiary), but also a legal duty to take reasonable care of the trust property in the meantime: Herdegen; CGU Insurance Ltd v One Tel Ltd (in liquidation) \[2010\] HCA 26; Corumo Holdings Pty Ltd v C Itoh Ltd (1991) 24 NSWLR 370 (CA); ISPT Nominees Pty Ltd v Chief Commissioner of State Revenue \[2003\] NSWSC 697. 7. What a bare trustee must do to fulfil their duty to protect trust property depends on the nature of the trust property and any threats to the trust property. However, a bare trustee must refrain from active management that does not fall within the duty to maintain the trust property: Bruton Holdings Pty Ltd (in liquidation) v FCT (2011) 193 FCR 442 (FCAFC). 194. The question, for s YB 21 purposes, will be whether a bare trustee (assuming that is the appropriate legal characterisation of someone’s capacity) “acts on behalf of” the beneficiary. This will depend on the circumstances, but it would be unusual for someone holding property on a bare trust not to be acting on behalf of the person for whom the property is held. 195. In the context of estates, a trust will, therefore, arise only on completion of the personal representative’s role in relation to property and on the personal representative assenting in relation to that property. Then it will depend on the facts as to what is being distributed, and whether any transfer of the property to an heir is a transfer by a bare trustee. In that case, the trust rules will not apply because for tax purposes there is no trust. The beneficiary, not the trustee, is treated by s YB 21 as holding the property from the date of assent. If, on the other hand, the personal representative is more than a bare trustee, the transfer (or part of it) might be of beneficiary income or a taxable distribution to the extent it is not excluded by the application of s HC 15. Consequences of an arrangement being a trust 196. A trust technically arises under the general law of many common law countries on assent. 37 UNCLASSIFIED 197. The trust that arises following assent and before distribution will often be a bare trust that will not be recognised as a trust for tax purposes. A transfer of property to a New Zealand resident will, therefore, often not be a taxable distribution. This would be the case if the property continued to be held for a time because of practical difficulties in locating the beneficiary or transferring the property to them. During that time, the property would have been held for the absolute benefit of the beneficiary, who has the right to call for the property at any time and the trustee must act on that direction. 198. An administrative delay, following payment of all debts, in selling property in order to distribute the proceeds of sale to heirs would not follow assent so would not give rise to a taxable distribution. Another situation that might hold up assent would be where the will is contested or there is a claim on the estate. There will be a delay in sorting out who is entitled to the property, but it would be the personal representatives dealing with that in their capacity as representatives, not as trustees. They would not give assent for property affected by the contest or claim until the contest or claim were sorted. 199. However, if an executor continues to hold property in the capacity of trustee on a trust, expressly or impliedly, provided for in a will, and the trust is not a bare trust, then any transfer to beneficiaries may be a taxable distribution. Assuming an assent is express or can be inferred from the circumstances, a distribution when it is made might then give rise to a taxable distribution. This would be where, for instance, heirs of an intestate deceased are not of age or where a will provides for a life interest before the property goes to the heirs. In these situations, there will be contingencies and more than protection of the property before distribution, so there will not be a bare trust. 200. In the example discussed at \[168\], of an executor in Australia distributing the proceeds of sale of Australian shares to a New Zealand resident heir of a deceased Australian, the distribution was from a foreign trust. This is because the proceeds were part of the residuary estate that was held undistributed by the executor for a time. The deceased had died with a will that expressly provided for a trust to be established for the heir so a trust arose following assent. The ordering rules in s HC 16(2) would need to be considered, unless the trust was a non-discretionary trust covered by s HC 16(6)(b). 201. Assuming it was a discretionary trust, if the trust records were not good enough to allow application of the ordering rules, the transfer of the proceeds of sale of the shares and the accumulated dividends would together be a taxable distribution: s HC 15(7). If the records showed that only the accumulated dividends represented income derived since the trust started, then they would not be excluded from being a taxable distribution by s HC 15(4), but any capital gains made on the shares by the trust and their value when the trust started (corpus) would be excluded and would not form part of the taxable distribution. 38 UNCLASSIFIED Summary 202. Common law countries are likely to have similar estate administration laws to those in New Zealand. This means that personal representatives, in that capacity, do not hold the property of a deceased person on trust for the heirs. Property will be subject to a trust only when personal representatives hold legal title subject to the terms of a trust, express or implied. This can happen only after they have given assent in relation to that property. Assent can be inferred from the circumstances and can be for individual items of property and before the residuary estate has been determined. Before such assent, the legal position is that the personal representatives hold both the legal and the beneficial interest in the estate property “in right of the deceased” rather than as trustee for beneficiaries. 203. A trust under general law and following assent can still arise for property distributed upon completion of administration. However, in a straightforward will disposition, such a trust is likely to be a bare trust that will not be a foreign trust for tax purposes and any distribution will not be a taxable distribution. Alternatively, where there is a testamentary trust or a will providing for life interests or no distributions to heirs who are minors, the property may continue to be held in trust and may be a taxable distribution when transferred to beneficiaries. A distribution in these circumstances could comprise more than corpus and could be subject to the ordering rules in s HC 16 as well as comprising current year or beneficiary income. 204. Distributions from estates of residents of civil law countries are less likely to be from trusts because heirs have a legal interest from the date of death.

Amounts not subject to ordering rule (6) To the extent to which a distribution is made from a trust that is not a complying trust by disposing of property at less than market value or providing services to a beneficiary at less than market value, the distribution is a taxable distribution and is not subject to the ordering rule in section HC 16. Inadequate records (7) If the records of a trust that is not a complying trust do not allow an accurate determination of the elements of a distribution under section HC 16, the distribution is a taxable distribution. Section HC 16 provides: HC 16 Ordering rule for distributions from non-complying and foreign trusts When this section applies (1) This section applies for the purposes of the trust rules when a trustee of a non- complying trust or a foreign trust makes a distribution in an income year to a beneficiary. Subsections (6) and (7) override this subsection. Order of elements of distribution (2) The distribution is treated as consisting of the following elements in the following order: (a) first, an amount of income that the trustee derives in the income year: (b) second, an amount of income, other than beneficiary income, that the trustee has derived in an earlier income year: (c) third, an amount that the trustee derives in the income year from the realisation of a capital asset of the trust or another capital gain and that is not income under section HC 15(5B) for the purposes of this section: (d) fourth, an amount that the trustee has derived in an earlier income year from the realisation of a capital asset of the trust or another capital gain: (e) last, the corpus of the trust. Order and elements (3) In subsection (2),— (a) an amount must not be treated as included in the distribution if the amount has been treated under this section as being included in an earlier or contemporaneous distribution from the trust: (b) the paragraphs are applied in order, and the next paragraph applies only to the extent to which the amount of the distribution is more than the cumulative amounts described in that paragraph and the preceding paragraphs. 44 UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED Deductions and capital losses subtracted (4) For the purposes of subsection (2),— (a) in paragraphs (a) and (b), the amount of income is determined after subtracting the amount of a deduction that is taken into account in the income year in the calculation of net or taxable income for the corresponding tax year: (b) in paragraphs (c) and (d), the amount is determined after subtracting the amount of a capital loss that the trustee incurs in the income year. Transactions that are not genuine (5) In the determination of the elements of a distribution to a beneficiary (beneficiary A), no amount of income or capital gain derived by the trustee of the trust is treated as distributed to another beneficiary of the trust (beneficiary B) if the effect is that some or all of the distribution to beneficiary A would be treated as not being a taxable distribution, unless the distribution to beneficiary B meets all the following requirements: (a) it is a genuine transaction entered into and carried out in good faith; and (b) it places the amount beyond the possession and control of the trustee in their capacity as trustee; and (c) it does not itself constitute a settlement. Exclusions: terms of trust (6) This section does not apply to the following distributions which are instead treated as consisting of the amount that reflects the terms of the trust or the terms of the exercise of the trustee’s discretion: (a) a distribution by the trustee of a complying trust which is treated as exempt income under section CW 53 (Distributions from complying trusts), unless an election to pay income tax on trustee income has been made for the purposes of section HZ 2 (Trusts that may become complying trusts); or (b) a distribution from a non-discretionary trust— (i) created by will or codicil, or by an order of court varying or modifying the provisions of a will or codicil; or (ii) created on an intestacy or partial intestacy; or (iii) on which no settlement has been made after 17 December 1987; or (c) a distribution from a trust, other than a non-complying trust, that is settled by a natural person and for which an election is made under section HC 30(2). Exclusions: taxable distributions (7) This section does not apply to a distribution described in section HC 15(6). Meaning of non-discretionary trust (8) In this section, a non-discretionary trust is a trust in relation to which the trustee has no discretion as to the source, nature, and amount of distributions to beneficiaries, including but not limited to the classification of trust property as capital or income. Section HC 18 provides: HC 18 Taxable distributions from foreign trusts An amount that a person derives in an income year as a taxable distribution from a foreign trust is income of the person under section CV 13(c) (Amounts derived from trusts).

This Interpretation Statement provides guidance on when the attribution rule for income from personal services in ss GB 27 to GB 29 will apply. It expands on 2 IS 19/02 UNCLASSIFIED “Attribution of Income” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 12, No 12 (December 2000): 49. It does not discuss or explain the calculation rules contained in s GB 29. 2. The attribution rule for income from personal services in ss GB 27 to GB 29 is a specific anti-avoidance rule that prevents an individual avoiding the top personal tax rate by diverting income to an associated entity. Essentially, the income attribution rule applies when an individual (the working person), who performs personal services, is associated with an entity (the associated entity) that provides personal services to a third person (the buyer). 3. The income attribution rule only applies where various threshold tests are met and no exemptions apply. This Interpretation Statement provides guidance on the application of each of those threshold tests and exemptions, to assist readers in determining whether the income attribution rule applies to their situation. 4. This Interpretation Statement makes minor amendments to and replaces IS 18/03: Income Tax – attribution rule for income from personal services, published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 30 No 9 (October 2018). Introduction 5. The income attribution rule applies where (s GB 27(1)): • a person (the working person) provides personal services; • the working person is associated with an entity (the associated entity); • the associated entity is inserted between the working person and the party who acquires the services (the buyer); • the working person performs the services, but the associated entity derives the income; • various threshold tests in s GB 27(2) are satisfied; and • none of the exemptions in s GB 27(3) apply. 6. This Interpretation Statement focuses on the application of the threshold tests in s GB 27(2), and the exemptions in s GB 27(3). 7. The threshold tests that must be satisfied for the income attribution rule to apply are: • 80% or more of the associated entity’s income from personal services during the income year is derived from the supply of services to the buyer or an associate of the buyer or a combination of them (s GB 27(2)(a)); and • 80% or more of the associated entity’s income from personal services during the income year is derived from services that are performed by the working person or a relative of the working person or a combination of them (s GB 27(2)(b)); and • the working person’s net income for the income year exceeds $70,000, including any amounts that would be attributed if the rule applied (s GB 27(2)(c)); and • substantial business assets are not a necessary part of the business structure used to derive the entity’s assessable income (s GB 27(2)(d)). 3 IS 19/02 UNCLASSIFIED 8. However, even if the threshold tests are satisfied, a working person and an associated entity will be exempt from applying the income attribution rule where: • the associated entity and the working person are non-residents; • the associated entity is a natural person, and is neither a partner of a partnership nor a trustee of a trust; • the services performed by the working person are essential support for a product supplied by the associated entity; • the amount to be attributed to the working person is less than $5,000 (although there are exclusions to this); or • in various situations where the associated entity is a controlled foreign company (CFC). 9. A process for considering the application of the various thresholds and exemptions is illustrated in Flowchart 1 on the next page. 10. The analysis following the flowchart discusses each of the threshold tests and any exclusions in the order that they appear in the flowchart. 4 IS 19/02 UNCLASSIFIED Flowchart 1: Does the income attribution rule apply?

See \[73\] and \[74\] Is the associated entity a CFC? See \[75\] Income attribution rule applies Income attribution rule does not apply 5 IS 19/02 UNCLASSIFIED Is there an associated entity and working person relationship? 11. The income attribution rule will only apply where the entity is associated with the working person. 12. The rules in subpart YB apply to determine whether a working person and an entity are associated persons. A company and a person (other than a company) will be associated if the person has a voting interest in the company of 25% or more (s YB 3). 13. If the entity and the working person are not associated, the income attribution rule will not apply. Example 1. Identifying the parties Paul employs Andrea. Andrea is paid a salary of $150,000. Andrea incorporates a company called A&M Co Ltd which contracts her services to Paul. Andrea is the sole shareholder of A&M Co Ltd. Paul pays A&M Co Ltd $150,000 for the services provided. A&M Co Ltd pays Andrea a salary of $80,000 and retains the remaining $70,000. Question Who are the relevant parties under the income attribution rule? Answer Under the new arrangement, Paul is the buyer, A&M Co Ltd is the associated entity and Andrea is the working person for the purposes of the income attribution rule. Who Attribution party Contractual party Original party Paul Buyer Buyer Employer A&M Co Ltd Associated entity Employer None Andrea Working person Employee Employee 14. The income attribution rule is not restricted to reorganisations of existing situations. It also applies to new structures where the appropriate relationships are created. The income attribution rule is also not confined to a corporate structure. The associated entity could be, for example, a trust or a partnership, and the working person could be a partner, trustee or beneficiary of a trading trust. The rules in subpart YB will also apply to determine whether a working person is associated with a partnership or trust. In particular, a partner and a partnership will be associated persons (s YB 12), and a trustee of a trust will be associated with the beneficiaries (s YB 6) (and people related to the beneficiaries (s YB 5)) and settlors of the trust (s YB 8), and with a person with the power to appoint or remove the trustee (s YB 11). 15. Most of the examples given in this item are based on a corporate structure because that is likely to be the most common structure. However, the analysis is equally applicable to other less common business structures where the income attribution rule may apply such as a trading trust or partnership. Example 2. Identifying the parties Jane and Megan have just established the JM Partnership. Jane completes all the work for the partnership while Megan has contributed the capital. The JM Partnership has entered into a substantial contract with Bug Eliminators Ltd which will take almost all of Jane’s time. Question Who are the relevant parties under the income attribution rule? 6 IS 19/02 UNCLASSIFIED Answer Under the arrangement Bug Eliminators Ltd is the buyer, JM Partnership is the associated entity and Jane is the working person for the purposes of the income attribution rule. Are the associated entity and working person both non-resident for the entire income year? 16. Under s GB 27(3)(a), the income attribution rule will not apply if the associated person and the working person are both non-resident during the relevant income year under the tests in ss YD 1 (Residence of natural persons) and YD 2 (Residence of companies). For more guidance on the application of the residence tests see “IS 16/03: Tax Residence” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 28, No 10 (October 2016): 2. 17. The residence or non-residence of the working person is the first matter to address when considering this exemption. It will only be necessary to consider the residence of the associated entity if the working person is a non-resident. Example 3. Non-resident working person and resident associated entity John is a non-resident who owns all of the share capital of NZCO which is a New Zealand incorporated company. John is the working person and NZCO is the associated entity. NZCO provides consulting services to one buyer, which is an Australian company. The services are provided to the buyer in Australia and the work is done by John in Australia. Question: Does the income attribution rule apply? Answer: Yes, the income attribution rule applies. The exemption in s GB 27(3)(a) provides that both the associated entity (NZCO) and working person (John) must be non-residents at all times. While John is not a New Zealand tax resident, NZCO is incorporated in New Zealand so is a company that is a New Zealand resident for tax purposes. There may be some relief for a working person under the Australia/New Zealand double tax agreement, but this item does not consider the application of any relevant double tax agreements. Example 4. Tax resident working person Michelle is New Zealand tax resident who is living in France. She owns all of the share capital of NZCO which is a New Zealand incorporated company. Michelle is the working person and NZCO is the associated entity. NZCO provides consulting services to FRENCHCO, which is the sole buyer of the services that NZCO provides. Michelle provides the services in France. Question: Does the income attribution rule apply? Answer: Yes, the income attribution rule applies. The exemption in s GB 27(3)(a) provides that both the associated entity (NZCO) and the working person (Michelle) must be non- residents at all times. In this example Michelle (the working person) is a New Zealand tax resident. This means the requirements of s GB 27(3)(a) are not met. 7 IS 19/02 UNCLASSIFIED Example 5. Non-resident associated entity Bryan was a New Zealand tax resident but he currently lives in the United Kingdom and is a non-resident at all relevant times. He owns all of the share capital of BRITCO which is a UK company. Bryan is the working person and BRITCO is the associated entity. BRITCO provides consulting services to UKCO, which is the sole buyer of the services that BRITCO provides. Bryan provides the services in the United Kingdom. Question: Does the income attribution rule apply? Answer: No, the income attribution rule does not apply. The exemption in s GB 27(3)(a) provides that both the associated entity (BRITCO) and the working person (Bryan) must be non-residents during the relevant income year. In this example the associated entity (BRITCO) is not a New Zealand tax resident and neither is Bryan (for the time being). This means the requirements of s GB 27(3)(a) have been satisfied even though the working person (Bryan) is a New Zealander. Is the associated entity a natural person acting in that capacity? 18. The income attribution rule will not apply if the associated entity is a natural person and is neither a partner of a partnership nor a trustee of a trust (s GB 27(3)(b)). The income attribution rule is designed to prevent higher income earners from diverting personal services income to associated people by using companies, trusts and look-through companies. Section GB 27(3)(b) was added after the income attribution rule was enacted so that if a sole trader employs relatives to carry out personal services of a type to which the income attribution rule would otherwise apply, all the income from those services is not directed to those relatives. If the income attribution rule did apply the sole trader would have no income from those services. 19. However, if the natural person is acting in their capacity as a partner of a partnership, or a trustee of a trust, opportunities may still exist for the natural person to divert personal services income. Accordingly, the exemption does not apply in these situations. Has the working person chosen to apply the controlled foreign company rules? 20. The income attribution rule will not apply (s GB 27(3)(e)) if: • the associated entity is a CFC (that is, a foreign company that is controlled by five or fewer New Zealand residents); and • the amount that would be attributed to the working person under the income attribution rules would also be attributed CFC income under s CQ 2(2B) (When attributed CFC income arises) or an attributed CFC loss under s DN 2(2) (When attributed CFC loss arises); and • the working person files a return of income in which they return the amount as attributed CFC income. 21. This exemption prevents double taxation through the application of multiple regimes by allowing the working person to choose to apply the CFC rules or the income attribution rules. 8 IS 19/02 UNCLASSIFIED Would the working person earn net income of more than $70,000 if s GB 29 applied? 22. The income attribution rule will only apply if the working person’s net income for the income year is more than $70,000, assuming the income derived by the associated entity is attributed to the working person under the income attribution rule (s GB 27(2)(c)). The income attributed to the working person must be calculated by applying all of the calculation rules contained in s GB 29 including the loss restriction rules contained in s GB 29(1). The $70,000 threshold is based on the working person’s net income which includes all income including from sources such as income from business, dividends, interest, rent, wages and salary, and attribution income. 23. This threshold is designed to ensure the income attribution rule does not apply if the working person’s net income for the year, calculated in accordance with all of the rules contained in s GB 29, is less than $70,000 (which is the income level at which the 33% top marginal rate of tax commences). If the working person’s net income from all sources including the amount of attribution income calculated in accordance with all of the rules contained in s GB 29, is less than $70,000, there are limited tax advantages from interposing the associated entity between the working person and the buyer. 24. The working person’s income is calculated by reference to income that would have been earned if the income attribution rule applied. This is effectively the income that the working person would have had, if the associated entity had not been interposed. Example 6. Income earned by working person Lauraco (the associated entity) earns $100,000 this year and pays a salary of $60,000 to Laura (the working person). Question Has Laura earned more than $70,000 for the purposes of the attribution rule? Answer Yes, Laura has earned more than $70,000 if the income attribution rule applies. As the amount paid as a salary to Laura is under the $70,000 threshold Laura might argue that the income attribution rule does not apply. However, if the income attribution rule applied a further $40,000 would be attributed by the associated entity. Accordingly, Laura’s net income for the purposes of this threshold requirement is $100,000, not just the $60,000 paid. Example 7. $70,000 threshold for net income Mattco (the associated entity) earns $50,000 this year and paid a salary of $30,000 to Matt (the working person). Matt also received $10,000 of rental income from a rental property he owns. Question Has Matt earned more than $70,000 for the purposes of the attribution rule? Answer No, Matt has only earned $60,000 net income if the income attribution rule applies. Matt’s $60,000 net income consists of $10,000 rent, $30,000 salary and $20,000 of attribution income. The answer would be yes if Matt received $26,000 of rental income. Matt would then earn $76,000 which would consist of $26,000 rent, $30,000 salary and $20,000 of attribution income. 9 IS 19/02 UNCLASSIFIED 25. When calculating the amount of income for the working person it is necessary to also consider the taxable value of any fringe benefit the working person receives (s GB 28(5)). Does 80% of the associated entity’s income from personal services come from one buyer or two or more associated buyers? 26. The income attribution rule will only apply where 80% of the associated entity’s total income from personal services is from one buyer or from two or more buyers if those buyers are associated persons (s GB 27(2)(a)). 27. The inclusion of this requirement ensures that contracts are not divided between existing entities associated with the buyer, or that the buyer does not incorporate new companies to ensure the 80% threshold is not met. 28. To determine whether two buyers are associated, the general associated persons rules in subpart YB apply. In summary, the associated persons rules treat two people as being associated where they are: • two companies, if either a group of persons hold total voting interests in each company of 50% or more, or if the group of persons control both companies by any other means; • a company and a person (other than a company) if the person has a voting interest in the company of 25% or more; • relatives; • a trustee of a trust and: o a beneficiary of the trust; o the settlor of the trust; o a person who is related to a beneficiary; o a trustee of another trust with the same settlor; or o a person with the power to appoint or remove the trustee; • a settlor of a trust and a beneficiary of the trust; • a partnership and a partner (excluding limited partnerships, which are treated as companies); • a look-through company and a look through owner who is a director or employee; or • each associated with a third person. 29. This Interpretation Statement does not go into detail about the application of the associated persons provisions. For more information see “New Definitions of ‘Associated Persons’” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 21, No 8 (October/November 2009): 75. Example 8. Associated persons – two buyers Bob owns all of the share capital of Bobco and is the sole employee of Bobco. Bob is the working person and Bobco is the associated entity. The buyers of Bobco’s services are AUSCO and its wholly owned subsidiary NZCO. Both of the buyer companies have entered into separate contracts with Bobco which will each provide 40% of Bobco’s total income. Bobco is aware that NZCO is a wholly owned subsidiary of AUSCO. 10 IS 19/02 UNCLASSIFIED Question: Does Bob earn 80% of his income from the buyer and a person associated with the buyer? Answer: Yes, Bob does earn 80% of his income from the buyer and a person associated with that buyer. AUSCO and NZCO are associated with each other, which means 80% of Bobco’s total income is derived from the supply of services to a combination of the buyer and a person associated with the buyer (that is, AUSCO and NZCO). Example 9. Associated persons – buyer with multiple customers Ann owns all of the share capital of Service Ltd and is the sole employee of Service Ltd. The buyer of Service Ltd’s services is Computersupport Ltd which provides a wide variety of computer services to 15 third party clients. Service Ltd has no clients apart from Computersupport Ltd. The contract between Service Ltd and Computersupport Ltd requires Service Ltd to provide direct “helpdesk” services as and when required to all of the 15 third party clients of Computersupport Ltd. Question Is Ann providing her services to one buyer? Answer: Yes, Ann is providing her services to one buyer. Ann is the working person and Service Ltd is the associated entity. The associated entity Service Ltd has only one client, Computersupport Ltd, which is the buyer. It is irrelevant that Service Ltd is providing computer helpdesk services to Computersupport Ltd’s 15 clients. There are no contracts between Service Ltd and the 15 third party clients of Computersupport Ltd. Example 10. Associated persons – buyer and associated entity associated Alan owns all of the share capital of Parent Ltd, Manufacturing Ltd, Distribution Ltd and Retail Ltd. Alan is the sole employee of Parent Ltd and is the working person. Parent Ltd is the associated entity that provides services to the three sister companies Manufacturing Ltd, Distribution Ltd and Retail Ltd, which are the buyers. Parent Ltd does not provide services to any other taxpayers. Question: Is Alan providing all his services to one buyer? Answer: Yes, Alan is providing all his services to one buyer. Parent Ltd, Manufacturing Ltd, Distribution Ltd and Retail Ltd are associated with each other which means all of Parent Ltd’s income is derived from the supply of services to a combination of the buyer and persons associated with the buyer (that is, Manufacturing Ltd, Distribution Ltd and Retail Ltd). 30. The income attribution rule may apply one year to an associated entity and cease to apply the next year. This could happen where an associated entity is working for one buyer but changes its contract midway through the year to a different, unassociated buyer. 31. This situation was considered when the income attribution rule was enacted and the decision was that although the rule may be arbitrary in this regard, the preference was to keep the rule simple to understand and apply. 11 IS 19/02 UNCLASSIFIED Example 11. Change of buyers Fiona (the working person) has been providing 100% management services, through her associated entity FJH Ltd, to a payroll company for years. Six months into the current income year, that contract ends and Fiona and the associated entity contracts for six months with a different, unassociated, independent payroll company. The new contract is on the same terms and for the same amount as the previous contract. Question: Will the income attribution rule apply to FJH Ltd for the current income year? Answer: No, the income attribution rule will not apply to FJH Ltd for the current income year. Because Fiona is earning the same amount in relation to each unassociated buyer, she can only be earning 50% from one buyer and the income attribution rule will not apply. There was only one buyer in the year before the change, so the income attribution rule does apply to that year. It is also possible that the income attribution rule may apply to the year after the change (if there are no other buyers). 32. Section GB 28 also contains rules relating to associated persons that are relevant when determining whether two buyers are associated. A person is only treated as being associated with another person for the income attribution rule if they are associated at the time the working person performs the services (s GB 28(2)). Also, no association exists between two buyers where both of them are public authorities (s GB 28(3)(a)). 33. Finally, there will be no association between two buyers where the working person cannot reasonably be expected to know that the two buyers are associated, other than by making a specific inquiry (s GB 28(3)(b)). An example of this would be if the working person were providing services to a company (an arm’s length third party) that is part of a large group, and that company had several related companies (also arm’s length) that were also contracting with the working person. 34. There is a difference between a person “knowing” that parties are associated (which would be subjective) and being “reasonably expected to know”. The use of the words “reasonably expected to know” rather than just “know” indicates that it is an objective test. Accordingly, the question is whether a reasonable person should know. 35. The Commissioner considers that the working person should reasonably be able to know that two buyers may be associated where the associated buyers have similar names, where the working person was contracting with the same person on behalf of two buyers, where there is obvious and immediately accessible public information available to the working person about the buyers, or where there is local or regional knowledge of the association. The requirement that the person should be “reasonably expected to know” will depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. Example 12. Associated persons - knowledge Clare owns all of the share capital of Clareco and is the sole employee of Clareco. Clare is the working person and Clareco is the associated entity. The buyers of Clareco services are AUSCO and its wholly owned subsidiary NZCO. Both buyer companies have entered into separate contracts with the associated entity that will each provide 50% of Clareco’s total income. Clare is not aware that NZCO is a wholly owned subsidiary of AUSCO. The buyers have different company names, and different employees entered into the contracts with the associated entity. Question: 12 IS 19/02 UNCLASSIFIED Can Clare be reasonably expected to know that AUSCO and NZCO are associated buyers? Answer: No, Clare cannot be reasonably expected to know that a particular buyer (NZCO) is associated with another buyer (AUSCO) without making specific enquires. The working person (Clare) is not aware of the 100% common shareholding between AUSCO and NZCO and would not reasonably be expected to know they are associated because: - The two buyers have different company names. - The two contracts were negotiated and entered into with different employees of NZCO and AUSCO. However, the answer might be different if AUSCO and NZCO were in the same industry and the services Clare provided were very similar with overlap between the first and the second contract in terms of timeframes, price and so on. Is 80% of the associated entity’s income from personal services earned by the working person or a relative of the working person or a combination of them? 36. The income attribution rules will only apply where 80% or more of the associated entity’s income from personal services during the income year is derived through services personally performed by the working person, a relative of the working person, or a combination of both of them (s GB 27(2)(b)). The inclusion of personal services performed by a relative of the working person is designed to ensure personal services cannot be split between relatives to make them appear to fall outside the income attribution rules. A common example would be where the services are provided by spouses or by a parent and an adult child. 37. “Relative” is defined in s YA 1 as a person connected with another person by being: • within the second degree of blood relationship to the other; • in a marriage, civil union, or de facto relationship with the other; • in a marriage, civil union, or de facto relationship with a person who is within the second degree of blood relationship to the other; • adopted as a child of the other or as a child of a person who is within the first degree of relationship to the other; or • the trustee of a trust under which a relative has benefited or is eligible to benefit. 38. This definition is consistent with the meaning of “relative” in the associated persons provisions, and covers parents, siblings and children. 39. The definition of “relative” is, however, limited by s GB 28(4) for the purposes of the income attribution rules. Section GB 28(4) states that a person is a relative of the working person only if the person is a relative at the beginning of the relevant income year. As an example, if during an income year two persons who each provide services to the entity begin a de facto relationship, they will not be caught within the provision until the next income year. However, if two people are in a de facto relationship, but split up during the year, they will be treated as being associated for the purposes of the income attribution rule for that income year. 13 IS 19/02 UNCLASSIFIED Example 13. Relatives of working person Dawn and her spouse Richard own all of the share capital of D&Dco. Dawn is the only full time employee of D&Dco. Richard and their adult children Diana and David are equally capable of providing the same services that would otherwise have been provided by Dawn. D&Dco is the associated entity. There is a single buyer of D&Dco services. The contract between D&Dco and the buyer provides that 50% of the services will be provided by Dawn and 50% of the services will be provided by Richard. The contract also provides that Richard can arrange for all or a proportion of his services to be provided by Diana or David or both. Question: Are Dawn and her relatives providing more than 80% of their services to a buyer? Answer: Yes, Dawn and her relatives are providing more than 80% of their services to a buyer. More than 80% (in this case 100%) of the services provided by D&Dco will be provided by a combination of the working person (Dawn) and the relatives of Dawn (Richard, Diana or David). Are there substantial business assets? 40. The income attribution rules will not apply if the associated entity: • has “substantial business assets”; and • those assets are a necessary part of the business structure that is used to derive the associated entity’s income from the provision of personal services to the buyer. 41. If the associated entity does not have substantial business assets, or those assets are not a necessary part of the business structure that is used to derive gross income from the provision of personal services, then income attribution may be required (subject to the application of the other thresholds and exemptions discussed in this Interpretation Statement) (s GB 27(2)(d)). 42. The substantial business assets test is designed to recognise that when substantial business assets are used in the associated entity’s business of providing personal services there should also be a return on that capital. For example, the owner-driver of a petrol tanker should receive a return based on both the asset employed and the labour provided. 43. The expression “substantial business assets” is defined in s GB 28(6) as depreciable property that: • has a total cost of more than: o $75,000; or o 25% or more of the associated entity’s total income from services for the income year; and • is not for “private use”, which will not apply where the private use of the depreciable property is 20% or less of its total use (s GB 28(8)). 44. “Substantial business assets” can comprise a single asset or multiple assets. 45. The questions that need to be considered to determine whether an associated entity has substantial business assets are summarised in Flowchart 2. 14 IS 19/02 UNCLASSIFIED 46. The text following the flowchart to \[85\] considers each question in the order that it appears in the flowchart. Flowchart 2: Are there substantial business assets? Does the associated entity have depreciable property? 47. As stated above, to have a “substantial business asset”, an associated entity must have property that is “depreciable property”. 48. “Depreciable property” is, generally, defined as being property that, in normal circumstances, might reasonably be expected to decline in value while it is used or available for use in deriving assessable income, or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income (s EE 6). Depreciable property includes items that are “depreciable intangible property” (listed in sch 14). These items include property such as a patent or the right to use a patent, and the right to use a copyright. However, “depreciable property” does not include items of property that are listed in s EE 7, such as land, trading stock, and financial arrangements. 49. To be depreciable property, the substantial business assets must be used, or available for use, to derive the associated entity’s assessable income from the provision of personal services. Not all property will automatically satisfy this requirement. Property that is used for private use is unlikely to satisfy this test. This is consistent with the definition of “substantial business assets”. Yes z No No No No No Yes Yes z Yes Yes Does the associated entity have depreciable property? See \[46\] to \[48\] Is the depreciable property a necessary part of the associated entity’s business structure for the provision of personal services? See \[49\] to \[52\] Yes, there are substantial business assets Did the depreciable property cost more than $75,000 or more than 25% of the associated entity’s income from personal services for the year? See \[53\] to \[56\] Is that private use 20% or less? See \[66\] to \[70\] No, there are no substantial business assets Is the depreciable property available for private use? See \[57\] to \[65\] 15 IS 19/02 UNCLASSIFIED Is the depreciable property a necessary part of the associated entity’s business structure for the provision of personal services? 50. As discussed above, it is a requirement that the depreciable property be a necessary part of the associated entity’s business structure that is used to provide personal services to the buyer. The first step is to identify the business that the associated entity is undertaking and then the structure that is being used. In most cases the business being undertaken by the associated entity will be self-evident. It can then be considered whether the particular assets being considered (to be substantial business assets) are a necessary part of the business structure. 51. An associated entity’s “business structure” is the structure or organisation that has been established to carry out the associated entity’s contractual obligations to the buyer of the working person’s services (CIR v Trustpower Ltd (2016) 27 NZTC 22-010 (CA); Sun Newspapers Ltd v FCT (1938) 5 ATD 87 (HCA)). 52. The dictionary definitions of “necessary” indicate that the depreciable property must be essential, vital, indispensable or imperative to the success of the activity being performed. Case law indicates that the word “necessary” can have a narrow or a wide interpretation depending on the statutory context. In the context of the income attribution rule, which is a specific anti-avoidance rule, the Commissioner’s view is that the word “necessary” should be narrowly interpreted (Pabari v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions \[2005\] 1 All ER 287). 53. Therefore, it is the Commissioner’s view that business assets must be indispensable or essential to the provision of the particular services provided by the working person to the buyer of those services. Tools and equipment that are only infrequently (if at all) used by a working person to perform the personal services provided to a buyer of the personal services may not satisfy the narrow test of indispensability. Example 14. Necessary business tools Wendy the plumber is the working person. She is a very experienced plumber and is employed by her associated entity. The associated entity’s business is providing plumbing services. The associated entity owns all of the plumbing equipment that Wendy needs to carry out her work and a van to carry that equipment. The buyer is constructing a large commercial building that will take at least three years to build. Question Are the plumbing equipment and van a necessary part of the business structure? Answer Yes the plumbing equipment and the van owned by the associated entity are a necessary part of the associated entity’s business structure. Example 15. Necessary business tools Barry the builder is the working person. Barry is employed by his associated entity which runs a business providing building services. All of the income of the associated entity is from a single buyer. The buyer owns all of the building equipment that Barry needs to carry out the buyer’s building contract. The buyer also provides a vehicle to transport Barry from the buyer’s premises to the construction site. The associated entity owns some equipment that is not used for building and it is stored at Barry's private residence. Barry uses a motor vehicle owned by the associated entity to drive from his private residence to the buyer’s premises. Barry then uses the buyers building equipment and motor vehicle to travel to the construction site. 16 IS 19/02 UNCLASSIFIED Question Are the associated entity’s equipment and motor vehicle a necessary part of the business structure? Answer No, based on the facts provided the associated entity’s equipment and motor vehicle are not necessary parts of the business structure (while the motor vehicle may be a necessary part of the business structure more information would be needed before this could be decided). The equipment owned by the associated entity is not a necessary part of the business structure because it does not relate to the business of the associated entity and the buyer provides Barry with all of the building equipment necessary. Did the depreciable property cost more than $75,000 or more than 25% of the associated entity’s income from personal services for the year? 54. Depreciable property will only be a “substantial business asset” if it has a total cost of more than (s GB 28(6)(a)): • $75,000; or • 25% or more of the associated entity’s total income from personal services for the income year. 55. These are alternative tests, either of which must be satisfied. 56. This test requires the taxpayer to correctly ascertain the relationship between the cost of their depreciable property and the two statutory thresholds. It is “cost” and not market value that is relevant. The “cost” will be the same as the cost the associated entity uses for depreciation purposes. 57. The most common categories of business assets owned by associated entities include motor vehicles, tools and equipment, computers and communication equipment. Example 16. Substantial business assets – monetary thresholds Cost of depreciable property $40,000 Total income from services $120,000 25% of total income from services $30,000 Statutory amount $75,000 Question Does the asset meet the monetary threshold? Answer Yes, the asset meets the monetary threshold. The cost of the depreciable property is $40,000 which is less than the statutory amount of $75,000. The first limb of the test is not satisfied. However, the cost of $40,000 is more than 25% of income from personal services which is $30,000. The second limb of the test is satisfied. Example 17. Substantial business assets – monetary thresholds Cost of depreciable property $50,000 Total income from services $240,000 25% of total income from services $60,000 Statutory amount $75,000 Question Does the asset meet the monetary threshold? 17 IS 19/02 UNCLASSIFIED Answer No, the asset does not meet the monetary threshold. The cost of the depreciable property is $50,000 which is less that the statutory amount of $75,000. The cost is also less than 25% of income from personal services which is $60,000. The test has not been satisfied because the taxpayer has failed both of the alternative tests. Example 18. Substantial business assets – monetary thresholds Cost of depreciable property $80,000 Total income from services $280,000 25% of total income from services $70,000 Statutory amount $75,000 Question Does the asset meet the monetary threshold? Answer Yes. The asset meets the monetary threshold. The cost of the depreciable property is $80,000 which is more than the statutory amount of $75,000. The cost is also more than 25% of income from personal services which is $70,000. The test is satisfied because the taxpayer has satisfied both of the alternative tests (and only one test needs to be satisfied). Example 19. Substantial business assets – monetary thresholds Cost of depreciable property $80,000 Total income from services $360,000 25% of total income from services $90,000 Statutory amount $75,000 Question Does the asset meet the monetary threshold? Answer Yes, the asset meets the monetary threshold. The cost of the depreciable property is $80,000 which is more than the statutory amount of $75,000. The first of the alternative tests has been satisfied. It does not matter that the cost of $80,000 is less than 25% of income from personal services which is $90,000. The test is satisfied because the taxpayer is required to satisfy only one of the alternative tests. Is the depreciable property used for private use? 58. Depreciable property may not be a “substantial business asset” if it is used for private use (subject to the 20% test discussed from \[67\]). 59. The Act does not contain a general definition of “private use”. The dictionary definitions relevantly indicate that “private” refers to the part of a person’s life that is concerned with situations or activities in a person’s personal relationships and activities rather than with the person’s work or business relationships (CIR v Haenga (1985) 7 NZTC 5, 198 (CA)). 60. Many business assets, such as computers, printers, tablets, smart phones tools and equipment, are capable of being used for both business and non-business activities. In relation to the use of such assets, the Commissioner considers that any use that is not in the course of undertaking specific income earning activities should be classified as private use. Private use of motor vehicles 61. The Act contains a specific definition of “private use” for motor vehicles. Under s CX 36, private use for a motor vehicle includes: 18 IS 19/02 UNCLASSIFIED • the employee’s use of the vehicle for travel between home and work; and • any other travel that confers a private benefit on the employee (for example, use after hours, during the weekend or when the working person is on leave). 62. Section GB 28(9), which sets out how to calculate the percentage of private use of a substantial business asset (discussed from \[67\]), refers to the number of days for which fringe benefit tax (FBT) is payable for the property. Because FBT is payable for motor vehicles depending on their private use, this definition is also relevant when determining the private use of a motor vehicle for the purposes of the substantial business asset test. 63. This Interpretation Statement briefly discusses where there will be private use of a motor vehicle. For more information on this topic see “Travel by Motor Vehicle Between Home and Work – Deductibility of Expenditure and FBT Implications” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 16, No 10 (November 2004): 31 (IS 3448), and IS 17/07 “Fringe Benefit Tax – Motor Vehicles” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 29, No 9 (October 2017): 12. Travel between home and work 64. In most cases, the Commissioner considers that travel between home and work in a vehicle owned by an associated entity will confer a private advantage and be considered private use of that vehicle. However, where a home is also a workplace and an employee is required for sound business reasons to travel to perform employment duties partly at the home workplace and partly at another workplace, then no private benefit will be conferred by that travel (CIR v Schick (1998) 18 NZTC 13,738 (HC)). 65. If the working person’s home is also the associated entity’s premises, and sound business reasons exist for this arrangement, travel in a motor vehicle from the home to the buyer’s premises will be considered work-to-work travel. This travel will not be considered private use for s GB 28(6)(b). 66. If the associated entity’s premises are separate from the working person’s home, the standard rules relating to FBT and motor vehicles as set out in IS 17/07 and IS3448 apply. It is likely that any travel between home and those premises in a motor vehicle will be considered private use under s GB 28(6)(b). Is the private use 20% or less? 67. The phrase “private use” is limited for the purposes of the income attribution rule so that where the private use of the depreciable property is 20% or less of its total use it will not be considered private use (s GB 28(8)). 68. This limitation means depreciable property may satisfy the test for substantial business assets even if there is an element of private use or enjoyment, provided the level of private use is not more than 20% of the total use. Or, to put it another way, the classification of an asset as a substantial business asset will not change in cases where the business use of that asset is at least 80%. 69. Section GB 28(9) provides guidance on calculating the percentage of private use of a business asset. 70. In the case of property that is subject to the FBT rules, the percentage of private use must be calculated by comparing the number of days for which FBT is 19 IS 19/02 UNCLASSIFIED payable with the total days in the tax year in which the property is owned or is subject to a specified lease, a finance lease or a hire purchase agreement. 71. In the case of all other property (including any property that is excluded from FBT under s CX 21), the percentage of private use must be calculated by comparing the expenditure relating to the property that is non-deductible as a result of the private use with the total expenditure relating to the property incurred in the tax year. Are the services being provided essential support for a product? 72. The income attribution rule will not apply to the extent that the services provided by a working person are essential support for a product supplied by the working person’s associated entity (s GB 27(3)(c)). 73. Various dictionary definitions suggest that the word “product”, when read in this context, describes the sale of something that has been produced or acquired by the associated entity that is sold to the buyer. Example 20. Essential support for a product Computer Comprehensive Service Ltd is the associated entity that has entered into a contract with its only customer, a government department (the buyer). The contract requires Computer Comprehensive Service Ltd to install a new computer system, provide software and hardware support and provide “hands on” training to the buyer’s staff. All of the staff training will be undertaken by the working person at the buyer’s premises. Question: Does the income attribution rule apply? Answer: No, the income attribution rule does not apply. Computer Comprehensive Service Ltd (the associated entity) has agreed to provide the government department (the buyer) with a computer system, software and hardware support, and comprehensive hands on training. The training services the working person provides are essential support for the hardware and software (the product) that Computer Comprehensive Service Ltd sold to the government department. Is the amount being attributed less than $5,000? 74. The income attribution rule will not apply where the total amount to be attributed to the working person by the associated entity is less than $5,000. This means that if the amount attributed under s GB 29 is less than $5,000, no attribution need be made (s GB 27(3)(d)). 75. However, if the working person has more than one associated entity, this exemption can apply only once (s GB 27(3)(d)(i)). This means the second entity must attribute income regardless of the level of that income. Is the associated entity a controlled foreign company? 76. The $5,000 exemption will not apply if the associated entity is a CFC. This is to ensure that all income from CFCs is returned regardless of the amount. A separate exemption that may apply for CFCs is discussed at \[20\] and \[21\]. 20 IS 19/02 UNCLASSIFIED References Subject references associated persons attribution of income from personal services controlled foreign companies income tax Legislative references Income Tax Act 2007 – ss CQ 2, CX 21, CX 36, CX 38, DN 2, EE 6, EE 7, EX 1, GB 27 to GB 29, in s YA 1 (“associated persons”, “ car”, “motor vehicle”, “relative”), subpart YB, ss YD 1, YD 2, sch 14 Land Transport Act 1998, s 2 (“motor vehicle) Case references Case P26 (1992) 14 NZTC 4,196 (TRA) Case R37 (1994) 16 NZTC 6,208 (TRA) Case S26 (1994) 17 NZTC 7,182 (TRA) Case T38 (1997) 18 NZTC 8,255 (TRA) CIR v Haenga (1985) 7 NZTC 5,198 (CA) CIR v Schick (1998) 18 NZTC 13,738 (HC) CIR v Trustpower Ltd (2016) 27 NZTC 22-010 (CA) Pabari v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions \[2005\] 1 All ER 287 (EWCA Civ) Sun Newspapers Ltd v FCT (1938) 5 ATD 87 (HCA) Other references “Attribution of Income” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 12, No 12 (December 2000): 49 “IS 16/03: Tax Residence” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 28, No 10 (October 2016): 2 “IS 17/07: Fringe Benefit Tax – Motor Vehicles” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 29, No 9 (October 2017): 12 “New Definitions of ‘Associated Persons’” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 21, No 8 (October/November 2009): 75 “Travel by Motor Vehicle between Home and Work – Deductibility of Expenditure and FBT Implications” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 16, No 10 (November 2004): 31 21 IS 19/02 UNCLASSIFIED Appendix – Legislation Sections GB 27 to GB 29 provide: GB 27 Attribution rule for income from personal services Application of section GB 29 (1) An amount of income in an income year of a person (the associated entity) is attributed to another person (the working person) under section GB 29 for the working person’s corresponding tax year if,— (a) during the income year, a third person (the buyer) acquires services from the associated entity, and the services are personally performed by the working person; and (b) the working person is associated with the associated entity; and (c) the threshold test in subsection (2) is met; and (d) none of the exemptions in subsection (3) applies. Threshold for application of attribution rule (2) The attribution occurs only if— (a) 80% or more of the associated entity’s total income from personal services during the income year is derived from the supply of services to the buyer, a person associated with the buyer, or a combination of them; and (b) 80% or more of the associated entity’s income from personal services during the income year is derived through services personally performed by the working person, a relative of the working person, or a combination of them; and (c) the working person’s net income for the income year, assuming section GB 29 applies in relation to the associated entity and working person, is more than $70,000; and (d) substantial business assets are not a necessary part of the business structure that is used to derive the total income referred to in paragraph (a). Exemptions (3) The attribution does not occur— (a) if both the associated entity and the working person are non-residents at all times during the associated entity’s income year: (b) if the associated entity is a natural person and is neither a partner of a partnership nor a trustee of a trust: (c) to the extent to which the services personally performed by the working person are essential support for a product supplied by the associated entity: (d) if the total amount to be attributed to the working person, for the associated entity and the income year, is less than $5,000, unless— (i) the application of this paragraph would prevent income being attributed to the working person for the income year in relation to another associated entity: (ii) the associated entity is a CFC and a person who holds an attributing interest in the CFC files, after the date (the Royal assent date) on which the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Act 2016 receives the Royal assent, a return of income in which the amount of income attributed to the working person is determined under this section: (e) if the associated entity is a CFC and— (i) the amount gives rise to attributed CFC income under section CQ 2(2B) (When attributed CFC income arises) or attributed CFC loss under 22 IS 19/02 UNCLASSIFIED section DN 2(2) (When attributed CFC loss arises) for a person who holds an attributing interest in the CFC; and (ii) the person who holds the attributing interest in the CFC files, after the Royal assent date, a return of income in which the amount attributed to the working person is determined under section EX 20B (Attributable CFC amount). Treatment of certain dividends (4) If a company that is required to attribute an amount to the working person under this section pays a dividend, sections HA 14 to HA 19 (which relate to qualifying companies) are treated as applying to the company and the dividend if the company— (a) has no net income for the tax year in which it pays the dividend other than income attributed under this section, ignoring interest income that is incidental to the company’s business; and (b) is not a qualifying company; and (c) chooses to have the dividend treated as if it were paid by a qualifying company. Cancellation of notional imputation credits (5) For the purposes of subsection (4), to the extent to which the dividend paid by the company would have had an imputation credit attached that arose under section OB 16 (ICA attribution for personal services) in the absence of the election made under subsection (4)(c), the credit is treated as cancelled immediately before it would have been attached under sections HA 14 to HA 19 (which relate to dividends paid by qualifying companies). GB 28 Interpretation of terms used in section GB 27 When this section applies (1) This section applies for the purposes of section GB 27. Associated persons (2) A person is treated as being associated with another person if they are associated at the time the services are personally performed by the working person. Non-associated buyers (3) For the purposes of section GB 27(2)(a), a buyer is not treated as being associated with another buyer if either— (a) both buyers are public authorities; or (b) the working person cannot be reasonably expected to know that a particular buyer is associated with another buyer, other than by making a specific enquiry. Relatives (4) For the purposes of section GB 27(2)(b), a person is a relative of the working person only if the person is a relative at the beginning of the relevant income year of the working person. Fringe benefits included (5) For the purposes of section GB 27(2)(c), the working person’s annual gross income includes the taxable value of a fringe benefit, as determined under sections RD 25 to RD 63 (which relate to fringe benefit tax), provided or granted by a person associated with the working person. Meaning of substantial business assets (6) Substantial business assets means depreciable property that— (a) at the end of the associated entity’s corresponding income year, has a total cost of more than either— 23 IS 19/02 UNCLASSIFIED (i) $75,000; or (ii) 25% or more of the associated entity’s total income from services for the income year; and (b) is not for private use. Assets subject to finance lease, hire purchase agreement, or specified lease (7) For the purposes of subsection (6)(a), the cost of depreciable property includes— (a) the consideration provided to the lessee in the case of property subject to a finance lease or a hire purchase agreement, including expenditure or loss incurred by the lessee in preparing and installing the finance lease asset for use, unless the lessee is allowed a deduction for the expenditure or loss, other than a deduction for an amount of depreciation loss: (b) the cost price, in the case of property subject to a specified lease. Private use of assets (8) Subsection (6)(b) does not apply to depreciable property if 20% or less of the property’s use is for private use. Calculation of private proportion of use (9) For the purposes of subsection (8), the percentage of a property’s use for private purposes for an income year is calculated according to— (a) the proportion that the number of days for which fringe benefit tax is payable by the associated entity in relation to the property bears to the total number of days in the income year in which the property is owned by or is subject to a finance lease, hire purchase agreement, or specified lease, involving the associated entity, if the property is subject to the FBT rules: (b) the proportion that the expenditure incurred in relation to the property, for which a deduction is denied to the associated entity, bears to all expenditure incurred by the associated entity in relation to the property in the income year, if the property is not subject to the FBT rules. GB 29 Attribution rule: calculation Amount attributed (1) A working person is treated as deriving income in an income year equal to the least of the following amounts: (a) the associated entity’s net income for the corresponding tax year, calculated as if their only income were derived from personal services: (b) the associated entity’s net income for the corresponding tax year: (c) if and to the extent to which the associated entity is a company or a trust that has a loss balance to be carried forward under section IA 4 (Using loss balances carried forward to tax year) arising from a business or a trading activity of supplying personal services, the associated entity’s net income for the corresponding tax year after subtracting the loss balance carried forward from an earlier corresponding tax year. Calculation for trustee or partnership (2) For the purposes of calculating the associated entity’s net income for the corresponding tax year in the application of subsection (1),— (a) if the associated entity is a trustee of a trust, the trustees are treated as not having made a distribution of beneficiary income out of the year’s income: (b) if the associated entity is a partnership, the associated entity is treated as a taxpayer and section HG 2 (Partnerships are transparent) does not apply: (c) if the associated entity is a look-through company, the associated entity is treated as a taxpayer and section HB 1 (Look-through companies are transparent) does not apply. 24 IS 19/02 UNCLASSIFIED Salary paid or fringe benefits treated as deductions (3) For the purposes of calculating the associated entity’s net income for the corresponding tax year in the application of subsection (1),— (a) the associated entity is allowed a deduction for employment income paid to the working person during the income year: (b) the associated entity is allowed a deduction for the taxable value of a fringe benefit provided or granted by the associated entity to the working person during the income year, and for the fringe benefit tax payable on the fringe benefit. Reduction of attributable income for distributions (4) For the purposes of calculating the associated entity’s net income for the corresponding tax year in the application of subsection (1), the amount of net income of the associated entity for the corresponding tax year is reduced by— (a) in the case of a trustee of a trust, the amount of beneficiary income derived by the working person from the trust in the income year: (b) in the case of a partnership, the share of profits allocated by the partnership to the working person: (c) in the case of a company, a dividend paid— (i) by the associated entity to the working person during the income year or before the end of 6 months after the end of the income year; and (ii) from income derived in the income year. Attribution reduced by market value of administrative services (5) If the associated entity is a partnership that receives administrative services from another person related to their income from personal services and has not paid for the administrative services, the amount to be attributed to the working person is reduced by the market value of the administrative services provided by the other person. Reduction of beneficiary income when rule results in trust having tax loss (6) If the associated entity is a trustee and the amount attributable would cause the associated entity to have a tax loss for the corresponding tax year, for the purposes of this Act,— (a) beneficiary income from the trust for the income year must be reduced to the extent to which the associated entity’s taxable income for the corresponding tax year is zero; and (b) the reduction in beneficiary income must be divided among the beneficiaries other than the working person— (i) according to proportions determined by the trust’s trustees: (ii) if the trustees do not make the determination, according to the proportion that each beneficiary’s beneficiary income bears to the total beneficiary income from the trust for the income year. Attribution to more than 1 working person (7) If the amount attributable is to be attributed to more than 1 working person, the share attributed to each working person must reflect the respective value of the services personally performed by each working person.

However, in certain circumstances, s CW 20 of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides non-resident entertainers and sportspersons with an exemption. This statement considers s CW 20, and the circumstances in which the exemption will apply. This statement is primarily intended to assist those who are paying non-resident entertainers to decide whether the exemption in s CW 20 applies so that payers do not need to withhold tax from payments made. However, it may also be of assistance to non-resident entertainers who are unsure whether their income is exempt. The exemption in s CW 20 covers income received by a non-resident entertainer in four situations. The situations are where the non-resident entertainer carries out an activity or performance in New Zealand, and one of the following occurs: (a) The activity or performance occurs under a government cultural programme. This is where a cultural programme belongs to, and is funded by, either the New Zealand Government or an overseas central government. (See s CW 20(1)(a) and the discussion from \[23\].); or, (b) The activity or performance occurs under a cultural programme that is wholly or partly sponsored by a government. This is where the New Zealand Government or an overseas central government provides more than minimal funding for the cultural programme. (See s CW 20(1)(b) and the discussion from \[32\].); or, (c) The activity or performance occurs as part of a programme that belongs to certain types of overseas bodies. To fall within this category, an overseas body needs to be a foundation, trust or other organisation. The body needs to have a more than minimal purpose of promoting cultural activity. The body also cannot be carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any member, proprietor, or shareholder; that is, none of those persons should be entitled to the body’s surpluses or capital. (See s CW 20(1)(c) and the discussion from \[43\].); or, (d) The activity or performance relates to a game or sport, where the participants are official representatives of a body that administers the game or sport at a national level in an overseas country. (See s CW 20(2) and the discussion from \[68\].). Section CW 20(3) also exempts amounts derived by another person ( the Service Provider) who provides the services of a non-resident entertainer during a visit to New Zealand if certain conditions are met. In particular, the Service Provider must be related to the entertainer in one of the following ways: (a) The Service Provider is the non-resident entertainer’s “employer”. This can occur by the Service Provider engaging the non-resident entertainer as either an employee, or an independent contractor. (See from \[101\].) ; (b) The Service Provider is a company that has the non-resident entertainer as an officer. This will most commonly occur where the non-resident entertainer is a director of the Service Provider company that derives income by providing the entertainer’s services. (See from \[107\].); (c) The Service Provider is a firm that has the non-resident entertainer as a principal. This will most commonly apply where the Service Provider is some other kind of unincorporated business and the entertainer is one of the senior persons in that business. (See from \[110\].). 3 UNCLASSIFIED If the exemption applies, those paying the non-resident entertainer or Service Provider are not required to deduct tax from the payments they make to the non- resident entertainer or Service Provider. If the exemption does not apply, there is a withholding liability on payers to deduct tax from income paid to non-resident entertainers or Service Providers under the PAYE rules in subpart RD. This statement updates and replaces “Non-resident sports people and entertainers – application of section 61(17) of the Income Tax Act 1976” published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 4, No 3 (October 1992) (the 1992 item). Introduction The term “non-resident entertainer” is defined in s CW 20(4): Meaning of non-resident entertainer (4) In this section, non-resident entertainer means a non-resident person, as defined in subpart YD (Residence and source in New Zealand), who carries out an activity or performance in connection with— (a) a solo or group performance by actors, comperes, dancers, entertainers, musicians, singers, or other artists, whether for cultural, educational, entertainment, religious, or other purposes; or (b) lectures, speeches, or talks for any purpose; or (c) a sporting event or sporting competition of any nature. A wide variety of performers and sportspeople are covered by s CW 20(4) and could qualify for the exemption provided the requirements of s CW 20(1), (2) or (3) are met. In the Commissioner’s view, the entertainers covered by s CW 20(4) include performers on both stage and screen. This statement does not address whether a person is a non-resident for income tax purposes. More information about residency is in the Commissioner’s Interpretation Statement “ IS 16/03 Tax Residence” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 28, No 10 (October 2016). Under the Act, non-residents are generally taxed on only their New Zealand– sourced income: s BD 1(5). For non-resident entertainers, income that they earn from activities or performances in New Zealand will generally have a source in New Zealand: s YD 4(3), (4) and (17D). Broadly, the Act does one of two things in relation to a non-resident entertainer’s income. The Act either: (a) exempts the income under s CW 20, which depends on the circumstances of the non-resident entertainer’s activity or performance; or, (b) creates a withholding liability on payers to deduct tax from the income under the PAYE rules in subpart RD. The analysis in this statement focuses on the scope of s CW 20. The effects of the PAYE rules and double tax agreements are also briefly noted from \[ 118\] below, but those paying non-resident entertainers for their services do not need to consider those aspects if the exemption applies. 4 UNCLASSIFIED Analysis Introduction The analysis in this statement is structured in the following way: (a) First, the statement discusses the circumstances in which income derived by a non-resident entertainer, other than a sportsperson, will be exempt. The statement separately addresses each of the three circumstances listed in s CW 20. (b) Secondly, the statement discusses when income derived by a non-resident entertainer from sporting activities will be exempt. (c) Thirdly, the statement discusses what happens if the income is derived by the non-resident entertainer’s employer, or by a company or firm with which the entertainer has some connection, rather than by the entertainer. (d) Finally, the statement briefly notes the further matters that payers should consider where the exemption does not apply, including the PAYE rules, and applicable double tax agreements. Non-resident entertainers other than sportspersons Section CW 20(1) exempts income derived by a non-resident entertainer, other than a sportsperson, from carrying out their “activity or performance” if the activity or performance occurs in one or more of three circumstances listed in the provision. Each circumstance is listed in a separate paragraph of s CW 20(1), and only one of the three paragraphs in s CW 20(1) needs to be met for s CW 20(1) to apply. However, a common theme in each paragraph is the reference to a “cultural” programme or activity. A “cultural” programme or activity The ordinary meaning of “cultural” includes “relating to the arts and to intellectual achievements” (Concise Oxford English Dictionary, Oxford University Press, online ed). Case law also describes “cultural” as covering a wide range of artistic or cultural pursuits. For instance, the Court of Appeal in Molloy v CIR (1981) 5 NZTC 61,070 noted that that the word “may properly have attributed to it its ordinary dictionary meaning as relating to the training, development and refinement of mind, tastes and manners”. The word “cultural” was also considered in Conyngham & Ors v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs \[1986\] FCA 238, (1986) 68 ALR 423. Conyngham concerned an administrative policy under which temporary entry permits could be issued to entertainers or professionals who possessed a level of talent of such merit as to lead to “the continuing cultural enrichment of the Australian community”. An American vocal group known as “The Platters”, who sang songs from the 1950s delivered in 1950s style, had been denied a temporary entry permit to Australia under that policy. Wilcox J (at \[30\]) considered the word “cultural” in this context was not limited to specialised arts practised only by a minority. Rather, the term was used in its full and true sense as “pertaining to civilization”. He went on to say that not everyone will appreciate a particular entertainer or their performance. However, this does not prevent the performance from enriching the culture of the community by extending the opportunities and range of those who do appreciate it. 5 UNCLASSIFIED That a cultural performance is not limited to specialised arts is consistent with the definition of “non-resident entertainer” in s CW 20(4) which lists a wide variety of activities. Following case law, whether the entertainer is widely appreciated is not relevant. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary provides several definitions for “programme”. The most relevant of those definitions is: A set of related measures or activities with a particular long-term aim. Taking “programme” to mean a set of related measures or activities with a long- term aim, the ordinary meaning of “cultural programme” would therefore be a set of related measures or activities with a long-term aim of “culture”. Given a “programme” refers to a set of related measures or activities, a standalone or one-off project is unlikely to constitute a programme by itself. However, if that project forms part of a wider, for example, event or festival, the event or festival could be considered a programme. For clarity, the Commissioner notes that the “cultural” programmes and activities covered in the provision are not limited to those that were explicitly listed in the 1992 item. This statement goes on to consider separately the three circumstances set out in the three paragraphs in s CW 20(1). Government cultural programmes – s CW 20(1)(a) The first circumstance (under s CW 20(1)(a)) is where the non-resident entertainer’s activity or performance: ...occurs under a cultural programme of the New Zealand government or an overseas government... Having already discussed the meaning of “cultural programme”, the remaining issues in this paragraph are whether there is a programme “of” a government, and which “governments” qualify. The ordinary meaning of the word “of” in this context suggests that the cultural programme must be associated with, or belong to, that government: Concise Oxford English Dictionary definition of “of”. The initial reference to “government” is to “the New Zealand” government. This implies that it refers to the national government of New Zealand (that is, central government), rather than to local authorities defined by the Local Government Commission that are independent of, and subordinate to, central government: J Wilson, “Nation and Government: Local Government” in Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand (Ministry for Culture and Heritage, 2005, updated 16 September 2016). In context, then, the reference to an overseas government is to the national or central government of an overseas country and not to a local or state government. For completeness, if a non-resident entertainer’s activity or performance occurs under a cultural programme of, for instance, a local or state government s CW 20(1)(b) or (c) can still apply provided the other requirements in those provisions are met. The policy intention behind s CW 20(1) is to facilitate cultural exchanges between New Zealand and other countries that: 6 UNCLASSIFIED • are funded by the government; or, • occur under a programme of a cultural organisation the activities of which are not carried out for the private pecuniary profit of any member (covered by s CW 20(1)(c) which is discussed from \[43\]). The same policy reason for s CW 20(1)(a) underlies similar provisions in some of New Zealand’s double tax agreements (DTA). Some of these DTAs include a provision that income derived by a visiting non-resident entertainer will not be subject to New Zealand tax. In the absence of such a provision, the income will be taxable in the contracting state in which it is derived: art 17 of the OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital (the OECD Model Tax Convention). The OECD, in “Commentary on Article 17”, in Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital: Condensed Version 2017 (OECD Publishing, Paris, 2017) explains that some DTAs provide that article 17 does not apply if the entertainer or sports person is employed in events that are supported by public funds: 13. Article 17 will ordinarily apply when the entertainer or sportsperson is employed by a Government and derives income from that Government: see paragraph 6 of the Commentary on Article 19. Certain conventions contain provisions excluding entertainers and sports persons employed in organisations which are subsidised out of public funds from the application of Article 17. 14. Some countries may consider it appropriate to exclude from the scope of the Article events supported from public funds. Such countries are free to include a provision to achieve this but the exemptions should be based on clearly definable and objective criteria to ensure that they are given only where intended. Such a provision might read as follows: The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to income derived from activities performed in a Contracting State by entertainers or sportspersons if the visit to that State is wholly or mainly supported by public funds of one or both of the Contracting States or political subdivisions or local authorities thereof. In such a case, the income is taxable only in the Contracting State in which the entertainer or sportsperson is a resident. \[Emphasis added\] In this light, a cultural programme will belong to the government (New Zealand or overseas) if that programme is funded by the government. For completeness, the Commissioner notes that neither the wording nor the policy of the legislation requires: • the non-resident entertainer to be an employee of the government or a government agency; or • the funding to be by way of monetary remuneration to an employee. For example, the funding may take the form of a grant given under a government cultural programme. Government sponsored cultural programmes – s CW 20(1)(b) The second circumstance (under s CW 20(1)(b)) is where the non-resident entertainer’s activity or performance: ...occurs under a cultural programme wholly or partly sponsored by the New Zealand government or an overseas government... Unlike in s CW 20(1)(a), this circumstance does not require the cultural programme to belong to the New Zealand or overseas government. However, it does require 7 UNCLASSIFIED the programme to be “wholly or partly sponsored” by the government (New Zealand or overseas). The meaning of that phrase is considered further below. “Sponsored” To sponsor means to be a sponsor. “Sponsor” is defined in the Concise Oxford English Dictionary: 1 a person or organization who pays or contributes to the costs of an event or broadcast in return for advertising. 2 a person who pledges a sum of money to a charity after another person has participated in a fundraising event. 3 a person who introduces and supports a proposal for legislation. 4 a person taking official responsibility for the actions of another. The meanings of “sponsor” contemplate either financial or non-financial support. As noted in \[ 28\], the policy behind s CW 20(1) is to facilitate cultural exchanges between New Zealand and another country that are funded by: • the government, or • a cultural organisation the activities of which are not carried out for the private pecuniary profit of any member. In this light, the Commissioner’s view is that sponsorship of a cultural programme requires the government (New Zealand or overseas) to pay or contribute to the costs of that programme. That is, the cultural programme must be wholly or partly funded by the government. What must be sponsored is a “cultural programme” and the meaning of that term is discussed at \[ 14\] to \[19\]. Mere sponsorship of an entity is insufficient, unless that entity is carrying on a cultural programme, that cultural programme is sponsored, and the non-resident entertainer’s activity or performance occurs under that programme. “Wholly or partly” The phrase “wholly or partly” is not defined in the context of s CW 20(1)(b). The ordinary meaning of “wholly” is entirely or fully and the ordinary meaning of “partly” is to some extent or not completely (Concise Oxford English Dictionary). In Dyck v Lohrer \[2000\] BCJ No 629, the court interpreted “partly” as meaning something less than the entire part. The word “partly” means a piece, portion or part of a whole. It may mean a very small part or a very large part (Re Schlatter and Defence Force Retirement and Benefits Authority and Brown (1985) 8 ALD 133). In McKenzie v Baddeley \[1991\] NSWCA 197, the court considered “partly” in the context of the phrase “wholly or partly dependent”. It held that “partly” did not mean substantially. Rather, it meant “more than minimally” or “significantly”. The legislative context determines whether the phrase “wholly or partly” is a composite term or whether the word “partly” is read in isolation. The Commissioner’s view is that “wholly or partly” is a composite phrase where the meaning of “partly” is coloured by “wholly”. T he word “partly” used in conjunction with the word “wholly” requires that the promotion of cultural activity must be a more than minimal purpose of the organisation’s existence (McKenzie v Baddeley). 8 UNCLASSIFIED If a cultural programme is only minimally funded by the government, the Commissioner acknowledges that a boundary issue about the meaning of “partly” could arise. However, in such a case the Commissioner’s view is that the provision’s purpose should be considered. The Commissioner’s view is that the provision was intended to promote programmes that are likely to result in little or no profit or might not happen without government funding. In practice, where governments do provide funding, one of the criteria that is likely considered by the agency or authority responsible for that funding is whether a programme is likely to happen without government funding. As such, the Commissioner’s view is that a programme that has received government funding to any extent will be the kind of programme that was anticipated to qualify under the exemption. Overseas foundations, trusts or other cultural organisations – s CW 20(1)(c) The third circumstance (under s CW 20(1)(c)) is where the non-resident entertainer’s: ... activity or performance occurs as part of a programme of an overseas foundation, trust, or other organisation that— (i) exists wholly or partly to promote cultural activity; and (ii) is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any member, proprietor, or shareholder. Section CW 20(1)(c) shares some common language with s CW 20(1)(a) and (b). In particular, para (c) refers to a programme “of” an organisation. As in para (a), the word “of” in para (c) also denotes ownership. The programme must belong to an “overseas foundation, trust, or other organisation”. These terms are not defined in the Act so the ordinary meanings are relevant. A “foundation” is an institution established with an endowment: Concise Oxford English Dictionary. A “trust” is a fiduciary relationship where a person holds the title of property for the benefit of another: New Zealand Law Dictionary (8 th ed, LexisNexis NZ, Wellington, 2015). An “organisation” is an organised group of people with a particular purpose: Concise Oxford English Dictionary. In context, the Commissioner notes that the overseas “foundation, trust, or other organisation” is the same body that must not be “carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any member, proprietor, or shareholder”. The reference to a shareholder anticipates that an “other organisation” could include a company, since a trust or foundation would not be expected to have shareholders. Similarly, the references to “member” and “proprietor” suggest that other types of unincorporated bodies, such as partnerships or unincorporated societies, will qualify. On balance, the Commissioner’s view is that, in practice, the inclusion of “other organisation” in s CW 20(1)(c) indicates that the provision potentially applies to any overseas group of people that meets the stipulated requirements outlined in \[ 43\]. Importantly, s CW 20(1)(c) will apply only if the cultural programme belongs to an overseas foundation, trust or organisation. This means a performance under a programme of a New Zealand organisation will not meet the requirements of s CW 20(1)(c). This is so even if the entertainer is a non-resident. The Commissioner’s view is that the reference to an “overseas” body refers to a body that has been constituted, has been established or operates outside New Zealand. 9 UNCLASSIFIED Does the overseas body exist (wholly or partly) to promote cultural activity? For s CW 20(1)(c) to apply, the overseas organisation must “exist wholly or partly to promote cultural activity”. This phrase is undefined in the Act. However, in the Commissioner’s view, this phrase suggests a test of the organisation’s purpose (or purposes). The organisation’s purpose needs to be to “promote cultural activity”. The ordinary meaning of “promote” is to move forward or advance (Aporex Inc v Hoffmann La- Roche Ltd \[2000\] OJ No 4732). Therefore, for s CW 20(1)(c) to apply, a purpose of the overseas organisation must be (wholly or partly) to move forward or advance cultural activity. As discussed from \[ 14\], culture relates to the training, development and refinement of mind, tastes and manners; it is not limited to specialised arts but pertains to civilisation. The meaning of “wholly or partly” is discussed above at \[38\] to \[42\]. In summary, the case law suggests that “wholly or partly” can be read as “significantly” or “more than minimally”: McKenzie v Baddeley. As discussed at \[41\], “partly” cannot refer to “significantly”. Therefore, in the context of s CW 20(1)(c), the promotion of cultural activity must be a more than minimal purpose of the organisation’s existence. In determining if an organisation exists wholly or partly to promote cultural activity, it is necessary to consider the activities that the organisation actually engages in (Capital Club Pty Ltd v Commissioner of State Revenue (2007) ATC 4498). For the exemption in s CW 20(1)(c) to apply, the overseas organisation must have promoted cultural activity by providing an activity or performance by a non-resident entertainer in New Zealand as part of a programme. The exemption could apply where an overseas organisation exists to promote cultural activity and for other purposes. This is provided the promotion of cultural activity is a more than minimal purpose for the organisation’s existence. What does it mean for an activity not to be carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any member, proprietor or shareholder? The phrase “private pecuniary profit of any member, proprietor or shareholder” is not defined in the Act. C ase law suggests that an organisation will be viewed as not being carried on for private pecuniary profit if its surpluses or capital are unavailable for private benefit: Trustees of the Auckland Medical Aid Trust v CIR (1979) 4 NZTC 61,404 (HC). However, the cases also indicate that the requirement that funds not be available for the private pecuniary profit of a member does not prevent a person being paid for their services to the entity: Presbyterian Church of New Zealand Beneficiary Fund v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,185 (HC) and Hester & Ors v CIR (2005) 22 NZTC 19,007 (CA). In s CW 20(1)(c), the relevant individuals or groups are the members, proprietors or shareholders of the overseas foundation, trust or other organisation. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary defines “member”, “proprietor” and “shareholder” as: member ... a person ... that has joined a group, society, or team ... proprietor ... 1 the owner of a business. 2 a holder of property. shareholder ... an owner of shares in a company. The definitions “proprietor” and “shareholder” incorporate the concept of ownership. The meaning of “member” is arguably wider, suggesting that a person is a member 10 UNCLASSIFIED because of the nature of their relationship with an organisation. Therefore, the essence of being a member is that a person belongs to an organisation. However, in the context of s CW 20(1)(c), the “member” will be someone who could potentially receive a private pecuniary benefit from the organisation’s activity unless prohibited by constitution or other founding document. The grammar of s CW 20(1)(c) indicates that what cannot be carried on for private pecuniary profit of any member, proprietor or shareholder is the overseas foundation, trust or other organisation. Provided the requirements in s CW 20(1)(c) are met, it can still apply if the non-resident entertainer profits from their performance – as is clearly envisaged where a non-resident entertainer derives an amount of income from their performance. Whether an organisation is or is not carried out for private pecuniary profit of any member, proprietor or shareholder is tested based on the wording of the constituting documents. These are then tested from a holistic perspective, having regard to the organisation’s functions and activities (CIR v Medical Council of New Zealand (1997) 18 NZTC 13,088 (CA); Crown Forestry Rental Trust v CIR (2002) 20 NZTC 17,737 (CA)). Activity ... “in connection with” To qualify for the exemption in s CW 20(1), a person needs to be a non-resident entertainer under s CW 20(4). They will be a non-resident entertainer if they are a “non-resident person ... who carries out an activity or performance in connection with” various kinds of entertainment and sporting activities listed in s CW 20(4)(a) to (c). Touring performers will often have supporting personnel. Although those personnel may play an important role in supporting performers, whether they qualify for the exemption depends on whether their activities have a sufficient “connection with”, the relevant event, as those words must be interpreted in the provision. The words “in connection with” and (as discussed later in this statement from \[86\]) “relating to” likely have a similar meaning. Case law has considered the words “relating to” as well as the similar phrases “in relation to” and “in respect of”. In one context, the courts have said that the words “in respect of or in relation to” are “words of the widest import”: Shell New Zealand Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,303. However, in New Zealand Forest Research Ltd v CIR (1998) 18 NZTC 13,928, the High Court stated that the starting point in interpreting the meaning of “relating to” is to consider the ordinary and natural meaning of the phrase, in the context of the provision in which it is used. That approach is consistent with s 5(1) of the Interpretation Act 1999, which requires the meaning of an enactment must be ascertained from its text and in the light of its purpose, and the Supreme Court’s decision in Commerce Commission v Fonterra Co-operative Group Ltd \[2007\] 3 NZLR 767. As noted at \[80\], the exemption’s purpose at the time of enactment was to bring the exemption for certain non-resident entertainers – then set out in Part F of the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1975 – into the general tax law. What were the payment categories in the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1975 are now found in sch 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Schedule 4 may therefore be relevant in interpreting s CW 20(4). The Commissioner notes that, in the context of entertainers, the sch 4 category for non-resident entertainers providing a “Part F activity” seems unlikely to include supporting personnel. Relevantly, sch 4 includes a specific category for people 11 UNCLASSIFIED providing services on- and off-set for television, video and film productions. That category was added by the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Amendment Regulations (No 2) 2003 (“ the Amendment Regulations”). The Commissioner understands that the Amendment Regulations added that category to ensure that those types of supporting personnel were subject to tax in approximately the same way as entertainers. By implication then, the Amendment Regulations would not have been necessary if supporting personnel already came within the entertainer category. The discussion in the OECD’s Commentary on Article 17 concerning the taxation of entertainers and sportspersons also stipulates at \[4\] that a distinction should be made between a person performing as an entertainer in a show and another taking a supporting role. Consistent with the approach in sch 4 and the OECD Commentary, the Commissioner’s view is that supporting personnel are not included as non-resident entertainers under s CW 20(4). However, supporting personnel may still qualify for the exemption in s CW 19. Section CW 19 gives non-residents who derive personal services income an income tax exemption where they visit for short periods only, work for a person who is a non-resident, and are subject to an equivalent income tax in their residence country. Similar considerations arise for sportspeople and are addressed below from \[86\]. Sportspersons Section CW 20(2) contains an exemption for certain non-resident entertainers carrying out an activity or performance relating to a game or sport. It provides: Income that a non-resident entertainer derives from carrying out an activity or performance that relates to a game or sport in New Zealand during a visit is exempt income if the participants are the official representatives of a body that administers the game or sport in an overseas country. Official representative For the exemption to apply, the participants need to be “official representatives”. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary defines “official”, in its adjective form, as follows: 1 Relating to an authority or public body and its activities and responsibilities. 1.1 Having the approval or authorization of an authority or public body. 1.2 Employed by an authority or public body in a position of authority. The example given in the Concise Oxford English Dictionary for definition 1.2 above is “an official spokesman”. Given the reference in the provision is to an “official representative” of a sporting body, definition 1.2 seems most relevant in this context. “Representative” is defined in the Concise Oxford English Dictionary as follows: 1 A person chosen or appointed to act or speak for another or others. Taken together, these definitions appear to suggest that an “official representative” is a person chosen or appointed to act as a person employed by an authority or public body in a position of authority, in this context in relation to a sport. 12 UNCLASSIFIED In that way, a person who merely affiliates with, or is a member of, an administering body will not qualify for the exemption. Similarly, a person will not qualify if they affiliate with a sporting body but compete on an individual basis rather than as an “official representative” of that body. The person needs to “represent” the administering body. For completeness, the Commissioner notes that while the dictionary definitions use the word “employed”, this may not refer to the legal concept of employment. In other words, a person need not have an employment contract with a body to be an official representative of that body. Body that “administers” the game or sport in an overseas country For the exemption to apply, the body must administer the game or sport “in an overseas country”. Income derived by official representatives of a New Zealand body which administers a sport is not exempt under this provision. “Administer” is defined in the Concise Oxford English Dictionary as follows: Manage and be responsible for the running of (a business, organization, etc.) Taking the ordinary meaning of “administer”, the provision therefore seems to point towards bodies that manage, or are responsible for running matters to do with, the sport or game in an overseas country. Whether an organisation can be regarded as one that “administers” a game or sport will ultimately be a factual matter. The ordinary meaning of “administers” suggests that an analysis of the organisation’s functions will be required. Without limiting the functions that might be considered, some examples of relevant “administrative” functions could include where the body is: (a) Formally established or constituted; (b) Responsible for promotion of the sport both within its country and internationally; (c) Recognised on the international stage as that country’s official body for its relevant sport; (d) Affiliated with, or a member of, an international body responsible for administering the sport; (e) Responsible for selection of players in international competitions; (f) Responsible for setting rules or codes in relation to its sport; (g) Responsible for disciplinary action against players or members. National sporting body The wording of s CW 20(2) suggests that there may be more than one administrative body for a game or sport in a country. This is because of the use of the indefinite article, “a body that administers the game or sport”. But it is not clear whether the wording merely allows for the possibility of more than one body at a national level (for example, one for men and one for women), or whether it also allows for bodies at a regional or city level. On one reading of s CW 20(2), there might not appear to be any reason why a member of a club rugby team, who is an official representative of the board or committee who administers the sport for the overseas club, would not be covered by s CW 20(2). 13 UNCLASSIFIED However, the explanatory note to cl 5 of the Land and Income Tax Amendment Bill (No 4) 1975, which led to the insertion of what is now s CW 20(2), stated that the exemption related to players officially representing their country or their national organisation: Clause 5 exempts from income tax the income derived by non-resident entertainers (within the meaning of the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1975) from any activity or performance– ... (c) In relation to any game or sport where the players officially represent their country or their national organisation. \[Emphasis added\] Background materials, including submissions made on the Bill, indicate that cl 5 was intended to bring the exemption for certain non-resident entertainers – which already appeared in Part F of the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1975 – into the general tax law. The New Zealand Society of Accountants submitted on cl 5 of the Bill, suggesting that the exemption for certain sportspersons should be widened. As a matter of policy, the Government decided that the exemption should only apply to sportspersons who officially represent their overseas country. The Commissioner also notes that the sportspersons exemption has subsequently been treated as applying to only national representatives. For instance, from 27 January 1995 the New Zealand-Australia DTA has included a specific rule for trans- Tasman sporting leagues, intended to reduce compliance costs for non-national sporting representatives: art 17(3) of the New Zealand-Australia DTA. The Finance and Expenditure Committee commented on the rule (at p 7): 1 The exclusion does not apply to national representative teams competing in international competitions such as the rugby world cup. Existing domestic law provisions exempt foreign national representative teams competing in New Zealand. \[Emphasis added\] Both the pre-legislative materials and subsequent interpretative approach indicate that the legislative intention of what is now s CW 20(2) was that the “governing body” is the governing body at a national level. Representing a provincial body or a club does not suffice for the exemption to apply. Further, that a visiting club team may have the approval of that governing body or the team’s board or committee is not intended to qualify a player for an exemption. Rather, the players must be official representatives of the overseas national governing body for the sport. In conclusion, s CW 20(2) applies when income is derived by a visiting sportsperson provided they officially represent a national body that administers the game or sport in an overseas country. As mentioned above, it is possible that there might also be more than one administrative body at a national level (for instance where there are separate bodies for women and men). The exemption can still apply in such a case. 1 International Treaty Examination of the Convention between New Zealand and Australia for the Avoidance of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income and Fringe Benefits and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion (Finance and Expenditure Committee, 2009, https://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/sites/default/files/tax-treaties/2009-nia-dta-nz-australia.pdf ) 14 UNCLASSIFIED Activity ... that “relates to”, or is “in connection with”, a game or sport Similar to the position for non-resident entertainers other than sportspeople, touring sportspeople may have a number of supporting personnel. A similar statutory interpretation issue may arise about the meaning of “in connection with”, as is described above at \[ 58\] to \[67\]. And for sportspeople, there is a separate but similar issue in s CW 20(2) because the non-resident entertainer’s income is only exempt if it is derived “from carrying out an activity ... that relates to a game or sport ... if the participants are the official representatives of \[a national administrative body\]”. The meaning of “in connection with” and “relates to” is set out above at \[60\]. In the context of s CW 20(2), the Commissioner has again had reference to the schedular payments regime. Notably in sch 4, the definition of “Part F activity” arguably only provides an exclusion from withholding tax deductions for “official representatives” themselves. This suggests that supporting personnel are not covered by s CW 20(2). The discussion in the OECD’s Commentary on Article 17 concerning the taxation of entertainers and sportspersons also generally appears to refer to sportspersons, rather than supporting personnel, as coming within Article 17 of the OECD Model Tax Convention. Therefore, the Commissioner’s view is that the exemption in s CW 20(2) does not apply to supporting personnel. However, as explained at \[ 66\] supporting personnel may still qualify for the exemption in s CW 19. Section CW 19 gives non-residents who derive personal services income an income tax exemption where they visit for short periods only, work for a person who is a non-resident, and are subject to an equivalent income tax in their residence country. Income ... “from” an activity or performance that relates to a game or sport Section CW 20(2) provides an exemption for income that a non-resident entertainer derives “from carrying out an activity or performance that relates to a game or sport”. In some cases, sportspersons may derive income from sources that are ancillary to the sportsperson’s physical performance. Some examples might include: (a) Payments by sponsors, for instance where the sportsperson might wear a sponsor’s branded clothing; or (b) ‘Image rights’ payments, where the sportsperson is paid for the use of their image, such as where a promoter wishes to use the sportsperson’s image to advertise their appearance in the lead up to an event. There may be a question as to whether income of these kinds can be regarded as “from” the sportsperson’s activity or performance for the purposes of s CW 20(2). This would seem to depend on whether the income has the required degree of connection to, even if it is not directly from, the sportsperson’s physical performance. In many cases, it appears that New Zealand would have a shared right to tax these sources of income. The entertainers and sportspersons article in most of New Zealand’s double tax agreements corresponds to Article 17 in the OECD’s Model Tax Convention. The OECD’s Commentary on Article 17 concerning the taxation of entertainers and sportspersons suggests that income from sources other than a sportsperson’s (or entertainer’s) physical performance can still fall within Article 17 15 UNCLASSIFIED of the OECD Model Tax Convention. This will be the case if the income has a “close connection” with the sportsperson’s physical performance. Some examples of when there is a “close connection” are described in the Commentary – for instance, where a sportsperson gives a paid media interview while they are on tour in a country. Section CW 20(2) was inserted alongside the exemptions for non-resident entertainers’ cultural performances and activities. As stated at \[ 42\], the non- resident entertainers’ exemption was intended, at least in part, to ensure that tax is not an impediment to cultural exchanges. The Commissioner considers it reasonable to assume that there was a similar policy rationale for the sportspersons’ exemption. That is, Parliament’s purpose was to remove the tax impost from sportsperson’s incomes that might otherwise have been an impediment to hosting international sporting competitions. If New Zealand imposed tax on income “closely connected” with a sportsperson’s physical performance, it could, at the margins, create the kind of impediment to hosting international sporting competitions that Parliament likely sought to avoid. For that reason, the Commissioner’s view is that the exemption was likely intended also to apply to income that is closely connected to a sportsperson’s physical performance in New Zealand. It is noted that the sportsperson would still need to meet all the elements of s CW 20(2). Most notably, the sportsperson has to be a national sporting representative. So, for instance, a fee paid for an interview with a member of a touring national rugby team while that player is on tour in New Zealand may qualify for the exemption, but a similar payment to a golfer competing on an individual basis may not. Service Provider providing services of non-resident entertainer or sportsperson Section CW 20(3) exempts amounts derived by a person (the Service Provider) who provides the services of a non-resident entertainer during a visit to New Zealand: Exempt income: employer of non-resident entertainer (3) If income derived from an activity or performance of a non-resident entertainer would be exempt income under this section if derived by the non-resident entertainer, that amount is exempt income if derived by a person who— (a) provides the services of the non-resident entertainer during the visit to New Zealand; and (b) is 1 of the following: (i) the entertainer’s employer; or (ii) a company of which the entertainer is an officer; or (iii) a firm of which the entertainer is a principal. Section CW 20(3) applies only if the income would have been exempt had it been derived by the non-resident entertainer. Therefore, it is first necessary to consider the application of s CW 20(1) and (2) to the income. If one of these exemptions would have applied, s CW 20(3) will exempt the income in the hands of the Service Provider. There is no restriction in s CW 20(3) on the residency of the Service Provider. The Service Providers who come within the categories listed in s CW 20(3)(b) include: 16 UNCLASSIFIED • the entertainer’s employer • a company of which the entertainer is an officer • a firm of which the entertainer is a principal The entertainer’s employer Section CW 20(3)(b)(i) exempts a payment received by a Service Provider that is “the entertainer’s employer”. The word “employer” is a defined term in s YA 1. The s YA 1 definition states, at para (a), that “employer”: means a person who pays or is liable to pay a PAYE income payment... Section CW 20(3)(b)(i) refers to “the entertainer’s employer”. Applying the s YA 1 definition in that context, the person referred to in para (a) of the definition of “employer” in s YA 1 is a “person who pays or is liable to pay a PAYE income payment” to the non-resident entertainer. Included within the PAYE income payment definition in s RD 3(1) are “a payment of salary or wages” and “a schedular payment”. A “schedular payment” includes a payment to a non-resident entertainer: s RD 8(1)(a)(i) and sch 4 , Part F, cl 4. The main difference between a person receiving a payment of “salary or wages” and a person receiving a “schedular payment” is the nature of their relationship with the payer. In essence, a payment of salary or wages is made under a contract of service while a schedular payment is a payment made under a contract for service. The implication from the above is that the definition of “employer” in s YA 1 means that “the entertainer’s employer”, is not limited to a person who has engaged the entertainer under a contract of service. This is because the definition includes a person paying a PAYE income payment, which may be in the form of either a payment of salary or wages or a schedular payment. Schedular payments are payments made under contracts for services (that is, to independent contractors). And in the context of s CW 20, a payment to a non-resident entertainer who is an independent contractor will come within the schedular payments rules because it is a payment listed in sch 4, Part F. In conclusion, s CW 20(3)(b)(i) covers situations where the “person” has engaged the entertainer either as an employee under a contract of service, or as an independent contractor under a contract for service. A company of which the entertainer is an officer Section CW 20(3)(b)(ii) exempts a payment received by a Service Provider that is “a company of which the entertainer is an officer”. A “company” is defined in s YA 1 as: company— (a) means a body corporate or other entity that has a legal existence separate from that of its members, whether it is incorporated or created in New Zealand or elsewhere: (ab) does not include a partnership: (abb) does not include a look-through company, except in the PAYE rules, the FBT rules, the NRWT rules, the RWT rules, the ESCT rules, the RSCT rules, and for the purposes of subpart FO (Amalgamation of companies): (abc) does not include a company that is acting in the capacity of trustee: 17 UNCLASSIFIED (ac) includes a listed limited partnership: (ad) includes a foreign corporate limited partnership: (b) includes a unit trust: ... There is no definition of “officer” in either the Income Tax Act 2007 or in the Companies Act 1993. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary defines “officer” as: 2 A holder of a public, civil, or ecclesiastical office. 2.1 A holder of a senior post in a society, company, or other organization. Based on the ordinary meaning, a company “officer” will be a person holding a senior post within the company. The most common example of a company officer is likely to be a company director. A firm of which the entertainer is a principal Section CW 20(3)(b)(ii) exempts a payment received by a Service Provider that is “a firm of which the entertainer is a principal”. The word “firm” is also not defined in the Act. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary defines “firm” as: 1 A business concern, especially one involving a partnership of two or more people. The ordinary meaning, therefore, suggests that a firm will be some kind of business, perhaps, but not always, involving more than one person. The ordinary meaning also suggests that a firm is likely to include a partnership and a sole trader. In legal dictionaries, “firm” is defined as “an unincorporated body of persons associated together for the purpose of carrying on business”: New Zealand Law Dictionary. While not directly applicable, it is noted that s 7 of the Partnership Act 1908 defines “firm” for the purposes of that Act: Persons who have entered into partnership with one another are for the purposes of this Act called collectively a firm, and the name under which their business is carried on is called the firm name. The Partnership Act 1908 then goes on to use the term “firm” to describe partnerships that are the subject of that Act. A “principal” of a firm is “the most important or senior person in \[a firm\]”: Concise Oxford English Dictionary. Although, in the context of s CW 20(3)(b)(ii) which refers to “a principal”, it is sufficient if the non-resident entertainer is one of the senior persons in that firm. Summary In summary, s CW 20(3) applies if one of the exemptions for non-resident entertainers and sportspersons in s CW 20(1) or (2) would have applied, but the services are supplied by another person. This is provided that other person has one of the kinds of relationship with the entertainer described at \[ 101\] to \[115\]. For instance, a company can qualify for the exemption if it derives income that would have been exempt under s CW 20(1) or s CW 20(2) in the non-resident entertainer’s hands. The company needs to supply the entertainer’s services, a nd 18 UNCLASSIFIED the entertainer needs to be an employee or officer of the company ( for example, director). What happens if the exemption does not apply This statement is primarily intended to assist those paying non-resident entertainers to determine whether the exemption in s CW 20 applies. If the exemption applies, the payer will not need to consider withholding any tax or the effect of an applicable DTA. However, for completeness, if the exemption in s CW 20 does not apply, a person paying a non-resident entertainer will need to: (a) apply the PAYE rules when making the payment; (b) consider whether the non-resident entertainer may be entitled to relief under a DTA. Applying the PAYE rules A person paying a PAYE income payment is obliged to withhold tax from that payment and pay that tax to the Commissioner. As explained in \[103\] and \[104\] above, a PAYE income payment includes both “salary or wages” and a “schedular payment”. Non-resident entertainers may be either employees (under a contract of service) or independent contractors (under a contract for services). As such, the first step for a payer is to determine whether the entertainer has been engaged under a contract of service or a contract for services. If the entertainer is an employee, the payer should look to withhold PAYE from the payment. If the entertainer is an independent contractor, the payer should apply the schedular payments rules. Payers will also need to record details of the non-resident entertainer they are paying, the amount of the payment, and the tax withheld as part of the income information filed with Inland Revenue. For further information about PAYE record- keeping, payday filing and tax payment obligations for schedular payments, see the Inland Revenue website: www.ird.govt.nz. If the payment is a schedular payment and no tax is deducted at source, the non- resident entertainer must pay the tax to the Commissioner by the earlier of the date of their departure from New Zealand or the 20 th of the month following payment: s RD 19(3). A non-resident entertainer cannot obtain an exemption certificate under s 24M(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Double tax agreements The provisions of a DTA may override the domestic tax position for a non-resident entertainer: s BH 1(4). In general, the articles in New Zealand’s DTAs relating to entertainers and sportspersons follow the formulation in art 17 of the 2017 OECD Model Tax Convention. The general position in that article is that entertainers’ and sportspersons’ income may be taxed in the country in which their performance or activity occurs. 19 UNCLASSIFIED However, there are exceptions to this rule. One example of an exception is art 17(3) of the New Zealand-Australia DTA, referred to at \[ 81\]. Another can be found in Article 17(1) of the New Zealand-United States DTA, which gives sole taxing rights to the entertainer’s or sportsperson’s country of residence where the relevant payments do not exceed USD$10,000 per year. In each case, the relevant DTA should be consulted. Examples The following examples assist in explaining the application of the law. Example 1: Australian cultural artist visiting New Zealand The Australian Federal Government establishes a programme aimed at establishing and maintaining a cultural presence in key overseas regions or countries. It provides funding for the programme on an annual basis. As part of the programme, a group from Arnhem Land travelled to four overseas countries including New Zealand where the group held exhibitions and gave demonstrations of Aboriginal weaving. At the group’s New Zealand events, the exhibitions were organised by a promoter who collected a small entry fee from those attending. The net proceeds from the entry fees were paid to the members of the group. The programme is a cultural programme belonging to and funded by the Australian Federal Government. The group’s exhibitions and demonstrations occur under this programme and they are carried out in New Zealand. The members of the group receive income for their performances from the promoter. This income will be exempt under s CW 20(1)(a), so the promoter does not deduct tax from the payment. Example 2: Income received by a service provider This example follows on from Example 1. The Arnhem Land cultural group have, for their own administrative purposes, established their group as a company. The members of the group are directors and equal shareholders of the company. Rather than paying each individual member, the promoter makes a payment to the company. The agreement is that the company will provide the services of each of the non-resident entertainers. The payments are exempt under s CW 20(3). This is because the income derived by the company would have been exempt if derived by the non-resident entertainers directly (as occurred in Example 1), the company provided the non- resident entertainers’ services, and the non-resident entertainers are officers of the company. Example 3: New Zealand sponsored programme to facilitate cultural performances The Culture Promo Association is an organisation based in Auckland. The Culture Promo Association is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any of its members. The Culture Promo Association establishes a programme to facilitate exchanges between Asian and New Zealand performance groups. The Association is funded 20 UNCLASSIFIED from a legacy and contributes towards the travel of the performance groups. The programme is not funded by the New Zealand government in any way. A Japanese pop music group, made up of several professional singers and dancers, gives dance and music performances in New Zealand under the Culture Promo Association’s programme and derives several thousand dollars of profit. The profit is split between the Japanese performers. To the extent that the performances occur under the Culture Promo Association’s cultural programme, the income derived is not exempt under s CW 20(1)(b) or (c). Section CW 20(1)(b) does not apply because the cultural programme is not sponsored financially by the New Zealand or an overseas government. Section CW 20(1)(c) does not apply because the Culture Promo Association is not an “overseas” organisation, since it is based in Auckland. Even if the Japanese pop group’s New Zealand tour activity can be regarded as occurring as part of the Japanese pop group’s “programme”, s CW 20(1)(c) will not apply. This is because the Japanese pop group is carried on for the private pecuniary profit of its proprietors or members. Therefore, the income derived is not exempt under s CW 20 and the payer must deduct tax from the payment under the PAYE rules. Example 4: Canadian curling competition in New Zealand The Canadian Curling Association is the body that administers curling in Canada. Although competitions are usually held in Canada, from time to time competitions are also held in other countries to increase the sport’s profile. The Association decides to approve a competition between several Canadian champion curlers, representing their local curling clubs, to be held on a curling sheet at a venue in Auckland. The curlers receive a percentage of the ticket sales from the promoter of the event for participating in the competition. The curlers are not competing in New Zealand as national representatives for Canada. Rather, they are competing as representatives of their local Canadian clubs. The Association’s approval does not mean that the curlers are officially representing the Association. Therefore, the income derived by the curlers in New Zealand is not exempt under s CW 20(2) and the payer must deduct tax from the payment under the PAYE rules. Example 5: Curling competition against New Zealand curlers This example follows on from Example 3. As well as approving club curlers to compete in a contest in Auckland, the Canadian Curling Association has chosen a team made up of the best Canadian curlers at club level. It is to play a team selected by the New Zealand Curling Players Association. The contest will be held at the same venue in Auckland. In contrast to example 3, the Canadian team members are official representatives of the Canadian Curling Association, the governing body that administers curling in Canada. Despite each player being a member of a club team, they are officially representing the Canadian Curling Association in this instance. Therefore, the income derived by the curlers in New Zealand is exempt under s CW 20(2), and the payer does not deduct tax from the payment. Example 6: Trans-national sports team competing in New Zealand A Scandinavian handball team is formed with representative players from Sweden, Denmark and Norway. The national handball administrative bodies for each of the three countries choose official representative players to join the team. The players are engaged by an entity formed to constitute the new team. 21 UNCLASSIFIED References Subject references Legislative references Exempt income Non-resident entertainer Income Tax Act 2007, ss BD 1(5), BH 1, CW 19, CW 20, YD 4(3), (4) and (17D), LD 3 , Subpart RD, Sch 4 Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1975 Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979 Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Amendment Regulations (No 2) 2003 Interpretation Act 1999, s 5 Partnership Act 1908, s 7 Tax Administration Act 1994, s 24M Case references Other references Aporex Inc v Hoffmann La-Roche Ltd \[2000\] OJ No 4732 Capital Club Pty Ltd v Commissioner of State Revenue (2007) ATC 4498 CIR v Medical Council of New Zealand (1997) 18 NZTC 13,088 (CA) Commerce Commission v Fonterra Co- operative Group Ltd \[2007\] 3 NZLR 767 Conyngham & Ors v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs \[1986\] FCA 238, (1986) 68 ALR 423 Crown Forestry Rental Trust v CIR (2002) 20 NZTC 17,737 (CA) CIR v Dick (2001) 20 NZTC 17,396 (HC) Dyck v Lohrer \[2000\] BCJ No 629 Hester & Ors v CIR (2005) 22 NZTC 19,007 Lowe v CIR (1981) 5 NZTC 61,006 (CA) McKenzie v Baddeley \[1991\] NSWCA 197 Molloy v CIR (1981) 5 NZTC 61,070 (CA) New Zealand Forest Research Ltd v CIR (1998) 18 NZTC 13,928 Presbyterian Church of New Zealand Beneficiary Fund v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,185 (HC) Re Schlatter and Defence Force Retirement and Benefits Authority and Brown (1985) 8 ALD 133 Shell New Zealand Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,303 Trustees of the Auckland Medical Aid Trust v CIR (1979) 4 NZTC 61,404 (HC) Concise Oxford English Dictionary, Oxford University Press, online ed International Treaty Examination of the Convention between New Zealand and Australia for the Avoidance of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income and Fringe Benefits and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion (Finance and Expenditure Committee, 2009, https://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/sites/default/files/ tax-treaties/2009-nia-dta-nz-australia.pdf) “IS 16/03 Tax Residence” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 28, No 10 (October 2016) Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital: Condensed Version 2017 (OECD Publishing, Paris, 2017) “Nation and Government: Local Government” in Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand (Ministry for Culture and Heritage, 2005, updated 16 September 2016) New Zealand Law Dictionary (8th ed, LexisNexis NZ Limited, Wellington, 2015) “Non-resident sports people and entertainers – application of section 61(17) of the Income Tax Act 1976” published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 4, No 3 (October 1992) The team travels to New Zealand to play a series of handball matches against national and regional New Zealand handball teams.

Goods and services tax: GST treatment of short-stay accommodation
=================================================================

This interpretation statement is the final item in a series of guidance on the income tax and GST consequences of providing short-stay accommodation through peer-to-peer websites such as Airbnb, Bookabach and Holiday Houses.  The statement explains the GST treatment of supplying short-stay accommodation and confirms these supplies are not exempt supplies.  The statement also discusses the requirements for registration, the main consequences of registration, change of use adjustments and what happens when the property is sold or the short-stay accommodation activity ceases.  These latter topics will be useful in providing guidance to taxpayers of the options available where their short-stay accommodation activity has been affected by Covid-19. 

**Note:** This interpretation statement is under review for amendments made to the GST Act 1985 in 2022 and 2023.   Care is needed when reading it.  Information on the amendments can be found in:

Where this occurs, s 5(15) deems the residence to be a separate supply from the rest of the land. The separate supplies need to be considered independently for GST purposes. This statement uses the term “residence” for the different types of premises mentioned in s 5(15). Section 5(15) applies where a supply includes: • a principal place of residence; or • a supply referred to in s 14(1)(d). “Principal place of residence” means premises occupied as the person’s main residence. However, it does not have to be the vendor’s own residence. It is the vendor’s use of the property that is determinative, not the purchaser’s intention. Section 14(1)(d) treats the sale of certain dwellings as an exempt supply, where the dwelling has been used exclusively for residential rental purposes for the preceding 5 years. 2 IS 20/05 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] If a residence is included in a supply that includes other real property, s 5(15) deems there to be two (or more, if more than one residence i s being supplied) separate supplies. A common example would be farm sales, where s 5(15) treats the farmhouse (provided it meets the definition of residence) and the rest of the farm as two separate supplies for GST purposes. The separate supplies are treated individually for GST purposes. It is often assumed that the supply of the residence is exempt or non-taxable and the supply of the other real property is taxable and subject to GST. However, this is an oversimplification and the treatment depends on the facts: • A supply of a principal place of residence where the residence is used by the vendor in a taxable activity will be a taxable supply made in the course or furtherance of the taxable activity and subject to GST under s 8(1). The supply will be taxable at the standard rate or may be zero-rated if the compulsory zero-rating rules apply. • A supply of a principal place of residence where the residence is exclusively private in nature and is not used by the vendor in a taxable activity is not a taxable supply. • A supply of a principal place of residence which has been used solely by the vendor for making exempt supplies of residential rental accommodation is an exempt supply. • A supply referred to in s 14(1)(d) is an exempt supply. • A supply of the other real property used by the vendor in a taxable activity may be a zero-rated supply under the compulsory zero-rating rules or as a supply of a going concern. Where s 5(15) applies so the supplies are considered individually for GST purposes, the consideration must be apportioned between the supplies. This enables the parties to identify the correct amount of GST payable on the transaction and to calculate any adjustments under ss 21–21H. To value the residence, it must be properly identified. For farmhouses, it may not be clear where the boundary of the farmhouse ends and where the farmland begins. When apportioning consideration between the two supplies, a farmhouse includes appurtenances (ie, things belonging to and used with the residence and included within its curtilage). Any apportionment must reflect the respective values of the residence and the surrounding land. The onus of proof that an apportionment is fair and reasonable is on the person seeking to rely on the apportionment, whether that is the vendor or purchaser. A valuation may be needed to satisfy this onus. In cases of doubt or where there are significant amounts of consideration, the parties should obtain a valuation from a registered valuer. When the supplier and recipient are GST registered, the same apportionment as set out in the tax invoice for any taxable supplies will apply to both parties. Ideally, this should be negotiated between the parties and agreed at the time of supply. This statement updates and replaces IS2824 “GST – Supplies of dwellings and other real property” (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 8, No 6 (October 1996): 1), which dealt with the apportionment between, and the valuation of, supplies of dwellings and other real property for GST purposes. The principles applying to valuations in IS2824 remain largely unchanged. 3 IS 20/05 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Introduction IS2824 was published in October 1996, shortly after subss 5(15)–(19) were enacted. The provisions were introduced in response to the Court of Appeal’s decision in CIR v Coveney (1995) 17 NZTC 12,193 (CA) and to deal with an issue that arose under the former “ principal purpose” rules. Prior to the enactment of s 5(15), the Act did not have a provision for splitting a single supply that was partly taxable and partly non-taxable (or exempt) – such as where a private dwelling was acquired as part of the purchase of a farm. A GST input tax credit was allowed if the goods and services had been acquired for the “principal purpose” of making taxable supplies. Dwellings acquired as part of a wider purchase of land were an anomaly because often the principal purpose of the dwelling was non-taxable private use, but the purchase of the land as a whole would satisfy the principal purpose test. The implementation of s 5(15) meant the supply of a dwelling was treated separately from the supply of the rest of the land. It would not give rise to an input tax deduction unless the dwelling itself had been acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Subsections 5(15)–(19) essentially reversed the Coveney decision and are consistent with the Commissioner’s position before the Coveney decision. Another effect was that the dwelling and other real property must be valued separately. Since IS2824 was published there have been numerous changes to the legislation, including the removal of the principal purpose rule for assets acquired after 1 April 2011. This statement discusses how the current s 5(15) and related provisions apply. Application of subss 5(15), (16) and (18) Subsections 5(15), (16) and (18) state: (15) When either of the following supplies are included in a supply, they are deemed to be a separate supply from the supply of any other real property that is included in the supply: (a) a supply of a principal place of residence: (b) a supply referred to in section 14(1)(d). (16) Where a registered person has claimed a deduction in accordance with section 20(3) in respect of the supply of a dwelling, any subsequent supply by the registered person of— (a) the dwelling; or (b) any land or other part of the dwelling that has ceased or will by reason of the supply cease to be appurtenant to or enjoyed with the dwelling,— will, for the avoidance of doubt but subject to subsections (17), (18), and (19)(b), be deemed to be a taxable supply. ... (18) Where a registered person has claimed a deduction in accordance with section 20(3) in respect of a proportion of a dwelling, the supply of that dwelling shall be deemed to be a taxable supply only to the extent that the proportion claimed bears to the whole dwelling Subsections 5(15)–(19) were a suite of provisions introduced specifically to deal with Coveney-type situations where a person could take advantage of the old principal purpose rule to claim GST input tax for a dwelling (which would otherwise be exempt or non-taxable). The purpose of subss 5(16) and (18) was to collect 4 IS 20/05 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] GST output tax from those who had already claimed a pre-s 5(15) input tax deduction. Section 5(15) can apply to a residence where there is the supply of other real property included in the supply. The word “other” requires a different or another item of real property distinct from the residence referred to. W here s 5(15) applies, the vendor will need to treat the two (or more) supplies as separate for GST purposes. Section 5(16) provides that where a person has claimed GST for a dwelling, any subsequent supply will be deemed taxable. This is subject to s 5(18), which restricts the deemed taxable supply to the proportion of GST input tax claimed. These provisions were part of the legislative response to the Coveney decision. The taxpayers in Coveney had claimed a GST input tax deduction for their dwelling because it was part of a wider supply. Subsections 5(16) and (18) ensured that taxpayers in this position will be liable for GST output tax on disposal of the dwelling. Under the previous principal purpose approach, if the dwelling was subsequently supplied separately it would likely be a non-taxable supply. This is because a dwelling is not likely to be used principally for making taxable supplies and so the supply of the dwelling would not be in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity under s 8(1). Consequently, subss 5(16) and (18) were required to deem a subsequent supply of the dwelling as a taxable supply. With the passage of time these provisions are likely to only be relevant to a small number of taxpayers. Subsections 5(17) and (19)(b) were exceptions to s 5(16). These provisions effectively allowed a person to otherwise account for the GST they had claimed on their dwelling. Section 5(17) has been repealed and s 5(19) only applies where a person made an election before 1 August 1996. Consequently, these provisions are not discussed in this statement. Amendments to s 5(15) When first enacted in 1995, s 5(15) referred to “a dwelling”: (15) Where a dwelling is included in a supply, the supply of that dwelling is deemed to be a separate supply from the supply of any other real property included in the supply Since 1995 there have been the following relevant changes: • The Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Act 2010 amended: o s 5(15) so the phrase “principal place of residence” replaced the word “dwelling” and a new definition of “principal place of residence” was added to s 2 ; and o the definition of “dwelling” in s 2(1) (see appendix) was amended to change it from a wide definition focused on the nature of the building to a narrower definition based on the nature of the supply. • Before the 2010 version of s 5(15) came into effect it was amended by the Taxation (Tax Administration and Remedial Matters) Act 2011. The 2011 amendments included the: o addition of clause (b); and o removal of the reference to s 5(15) in the definition of “principal place of residence”. • From 1 April 2011, the apportionment and adjustment rules changed so that deductions are now based on the use (or intended use) of the asset in making taxable supplies, rather than the former principal purpose test. 5 IS 20/05 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] The changes to the legislation have been significant but s 5(15) still largely operates in the same way. For example, if a farm sale includes a farmhouse (used as a residence), then there will be two separate supplies. Application of s 5(15) Section 5( 15) applies to either a supply of: • a principal place of residence; or • a dwelling to the extent it is a supply referred to in s 14(1)(d). Principal place of residence “P rincipal place of residence” is a term that can have slightly different meanings depending on the context. In the definition of “dwelling” the phrase “principal place of residence” is intended to mean premises supplied as accommodation to a person who occupies them as their main residence for the duration of an agreement. In the context of the zero-rating provisions, the “principal place of residence” is intended to indicate land used by its owner or their relatives as their main place of residence. References to specific provisions (including s 5(15)) in the previous s 2 definition of “principal place of residence” were removed to avoid confusion about when the different meanings apply. “P rincipal place of residence” is now defined only for the purposes of “dwelling”: principal place of residence, in the definition of dwelling means a place that a person occupies as their main residence for the period to which the agreement for the supply of accommodation relates The Commissioner discussed the term in IS 17/08: “GST – Compulsory zero-rating of land rules (general application)” (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 29, No 10 (November 2017): 17) and considered: • The phrase “principal place of residence” in s 5(15)(a) refers to a place occupied as a person’s main residence. The plain meaning of the phrase indicates a person may have more than one residence, but at any point in time they can have only one main residence. • Because the provision refers to a person’s main residence, the application of s 5(15)(a) is not restricted to a place occupied as the vendor’s main residence. It is possible for a vendor to supply a principal place of residence that is not their own residence (eg , a house that has been lived in by a farm manager). • Section 5(15)(a) is concerned with the supply of a principal place of residence. Therefore, for the purposes of s 5(15), the current use of the property is determinative rather than the purchaser’s intended use of the property. This is in contrast to how the phrase is used in the compulsory zero-rat ing rules, which focuses on the purchaser’s (or their relative’s) intended use of the land. • The inquiry in s 5(15)(a) is objective, based on the available information. “Principal place of residence” as used in s 5(15) is different from the term “dwelling” used in previous versions of s 5(15). While the changes in terminology can be confusing, where a person occupies a residential property as their home it will usually be both a “dwelling” and a “principal place of residence”. That said, there are some differences in the definitions; notably a “dwelling” will usually 6 IS 20/05 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] require quiet enjoyment as that term is used in s 38 of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 and does not include a property that is a “commercial dwelling” (defined in s 2 of the Act). These differences mean there will be some exceptions where a property is a principal place of residence but not a dwelling. By using the phrase “principal place of residence” and not “dwelling”, s 5(15)(a) will apply to properties such as homestays ( a commercial dwelling in the s 2 definition) provided the property is a person’s principal place of residence. Whether a property is a “principal place of residence” will be a matter of fact. For example, a farmhouse supplied to sharemilkers will likely be a principal place of residence (and it could also be a supply of a dwelling under s 14(1)(d)). Conversely, where farm lodgings are supplied to fencing contractors for the duration of their job, this is not the supply of a principal place of residence. The contractors only stay in the property for a relatively short period because it is not convenient to travel back to their homes in town. Similarly, a property exclusively rented out as farmstay accommodation on a peer-to-peer website will be used as short-stay holiday accommodation and the guests will not be using the property as their principal place of residence. Consequently, s 5(15)(a) will not apply to deem a separate supply of such a property. Supply within s 14(1)(d) This provision treats the sale of a dwelling that has been used exclusively for making exempt supplies of residential rental accommodation for the preceding 5 years, as an exempt supply. The dwelling can have been supplied as residential rental accommodation by way of hire, a service occupancy agreement or a licence to occupy. However, it still must be a supply of a “dwelling” (as defined in s 2), which means, amongst other things, it must be a person’s “principal place of residence” (as defined in s 2). Section 14(1)(d) is discussed in detail in IS 07/01: “GST treatment of sale of long- term residential rental properties” (Tax information Bulletin Vol 19, No 5 (June 2007): 16). There have been a number of changes to the GST Act since IS 07/01 was published (see \[ 20\]), however some of the analysis remains relevant, in particular s 14(1)(d): • applies where the property is used for residential purposes and for no other purpose for the required period; • can apply even if the property is vacant for periods during the 5 years (eg, while attempts are made to find a tenant); and • only applies where the vendor uses the property for residential purposes for 5 years. It does not apply where different owners have rented the property out over a 5- year period. Summary Section 5(15) applies where a supply includes a pri ncipal place of residence or a supply within s 14(1)(d). When considering this issue, the focus is on the vendor’s use of the property rather than the purchaser’s intended use. Section 5(15) can apply to both owner-occupied homes and rental properties. GST on the separate supplies If s 5(15) deems there to be two or more separate supplies, then each supply is considered individually. T he supply of the residence is most likely an exempt or non-taxable supply and the supply of the other real property is likely subject to 7 IS 20/05 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] GST. However, this is not always the case. For example, the supply of the residence may be subject to GST under s 8(1) because it is a supply in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity, and the supply of the other real property may be zero-rated. In some cases, the separate supplies may be subject to the same GST treatment (eg, both supplies are taxable under s 8(1)). Section 5(15) applies whenever a principal place of residence is supplied with other real property . A common example of s 5(15) applying is to farm sales where the farmhouse (provided it is a residence) is treated as a separate supply from the rest of the farm. It will also apply in other situations, such as where there are residential flats above a commercial property. Section 5(15) can also apply where there are two houses on a single property and one house is used as a principal place of residence and one is not. For example, a registered person lives in the main house but has a separate cottage on their property that they use solely for their taxable activity of making taxable supplies of short-stay accommodation via a peer-to-peer website. W here s 5(15) applies, the vendor needs to treat the two supplies as separate. The next section of the statement considers the treatment of the separate supplies. Supplies of a principal place of residence The supply of a principal place of residence will usually be a non-taxable supply and not subject to GST because it is a supply of a private home. It will not generally form part of a registered person’s taxable activity. However, where a principal place of residence is used in a registered person’s taxable activity, then the supply is chargeable with GST under s 8(1), at either the standard rate or zero rate. Section 8(1) imposes GST output tax when the supply is in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. As noted, a residence is usually used as a private home and so any separate supply of that residence will not usually be in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. However, s 8 may apply where the residence being supplied is used as part of a business. Accordingly, it is necessary to consider whether a supply of a residence in such circumstances will be in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. Case law supports the view that “in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity” can include the one-off sale of capital items that a registered person uses in their taxable activity (Case K55 (1988) 10 NZTC 453, Hibell v CIR (1991) 13 NZTC 8,195 (HC) and CIR v Dormer (1997) 18 NZTC 13,446 (HC)). Further, the property supplied does not need to be the “usual” good supplied by the taxpayer for it to come within the scope of the taxpayer’s taxable activity (Case K55, Case N43 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,361 and Case V16 (2002) 20 NZTC 10,182). Whether property comes within the scope of a taxable activity is a matter of fact and will depend on the “use” or “involvement” of the property in the taxable activity (Case V16, Case K55). In Case K55, this was characterised as there being a “discernible nexus” between the activity and the supply. IS 20/04 GST treatment of short-stay accommodation (Inland Revenue, June 2020) discusses whether a disposal will be “in the course or furtherance” of a person’s taxable activity of supplying short-stay accommodation. That item contains a more detailed discussion of the term “course or furtherance” but, in short, a supply of a residence can be in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity even though it is a one-off sale and not the usual type of good supplied by the person. In the short- stay accommodation context, if a property is used to make taxable supplies of short-stay accommodation, the subsequent disposal of the property will be in the course or furtherance of the taxable activity and subject to GST output tax under 8 IS 20/05 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] s 8(1) (and potentially subject to an adjustment under s 21F if there has been both taxable and non-taxable use). Whether a supply is within the scope of s 8(1) will ultimately be a question of fact based on the use of the residence. For example, if a farmhouse is not used in a taxable activity, s 8(1) will not apply. On the other hand, if a GST-registered farmer is claiming an automatic 20% deduction for farmhouse expenses based on IS 17/02: “Income tax – deductibility of certain expenses attributable to a farm dwelling” (Tax information Bulletin Vol 29, No 4 (May 2017): 82) then there is an expectation that the property is being used 20% of the time in the taxable activity. Consequently, any sale of the farmhouse would be a supply in the course or furtherance of the taxable activity and subject to GST under s 8(1) (with an adjustment available under s 21F). Supplies under s 14(1)(d) A supply of a residence under s 14(1)(d) will be an exempt supply and will not be subject to GST. Zero-rating rules The zero-rating rules may apply to one or more of the separate supplies created by s 5(15). Section 11(1)(mb) provides for compulsory zero-rating where: • both the supplier and recipient are GST-registered; • the property will be used to make taxable supplies; and • it will not be lived in as a principal place of residence by the recipient or their relatives. An example where the compulsory zero-rating (CZR) rules might apply, is where a registered person sells their property comprising their home and a cottage used solely to supply short-stay accommodation on a peer-to-peer website. In that situation, s 5(15) deems there to be a supply of the registered person’s home, and a separate supply of the cottage. If the sale is to a GST-registered purchaser who does not intend to reside in the cottage and will continue supplying short-stay accommodation, that supply may be zero-rated under s 11(1)(mb). For further detail on the application of the CZR rules refer to IS 17/08: “GST – Compulsory zero-rating of land rules (general application)” (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 29, No 10 (November 2017): 17). On the sale of a farm between registered persons it is likely that the sale of the farm will meet the requirements of the CZR rules and be zero-rated. However, the supply of a farmhouse is less likely to meet the requirements as it will not necessarily be used to make taxable supplies (see above) but in any event, it may be used as a principal place of residence by the recipient or their relatives. If the CZR rules do not apply to the farmhouse, then it is likely to be either: • a standard rated supply, if used in the taxable activity; or • not subject to GST if used to make exempt supplies or not otherwise used in the taxable activity. In some circumstances, a transaction can be zero-rated under s 11(1)(m) where a taxable activity is sold as a going concern. Unlike the CZR rules, the parties may choose whether to zero-rate the supply of a going concern. The interaction of the going concern rule and the CZR rules is also discussed in IS 17/08. 9 IS 20/05 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Apportionment and valuation issues When s 5(15) applies, the vendor will be making two or more supplies. Depending on the circumstances those supplies will be taxable, non-taxable or exempt. Identifying the residence To value the residence and apportion the purchase price between the supplies, the extent of the principal place of residence must be identified. In the case of farmhouses this can be difficult because the land and buildings belonging to the farmhouse are not always clearly delineated from the rest of the farm. For other types of property (like flats above business premises) the residence might include rights to use common areas. The Commissioner considers it is reasonable for the purposes of s 5(15) that a principal place of residence also includes any appurtenances belonging to or used with it. While the phrase “principal place of residence” is not defined in the GST Act for the purposes of s 5(15), including appurtenances with a residence is consistent with the definition of “dwelling” in s 2(1), and in particular with para (b)(ii) of the definition that provides that a dwelling includes “ any appurtenances belonging to or used with the premises”. The meaning of “appurtenances” in the context of the Act was considered in Norfolk Apartments Ltd v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,212 (CA) and briefly in Wairakei Court Ltd v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,202 (HC) (both cases concerned retirement villages). These cases and the term “appurtenance” are discussed in detail in IS 15/02: “Goods and services tax – GST and retirement villages” (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 27, No 11 (December 2015): 6). While IS 15/02 deals with retirement villages, the underlying principles apply to all properties. The Court of Appeal in Norfolk refers to the English authorities (Methuen-Campbell v Walters \[1979\] 1 All ER 606 and Trim v Sturminster Urban District Council \[1938\] 2 All ER 168). The Trim case considered the word “appurtenances” in a statutory definition of “house”. It held that it has its natural meaning and could not extend to cover land outside the curtilage of the house. Farmland adjacent to the house was not an appurtenance. In Methuen-Campbell the issue was whether a paddock adjoining the garden of a dwelling-house was within the curtilage and an appurtenance to the house. A fence separated the paddock from the garden, although access had once been available through a now boarded-up gate in the fence. The Court considered the Oxford English Dictionary definition of curtilage as “a small court, yard, or piece of ground attached to a dwellinghouse and forming one enclosure with it” and considered what is within the curtilage is a question of fact in each case. In that case the paddock did not form part of the curtilage, being well apart from the house and physically separated from the garden. IS 17/02: “Income tax – deductibility of certain expenses attributable to a farm dwelling” (Tax information Bulletin Vol 29, No 4 (May 2017):82) discussed the identification of “curtilage” in the context of farmhouses: 98. The term “curtilage” refers to the land surrounding the farmhouse that is used primarily for private purposes. The curtilage may be fenced (like a backyard) or not. If the curtilage is not fenced, the Commissioner will accept a reasonable estimate of the curtilage and its value. The curtilage must be taken into account when determining the value of the farmhouse as a proportion of the overall value of the farm. This is because the curtilage is generally used for private purposes and is not used in the farming business. The extent of the curtilage, and its value, must be measured on a fair and reasonable basis. The Commissioner will accept a valuation, a reasonable estimate of the value of the curtilage, or an apportionment based on land area (ie, on a value/cost per hectare basis). Any apportionment needs to be calculated on a reasonable basis and recognise the land value of the curtilage will often be proportionately higher than the rest of the farm. 10 IS 20/05 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Whether land or buildings are appurtenant to a house and contained within its curtilage is based on both physical aspects (ie, proximity to the house and separation from the house) and also on the use to which the land or buildings are put. Something will be an appurtenance where its use and enjoyment forms part of the use and enjoyment of the residence and where it belongs to the residence so that it is not physically separated from the dwelling (eg, by distance or by a fence or a hedge). To determine the extent of a principal place of residence, the facts of each case need to be examined to work out the physical area and any other rights reasonably belonging to and used with the residence. For example, a landscaped garden surrounding a residence that includes a swimming pool and tennis court will be appurtenant to the residence and within its curtilage. While the pool and tennis court may be fenced for safety reasons they are still within the residence’s curtilage, belong to and are used as part of the use of the residence. However, a fenced horse paddock, (such as in Methuen- Campbell), is not appurtenant to a residence as it is physically separated from the residence, so it does not “belong” to the residence and it is not used as part of using the residence. It is not within the residence’s curtilage. Tax invoices The tax invoice for any taxable supplies made by the vendor should state the consideration for those taxable supplies and the amount of tax charged or included in the consideration (see s 24(3)). If the parties have not agreed the separate consideration for the taxable supplies, the total consideration for the whole transaction will need to be apportioned between the taxable supplies and the other non-taxable or exempt supplies. Valuation Where the consideration needs to be apportioned between the separate supplies the onus of proof that the apportionment and the method adopted to reach that apportionment are fair and reasonable in the circumstances, is on the party seeking to rely on the apportionment. Section 10(18) states that if a taxable supply is not the only matter to which a consideration relates, the supply is deemed to be for such part of the consideration as is properly attributable to it. While s 10(18) refers to the amount of consideration that is properly attributable to the supply, s 3A(3)(d) limits the GST input tax claimable to the lesser of the tax fraction of the purchase price or the tax fraction of the open market value of the supply. This may apply in s 5(15) situations where the purchaser claims a secondhand goods GST input tax deduction on a non-taxable supply. For example, where the sale of the residence is non-taxable (because the vendor only uses it privately and not in their taxable activity) and the purchaser subsequently claims a secondhand goods GST input tax deduction (because the purchaser intends to use the residence for taxable purposes). The amount of the GST input tax deduction is limited to the lesser of the tax fraction of the purchase price or open market value. Where open market value is lower, or there is no agreed apportionment of the purchase price, the open-market value will be the default. Hansen J briefly considered s 10(18) in Auckland Institute of Studies Ltd v CIR (2002) 20 NZTC 17,685. He found there was no separate supply and so it was unnecessary to consider the value of those zero-rated supplies. However, he went on to make the following obiter comments: 11 IS 20/05 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[67\] As concluded in the Smiths City case (para 25 above), s 10(18) of the Act suggests that the value of a separate supply is what is “properly attributable” to it. Other provisions of the Act indicate that the open market value of the service is an appropriate basis on which to fix value. Section 4(2) provides: “For the purposes of this Act, the open market value of any supply of goods and services at any date shall be the consideration in money which the supply of those goods and services would generally fetch if supplied in similar circumstances at that date in New Zealand, being a supply freely offered and made between persons who are not associated persons.” Section 10(2)(b) provides: “Subject to this section, the value of a supply of goods and services shall be such amount as, with the addition of the tax charged, is equal to the aggregate of: ... (b) To the extent that the consideration for the supply is not consideration in money, the open market value of that consideration.” \[68\] When it is possible, I see no reason why values should not initially be assessed on the basis of the actual cost of providing the separate supply, plus a reasonable allowance for profit. In this case that would not be possible as agents are remunerated by a commission which itself would have to be apportioned between marketing and promotional services provided to the \[sic\] International and services provided solely or in part to the students. However, ultimately, the appropriate value for a separate supply would have to be tested against the market. I accept Mr Willox’s submission that the value of a separate supply could not exceed the sum which a hypothetical consumer would be prepared to pay. \[E mphasis added\] Sections 10(18) and 3A(3) (d), and Hansen J’s comments in Auckland Institute (although obiter) support the view that the amount paid for a residence and other real property supplied together should be the amount properly attributable to each supply, being the open market value. Where GST-registered non-associated parties agree the purchase price through negotiations, there is an assumption that this will be the open market value. Where the parties are associated, then subs 3A(3)(a)– (c) limit the GST input tax, often to the lesser of input tax on the purchase price or open market value. However, the onus of proof that an apportionment is correct is on the person seeking to rely on the apportionment. Even when the purchase price is agreed, obtaining a valuation to support apportionment should be considered, particularly in cases of doubt or involving significant amounts of consideration. A valuation may be necessary to identify the market value when: • a GST-registered vendor and purchaser cannot agree on the respective values of the residence and the other real property; or • a GST-registered vendor needs to issue a tax invoice and the sale and purchase agreement does not apportion the consideration. Even where no GST is payable on the transaction (eg , where the supply of the residence is non-taxable and the other real property is subject to the CZR rules), a valuation of the separate supplies is still necessary. For instance, the CZR rules require that: • the vendor keeps certain records including details of the consideration received for the supply (see s 75(3B)); and • the purchaser identifies the nominal amount of GST chargeable on the supply (ie, the GST if the transaction was not zero-rated) ( see s 20(3J)). 12 IS 20/05 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Moreover, either party may need to value the separate supplies so they can calculate adjustments required under ss 21–21H. For instance, in the case of a farm sale, there might be future change-of-use adjustments if the purchaser plans to use the farmhouse for making taxable supplies. The method of valuation depends on the circumstances of the case. The method adopted should best reflect the market value of the property in the circumstances. For example, an apportionment based solely on land area is unlikely to be acceptable if it is reasonable for the value of the residential land to be proportionately higher than the rest of the land. This can be the case with farms – see IS 17/02 (at \[47\]). For farms, sometimes it may be more reasonable to value the residence by comparison with sales of residential properties in nearby rural townships, than by applying the per hectare farmland valuation across the board. Ultimately, the onus is on the taxpayer to demonstrate they have used a fair and reasonable basis for their apportionment in the circumstances. A supply forming part of a larger transaction should not be over or under-valued at the expense of another supply in the same transaction. Valuations should be applied to the total consideration on a pro-rata basis. This might be relevant where separate valuations are obtained for separate supplies or if a valuation does not align with the actual purchase price. More information on applying valuations on a pro-rata basis is provided in QB 09/06: “GST – Apportionment of the cost of bare land for the purposes of a change-in-use adjustment” (Tax Information Bulletin, Vol 22, No 6, (July 2010: 21)). Ideally, a valuation should be made by a registered valuer and any valuation relied upon needs to identify the method of valuation and reasons for adopting that method. In cases of doubt or significant consideration, Inland Revenue may insist on a valuation by a registered valuer. If registered persons are in doubt as to whether they need to obtain a valuation from a registered valuer, they should contact their tax adviser. Examples The following examples are included to assist in explaining the application of the law. Example 1 is adapted and updated from the example in IS2824. Example 1 - Sale of farm with two farmhouses The properties A GST-registered farmer negotiates to sell a 225-hectare farm that includes two farmhouses. The farmer and his family occupy the main farmhouse. A fenced garden area of 4,000 square metres surrounds the farmhouse that includes a chicken coop, the vegetable garden and various small sheds. There is an adjacent paddock of 5,000 square metres, known as the “home paddock”. Farm employees and their families occupy the second farmhouse (and it has been rented to various employees and their families for more than 5 years). It is fenced on two sides, has a hedge on one side and a stream running along the fourth side. The area within these boundaries measures 4,750 square metres. The area includes a garage, a mower shed, a few trees and a washing line. There is no garden. The application of s 5(15) Section 5(15) applies to the supply of the farm property. It deems the supply of each of the residences and the balance of the farmland and buildings to be 13 IS 20/05 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] separate supplies. This is because the two farmhouses are the principal places of residence of the families that live in them. The second farmhouse is also a supply subject to s 14(1)(d). For the main farmhouse, this is used by the farmer in the farming operations. Following IS 17/02: “Income tax – deductibility of certain expenses attributable to a farm dwelling”, the farmer has been claiming 20% of the expenses relating to the property for income tax purposes – as well as claiming GST input tax on these expenses. On this basis, the farmhouse is used in the farmer’s taxable activity and is subject to GST under s 8(1) on sale (with an adjustment under s 21F). The second farmhouse has at various times been rented or made available under a service occupancy agreement to farm employees. This means that the second farmhouse has been used for making exempt supplies and so no GST input tax was claimable on it. As it was used for making exempt supplies, it is excluded from forming part of the farmer’s taxable activity under s 6(3)(d). In any event, it would be an exempt supply under s 14(1)(d). Therefore, the second farmhouse is not subject to GST on sale. Identifying the extent of the properties The physical area of the residence in each case is as follows: • Main farmhouse — 4,000 square metres. The home paddock is not part of the curtilage of the farmhouse. The area is physically divided off from the farmhouse. It is reasonable to treat the fenced area immediately surrounding the farmhouse as its curtilage. • Second farmhouse — 4,750 square metres. Although fairly large, it is reasonable to treat this area as appurtenant to the farmhouse. This area is physically divided off from the surrounding farmland by both artificial and natural features. Valuation and apportionment of purchase price Anticipating selling the property, the farmer has recently had the farm independently valued by a registered valuer. The valuation (exclusive of GST) shows: • Farmland and farm improvements – $1.4 million • Main farmhouse – $2 50,000 • Second farmhouse – $20 0,000 • Total value = $1.95 million The farmer negotiates to sell the farm for $2 m illion plus GST, to a GST- registered purchaser who is acquiring the farm to carry on a taxable activity of farming. The parties are not treating this as the sale of a going concern, however the CZR rules will apply to the supply of the farm (but not the farmhouses). In finalising the terms of the sale and purchase agreement, the parties agree that the purchase price shall be apportioned between the farm as to $1.5 million and the two farmhouses as to $500,000. The split between the two farmhouses is agreed as being $300,000 for the main farmhouse and $200,000 for the second farmhouse. (The purchaser is prepared to accept this price and the apportionment, having received their own valuation.) The sale and purchase agreement includes the following details: • Apportionment of consideration: o Farm – $1 .5 million (plus GST of $0 as zero-rated) o Main farmhouse – $300,000 (plus GST of $45,000 as standard rated) o Second farmhouse - $200,000 (plus no GST as exempt) • Total price including GST – $2,045,000 14 IS 20/05 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] GST output tax of $45,000 is payable on the transaction, with an adjustment made under s 21F for GST input tax not claimed on the main farmhouse. GST input tax may be claimable by the purchaser on the main farmhouse to the extent that it is used in their taxable activity, and the CZR rules require them to identify the nominal amount of GST on the farm – in this case $225,000 ($1.5 million x 15%). Example 2 - Sale of section with home and holiday cottage Petunia and Vernon own a section next to Lake Wakatipu. On the section is a three-bedroom house and a separate holiday cottage. The house is used solely as their private residence. The holiday cottage is accessed via a private driveway. It has a white picket fence on three sides and drops away to the lake on the other side. The cottage is used as a dedicated short-stay rental property. It is well maintained, in a prime location and is advertised on various websites. It is used year-round by skiers, trampers and overseas holiday makers. The holiday cottage’s turnover is $70,000 a year and so Petunia and Vernon are registered for GST. Petunia and Vernon told an estate agent friend that they were thinking of retiring and their friend told them they could get $2 m illion for the property in the current market. They mentioned this to Luna who has previously shown an interest in the property. The parties are interested but want to know the GST implications before they go any further. The Act treats the supply of a principal place of residence and other property as separate supplies. The three-bedroom house is used by Petunia and Vernon as their principal place of residence and so is treated separately from the holiday cottage for GST purposes. The three-bedroom house is not used in the taxable activity and will not be subject to GST output tax when sold. There may be GST implications in the future if Luna decided to also use the house to make supplies of accommodation. However, on sale there is no GST output tax liability for Petunia and Vernon. The holiday cottage is used in the taxable activity to make taxable supplies and will be subject to GST output tax. If Luna remains unregistered (because she intends to make fewer supplies and stay below the $60,000 threshold) then GST would be payable at the standard rate. However, it is more likely that Luna will be GST registered in which case the compulsory zero-rating rules may apply. GST will apply at 0% if the holiday cottage will be used to make taxable supplies and it will not be lived in as a principal place of residence by Luna or her relatives. In many cases prudent parties (or their lenders) will require a valuation from a registered valuer. In this case they decide they will want a valuation. This is a good idea because even though they do not return any GST there are still record keeping requirements on Petunia and Vernon. Luna is also required to identify the nominal amount of GST chargeable on the supply of the holiday cottage (ie, the GST if the transaction was not zero-rated). Moreover, the valuations could be important for Luna if her use of either property changes and she is required to calculate change in use adjustments. Example 3 – Sale of shop and flat Rita is selling a giftshop she has owned and operated for the last ten years. Above the giftshop is a two-bedroom flat with a separate accessway. When she first purchased the property, she lived in the flat but for the last 8 years she has rented it out to tenants. Rita is GST registered and is selling the business and property to a GST registered purchaser who will continue to operate the giftshop. Section 5(15) will apply to split the supplies – the giftshop and the two-bedroom flat. The GST treatment of these supplies is as follows: 15 IS 20/05 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] • The supply of the giftshop will be subject to GST but at 0% because the compulsory zero-rating rules will apply. This is because the parties are both GST-registered and the purchaser is intending to continue to make taxable supplies. • The supply of the flat is not subject to GST as it does not form part of Rita’s taxable activity.

Income tax - tax issues arising from owning foreign residential rental property
===============================================================================

If you own a foreign residential rental property, you probably need to pay tax on the rental income in both New Zealand and in the country where the property is located.  As a result, you want to ensure you are calculating your New Zealand tax correctly and getting any available credit for the foreign tax paid.

The way you calculate the income from your foreign residential rental property for New Zealand tax purposes may be different from the way you calculate it for foreign tax purposes.  It is unlikely that you will be able to simply copy the income and expense amounts you calculated for foreign tax purposes straight into your New Zealand tax return.  This is because tax rules vary from country to country.  For example:

*   balance dates for when income or expenses are recognised as derived or incurred vary from country to country
*   the deductions you can claim for New Zealand tax purposes may differ from those allowed overseas and vice versa 
*   you will need to convert the foreign currency amounts into New Zealand dollars using the correct rates for the correct dates
*   New Zealand’s Financial Arrangements rules (FA rules) may mean you need to account for both the amount of interest you paid or incurred on a foreign currency loan used to finance the residential rental property as well as any foreign exchange gains or losses made on the loan

In addition to paying New Zealand tax on rental income from your foreign residential rental property, you may also be required to pay New Zealand tax on any gains you make if you sell the property.  This is because New Zealand’s land taxing rules can apply to foreign property owned by New Zealand tax residents in the same way they do for New Zealand property.

If you are required to pay tax on income from your foreign residential rental property both in New Zealand and overseas, you may be entitled to claim foreign tax credits in New Zealand for tax paid overseas.  Calculating the foreign tax credits available where tax has been paid on income in a foreign country and tax is also payable on the same income in New Zealand is complex.

This interpretation statement explains the different matters you need to consider to comply with your New Zealand tax obligations when you own a foreign residential rental property.  Because these issues can be complicated and the outcomes can vary depending your circumstances, you may wish to seek professional tax advice tailored to your situation.

One of the requirements is that the person (or another person for them) must have carried on development or division work that is not minor, on or in relation to that land (s CB 12(1)(d)). The focus of this Interpretation Statement is on the meaning of the word “ minor” in s CB 12(1)(d). The other requirements of s CB 12(1) are also discussed. 2.This Interpretation Statement updates and replaces Interpretation Guideline IG0010 “Work of a minor nature”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 17, No 1 (February 2005): 5 (IG0010). The main conclusions in this Interpretation Statement are unchanged from IG0010. However, some parts have been updated for clarity and to account for changes to the legislation. The item has also been updated to reflect the conclusions reached in two public items: •“QB 15/04: Income tax — whether it is possible that the disposal of land that is part of an undertaking or scheme involving development or division will not give rise to income, even if no exclusion applies”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 27, No 4 (May 2015): 37. •“QB 15/02: Income tax – major development or division - what is ‘significant expenditure’ for section CB 13 purposes?”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 27, No 4 (May 2015): 20. 3.‘Safe harbour’ figures for absolute cost and relative cost have also been identified to assist taxpayers with compliance. Summary 4.Under s CB 12(1), a n amount a person receives from the disposal of land will be income of a person where the following requirements are satisfied, and provided no exclusions apply 1 . The requirements are that: •the person carries on an undertaking or scheme (not necessarily in the nature of a business); •the undertaking or scheme involves the development of the land or the division of the land into lots; •the development or division work is carried on by the person (or another person for them) and that work is on or relates to that land; •the work is not minor; and •the undertaking or scheme was begun within 10 years of the date on which the person acquired the land. 5.For income to be taxable under s CB 12(1) a person must carry on an “undertaking or scheme”. An “undertaking or scheme” is a plan, design or programme of action devised to attain some end and includes a project or enterprise. There must be a 1 The relevant exclusions are listed at \[19\]. 3 IS 20/08 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] coherent plan or purpose which involves a series of steps directed to an end result. Not a great deal is needed for an activity to constitute an undertaking or scheme. 6.The undertaking or scheme must involve the “development of the land” or the “division of the land into lots”. •“Development of the land” includes work done on or in relation to the land in preparation for its intended use. This might include fencing, demolishing buildings, clearing the site, earthmoving, installing power or water, creating a driveway or entranceway, legal work, zoning applications, the drawing of engineering plans and specifications, and entering into contracts for the physical work necessary for the development. It does not include the development of buildings. •“Division of the land into lots” requires, at a minimum, a level of activity designed to facilitate the division of land. This could include planning and preparation of formal plans; survey work, obtaining resource and building consents, and legal work, including the deposit of subdivision plans and the issue of separate titles if required. 7.The development or division work must be carried on by the person (or another person for them) and that work must be on or relating to the land. Work performed by a local authority in fulfilment of its own statutory function is not work carried on by the person (or another person for them). 8.The development or division work must be more than minor. Whether development or division work is more than minor depends on an overall assessment of the facts of each case, having regard to what has been done relative to both the nature and value of the land involved. The case law identifies four factors that must be considered when making that assessment: •The total cost of the work done, in both absolute and relative terms Whether development or division work is minor depends on an overall assessment of the work involved, including the cost, as measured both in absolute terms (total cost) and relative terms (relative to the value of the land that is subject to the undertaking or scheme at the start of the development or division work). The Commissioner accepts that amounts of $50,000 or below are low in absolute cost terms. Similarly, the Commissioner accepts that relative costs of less than 5% of the value of the land at the start of the development or division work are low in relative cost terms. These figures are ‘safe harbours’ and are intended to give taxpayers greater certainty when making this cost assessment. Both measures of cost must be considered as it is possible for costs to be low in absolute terms but high in relative terms, and vice versa. The cost factor is weighed along with the other three factors discussed below. However, the Commissioner considers that there will be a point where the absolute value of the sum spent on the development or division work is so high that this factor alone will indicate that the work is more than minor. •The nature of the professional services used Development or division work typically requires the services of professionals such as a solicitor, a surveyor, an engineer and/or a valuer. The more time a professional spends on the development or division work, the more likely that the development or division work is not minor. In addition, the more complex 4 IS 20/08 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] and significant the work undertaken by the professional the more likely that the development or division work is not minor. •The extent of the physical work required The more physical work undertaken as part of the development or division work, the more likely it is that the work is not minor. However, a lack of physical work does not necessarily mean that the development or division work will be minor. •The significance of the changes to the physical nature and character of the land The more significant the changes to the physical nature and character of the land since the development or division work began, the less likely it is that the development or division work will be minor. 9.Fi nally, the undertaking or scheme must have begun within 10 years of the date on which the person acquired the land. An undertaking or scheme begins when the first step in carrying out the scheme takes place; when there is some act done that sets it in train. Introduction 10.An amount a person receives from the disposal of land is taxable if the requirements of s CB 12 are satisfied. One of the requirements is that the person (or another person for them) must have carried on development or division work that is not minor, on or in relation to that land (s CB 12(1)(d)). The focus of this Interpretation Statement is on the meaning of the word “minor” in s CB 12(1)(d). The other requirements of s CB 12(1) are also discussed. 11.The interpretation taken in the statement is based on: •the context and wording of s CB 12; •the background to s CB 12, including the policy reasons for its introduction; •principles for interpreting s CB 12, based on the relevant case law; and •the factors the courts have considered in determining whether development or division work is “minor” under s CB 12(1)(d). Context for s CB 12 12.Section CB 12 is one of several provisions in subpart CB that treat amounts derived from a disposal of land as income. Other sections include: •land disposals falling within the bright-line test (s CB 6A); •land disposals where the land was acquired with the purpose or intention of sale (s CB 6); •land disposals where the land was acquired by a land dealer or developer (s CB 7); •land disposals where the land was used as a landfill (s CB 8); 5 IS 20/08 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] •land disposals within 10 years: oland dealing business (s CB 9); oland development or subdivision business (s CB 10); •land disposals within 10 years where the person or their associate carries on a business of erecting buildings and makes improvements to the land (s CB 11); •amounts from the major development or division of land that are not already income under another land disposal provision (s CB 13); •amounts from land affected by change that are not already income under another land disposal provision (s CB 14); •land disposals where the parties are associated persons (s CB 15(1)). 13.Amounts derived from the disposal of land may also be taxable income if they are amounts derived from a business (s CB 1), amounts derived from a profit-making undertaking or scheme (s CB 3), or as income under ordinary concepts (s CA 1(2)). Background to s CB 12 14.Earlier versions of what is now s CB 12 stated that a disposal of land was taxable income if it involved “development or division work, not being work of a minor nature”. 2 The interpretation of this phrase was considered in IG0010. 15.When the income tax legislation was rewritten, “work of a minor nature” became “the development or division work is not minor”. This wording change was not intended to change the substantive effect of the provision 3 . Therefore, s CB 12 should be interpreted consistently with earlier versions of the legislation. Purpose of s CB 12 16.In Lowe v CIR (1981) 5 NZTC 61,006 (CA), Cooke J said that the purpose of s 88AA of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954 ( an earlier version of s CB 12) was to remove the need for a profit-making intention before an amount would be income arising from an undertaking or scheme. 17.In Costello v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,253 (CA), Richardson J noted that the focus of what is now s CB 12 is on the activity undertaken by the person with respect to the land, rather than any economic benefits the person may have obtained. In passing what is now s CB 12, Parliament sought to limit the scope of the provision to exclude developments or divisions of land that were only minor. This limitation was referred to in Parliament by the then Member for Kāpiti, Frank O'Flynn, at the third reading of the Land and Income Tax Amendment Act 1973: 4 2 Section 67(4) of the Income Tax Act 1976, s CD 1(2)(f) of the Income Tax Act 1994 and s CB 10 of the Income Tax Act 2004. 3 See s ZA 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007, s YA 3(3) and (4) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and s YB 4(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994. 4 (2 November 1973) 387 New Zealand Parliamentary Debates 4,792 at 4,805 (Land and Income Tax Amendment Act 1973 – Third Reading, Frank O’Flynn). 6 IS 20/08 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] It is quite wrong to claim that a man who owns a section of half or three-quarters of an acre for, say, not quite 10 years, and who cuts it up into three lots and sells two of them, would be lumbered with what the Opposition emotionally called a capital gains tax. The paragraph uses the words “not being work of a minor nature”, and it is well known that if one merely cuts up a big section the only work involved for the subdivider is having a surveyor draw up a simple plan, and often not even a plan which requires the formal depositing arrangements under the Land Transfer Act. 18.Limiting s CB 12 to developments or divisions of land that are more than minor was an attempt to exclude very basic development or division work from the scope of the provision . E xclusions to s CB 12(1) 19.Section CB 12(1) is subject to four exclusions. The exclusions apply where the land disposed of is for the person’s: •residential occupation (s CB 17); •business premises (s CB 20); •farming or agricultural business (s CB 21); •business of deriving investment income from the land as described in s CC 1; for example, renting or leasing the land (s CB 23) . 20.S ection CB 12(2) states that s CB 12(1) is overridden by these exclusions. These exclusions are not discussed in this item. Other relevant provisions 21.Section CB 12 is subject to several provisions that help to interpret its scope an d m eaning. 22.Section CB 15(1) applies to s CB 12 and provides that land that is transferred between associated persons and later sold by the transferee (the person who received the land) gives rise to income in the hands of the transferee where: •the transferee derives a gain when they sell the land; and •the amount the transferee derived would have been income of the transfero r ( the person who transferred the land to the transferee) under any of ss CB 6- CB 14, i f the transferor had retained the land and sold it themselves. 23.Section CB 15B states that a person will acquire an estate, interest or option in land on the date that begins a period in which the person has an estate or interest in, or an option to acquire, the land (alone or jointly ( in common with) another person). 5 24.U nder s CB 23B, s CB 12 and the exclusions in ss CB 17 to CB 23 can apply if the land disposed of is part or the whole of the land to which s CB 12 applies or is disposed of together with other land. 25.Section YA 1 defines terms used in s CB 12(1), including “dispose” and “land”. 5 For more information, see “QB 17/02: Income tax – date of acquisition of land, and start date for 2- year bright-line test”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 29, No 4 (May 2017): 125. 7 IS 20/08 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] The requirements of s CB 12(1) 26.Under s CB 12(1), any amount a person receives from the disposal of land will be income of that person where the following requirements are satisfied, and provide d n o exclusions apply. The requirements are that: •the person carries on an undertaking or scheme (not necessarily in the nature of a business ); •t he undertaking or scheme involves the development of the land or the division of the land into lots; •the development or division work is carried on by the person (or another person for them) and that work is on or relates to that land; •the work is not minor; and •the undertaking or scheme was begun within 10 years of the date on whic h t he person acquired the land. 27.This Interpretation Statement considers when development or division work, carried on as part of an undertaking or scheme, is minor. The other requirements of s CB 12(1) are also discussed. 28.This statement addresses three questions: •What is an “undertaking or scheme”? (From \[29\].) •When does a person carry on “development or division work”? (From \[39\].) •When is development or division work “minor”? (From \[75\].) What is an “undertaking or scheme”? 29.The words “undertaking or scheme” were considered in Vuleta v CIR \[1962\] NZLR 325 (SC). Henry J, at 329, defin ed “scheme" as: a plan, design, or programme of action, hence a plan of action devised in order to attain some end; a project, an enterprise. To “devise” likewise is to order the plan or design of; to plan, to contrive, to think out, to frame or to invent. 30.This definition was approved by the Court of Appeal in Duff v CIR (1982) 5 NZTC 61,131 (CA). This definition has also been approved in several land subdivision cases, including Wellington v CIR (1981) 5 NZTC 61,101 (HC) and O’ Toole v CIR (1985) 7 NZTC 5,045 (HC). 31.Similarly, Judge Barber defined an “undertaking or scheme” in Case S86 (1996) 1 7 N ZTC 7,538 at 7,548: It is settled law that a scheme or undertaking means some plan or purpose which is coherent and has some unity of conception; there should be a series of steps directed to an end result; a fairly generalised plan is all that is needed; the scheme need not be precise: refer Duff v CIR (1982) 5 TRNZ 343, Steinberg v FCT (1975) 134 CLR 640. \[Emphasis added\] 32.In both Lowe and Costello, it was accepted by the taxpayers that the subdivision w ork they had done amounted to an undertaking or scheme. In both cases, the 8 IS 20/08 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] courts commented that this was a proper concession to make. Richardson J noted in Lowe at 61,020: More importantly for present purposes, division as an alternative to development and the limitation of the exception to work of a minor nature suggest that not a great deal is required by way of activity to constitute a plan or programme of action an undertaking or scheme under the paragraph. \[Emphasis added\] 33.The court in O’ Toole stated at 5,050, that an undertaking or scheme existed because the taxpayers: ... entered into a project or enterprise directed towards the subdivision of their land into lots with the view to sale of those lots at a profit. The scheme existed in the plan or purpose to sell off the lots not reserved by the objectors for their own use in order to realise the maximum available profit. 34.In summary, an undertaking or scheme is a plan, design or programme of action devised to attain some end and includes a project or an enterprise. There must be a coherent plan or purpose which involves a series of steps directed to an end result. Not a great deal is needed for an activity to constitute an undertaking or scheme under s CB 12(1). When does an undertaking or scheme commence? 35.The time at which an undertaking or scheme commences is relevant because s CB 12 will only apply if the undertaking or scheme was begun within 10 years of the date on which the person acquired the land. 36.The date of commencement is when the first step in carrying out the scheme takes place; when there is some act done that sets it in train (Cross v CIR (1985) 7 NZTC 5,054 (HC), Cross v CIR (1987) 9 NZTC 6,101(CA), Smith v CIR (No 2) (1989) 11 NZTC 6,018 (CA)). It is a question of fact in any given case as to whether the undertaking or scheme has moved beyond conception to having been put into operation. This is discussed in more detail in “QB 15/04: Income tax — whether it is possible that the disposal of land that is part of an undertaking or scheme involving development or division will not give rise to income, even if no exclusion applies”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 27, No 4 (May 2015): 37, from \[39\]. Undertaking or scheme not carried on with a view to disposal of that land 37.Section CB 12(1) will not apply to the disposal of land if it can be established that the undertaking or scheme involving development or division work was not carried on with a view to the disposal of that land. 38.This issue is also discussed in detail in “ QB 15/04: Income tax – whether it is possible that the disposal of land that is part of an undertaking or scheme involving development or division will not give rise to income, even if no exclusion applies ”, T ax Information Bulletin Vol 27, No 4 (May 2015): 37, from \[52\]. QB 15/04’s conclusion is based on case law, the words of s CB 12 and the purpose of the provision. 9 IS 20/08 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] When does a person carry on “development or division work”? Development of the land 39.In Dobson v CIR (1987) 9 NZTC 6,025 (HC), Hardie Boys J stated that the scheme of the statute made it clear that “development” is to be interpreted in a restricted sense. It means preparation of the land for an intended use. In Dobson, “development” was found to be the demolition of existing buildings and the clearing of the sites. This suggests that development work encompasses physical wor k und ertaken in relation to the land. This conclusion is also consistent with Anzamco Ltd (in liq) v CIR (1983) 6 NZTC 61,522 (HC). 40.However, Smith, makes it clear that development work does not have to be physical work. As McMullin J stated, at 6,024–6,025: What then is meant by the words “development or division into lots”. There is a degree of overlapping in that phrase. Some development work may not be division work and vice versa, but generally speaking the two will go hand in hand. “Division” is not defined in the Land and Income Tax Act or the Local Government Act 1974 which deals with the subdivision of land. “Development” is also not defined. This rather suggests that the framers of the tax legislation intended that the phrase “development or division” is not to be narrowly construed when considered in relation to an undertaking or scheme. By declining to define “development or division work” \[s CB 12\] leaves the exact nature of the work wide open. Development work frequently involves physical work on the land itself but need not necessarily do so. In their concession that the letting of the sewage contract in October 1971 was capable of construction as a development work, counsel for the appellant rightly recognised that a contractual step which anticipates physical work but itself falls short of it may be development work. In my view development work on a subdivision of land may cover a range of activities including, in appropriate cases, the preparation of a zoning application without which the subdivision and resulting sales at a profit could never be achieved, the drawing of engineering plans and specifications for roads, the provision of estimates, the preparation of subdivisional plans, the letting of the necessary contracts and the resulting physical work involving the construction of roads, rights of way and culverts. \[Emphasis added\] 41.Similarly, in Smith, Bisson J stated, at 6,026: If \[counsel for the taxpayer\] accepts as a matter of law that legal work can be division work in a scheme involving division into lots, there can be no justification as a matter of law and logic for not accepting legal work as development work in a scheme involving development. This would also be the case if the scheme involved both development and division into lots of the land in question. 42.In summary, development work includes any type of work done on or in relation to the land in preparation for its intended use, such as: •fencing •demolishing buildings •clearing the site •earthmoving •installing power or water •creating a driveway or entranceway •legal work 10 IS 20/08 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] •zoning applications •drafting engineering plans and specifications •entering into contracts for the physical work necessary for the development. 43.However, development work does not include the development of buildings. This is discussed in more detail from \[60\] . Division of the land into lots 44.Division of the land into lots requires, at a minimum, a level of activity designed to facilitate the division of land. The High Court in Wellington concluded that the work involved in the division of an area into lots would include at least the following for the purposes of s CB 12(1): •planning and preparation of formal plans; •survey work; •obtaining town planning consents and local authority permits; and •legal work, including the deposit of subdivision plans and the issue of separate titles if required. 45.These features will exist where the division work has been completed. However, s CB 12 only requires the work to be carried on, not to be carried out, so it is possible that an undertaking or scheme involving the division of land into lots would not involve some of the work listed. 46.The High Court in O’Toole found that the absence of physical work did not mean that there was no division work carried out. However, as confirmed by the Court of Appeal in Smith, in some situations there may be a degree of overlap between “development” and “division” work. For example, the physical work of erecting boundary fences or defining boundaries might be development work and the division of the land into lots. 47.The Commissioner considers that the “d ivision of the land into lots” includes subdivisions, unit-titling and cross leasing. 48.The amalgamation of two or more lots of land into one lot will not, on its own, constitute the division of the land into lots for the purposes of s CB 12(1) . H owever, if the amalgamation of land forms part of a subdivision scheme, the cost of that amalgamation work will be included in the cost of the division work (see Case P61 (1992) 14 NZTC 4,416 and Case R7 (1994) 16 NZTC 6,035). Specific circumstances 49.This section provides further analysis on whether some specific types of work are development or division work for the purposes of s CB 12(1). The types of work are: previous work for a different purpose; abandoned and revived undertakings or schemes; boundary adjustments; building on the land; a financial contribution or an environmental assessment as part of resource consent; and work done by a local authority. 11 IS 20/08 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Does previous work for a different purpose constitute “development or division work”? 50.If work is done on or in relation to the land and that work was for a different purpose to the undertaking or scheme of developing land or dividing land into lots, that work is not development or division work for the purposes of s CB 12(1) . 51.In Case P61, the taxpayer carried out work involving water supply, sewer age, an d l and clearance to develop an orchard five or six years before the land wa s s ubdivided. Judge Barber concluded that this previous work was not division work carried on or carried out by the taxpayer and this work did not form part of the undertaking or scheme of the subdivision, as it was done for a different purpose. Consequently, this previous work was not considered development or division work. What happens if an undertaking or scheme is abandoned? And what happens if the undertaking or scheme is later revived? 52.It is only necessary that an undertaking or scheme meeting the relevant criteria has been carried on, it does not need to have been carried out (ie, brought to fruition). If an undertaking or scheme was carried on but was subsequently abandoned, the ultimate disposal of the land will still be caught by the relevan t p rovisions unless an exclusion applies or the taxpayer can establish that the undertaking or scheme was not carried on with a view to disposal of the land in question (See “QB 15/04: Income Tax – whether it is possible that the disposal of land that is part of an undertaking or scheme involving development or division will not give rise to income, even if no exclusion applies” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 27, No 4 (May 2015): 37, at \[8\] and Cross (HC)). 53.If an abandoned undertaking or scheme is subsequently revived as a continuation or modification of the original undertaking or scheme, s CB 12(1) will apply (provided the other criteria are met). For example, if the land was purchased in Year 1, the scheme was commenced in year 5 and abandoned in year 8 and later revived and sold in year 12, the sale will still be caught by s CB 12 as the scheme was begun within 10 years of the date on which the person acquired the land. Are boundary adjustments the “division of the land into lots”? 54.Surveyed boundaries between adjoining lots of land may be adjusted. Adjustment m ight be by relocating the boundary and rearranging the lots or realigning the lots and may not involve any increase in the number of lots. The Commissioner’s view is that all boundary adjustments are the division of the land into lots. There are two reasons for this view. 55.The first reason is that, technically, a boundary adjustment requires the existing boundaries to be erased and new boundaries to be created (even if there is n o i ncrease in the number of lots). The work is the same type of work that is carried out in a subdivision where the number of lots is increased. 56.The second reason is that s CB 23B provides that s CB 12 applies where the land disposed of is the whole or part of any land to which s CB 12 applies or the whole or part of any such land together with any other land. Therefore, if the boundaries between adjoining lots of land owned by the same person are altered, there is a division into lots of the land comprised of those adjoining lots. 12 IS 20/08 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 57.While the term “division of the land into lots” has a broad meaning and encompasses all types of boundary adjustments, the amount received from the sale of that adjusted land may not be taxable under s CB 12 if: •the other conditions of s CB 12(1) are not satisfied (that is, the division work is minor); or •one of the exclusions to s CB 12 is satisfied; or •it can be established that the undertaking or scheme involving the land was not carried on with a view to disposing of that land (discussed at \[37\] to \[38\] and in QB 15/04). 58.A boundary adjustment where physical work is carried out could also fall within the definition of “development work” in s CB 12(1) (see Anzamco, Dobson and Wellington). 59.Example 4 of this Interpretation Statement concerns a boundary adjustment. Is building on the land “development work”? 60.In Dobson, Hardie Boys J held that development work referred to in what is now s CB 12(1) does not include the construction of buildings, as income derived from this activity is assessed under what is now s CB 11 or in the case of others who build for profit, what is now s CB 3. 6 Therefore, building work is not development work, so building work is not taken into account in assessing whether s CB 12(1) applies to the land. As observed by Hardie Boys J, at 6,030: The question to be determined in respect of each of the three properties involved in this case is therefore whether their division into lots, or their development, as distinct from the construction of buildings on them, was “work of a minor nature”. 61.It may be difficult to determine whether the work is preliminary development or d ivision work (which could be development or division work for the purposes of s CB 12(1)) or part of the construction process of a building (which, per Dobson, would not be development work). In Dobson, Hardie Boys J concluded, at 6,030: Demolition, clearing of the sites, surveys, the deposit of plans, the preparation of cross leases, the obtaining of composite titles, were all part of, and together comprised, the development and division work involved. All else was part of the construction of the new flats. 62.Accordingly, the demolition and clearing of the sites was regarded as preliminary work that was within the phrase “development or division into lots”. 63.The decision in Dobson was followed in Case R7. In that case, an old house was purchased, placed on the site of a subdivision and partly renovated. Judge Barbe r d id not regard the purchase and placement of the house on the site as development work. He excluded the necessary minor excavation work for the foundations of the house when he weighed up whether the development work was minor. 64.Whether an item of development work is preliminary to construction work or is part of the construction process is a question of fact to be determined in each case. 6 Section CB 11 covers disposals of land within 10 years of improvement by a building business, and s CB 3 covers profit-making undertakings or schemes. 13 IS 20/08 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Demolition work to prepare land before construction of a building is development work, but construction of the building itself is not. Does a financial contribution imposed as a condition of resource consent represent “development or division work”? 65.In deciding whether development or division work is minor, the courts have evaluated the total cost of the work done in both absolute and relative terms (this is discussed further from \[80\]). It is therefore necessary to evaluate whether some expenses represent work done that is within the definition of development or division work and should therefore be included in the total cost of the work done. 66.A financial contribution of money or land may be imposed as a condition of a resource consent under the Resource Management Act 1991, as a charge against landowners who are subdividing. The financial contribution will be specified in the relevant district plan and can be a significant proportion of the total subdivision costs. 67.The issue is whether the landowner’s payments of financial contributions under the Resource Management Act 1991 would represent division work. 68.Case D24 (1979) 4 NZTC 60,597 is the only case that considers whether a financial contribution under the Resource Management Act 1991 is a payment representin g w ork done for the purposes of what is now s CB 12(1). Associate Judge Lloyd Martin said, at 60,607: The amount payable to a local authority as “Reserve Contribution” cannot in my opinion be considered as amounts payable for “work” done. Such sums become payable as the result of the subdivision of land into lots but the contributions are not part of the costs involved in creating such subdivisions. 69.This view was later affirmed in Aubrey v CIR (1984) 6 NZTC 61,765 (HC) ( in the context of s CB 13(1)) where Tompkins J concluded, at 61,769: The division work involves the preparation and obtaining of the requisite approval of the scheme plan of the subdivision, then the lodging in the Land Registry Office of the deposited plan. The legal and survey costs involve expenditure on that work. But although a reserve fund contribution may be required to obtain the approval of the subdivision, I do not consider that it can be regarded as an expenditure on that work. Nor do I consider that it can be regarded as an expenditure on an amenity customarily provided in major projects. \[Emphasis added\] 70.Accordingly, financial contributions of money or land or both imposed as a condition of resource consent do not represent “development or division work”. Is an environmental assessment as part of resource consent “development or division work”? 71.A resource consent application may require the applicant to provide an assessment of the activity’s effects on the environment. 7 The Commissioner considers that “development or division work” includes any work involved in obtaining an environmental assessment as part of the process of applying for resource consent . This is because obtaining an environmental assessment is “development or division 7 See s 88(2)(c) of the Resource Management Act 1991. 14 IS 20/08 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] work carried on by the person (or another person for them) on or relating to the land”. However, for work done by a local authority itself, see from \[72\]. Is work done by a local authority “development or division work carried on by the person, or another person for them”? 72.The courts have not addressed the meaning of the words “work ... carried on by the person, or another person for them” in the context of s CB 12(1) or its earlie r i terations. However, in Mee v CIR (1988) 10 NZTC 5,073 (HC), Hardie Boys J considered the words “ development or division work ... has been carried on or carried out by or on behalf of the taxpayer on or in relation to that land” in what is now s CB 13. The issue was whether a payment of an agreed sum to the local authority for roading, water and sewer age as a condition of the subdivision consent represented development or division work carried on or carried out by the taxpayer. Hardie Boys J found that it did not, saying, at 5,076: Execution of this scheme did not involve the taxpayer in this particular work. All that was required of him was the payment of money to enable the Council to do it at a later date. When the Council did eventually do it, it did not do it on Mr Mee’s behalf. It was not acting as his agent, or in any other representative capacity, but independently, in the fulfilment of its own duties. 73.It is inferred from this case that work performed by a local authority in fulfilment of its own statutory function is not “work ... carried on by the person or another person for them” under s CB 12. The work carried out is the responsibility of the local authority. This is different to the situation where a local authority requires a taxpayer to undertake work themselves, as a condition of the consent. Because s CB 12 was originally enacted at the same time as s CB 13 and as part of the same legislative scheme, and because s CB 13 and s CB 12 deal with the development of land or the division of the land into lots, it is presumed that a court would adopt the same view if the question arose in relation to s CB 12. 74.Similarly, the processing of a resource consent application by a local authority i s w ork done in fulfilment of the local authority’s own statutory function, not “work ... carried on by the person, or another person for them” under s CB 12(1). C onsequentially, resource consent application fees are not included whe n e valuating whether the development or division work is minor. When is development or division work “minor”? 75.As discussed at \[15\], when the Income Tax Act was rewritten, “work of a minor nature” became “the development or division work is not minor”. The wording change was not intended to change the substantive effect of the provision, s o s CB 12 is to be interpreted with reference to the earlier iterations of the Income Tax Act. 8 76.In Costello, the Court of Appeal considered the meaning of the phrase “work of a minor nature”. Richardson J, delivering the court’s judgment, noted that the phrase focuses on the nature of the work undertaken, not the economic benefits that result from the work. He emphasised the need to carry out a comparative analysis of the work undertaken in determining whether the work was minor in nature. He commented that this analysis needed to be performed on a case-by- 8 See s ZA 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007, s YA 3(3) and (4) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and s YB 4(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994. 15 IS 20/08 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] case basis rather than by simply applying a pre-determined or mechanical checklist, at 11,256: “Minor” like “lesser” is a relative expression. It becomes a question of degree. Whether the work in question is of a minor nature is a matter of fact to be determined on all the circumstances of the particular case. Every subdivision of a larger area into lots will include some survey work, the preparation of appropriate plans, obtaining planning consents and local authority permits and associated legal work including the depositing of subdivisional plans and the issue of any separate titles. \[ Section CB 12\] recognises that the work involved in some subdivisions may be of a minor nature. Whether or not it is so in the particular case calls for an assessment of what was done which in practical terms may require consideration of the time, effort and expense involved. The statutory yardstick is not precise. It does not specify any particular criteria. It calls for an overall judgment not a mechanical application of a checklist. 77.His Honour had made similar comments in Lowe, at 61,020: Whether the work is of a minor nature must, it seems, depend on an overall assessment of such matters as the time, effort and expense involved, measured both in absolute terms and relative to the nature and value of the land on which the work is done. 78.Therefore, whether work done in developing land or dividing the land into lots is minor depends on an overall assessment of the facts of each case, having regard to what has been done relative to both the nature and value of the land involved. It does not require a mechanical application of a checklist. 79.The courts have identified several factors to be considered in determining whether development or division work is minor. This Interpretation Statement focuses on how each of these factors has been interpreted and applied. These factors are: •the total cost of the work done, in both absolute and relative terms; •the nature of the professional services used; •the extent of the physical work done; and •the significance of the changes to the physical nature and character of the land. Total cost of work done in both absolute and relative terms 80.Richardson J in Lowe stated that whether development or division work is minor depends on an overall assessment of the work involved, including the cost, as measured both in absolute (total cost) and relative terms. 81.However, cost is only one factor in the overall assessment. In K v CIR (1991) 13 N ZTC 8,216 (HC), Tompkins J said, at 8,220: Whether the work is of a minor nature is a matter of fact to be determined depending on all the circumstances of the particular case. Cost is one, but not the only factor. Cost of the work in absolute terms 82.The courts may take into account the total cost of the work done in absolute terms when assessing whether the development or division work is minor. The higher the cost, the more likely it is that the work is not minor. However, subject to the 16 IS 20/08 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] qualification set out at \[84\], cost is only one of four factors that is considered and weighed up in an overall assessment. 83.In Costello it did not assist the taxpayer that the professional fees for the whole subdivision were a modest $1,700 (equivalent to approximately $2,980.00 in 2020). The Court of Appeal considered other factors and concluded that the division work was not minor even taking into account the modest absolute cost. In contrast, in Case P61, the survey costs were $6,334 (equivalent to approximately $18,800 in 2020), and Judge Barber did not find that this expenditure affected his decision that the division work was minor. 84.Although the development or division work is to be measured in both absolute an d r elative terms, the Commissioner considers that there will be a point where the absolute value of the sum spent on the development or division work is so high this factor alone will indicate that the work is more than minor. 85.To assist taxpayers with the absolute cost inquiry, the Commissioner accepts that amounts of $50,000 or below will be considered low in absolute cost terms. This f igure is a ‘safe harbour’ figure. It is intended to give taxpayers greater certainty when making this cost assessment. It does not mean that amounts in excess of this figure will necessarily be considered more than minor, but it is a strong indicator that the scale of the work is likely to be more than minor. In some cases, the figure may be so high as to fail the test outright (as per \[84\]) and in other cases there may still be a need to weigh up all the factors. 86.Although the costs may be low in absolute terms, the amount spent may indicate that the development or division work is more than minor in relative terms. Cost of the work in relative terms 87.As noted in Lowe, the courts may take into account the cost of development or division work relative to the nature and value of the land on which the work is done when assessing whether the development or division work is minor. The higher the cost of the work done relative to the value of the land that is subject to the undertaking or scheme, the more likely it is that the work is not minor. 88.One issue is what parcel of land must be valued for the purpose of the relative cost assessment: the value of the land disposed of, or all the land that is subject to the undertaking or scheme? The Commissioner considers that based on the language of s CB 12, the land to be valued is all the land that is subject to the undertaking o r sch eme. (See “QB 15/04: Income tax — whether it is possible that the disposal of land that is part of an undertaking or scheme involving development or division will not give rise to income, even if no exclusion applies”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 27, No 4 (May 2015): 37.) 89.Another issue is how to determine the value of the land, against which the cost of the development or division work could be compared. Over the years, various values have been used in the High Court and Taxation Review Authority, including the “cost of the land” 9 , the “ultimate value achieved” 10 and the “sale price of the 9 Wellington v CIR (1981) 5 NZTC 61, 101 (HC). 10 Dobson v CIR (1987) 9 NZTC 6,025 (HC). 17 IS 20/08 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] land or some of it” 11 . However, the Commissioner considers that, based on the Court of Appeal decision in Lowe, the relative cost of the work should be compared with the total value of all the land subject to the undertaking or scheme at the commencement of the work. This is because the cost of the work is to be compared with “the value of the land on which the work is done” per Richardson J, at 61,028: Whether the work is of a minor nature must, it seems, depend on an overall assessment of such matters as the time, effort and expense involved, measured both in absolute terms and relative to the nature and value of the land on which the work is done. \[Emphasis added\] 90.This approach minimises distortion due to movement in land values from the passage of time and from alterations to the land. 91.The value of the land at the commencement of the work should include the value of any buildings on the land. This was the approach taken in Wellington where Ongley J held that work costing $9,080, in relation to the land and buildings tha t c ost $12,000, could hardly be said to be minor. 92.To assist taxpayers with this inquiry, the Commissioner accepts that relative cost s o f less than 5% will be considered low in relative cost terms. This figure is a ‘safe harbour’ figure and is intended to give taxpayers greater certainty when making this cost assessment. It does not mean that relative costs of 5% or greater will necessarily be considered more than minor, but it is an indicator that the scale of the work is likely more than minor, unless other factors can prove otherwise. 93.Although the costs may be low in relative terms, the amount spent may indicate that the development or division work is more than minor in absolute terms. For example, costs of $70,000 on a $2,000,000 subdivision would be low in relative terms at only 3.5% (according to the Commissioner’s safe harbour) but would not be low in absolute terms (again, according to the Commissioner’s safe harbour) . 94.W here the value of land is unknown, an independent valuation may be used to determine the market value of the land prior to the start of the subdivision or development work. It may also be appropriate to use a recent council rating valuation, if that valuation reflects the market value of the land. Example 2 of this Interpretation Statement concerns a situation where the value of the land i s unknown at the start of the work. Work done by the taxpayer 95.In evaluating the total cost of the work done, the courts will consider work done by the taxpayer themselves. If the cost of the development was low, but this was because the taxpayer performed some of the development or division work, then the courts will give limited weight to the cost factor when evaluating whether the development or division work is minor. 96.For example, in K v CIR, Tompkins J concluded that although the expenses of the development or division work were low because the work was performed by one of the taxpayers, this did not undermine the conclusion that the development or division work was more than minor, at 8,219 and 8,220: 11 Case E41 (1982) 5 NZTC 59,255 and Case P61 (1992) 14 NZTC 4,416. 18 IS 20/08 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] The only cost relating to the division into lots was a cross-lease plan that cost $154.50. It was in reliance on these figures that \[the taxpayer\] submitted that obtaining the cross-lease plan, and therefore the division work, was minor having regard to the costs of each of the projects. ... There would also have been considerable legal work in the deposit of each of the subdivisional plans and the issue of the separate titles that were going to be required in order to carry out the scheme involving, as it did, the sale of the home units. In this particular case no legal costs were incurred because Mr K, being a solicitor, was able to and did carry out the work without charging himself or his wife a fee. ... It is my conclusion, having regard to these factors, that in both cases the division work of the kind I have described was not, in the context of each scheme, work of a minor nature. 97.Similarly, in Case E41 (1982) 5 NZTC 59,255, Judge Barber considered the costs of certain development and division work, including fencing work carried out by the taxpayer, and found that it was not work of a minor nature despite the cost of the development being relatively low. 98.The Commissioner will take a similar approach when applying the absolute and relative cost safe harbours. Where a taxpayer has been able to keep development or division work costs low because they have performed the work themselves, the Commissioner will give limited weight to the cost factor when evaluating whether the development or division work is minor. 99.Example 3 of this Interpretation Statement concerns work done by the taxpayer and a low cost of work. GST-treatment 100.In some cases, a taxpayer may be registered for GST and the land in question forms part of their taxable activity. If a taxpayer is registered for GST, and if they are able to claim back the input tax under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 , t hen, the GST component of their costs may be excluded when determining the cost of the work done in absolute and relative terms. This reflects the fact that the taxpayer can claim an input tax deduction for this GST component, and therefore reduces their overall costs. Nature of professional services used 101.Development or division work typically requires the services of professionals such as a solicitor, a surveyor, an engineer or a valuer. The courts have considered the use of professionals in determining whether the development or division work was minor. 102.From the case law, the use of professionals is considered in light of: •the amount of time such professionals expended to undertake the development or division work; and •the complexity and significance of the work that the professionals undertook. 19 IS 20/08 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 103.Even straightforward development or division work will require the services of professionals. For example, even the simplest subdivision would require the services of a solicitor and a surveyor. Consequently, the use of professional services is just one of the four factors that is taken into account when making an overall judgment as to whether the development or division work is minor. Amount of time professional services were required 104.In Case E41, the taxpayer had undertaken much of the division work himself and the legal costs were not substantial. H owever, Judge Barber took into account the amount of time the surveyor took to undertake the subdivision and determined that the work of the surveyor, in combination with the work of a lawyer and the work done by the taxpayer, showed that the division work was more than minor. Judge Barber said, at 59,261: The evidence showed that the subdivisional work proceeded very smoothly, speedily and inexpensively as these matters go. Nevertheless a surveyor was engaged in field work for two weeks and office drafting work for at least one day. The legal and local authority aspects were minimal. I have already referred to Mr. ON’s evidence of clearing gorse from the boundaries and then burning off same and the new fencing work involved. His evidence as quoted by me above shows that he intended the fencing work as part of the subdivision. In any case I think that where there is a scheme to subdivide lots for sale but they cannot be sold unless certain fencing work is effected, then that fencing work must be regarded as part of the overall scheme of subdivision work. The evidence outlined above shows that the purchasers required the fencing work to be effected. I think that on the facts of this case, although the division work was not that extensive by comparison with subdivisional work in general, nevertheless the combination of survey, legal and fencing work was something more than “of a minor nature”. \[Emphasis added\] 105.The more time a professional, or professionals, spend on development or division work, the more likely the development or division work will not be minor. The amount of time a professional spends may also be an indicator of the complexity of the professional work. Complexity and significance of the professional work 106.The complexity and significance of the professional work done to effect the development or division is an important factor the courts consider when evaluating whether the development or division work is minor. If the work required from professionals is straightforward, the courts will be more likely to conclude the development or division work is minor. For example, if a taxpayer divides land into lots and this division is very simple because it used established procedures and was routine, then a court would be more likely to conclude that the division work is minor. 107.Conversely, if additional work, beyond straightforward surveying and conveyancing, is required for completion of the undertaking or scheme, then this will indicate tha t th e development or division work is not minor. The introduction of an additional professional activity (beyond minimal surveying and conveyancing) that is a significant part of the undertaking may be enough to make the work more tha n m inor. 108.In Costello v CIR (1993) 15 NZTC 10,285 (HC), the t axpayer engaged a surveyor to facilitate the subdivision of land. The plan produced showed more than 30 separate 20 IS 20/08 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] areas delineated with their respective entitlements. Work was also done by a valuer, so that an appropriate valuation could be made for each unit ( as required under the Unit Titles Act 1972), and a solicitor undertook additional work. Speight J , in the High Court, held that while the fees the professionals charged were modest, a complicated series of steps was undertaken in three separate professional disciplines (law, surveying and valuation). The scheme could not have been finalised and unit titles made available for issue unless each step undertaken by the professionals was accurately completed. This was a factor that led Speight J to the conclusion that the division work the taxpayer undertook was not minor. In the subsequent Court of Appeal case 12 , it was concluded that Speight J did not err in his overall approach to the question or in his conclusion. 109.K v CIR involved complex legal work in the subdivision of two properties and , d espite no fees being charged, the complexity of this legal work indicated that the division work was more than minor. Tompkins J said, at 8,221: There would also have been considerable legal work in the deposit of each of the subdivisional plans and the issue of the separate titles that were going to be required in order to carry out the scheme involving, as it did, the sale of the home units. In this particular case no legal costs were incurred because Mr K, being a solicitor, was able and did carry out the work without charging himself or his wife a fee. 110.Similarly, in Case N59, subdivision work was held not to be minor, in part due to the considerable legal work involved. Judge Barber held, at 3,464: There was no evidence as to cost of the development or subdivision work. It appears that the development work must have been contour work for access and foundations and landscaping work. Apart from landscaping, development work may have been completed prior to the formulation of the intention to also sell the second flat. However, in my view, the division work in such a project cannot normally be regarded as work of a minor nature. The minimum division work involved surveying, preparation of the flat plans, lodging and depositing same at a Land Transfer Office, drafting and execution of cross-leases, and obtaining of separate composite titles. I do not think that a conveyancing solicitor would regard such work as of a minor nature in relation to these two sale transactions even though it may be routine. \[Emphasis added\] 111.In other cases, the development or division work a professional undertook was st raightforward, and this was a factor in the court’s decision that the developmen t o r division work was minor. For example, in Case P61, two lots of land were amalgamated and then subdivided. The taxpayer’s subdivision expenditure comprised only a modest amount for survey and legal work. The subdivisio n i nvolved the creation of easements to give access and to convey power and water. Judge Barber decided that these easements were undertaken in the standard way and were quite straightforward from a legal point of view, needing little time to complete. Considering the complexity of the work, Judge Barber decided that the professional work needed was much less than was needed in another subdivisio n ca se (Wellington), so the development or division work was minor. 112.Another example is Case R7 which also concerned an amalgamation and subdivision. Judge Barber held that the development and division work was minor because it involved uncomplicated and quite minor survey work and legal work. 113.Example 1 of this Interpretation Statement features uncomplicated division work. 12 Costello v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,253 (CA). 21 IS 20/08 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Extent of physical work done 114.The more physical work undertaken as part of the development or division work, the more likely it is that a court will conclude that the work is not minor. However, a lack of physical work does not necessarily mean that the work will be minor. For example, in O’Toole no physical work was done, yet the division work was held to be more than minor. 115.Physical work involved in a development or division scheme could include: •fencing; •planting trees or hedges; •demolition and site clearance; •connection of water, sewerage, telecommunications and electricity; •creation of access, such as roading or driveways; and •earthworks to level land before building. 116.In Case E41, the court considered the extent of the physical work undertaken. The taxpayer owned a 279-acre property and created a subdivision of six lots out of a block of 177 acres. To undertake the subdivision, t he taxpayer built 120 chains of new fencing, doing much of the work himself, including removing gorse on the boundaries with a tractor. This w as the only physical work required. Judge Barbe r co ncluded that this physical work was a necessary part of the subdivision and that although the division work was not that extensive by comparison with subdivision work in general, the combination of survey, legal and fencing work meant the division work was more than minor. 117.Example 3 of this Interpretation Statement features extensive physical work. Significance of changes to the physical nature and character of the land 118.The significance of the changes to the physical nature and character of the land is a factor that has been considered by the courts in establishing whether the development or division work is minor. The more significant the changes to the physical nature and character of the land since the development or division work began, the less likely it is that the development or division work will be minor. 119.This factor was discussed in Dobson. In this case, a taxpayer had demolished the buildings on three properties and replaced them with new flats. The subdivision work involved demolition, clearing of sites, surveys, plan deposits, preparation of cross leases and obtaining composite titles. Hardie Boys J commented on the significance of the development in terms of how it had changed the land, at 6,030: This was development work, and it was not minor, whatever its cost may have been, for it altered the whole character of each property, allowing for its complete redevelopment, which would not otherwise have been possible. 120.Similarly, in Case E90, a subdivision made a significant change to the character of the land by dividing the land and buildings into five separate units and creating a section of land as common property. Judge Bathgate concluded, at 59,476: 22 IS 20/08 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] I consider that the nature and effect of the work in the way of development or division into lots must be a significant factor in ascertaining whether or not that work is of a minor nature in relation to that land. ... I do not consider that in this case the division of the land into lots is of a minor nature. I agree the surveyor’s costs and legal costs in this case for urban, industrial land division are of a minor nature. I do not know what the total costs of the division are, or whether or not there was any “development” necessary for that purpose. However even if a person were able to subdivide his land at no cost to himself, I do not believe that would automatically take the case out of \[what is now s CB 12\]. In my view the effect of the development and division undertaken on the land in question is an important factor in deciding whether or not it is work of a minor nature. The nature of the work may have far reaching consequences on the land without significant costs. Not a great deal of activity may be required. In this case one single piece of land in one title has been subdivided, there has been a division of the building into three major units, and two smaller units, with the definition of a further piece of land as common property ..I consider all this is not “work of a minor nature” for that particular piece of land. Nor has \[the taxpayer\] satisfied me on the balance of probabilities that the division work alone is of a minor nature. \[Emphasis added\] 121.Example 4 of this Interpretation Statement features a significant change to the physical nature and character of the land. Examples 122.The following five examples explain the application of s CB 12. They do not consider the potential application of other provisions, and the exclusions to s CB 12 l isted at \[19\] are assumed not to apply. 123.Appendix 2 of this Interpretation Statement provides a summary of cases that considered whether development or division work was minor. These may also be of assistance to taxpayers in explaining the application of s CB 12. 23 IS 20/08 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Example 1 – Straightforward subdivision of a farm Mohammed owns a 75-acre farm he purchased six years ago. In addition to the house he lives in, there is an old farmhouse situated at one end of the property. Mohammed decides to subdivide off the old farmhouse and 2 acres of surrounding land. He arranges for a valuer to value the 75-acre farm shortly before the subdivision begins. The valuer estimates the value of the farm to be $1,800,000. Mohammed spends $20,000 on professional services to create the subdivision. The survey work and legal work is straightforward as it is a simple division of one parcel of land into two. No physical work is required as existing fencing and hedges separate the old farmhouse and surrounding land from the rest of Mohammed’s property. No easements for access or services are required. Mohammed sells the farmhouse and the surrounding 2 acres for $795,000. Is the sale of the farmhouse and the 2 acres of surrounding land taxable under s CB 12 ? •There was an undertaking or scheme to divide the land into lots. •The cost was low in absolute terms ($20,000) and in relative terms (1 % of the pre-division value of the land, being $1,800,000). •The nature of the professional services used was straightforward. •No physical work was required. •The character or nature of the land did not change. •The undertaking or scheme was begun within 10 years of the date on which Mohammed acquired the land. On the facts, the division work was minor. Therefore, the sale of the farmhouse and the 2 acres of surrounding land is not taxable under s CB 12. Example 2 – Subdivision with use of professional services and additional physical work and with land value unknown Elisapeta purchased 10 acres of land seven years ago for $500,000. She began to build her dream home on the land, but building costs exceeded her expectations and she decided to subdivide the land to help finance the construction: o ne lot of 3 acres with her home on it and one lot of 7 acres to sell. Elisapeta used the professional services of a surveyor, a solicitor and a geotechnical engineer. She also organised a landscaper to fence between the two lots and had an earthworks company excavate a driveway to one of the lots. An arborist felled several trees and cleared the site, as this was necessary for the subdivision of the land. The total cost of the division work was $60 ,0 00. Elisapeta did not know how much the 10 -acre block was worth before she started the development. However, a council rating valuation from the year before for the undivided land was $1,000,000. Elisapeta sold the 7- acre block of land for $700,000, which allowed her to complete construction of her home. Is the sale of the 7- acre block taxable under s CB 12? 24 IS 20/08 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] •There was an undertaking or scheme to develop and/or divide the land into lots. •The cost was high in absolute terms ($60,000). The cost was also high in relative terms, being 6% of the pre-division value of the land. •The use of several different professional services was required. •Physical work was required, including site clearance, excavation of a driveway and installation of fencing. •The character and nature of the land has changed, with the site cleared and trees felled. •The undertaking or scheme was begun within 10 years of the date on which Elisapeta acquired the land. On the facts, Elisapeta’s subdivision involved development or division work that was more than minor. Accordingly, s CB 12 applies, and the sale price of $700,000 is taxable. Example 3 – Non-straightforward subdivision with work done on behalf of the owner at a discounted cost and with changes to the character and nature of the land Kimiora acquired a house on a 1- acre section on the outskirts of a city six months ago for $1,000,000. Most of the land is native bush on a slope, with the house at the front of the section. Kimiora had planned to rent the house to tenants, but after buying the land she decided to subdivide the land into four parcels and sell them. The professional work required was not straightforward because a shared driveway needed to be created from the street to the three new parcels of land. Buried under one parcel of land was a council-owned storm-water drainage pipe, so legal work was required to manage the easements for this and for the shared driveway. The professional services of a surveyor were also required. Despite the complexity, the cost of professional services was only $30,000. Kimiora owns a landscaping business, Bushbusters Ltd. Bushbusters cleared the bush on the property and undertook earthworks to clear the way for a driveway and to create three platforms on which houses could be built. The company didn’t charge Kimiora for this work. Kimiora’s brother Hemi owns an asphalt and paving company. The company created the shared driveway for a discount, costing Kimiora only $5,000. Kimiora sold the four newly created lots (including the lot with the house on it) as soon as the work was finished for a total of $1,600,000. Is this sale taxable under s CB 12? •There was an undertaking or scheme to develop and divide the land into lots. •The cost was low in absolute terms, with total costs of $35,000. The cost was also low in relative terms, at 3.5% of the pre-division value of the land ($1,000,000). However, the Commissioner will not give this factor much weight, given that Kimiora performed some of the work herself and obtained other services at a considerable discount (see from \[95 \]). •The professional work required to undertake the development was not str aightforward due to the complexities of creating a shared driveway and easements. •Extensive physical work was undertaken on the land, including earthworks. 25 IS 20/08 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] •The nature and character of the land changed significantly – from native bush on a slope to cleared, flattened land suitable for housing. •The undertaking or scheme was begun within 10 years of the date on which Kimiora acquired the land. On the facts, despite the low cost of the work, Kimiora’s development and subdivision involved development and division work that was more than minor. Accordingly, s CB 12 applies, and the sale price of $1,600,000 is taxable. Example 4 – Boundary adjustment While preparing to sell her quarter-acre residential property (which she had owned for 5 years), Michelle obtained a valuation and found it was worth $750,000. Michelle also discovered from the valuation report that she and her neighbour Daneka had been mistaken about where the boundary was between their properties. As a result, Michelle’s prized rose garden extends a little over the boundary into Daneka’s land. This garden adds value to Michelle’s property. After negotiating, Michelle and Daneka agree that they will adjust the boundary to add a small corner from the rear of Daneka’s property to Michelle’s, so Michelle can keep her rose garden. In consideration for this, Michelle pays Daneka $6,000. The only work involved is straightforward survey and legal work, which is completed without any difficulty at a cost of $15,000. Once the boundary adjustment is completed, Michelle sells the land for $761,000. Is this sale taxable under s CB 12? •There was an undertaking or scheme to divide the land into lots (being the boundary adjustment). •Although there was a cost in undertaking the division work of $15,000, it was low in absolute terms and in relative terms (2%). •The professional work required to undertake the division work was straightforward. •No physical work was required. •The nature and character of the land were unchanged. From the facts, the division work was minor. Accordingly, the sale price of $761,000 is not taxable under s CB 12. Example 5 – A subdivision with some physical work required Nick acquired a 50-hectare farm property at a cost of $1,400,000. The farm comprises t wo connected parcels of land. Within one month of Nick's acquisition of the property, the power was connected for farm development purposes at a cost of $15,000, paid to the power company. This resulted in the erection of a transformer structure on the land. Two months later he accepted an offer of $175,0 00 for a 0.5-hectare parcel of the land. As a condition of the subdivision consent, the Council required Nick to construct an entranceway to the subdivided lot. A power supply to the subdivided lot already existed. Constructing an entrance way to the lot cost $2,000 and was very straightforward. The creation of the entranceway is development work. The farm had two existing titles, so it was a relatively simple exercise to adjust the boundaries to provide a small residential block for sale. The boundary adjustment is division work. The costs involved in the subdivision were: 26 IS 20/08 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] $ Surveying (including): •Scheme plan preparation and submissions •Field Work and LT plan preparation$20,000 Entrance Way $2,000 Legal fees $7,000 TOTAL $29,000 Is this sale taxable under s CB 12? •There was an undertaking or scheme to develop and divide the land into lots. •Although there was a cost in undertaking the division work of $29,000, it was low in absolute terms ($29,000) and in relative terms (2.6%). •The professional services of a surveyor and a lawyer were required to subdivide the land. The legal work involved was minimal in both cost and complexity. The survey work was standard as it entailed only a simple boundary adjustment. •Physical work was required to be carried out on the land. This was the construction of the entranceway. This work was not extensive. •The erection of the transformer structure by the power company was an expensive procedure. It was work of a physical nature. However, it did not form part of the undertaking or scheme of subdivision. It was done for a different purpose, of farm development. On this basis the additional costs associated with the supply of electricity to the section would not form part of the subdivision. •The nature and character of the land were not changed. •The undertaking or scheme was begun within 10 years of the date on which Nick purchased the land. On the facts, the division work was minor. Accordingly, the sale price of $175,000 is not taxable under s CB 12. However, if Nick had incurred significant expenditure in dividing the farm into say three or more titles, as well as fencing the relevant sections off (including the removal of gorse bushes, creating new fences and replacing old ones), the Commissioner considers that this example would most likely be more than minor. In that case, the proceeds of the sale of the land would be taxable. 27 IS 20/08 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] References Subject references development of the land division of the land into lots dispose land not minor undertaking or scheme Legislative references Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Income Tax Act 1976, s 67(4) Income Tax Act 1994, s CD 1(2)(f), YB 4(3) Income Tax Act 2004, s CB 10, YA 3(3) and (4) Income Tax Act 2007, subpart CB (ss CB 6, CB 6A, CB 7–CB 14, CB 15, CB 17–CB 23, CB 23B), s CC 1, YA 1 (“dispose”, “land”), ZA 3 Land and Income Tax Act 1954, s 88AA Land and Income Tax Amendment Act 1973, s 9(1) Resource Management Act 1991, s (2)(c) Unit Titles Act 1972 Case references Anzamco Ltd (in liq) v CIR (1983) 6 NZTC 61,522 (HC) Aubrey v CIR (1984) 6 NZTC 61,765 (HC) Case D24 (1979) 4 NZTC 60,597 Case E41 (1982) 5 NZTC 59,255 Case E90 (1982) 5 NZTC 59,471 Case N59 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,457 Case P61 (1992) 14 NZTC 4,416 Case R7 (1994) 16 NZTC 6,035 Case S86 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,538 Costello v CIR (1993) 15 NZTC 10,285 (HC) Costello v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,253 (CA) Cross v CIR (1985) 7 NZTC 5,054 (HC) Cross v CIR (1987) 9 NZTC 6,101(CA) Duff v CIR (1982) 5 NZTC 61,131 (CA) Dobson v CIR (1987) 9 NZTC 6,025 (HC) K v CIR (1991) 13 NZTC 8,216 (HC) Lowe v CIR (1981) 5 NZTC 61,006 (CA) Mee v CIR (1988) 10 NZTC 5,073 (HC) O’ Toole v CIR (1985) 7 NZTC 5,045 (HC) Smith v CIR (No 2) (1989) 11 NZTC 6,018 (CA) Vuleta v CIR \[1962\] NZLR 325 (SC) Wellington v CIR (1981) 5 NZTC 61,101 (HC) Other references (2 November 1973) 387 New Zealand Parliamentary Debates 4,792 (Land and Income Tax Amendment Act 1973 – Third Reading, Frank O’ Flynn) “QB 15/02: Income tax – major development or division - what is ‘significant expenditure’ for section CB 13 purposes?”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 27, No 4 (May 2015): 20. “QB 15/04: Income tax — whether it is possible that the disposal of land that is part of an undertaking or scheme involving development or division will not give rise to income, even if no exclusion applies”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 27, No 4 (May 2015): 37. “QB 17/02: Income tax – date of acquisition of land, and start date for 2-year bright-line test”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 29 , No 4 (May 2017): 125. “Work of a minor nature”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 17, No 1 (February 2005): 5. 28 IS 20/08 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Appendix 1 : Legislation 1.Section CB 12 provides: CB 12 Disposal: schemes for development or division begun within 10 years Income (1)An amount that a person derives from disposing of land is income of the person if the amount is derived in the following circumstances: (a )an undertaking or scheme, which is not necessarily in the nature of a business, is carried on; and (b)the undertaking or scheme involves the development of the land or the division of the land into lots; and (c)the person, or another person for them, carries on development or division work on or relating to the land; and (d )the development or division work is not minor; and (e)the undertaking or scheme was begun within 10 years of the date on which the person acquired the land.

UNCLASSIFIED \[UNCLASSIFIED\] INTERPRETATION STATEMENT GST – Registration of non-residents under section 54B Issued: 28 May 2021 IS 21/03 Section 54B of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 allows non-resident businesses that do not make supplies to end consumers in New Zealand to register for GST and recover GST input tax on goods and services acquired in New Zealand. Since s 54B was introduced, there have been legislative changes that treat certain supplies by non-residents as being made in New Zealand. These changes include the supply of remote services and low value goods. This means a greater number of non-residents must register under the standard registration provision and fewer non-residents are eligible to register under s 54B. This item provides guidance on whether a non-resident is eligible to register under s 54B. All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated.

UNCLASSIFIED Page 2 | 38 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Introduction 1. Section 54B has been described as an “enhanced” registration system for non- residents. It allows non-resident businesses to recover GST input tax on goods and services acquired in New Zealand for the purpose of making supplies outside New Zealand. GST operates on what is known as the “destination principle” where goods and services are taxed in the country in which those services are consumed by end-users. GST should not generally be an economic burden on businesses that form part of a supply chain. 2. In 2011, a government discussion document about GST on cross-border supplies between businesses, 1 recognised that the existing legislation worked well for domestic supplies between GST-registered persons, and where goods and services were exported and zero-rated, but that it did not work as effectively for non-resident businesses receiving services in New Zealand. This was because, although non- resident businesses were able to register for GST under s 51, their ability to claim input tax credits for GST incurred was limited. This limitation was because the legislation allows a deduction for input tax for goods or services to the extent that those goods or services are used for or available for use in making taxable supplies. Taxable supplies are supplies made in New Zealand. Therefore, non-resident businesses that made no supplies in New Zealand or that predominantly made supplies outside New Zealand were unable to get a full deduction for the GST that they had incurred in New Zealand. This resulted in such businesses bearing the New Zealand GST as an economic cost despite the services being acquired for making supplies to final consumers outside New Zealand. 3. Since s 54B was introduced in 2013, there have been several remedial amendments to it and related provisions. In addition, legislation was introduced affecting non-resident suppliers of cross-border remote services and low value goods imported into New Zealand. This means more non-residents are treated as making supplies in New Zealand and have an obligation to register under the standard registration provisions. Commentators say that eligibility for registration under s 54B has not always been well understood. 4. The requirements for a person to be eligible to register under s 54B are cumulative. This statement steps though each requirement and provides examples as to how it applies. 1 GST: Business-to-Business Neutrality across Borders (government discussion document, Policy Advice Division, August 2011).

The requirements for registration of certain non-resident suppliers are set out in s 54B(1): 54B Requirements for registration for certain non-resident suppliers Requirements for registration (1) Despite section 51(3), the Commissioner may register a person who is a non-resident and has not become liable to be registered under section 51(1) if the Commissioner is satisfied that the person meets the following requirements: (a) the person— (i) is registered for a consumption tax in the country or territory in which they are resident; or (ii) if the country or territory in which the person is resident does not have a consumption tax, or has a consumption tax that does not apply to the person’s activities, is carrying on a taxable activity, and has a level of taxable activity in a country or territory that would render them liable to be registered under section 51(1) if they were carrying out the taxable activity in New Zealand; and (b) for the first taxable period after the date of registration in New Zealand, the amount of the person’s input tax is likely to be more than $500 or the person is likely to be liable for tax levied under section 12(1) in relation to the importation of goods that are received by another person or that the person delivers to another person; and (c) the person’s taxable activity does not involve a performance of services in relation to which it is reasonably foreseeable that the performance of the services will be received in New Zealand by a person other than in the course of making taxable or exempt supplies; and (d) the person is not making, or intending to make,— (i) a taxable supply in New Zealand; or (ii) a supply in New Zealand that would be a taxable supply if the person were registered under section 51, to a person in New Zealand who is not a registered person; and (e) the person is not, and does not intend to become, a member of a group of companies that makes taxable supplies in New Zealand. 6. The seven requirements for registration of certain non-resident suppliers are that:  the person must be a non-resident for GST purposes (discussed from \[8\]);  the person is not liable to be registered under s 51 (discussed from \[34\]); IS 21/03 | 28 May 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 4 | 38 \[UNCLASSIFIED\]  the person is registered for a consumption tax in the country or territory in which they are resident or the level of their taxable activity would require them to register in New Zealand if they were carrying on that activity in New Zealand (discussed from \[63\]);  the amount of the person’s input tax exceeds $500 or the person is likely to be liable for tax levied under s 12(1) in relation to imported goods received by another person or that are to be delivered to another person (discussed from \[65\]);  the person’s taxable activity does not involve the performance of services where those services will be received by an end-user in New Zealand (discussed from \[76\]); and  the person is not making or intending to make taxable supplies in New Zealand (discussed from \[84\]); or the person is not making supplies to an unregistered person that would be taxable supplies if the supplier was registered (discussed from \[87\]), and  the person is not a member, or intending to become a member, of a group of companies that makes supplies in New Zealand (discussed from \[90\]). 7. These seven requirements are summarised in Flowchart 1 - Overview of registration requirements of s 54B with reference to the relevant discussion and examples. As the third, fourth and sixth requirements contain alternative requirements this translates to nine questions that may be required to be satisfied to meet registration under s 54B.

The first requirement for registration of certain non-resident suppliers is that the person must be non-resident. Most people are familiar with the income tax test for residency and know whether they are non-resident for income tax purposes. However, the GST definition of resident is wider, so some non-residents may be treated as a resident for GST purposes and may be unaware of the difference in the two definitions. 9. The law relating to determining whether a person is non-resident for GST purposes is set out in “IS 18/07 : Goods and services tax – zero-rating of services related to land”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31, No 1 (February 2019): 17. The Commissioner’s view on when a person is resident for GST purposes is consolidated in interpretation statement “ IS 21/07: GST – Definition of a resident”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33, No 9 (October 2021). The following analysis reproduces parts of and is consistent with that analysis. 10. A non-resident is defined in s 2 to mean a person “to the extent that the person is not resident in New Zealand”. The definition of “resident” in s 2 modifies the income tax definition of resident by providing for three exceptions in paras (a) to (c). Paragraphs (b) and (c) relate to unincorporated bodies and the effect of the day count tests in the income tax residency tests. 11. The exception in para (a) deems a person to be resident to the extent that the person carries on their taxable or other activity in New Zealand from a fixed or permanent place in New Zealand that is related to that activity. Non-residents may have a presence or connection to a place in New Zealand related to their taxable or other activities and may be unsure whether that is sufficient to for them to be treated as resident for GST purposes. 12. Therefore, the key considerations are what is meant by:  a “taxable activity or other activity”;  a “fixed or permanent place”;  “relating to that activity or other activity”; and  “to the extent that”, and whether it means a person can be both resident and non-resident for GST purposes. IS 21/03 | 28 May 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 7 | 38 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Taxable activity or other activity Taxable activity 13. For the purposes of the resident definition, it is the taxable activity that needs to “relate to” the fixed or permanent place. The term “taxable activity” is also relevant to the second and third requirements for registration under s 54B set out in \[6\]. 14. A broad definition for this term is given in s 6(1)(a) with certain activities being specifically excluded in s 6(3). The key requirements of a taxable activity are:  there must be an activity;  that is carried on continuously or regularly by a person; and  that involves the making of taxable supplies. 15. Notably, however, s 6(3) excludes certain activities from being taxable activities. Examples of excluded activities are:  the making of exempt supplies (such as the supply of financial services and the supply of accommodation in a dwelling); and  private recreational pursuits or hobbies. 16. Determining whether a taxable activity is being carried on is always a question of fact. It involves examining all the circumstances of the particular case. The concept of a taxable activity is not considered further in this statement as it is covered in other publications, see “IS 20/04 : Goods and services tax – GST treatment of short-stay accommodation”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32, No 6 (July 2020): 69. Other activity 17. Paragraph (a) in the definition of “resident” also includes “other” activities in its scope. The terms “activity” and “other activity” are not defined in the Act. 18. The word “activity” has a broad meaning. It may refer to “a course of conduct or series of acts which a person has chosen to undertake or become engaged in”: Newman v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,229 (HC). Similarly, the Court of Appeal in CIR v Bayly (1998) 18 NZTC 14,073 said, at 14,078: In its standard dictionary usage, “activity” is “the state of being active; the exertion of energy, action” (Oxford English Dictionary). In the context of ss 6 and 8 \[of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985\] it points to the combination of tasks undertaken, or course of conduct pursued by the registered person and whether or not it amounted to a business, trade or profession in the ordinary sense. IS 21/03 | 28 May 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 8 | 38 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 19. Both Newman and Bayly discuss the meaning of an “activity” in their discussion of a “taxable activity”. The Commissioner’s view is that “activity” in “other activity” bears the same meaning. 20. The reference to “other activities” expands the range of activities so that not only “taxable activities” can result in residency under the Act. 21. However, the Commissioner’s view is that “other activity” is not limited to activities that involve the making of exempt supplies. The word “other” implies that Parliament intended a wide variety of activities to be covered by para (a). Fixed or permanent place 22. For para (a) to apply, a person must also have a “fixed or permanent place” in New Zealand relating to the taxable activity. The term “fixed and permanent place” is not defined in the Act. 23. In the context of para (a), it is the place that must be “fixed” or “permanent”. The word “place” indicates a physical location or a link to a particular geographical point. 24. The ordinary meanings of the words “fixed” and “permanent” indicate that the physical location must be lasting and unchanging and not temporary. An element of permanence is necessary, so a transient connection to a place will not meet the test. However, ownership of the physical location is not necessary. Having a fixed or permanent place merely requires the person to have that place permanently at their disposal or be able to use that place on a permanent basis. 25. The Commissioner notes that a similar concept of “fixed establishment” is used in the Income Tax Act 2007, and the phrase “permanent establishment” is used in New Zealand’s double tax treaties. Case law discusses the meanings of these phrases, and the concepts likely overlap with the concept of a “fixed or permanent place”. 26. However, the Commissioner’s view is that the “fixed establishment” and “permanent establishment” concepts are not equivalent to “fixed or permanent place” under the Goods and Services Tax Act. The ordinary meaning of the word “establishment” is arguably a stronger term than “place”, so “place” may be wider in its scope. Also, tax treaties often define a “permanent establishment” to include or exclude specific types of establishments. In contrast, the definition in the Goods and Services Tax Act is general in its terms. “Relating” to that taxable activity or other activity 27. Paragraph (a) also requires the person to have a fixed or permanent place “relating” to the taxable activity or other activity. IS 21/03 | 28 May 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 9 | 38 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 28. The ordinary meaning of “relating” is a connection between things: Concise Oxford English Dictionary (12 th ed, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2011). This suggests a degree of connection is required between the fixed or permanent place and the relevant activity. 29. The context of the provision does not appear to require a departure from the ordinary meaning of “relating to”. The provision is part of the definition of “resident” in the Act, which affects both the imposition of GST on supplies under s 8 and whether supplies can be zero-rated under the zero-rating provisions. In general, these provisions are intended to give effect to the destination principle, under which supplies of goods and services are taxed in the jurisdiction where the goods and services are consumed. Requiring a connection between a person’s activity in New Zealand and a fixed or permanent place in New Zealand before the person is considered resident for GST purposes (and subject to GST at the standard rate) appears to be consistent with that purpose. “To the extent that” 30. For GST purposes, a person is deemed to be resident in New Zealand “to the extent that” the person carries on, in New Zealand any taxable activity or any other activity while having any fixed or permanent place in New Zealand relating to that taxable activity or other activity. 31. Similarly, the definition of “non-resident” in s 2 states that non-resident “means a person to the extent that the person is not resident in New Zealand” \[emphasis added\]. 32. The use of the phrase “to the extent that” implies that a single legal person can, for the purposes of the Act, be both resident and non-resident. 33. Further discussion on when a person is resident for GST purposes (including examples) can be found in “IS 21/07 : GST – Definition of a resident”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33, No 9 (October 2021). Second requirement – person is not liable to be registered under s 51 34. The second requirement for registration of certain non-resident suppliers is whether the person has become liable to be registered under s 51(1) for GST purposes. The opening words to s 54B(1) are: IS 21/03 | 28 May 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 10 | 38 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Despite section 51(3), the Commissioner may register a person who is a non-resident and has not become liable to be registered under section 51(1) if the Commissioner is satisfied that the person meets the following requirements: \[Emphasis added\] 35. Registration under s 54B is not available for non-residents who are liable to be registered under s 51. Special rules apply to a non-resident who is carrying on a taxable activity in branches or divisions. This is discussed at \[62\]. 36. Key considerations as to whether a non-resident is liable to register under s 51 are the value of the supplies made and where the supplies are treated as being made. Where supplies are treated as being made depends on the type of supply and who is being supplied. The place of supply rules are covered in greater detail in \[40\] to \[57\] and Flowchart 2 and Flowchart 3. 37. Recent legislative changes have made certain non-resident suppliers liable to be registered under s 51 for goods and services supplied to New Zealand residents. This is because certain supplies are treated as being made in New Zealand:  Suppliers of “low-value imported goods” that are treated as supplied in New Zealand may be liable to be registered. These changes relate to “distantly taxable goods” that a non-resident supplies to a person who resides in New Zealand. For further information, see “Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019- 2020, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Act, 2019”, Tax Information Bulletin, Vol 31, No 8 (September 2019): 2.  Secondly, suppliers of cross-border “remote services” (such as e-books, music and video streaming, online games and other software services) may be liable to be registered. These services do not necessarily have a connection either to a place of supply or to the recipient of the supply. For further information, see “Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Act 2016”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 28, No 6 (July 2016): 12.  However, if the non-resident supplier only makes these supplies to registered persons for use in their taxable activity, the supplies will be treated as supplied outside New Zealand. In that case, the non-resident supplier would not be liable to register under s 51 and the non-resident may be able to register under s 54B.  Where a person is not liable to be registered under s 51 they may be able to register voluntarily under s 51(3), see \[60\] to \[61\]. General registration provision – s 51 38. A person becomes liable to be registered where that person carries on a taxable activity and, in the course of carrying on all taxable activities, makes supplies in New Zealand where the total annual value of those supplies exceeds $60,000: s 51(1). Section 51(1) states: IS 21/03 | 28 May 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 11 | 38 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 51 Persons making supplies in course of taxable activity to be registered (1) Subject to this Act, every person who, on or after 1 October 1986, carries on any taxable activity and is not registered, becomes liable to be registered— (a) at the end of any month where the total value of supplies made in New Zealand in that month and the 11 months immediately preceding that month in the course of carrying on all taxable activities has exceeded $60,000 (or such larger amount as the Governor-General may, from time to time, by Order in Council declare): provided that a person does not become liable to be registered by virtue of this paragraph where the Commissioner is satisfied that the value of those supplies in the period of 12 months beginning on the day after the last day of the period referred to in the said paragraph will not exceed that amount: (b) at the commencement of any month where there are reasonable grounds for believing that the total value of the supplies to be made in New Zealand in that month and the 11 months immediately following that month will exceed the amount specified in paragraph (a): provided that any such person shall not become liable where the Commissioner is satisfied that that value will exceed that amount in that period solely as a consequence of— (c) any ending of, including a premature ending of, or any substantial and permanent reduction in the size or scale of, any taxable activity carried on by that person; or (d) the replacement of any plant or other capital asset used in any taxable activity carried on by that person; or (e) the supply, to persons who are non-residents but are physically present in New Zealand, of telecommunications services that are treated as being supplied in New Zealand under sections 8(6) and 8A. Taxable activity 39. The first requirement of s 51(1) is that the person is carrying on a taxable activity. This was discussed from \[13\] to \[16\] regarding whether a person is a non-resident. Place of supply 40. To be liable to register under s 51(1), the person must be making supplies “in New Zealand” in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. To determine the place of supply for goods, follow Flowchart 2 (after \[53\]) and for services, follow Flowchart 3 (after \[60\]). IS 21/03 | 28 May 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 12 | 38 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 41. Section 8(2) provides a general rule for where supplies are made. Under the general rule, supplies made by a New Zealand resident are deemed to be supplied in New Zealand and supplies by a non-resident are deemed to be supplied outside New Zealand. Section 8(2) states: 8 Imposition of goods and services tax on supply ... (2) For the purposes of this Act, goods and services shall be deemed to be supplied in New Zealand if the supplier is resident in New Zealand, and shall be deemed to be supplied outside New Zealand if the supplier is a non-resident. 42. The general rule is displaced by s 8(3) for certain supplies by non-residents: (3) Despite subsection (2), goods and services are treated as being supplied in New Zealand if the supplier is a non-resident and— (a) the goods are in New Zealand at the time of the supply and are not distantly taxable goods to which paragraph (ab) applies; or (ab) the goods are distantly taxable goods to which subsection (4E) does not apply; or (b) the services are physically performed in New Zealand by a person who is in New Zealand at the time the services are performed; or (c) the services are remote services supplied to a person resident in New Zealand, other than services that are physically performed in New Zealand by a person who is in New Zealand at the time the services are performed. 43. The four circumstances in which the goods or services are treated as supplied in New Zealand are when the:  goods are in New Zealand at the time of supply (s 8(3)(a));  goods are “distantly taxable goods”, unless the supply is to a registered person for the purposes of carrying on that person’s taxable activity (s 8(3)(ab));  services are physically performed in New Zealand by a person in New Zealand at the time the services are performed (s 8(3)(b)); and  services are “remote services” supplied to a person resident in New Zealand (other than services physically performed in New Zealand) (s 8(3)(c)). 44. To understand these rules, it is helpful to consider:  where the goods are at the time of supply; or  where the services are performed; and IS 21/03 | 28 May 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 13 | 38 \[UNCLASSIFIED\]  whether the recipient of the supply is receiving the goods or services for the purpose of carrying on their taxable activity. Goods in New Zealand at time of supply 45. Where goods are in New Zealand at the time of supply they are treated as supplied in New Zealand, even though they are supplied by a non-resident or the contract is made outside New Zealand. However, this rule can be overridden if the recipient is a registered person who is acquiring the goods for the purposes of that person’s taxable activity. This is provided for in s 8(4), which treats the supply as being made outside New Zealand unless the supplier and recipient agree to treat the supply as made in New Zealand: (4) Despite subsection (3), if a supplier who is a non-resident supplies goods and services, to which subsection (3)(a) or (b) would apply but for this subsection, to a registered person for the purposes of carrying on the registered person’s taxable activity, the goods and services are treated as being supplied outside New Zealand unless the supplier and the recipient of the supply agree that this subsection will not apply to the supply. 46. Example 1: Supply in New Zealand demonstrates that a non-resident may not be able to register under s 54B, and may in fact be required to register under s 51, where they are making supplies of goods that are in New Zealand at the time of supply. Example 1: Supply in New Zealand Non-resident company Merino has an agreement to supply merino cot blankets to another non-resident company Natural Baby Supplies, who is not registered for GST in New Zealand. Merino arranges to have the cot blankets made in New Zealand by High Country Wool Co. Natural Baby Supplies intends to supply these to a retailer in New Zealand (NZ Wool Babies). Under the agreement between Merino and Natural Baby Supplies, the blankets will be delivered to NZ Wool Babies store. Although the supply by Merino to Natural Baby Supplies is made between two non- resident companies, the goods are in New Zealand at the time of supply. This means that Merino could be liable to register under s 51, if the annual value of the supplies exceeds $60,000, or if less than $60,000 it could voluntarily register. Merino could not register under s 54B to claim back GST charged to it by (High Country Wool) because it is making supplies in New Zealand to an unregistered person. IS 21/03 | 28 May 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 14 | 38 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Services performed in New Zealand 47. If the services a non-resident supplies are performed in New Zealand, they will be treated as supplied in New Zealand by s 8(3)(b). However, provided the recipient is a registered person who is acquiring the services for the purposes of their taxable activity, the services will be treated as supplied outside New Zealand under s 8(4). Again, unless the supplier and recipient agree that s 8(4) does not apply and have the services treated as supplied in New Zealand. 48. The reason for allowing supplies of goods or services to a registered person (for the purposes of their taxable activity) to be treated as supplied outside New Zealand is because the transaction is GST neutral – the non-resident supplier would charge GST output tax and the resident recipient would deduct the GST as input tax, if the goods or services were acquired for the purposes of making taxable supplies. 49. Some non-residents wanting to register under s 54B are not aware that they will be treated as making supplies in New Zealand. This can arise where a subcontractor performs the services in New Zealand. Understanding the contractual arrangements entered into and identifying exactly what is being supplied, who is making the supply and who is receiving the supply is required to determine where a supply is treated as being made. 50. The following examples consider whether services are performed in New Zealand and are therefore treated as supplied in New Zealand. In Example 2: Services performed by a sub-contractor, the non-resident is treated as making supplies in New Zealand, as the services are performed in New Zealand by a subcontractor. In Example 3: Professional services advice to a non-resident, the non-resident is not treated as making supplies in New Zealand because the services performed in New Zealand are a separate supply to the services provided by the non-resident. Example 2: Services performed by a sub-contractor A non-resident electrical contractor (Sparky Inc) has an agreement with a non-resident retail clothing company to fit out all its retail outlets. A new retail outlet is to be opened in New Zealand. Sparky arranges for the New Zealand fit out to be carried out by a New Zealand firm, Zappadee Ltd. The contract with Zappadee Limited is for goods and services amounting to $65,000. Because the services are performed in New Zealand, Zappadee Ltd charges Sparky GST at the standard rate. Sparky wants to know if it can register under s 54B to claim back the GST charged. Sparky cannot register under s 54B because Sparky is providing services to the non- resident clothing retailer which are performed in New Zealand through Zappadee Ltd and received in New Zealand. As the value of the supplies exceeds $60,000 Sparky is liable to register under s 51. IS 21/03 | 28 May 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 15 | 38 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Example 3: Professional services advice to a non-resident A professional services firm in Hong Kong is asked to provide advice to a non-resident group of companies looking to make a global acquisition. The firm is asked to provide a report on the merits of the global transaction. The Hong Kong firm seeks advice from a New Zealand professional services firm in relation to a property situated in New Zealand. The New Zealand firm carries out due diligence in relation to the land and, as requested, prepares transfer documents to a nominee company to enable the land to be transferred if the transaction proceeds. Because the transfer documents would result in a change to the land the law firm has charged GST at the standard rate. This is a very minor component of a large-scale transaction. In this case the supply by the Hong Kong firm of its global impact assessment on a multinational contract is a separate supply to its client. The services performed in New Zealand are a separate supply to the Hong Kong firm. The Hong Kong professional services firm could register under s 54B. “Distantly taxable goods” or low value imported goods 51. “Distantly taxable goods”, defined in s 4B, are often referred to as “low value imported goods”. These are generally defined as goods that:  individually have a value of NZ$1,000 or less;  are outside New Zealand at the time of supply;  are supplied by a non-resident; and  are delivered to New Zealand. 52. These distantly taxable goods are treated as supplied in New Zealand, unless the goods are supplied to a registered person for the purposes of carrying on the registered person’s taxable activity: s 8(4E). This is consistent with the principle that GST should not be a cost to businesses in the supply chain and should be borne by the final consumer. However, the non-resident supplier can choose that s 8(4E) not apply, which means the goods would be treated as supplied in New Zealand. The circumstances when they may make this choice are set out in s 8(4F). This choice requires:  value of the supply to be no more than $1,000; and  non-resident supplier to reasonably expect that more than 50% of the value of supplies made to persons in New Zealand in the following 12 months will be made to non-registered persons. IS 21/03 | 28 May 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 16 | 38 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 53. Therefore, where a non-resident supplier of distantly taxable goods supplies goods that exceed the annual threshold of $60,000, that person is liable to register under s 51. Such non-resident suppliers will not be eligible to register under s 54B. 54. Flowchart 2: Non-resident GST registration under s 54B – Place of supply – goods illustrates how to determine the place of supply for goods supplied by a non-resident.

A “remote service” is defined as a service where, at the time of the performance of the service, no necessary connection exists between the recipient’s physical location and the place of physical performance. These services include the supply of e-books, software, and digital services. 56. A non-resident supplier of remote services to a New Zealand resident will also be treated as making supplies in New Zealand under s 8(3)(c), so potentially liable to register under s 51. However, if the supply of remote services is to a registered person for the purposes of that registered person’s taxable activity, the supply is treated as made outside New Zealand. The supplier may choose to treat the supply as made in New Zealand (s 8(4D)) and register under s 51. If the non-resident supplier does so, the supply is zero-rated under s 11A(1)(x), and the person may be able to claim back the amount of GST incurred in making the supplies in New Zealand. Section 11A(1)(x) states: 11A Zero-rating of services (1) A supply of services that is chargeable with tax under section 8 must be charged at the rate of 0% in the following situations: ... (x) the services are remote services to which section 8(3)(c) applies that are provided to a registered person and the supplier has chosen under section 8(4D) to treat the supply as made in New Zealand. 57. Several rules determine when supplies are received in New Zealand and when non- resident suppliers are required to register under s 51. For more information, see “Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Act 2016”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 28 No 6 (July 2016): 12. 58. If a person is liable to be registered under s 51, they cannot register under s 54B. 59. Flowchart 3: Non-resident GST registration under s 54B – Place of supply – services illustrates how to determine the place of supply of services supplied by a non-resident. IS 21/03 | 28 May 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 18 | 38 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Flowchart 3: Non-resident GST registration under s 54B – Place of supply – services Voluntary registration 60. A person who is not liable to register under s 51(1) but who carries on a taxable activity may register voluntarily under s 51(3). For example, a non-resident making supplies in New Zealand, where the value of the supplies is below the threshold to require registration, could voluntarily register. This would enable the non-resident to claim GST input tax on goods and services used to make those supplies in New Zealand. Are the services physically performed in New Zealand by a person who is in New Zealand at the time of performance? Supply in New Zealand – s 8(3)(b), 8(3)(c) and 8(4B) Are services supplied to a registered person for use in their taxable activity? Are they remote services supplied to an New Zealand resident?

However, for a non-resident who is not making supplies in New Zealand (and this includes a non-resident who only supplies registered persons in New Zealand), then, unless they are registered under s 54B, they are not entitled to recover input tax incurred in New Zealand. The reason for this is that, for a person registered under s 51, input tax deductions are available only to the extent to which the goods and services are used for or are available for use in making taxable supplies in New Zealand. Branches or divisions 62. A non-resident person, who has a branch or division making supplies in New Zealand, may register that branch or division under s 51. For the purposes of s 54B, the branch or division is treated as a separate person (s 54B(5)). This means that the non-resident may still apply to be registered under s 54B provided they meet the requirements of s 54B(1). Third requirement – person is registered for a consumption tax – s 54B(1)(a) 63. The third requirement for registration of certain non-resident suppliers under s 54B is that the non-resident must be registered for a consumption tax in their home country or be carrying on a taxable activity and making a sufficient level of supplies that would render them liable to be registered under the New Zealand Act. Section 54B(1)(a) provides: (i) the person—is registered for a consumption tax in the country or territory in which they are resident; or (ii) if the country or territory in which the person is resident does not have a consumption tax, or has a consumption tax that does not apply to the person’s activities, is carrying on a taxable activity, and has a level of taxable activity in a country or territory that would render them liable to be registered under section 51(1) if they were carrying out the taxable activity in New Zealand; 64. The requirement in s 54B(1)(a) is to ensure the non-resident is a genuine business with a level of activity equivalent to the level at which a New Zealand business would be required to be registered for GST. IS 21/03 | 28 May 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 20 | 38 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Fourth requirement – input tax exceeds $500 or tax levied under s 12(1) – s 54B(1)(b) 65. The fourth requirement for registration of certain non-resident suppliers under s 54B is that, for the first taxable period after the date of registration in New Zealand:  the amount of the person’s input tax is likely to be more than $500; or  the person is likely to be liable for tax levied under s 12(1) in relation to the importation of goods that are received by another person or that the person delivers to another person. 66. While the provision seems straightforward, some non-residents seeking registration under s 54B have not been able to meet this requirement because they have not been the recipient of the supply or treated as the person who has paid the GST. Section 54B(1)(b) states: (b) for the first taxable period after the date of registration in New Zealand, the amount of the person’s input tax is likely to be more than $500 or the person is likely to be liable for tax levied under section 12(1) in relation to the importation of goods that are received by another person or that the person delivers to another person; 67. To meet the first part of the requirement in s 54B(1)(b), the non-resident must have incurred “input tax”. Input tax 68. “Input tax” is defined in s 3A: 3A Input tax defined (1) Input tax, in relation to a registered person, means – (a) tax charged under section 8(1) on a supply of goods or services acquired by the person: (b) tax levied under s 12(1) on goods entered for home consumption under the Customs and Excise Act 2018 by the person: (c) an amount determined under subsection (3) after applying subsection (2). 69. For a person to have “input tax”, the supply of goods or services must be “acquired” by the person. IS 21/03 | 28 May 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 21 | 38 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 70. For GST purposes, the focus is on the contractual arrangement between the supplier and the recipient of the supply (Wilson & Horton Ltd v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,325 (CA)). 71. In determining whether the non-resident has the required level of input tax for s 54B(1)(b), it is necessary to look at the contractual arrangements entered into to determine who has incurred the input tax. In Example 4: Business incurs expenditure on staff training and Example 5: Business incurs expenditure on management conference, the contractual recipient of the supply is the non-resident company. Example 4: Business incurs expenditure on staff training Watchtower Limited sends three trainee air traffic controllers to train on simulators in New Zealand. Watchtower doesn’t operate in New Zealand. It pays the trainees’ course fees and accommodation and incurs GST. Watchtower also reimburses the trainees for incidentals such as meals and local travel costs. At the end of the training the trainees leave New Zealand. Provided the amount of input tax exceeds $500 and Watchtower meets all the other requirements of s 54B, it could register and claim back the input tax paid on its New Zealand business expenses. Example 5: Business incurs expenditure on management conference PRW is a US company that doesn’t trade in New Zealand. PRW organises a conference in New Zealand for its management team. PRW makes all the bookings and pays all New Zealand costs associated with the conference (for example, venue hire, accommodation and meals) and incurs the GST. Provided the amount of input tax exceeds $500 and PRW meets all the other requirements of s 54B, it can claim the GST paid on its New Zealand business expenses. 72. The non-resident companies incurred input tax on the supplies they received in New Zealand. The non-resident companies are placed in the same position as a New Zealand GST-registered business that would be able to claim input tax deductions on the services it acquired for the purpose of making taxable supplies 2 . However, sometimes the correct contractual position is that the non-resident company seeking to register has not incurred any input tax as shown in Example 6: Contractual recipient of the supply. 2 See: Chapter 6 – GST policy issues, (Officials’ issues paper, Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue, February 2020) on the potential zero-rating of conference fees and training fees charged to non- resident businesses. IS 21/03 | 28 May 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 22 | 38 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Example 6: Contractual recipient of the supply A non-resident company (Chefco) is registered for consumption tax in its home territory as a supplier of chef training services. It enters into an arrangement with a New Zealand cooking school, Gourmet Chefs Ltd, for it to provide an introductory 6-week training course on basic chef skills. Once the students have the basic skills, Chefco can then refer the best students through to more advanced training in the home territory. Under the arrangement, Chefco refers prospective students to enrol with Gourmet. Gourmet will provide a certificate of achievement to those who successfully meet the requirements. Gourmet agrees to send the invoices directly to Chefco so that the course will be pre-paid before the students arrive. Chefco wants to know if it can register under s 54B to claim back the GST incurred on the invoices from Gourmet. Chefco has not incurred the GST as the contract for supply is a supply of training services provided by Gourmet to the students. As Chefco has not incurred the GST it cannot meet the requirements of s 54B(1)(b). Tax levied under s 12(1) 73. The alternative requirement for s 54B(1)(b) is that the person has had tax levied under s 12(1) on imported goods that were received by or delivered to another person in New Zealand. There is no threshold requirement for the amount of tax levied under s 12(1). The reason for this alternative requirement is that under s 20(3LC), in situations where the imported goods are received by or delivered to another person in New Zealand, the recipient of the goods is treated as having paid the tax levied. Without this alternative requirement, a non-resident importer of goods would not have incurred the input tax to meet the $500 threshold. 74. Section 20(3LC) was introduced so non-residents could not recover GST input tax on high value goods imported by the non-resident that they then delivered to a New Zealand customer. Section 20(3LC) does not apply if the non-resident importer is the receiver of the goods and is not delivering them to another person in New Zealand. This is provided for in s 20(3LB). To establish that s 20(3LC) did not apply the non-resident importer would need to demonstrate that the imported goods were not intended to be delivered to another person. 75. In Example 7: Allowing non-resident goods importers to register, a non-resident company is placed in the same position as a New Zealand GST-registered business that can claim back the GST incurred on the goods and services acquired for the purposes of making taxable supplies. IS 21/03 | 28 May 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 23 | 38 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Example 7: Allowing non-resident goods importers to register Allowing non-resident goods importers to register Prestige Classics is a non-resident company that sells a luxury motor vehicle to a motor vehicle dealership, Swanky Motors, in New Zealand. The contract is entered into in Australia and a deposit is paid at that time. The payment of the deposit triggers the time of supply. At the time of supply the vehicle is outside New Zealand. As the vehicle is outside New Zealand at the time of supply, the place of supply is outside New Zealand. A term of the contract is that Prestige will import the vehicle and personally deliver it to Swanky Motors (by one of Prestige’s employees). Prestige incurs expenses in New Zealand relating to its employee’s accommodation and incidental costs in the course of delivering the vehicle to Swanky Motors. The GST amount incurred in relation to the employee’s expenses is $275.00. Prestige wants to recover the GST on these costs. Prestige arranges to import the vehicle and is levied tax on the import under s 12(1). Although Prestige has not incurred input tax exceeding $500, it has been levied tax under s 12(1) on the import of the vehicle and is therefore able to meet the requirement of s 54B(1)(b). Provided Prestige meets all the other requirements of s 54B, it could register under s 54B to claim back the GST costs for the expenditure incurred by its employee while delivering the vehicle. It cannot claim the tax levied on the vehicle as this is treated as paid by Swanky Motors under s 20(3LC). Note: If Prestige registers under s 54B, Swanky Motors may be able to claim an input tax deduction under ss 20(3) and 20(3LC) if: • It is a registered person acquiring the vehicle for the purposes of its taxable activity, and • It has appropriate supporting documents, such as Prestige’s GST registration number and evidence of the tax levied under s 12(1) on the import of the vehicle. Fifth requirement – performance of services received in New Zealand – s 54B(1)(c) 76. The fifth requirement for registration of certain non-resident suppliers focuses on where the services are performed and whether they are received by someone in New Zealand as a final consumer. A person cannot register under s 54B if the non- resident’s taxable activity involves a performance of services that are likely to be received in New Zealand by a person who is not a registered person or is a registered person but is not receiving the services in the course of making taxable or exempt supplies: s 54B(1)(c). IS 21/03 | 28 May 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 24 | 38 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 77. Section 54B(1)(c) provides: (c) the person’s taxable activity does not involve a performance of services in relation to which it is reasonably foreseeable that the performance of the services will be received in New Zealand by a person other than in the course of making taxable or exempt supplies; and ... 78. Under s 54B(1)(c), there are three main considerations:  Does the non-resident’s taxable activity involve providing services?  Is it reasonably foreseeable that the services will be received in New Zealand?  Is the recipient receiving the services “other than in the course of making taxable supplies”? 79. Section 54B(1)(c) applies to non-residents whose taxable activities involve providing services where it is reasonably foreseeable that those services will be performed in New Zealand. 80. The second and third considerations are sometimes misunderstood. The second consideration focuses on where the services are received, which is not the same as where the supply is deemed to be made for GST purposes. Once again, the focus needs to be on the nature of the contract entered into to determine who is supplying what to whom. 81. The third consideration looks at the recipient of the services and whether they are receiving the services as an end consumer. An end-consumer receives services “other than in the course of making taxable supplies” if:  the recipient is not GST registered, or  the recipient is a registered person but the services are not for the purposes of making taxable supplies, and are acquired for other purposes such as for private consumption. 82. If the services are received by a New Zealand–registered person for the purposes of making taxable supplies, then this will not prevent registration of the non-resident under s 54B. 83. Example 8: Supply of services performed and received in New Zealand builds on Example 6: Contractual recipient of the supply and illustrates how s 54B(1)(c) can prevent registration under s 54B even when the non-resident company incurs the GST input tax. IS 21/03 | 28 May 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 25 | 38 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Example 8: Supply of services performed and received in New Zealand Following the completion of the first introductory basic skills course (Example 6), non-resident company Chefco and New Zealand registered business Gourmet Chefs Ltd decide to vary their agreement. Chefco decides that it would like to incorporate the basic skills training as a component of its three-level Chef Training programme leading to a Diploma in Culinary Arts. Gourmet will be a contracted provider of services supplied to Chefco. Chefco outsources other components of its training and has similar arrangements with several other cooking schools and restaurants in its home territory. The foreign students will be enrolled with Chefco who will award the achievement certificates if the training is completed successfully. Gourmet agrees to hold places for the students, and invoices Chefco in advance of each course. The fee includes GST, as the services will be performed in New Zealand. Chefco wants to know if it can register under s 54B to claim back the GST incurred on the invoice from Gourmet. Chefco’s taxable activity is providing and arranging chef training for individuals, like the students sent to New Zealand. However, Chefco’s taxable activity involves the performance of services where it is foreseeable that the services will be received in New Zealand by the students. Part of the service provided by Chefco to the students is to provide the training at Gourmet, a service that is performed and received in New Zealand. The students will not be receiving the services for the purposes of making taxable supplies. Therefore, Chefco cannot register under s 54B because s 54B(1)(c) is not met. Sixth requirement – not making taxable supplies in New Zealand – s 54B(1)(d) 84. Under the sixth requirement for registration of certain non-resident suppliers, the non- resident seeking registration under s 54B must not be making taxable supplies in New Zealand or supplies that would be taxable if the non-resident were a registered person. Section 54B(1)(d) states: (d) the person is not making, or intending to make, — (i) a taxable supply in New Zealand; or (ii) a supply in New Zealand that would be a taxable supply if the person were registered under section 51, to a person in New Zealand who is not a registered person; and ... IS 21/03 | 28 May 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 26 | 38 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 85. Section 54B(1)(d)(i) applies to prevent registration under s 54B where the person is making or intending to make taxable supplies in New Zealand. This will include persons who are treated as making such supplies in New Zealand under s 8(3) but will allow a person to register under s 54B if the only supplies they make are to registered persons. This is because these supplies are treated as made outside New Zealand under s 8(4), unless the supplier and recipient agree to treat them as supplied in New Zealand. If there is an agreement to treat the supplies as made in New Zealand, the non-resident may register under s 51. 86. The policy reason for not requiring the non-resident to register under s 51 and return GST output tax on business-to-business supplies is that the GST collected would be offset by input tax deductions claimed by the GST-registered recipients of the supplies (as explained in Example 9: Non-resident supplies remote services to New Zealand GST- registered business). Example 9: Non-resident supplies remote services to New Zealand GST-registered business Accounts4U Ltd is a non-resident company that produces accounting software packages for small businesses. It supplies a small number of New Zealand GST-registered businesses but does not make supplies to any unregistered customers in New Zealand. Accounts4U wants to send two of its staff to demonstrate a new enhancement to the software package to its customers in New Zealand. The marketing and demonstration will take place on the clients’ premises over the course of a week. The staff will incur accommodation, food and transport costs in New Zealand which will be inclusive of GST. Accounts4U wants to register under s 54B to claim back the GST incurred on the employees’ expenses. As Accounts4U is a non-resident company, under the general place of supply rules (s 8(2)), supplies by the non-resident are treated as being made outside New Zealand. The supply of software products is the supply of remote services, which under s 8(3)(c) can be treated as made in New Zealand. However, because the supplies by Accounts4U are made to GST-registered customers, the supplies are treated as supplied outside New Zealand under s 8(4D), unless Accounts4U chooses otherwise. Therefore, Accounts 4U is not prevented from registering under s 54B by s 54B(1)(d)(i). Supply that would be a taxable supply if it were to an unregistered person 87. Section 54B(1)(d)(ii) focuses on the nature of the supply and the GST status of the recipient. For this provision to apply and prevent the non-resident from registering under s 54B: IS 21/03 | 28 May 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 27 | 38 \[UNCLASSIFIED\]  the supply must be of goods or services that “would be” a taxable supply if the person were registered; and  the recipient must be an unregistered person. 88. As with s 54B(1)(d)(i), a business-to-business supply by a non-resident is treated as a supply outside New Zealand, but a supply to an unregistered person is treated as a supply in New Zealand, so may be a taxable supply. 89. Section 54B(1)(d)(ii) applies to prevent a non-resident from registering under s 54B where the supplies are to an unregistered person, even where the level of supplies to an unregistered person does not meet the threshold for registration in New Zealand. The only way for the non-resident to register and claim any GST input tax it incurs is to voluntarily register, which would make it liable to account for GST on supplies made in New Zealand. Example 10: Non-resident company intending to make taxable supplies in New Zealand demonstrates the application of s 54B(1)(d)(ii). It is drawn from Example 1 in “Taxation (Annual Rates for 2016–17, Closely held Companies, and Remedial Matters) Act 2017”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 29, No 5 (June 2017): 89 at 91. Example 10: Non-resident company intending to make taxable supplies in New Zealand Video Game Startup Co is a small non-resident video game production company that is developing its first video game. While the worldwide sales of the game for the first year of its release are expected to be in excess of $60,000, and Video Game Startup already has a few New Zealand-based customers, Video Game Startup does not expect that sales of the game to New Zealand-resident private consumers will be above the $60,000 GST registration threshold for at least the next two years. Therefore, even though the company is supplying a remote service to New Zealand consumers, it does not have a liability to register for GST in New Zealand under the remote services rules. Therefore, if Video Game Startup does not register for GST (or does not become liable to register for GST under s 51(1)), the remote services rules will not apply to impose GST on its supplies to New Zealand consumers. In other words, as a non-registered person, Video Game Startup does not make taxable supplies because its supplies are not charged with GST under s 8. Video Game Startup intends to send two of the animators it employs, Shane and Matt, to an animation conference in Auckland. The conference price includes GST at 15%. Video Game Startup wishes to claim back the GST it incurs on the conference fees for Shane and Matt. However, Video Game Startup is not eligible to register under s 54B because of the exclusion in s 54B(1)(d)(ii): Video Game Startup makes supplies of remote services to New Zealand consumers that, if Video Game Startup were a GST-registered person, would be charged with GST. IS 21/03 | 28 May 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 28 | 38 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Seventh requirement – not a member of a group of companies that makes supplies in New Zealand 90. The final requirement is s 54B(1)(e). The non-resident ca nnot be a member of a group of companies that makes supplies in New Zealand or intend to become a member of such a group. Cross-border grouping is permitted for GST, but a group with resident and non-resident members must register under s 51. Section 54B(1)(e) states: (e) the person is not, and does not intend to become, a member of a group of companies that makes taxable supplies in New Zealand. 91. If a non-resident registered under s 54B becomes part of a group of companies that makes taxable supplies, then the person is treated as being registered under s 51 from that date: s 54B(2). Administrative issues 92. This section discusses six administrative issues in relation to registration:  the application for registration (from \[93\]);  returns and taxable periods (from \[94\]);  accounting basis (from \[97\]);  claiming input tax deductions (from \[99\]);  refunds and timing (from \[104\]);  cancellation of registration (from \[106\]); and  supplies on cessation (from \[110\]). Application for registration 93. A non-resident who applies to be registered under s 54B must complete an IR 564. The IR 564 outlines the information required to be provided with the application to ensure that the requirements for registration are met. From a practical perspective, applications for registration may be forwarded after the period for which the non- resident wishes to register, together with appropriate documentation to support the requirements. IS 21/03 | 28 May 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 29 | 38 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Returns and taxable periods 94. A non-resident who applies to be registered under s 54B can request the frequency of return filing to be a one-month, two-month or six-month period. A three-month period is not available for non-residents registering under s 54B. 95. A three-month taxable period is available for registered persons whose only supplies are of distantly taxable goods or remote services that are treated as supplied in New Zealand under s 8(3)(c): s 15(6). This period is not available to a person registered under s 54B, since that person cannot be making taxable supplies in New Zealand. 96. Where the person registered under s 54B has a branch or division registered in New Zealand under s 51 there is no requirement for the person, the branch or divisions to have consistent taxable periods. This is provided for in s 54B(6). (6) In relation to the registration of the person, section 56(6) does not apply to require the person and the branch or division to have, between themselves, consistent practices for taxable periods and accounting bases. Accounting basis 97. A person registered under s 54B must use the payments basis of accounting for GST. This means the person can claim an input tax deduction only once payment for the supply has been made. This requirement is provided for in s 19(1B): (1B) Despite subsection (1), if the Commissioner registers a non-resident person under section 54B, the person must account for tax payable on a payments basis for the purpose of section 20. 98. As already noted at \[96\] in relation to taxable periods, this accounting basis may differ from the accounting basis used by a separately registered branch or division of the person. Claiming input tax deductions 99. For non-residents registered under s 54B, a full input tax deduction may not be available. This is because an apportionment may be required under s 20(3L). Section 20(3L) provides that the person may deduct input tax to the extent to which the goods or services are used for or available for use in making taxable supplies “treating all the supplies made by the person as if they were made and received in New Zealand”. IS 21/03 | 28 May 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 30 | 38 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 100. This means that if all the supplies made by the non-resident would be taxable supplies in New Zealand, the full input tax deduction may be available. However, the input deduction may be adjusted if the person is also making what would be “exempt supplies” if made in New Zealand. The non-resident would be entitled to claim back GST based on the proportion of taxable supplies to total supplies. This means the non- resident is treated the same as a New Zealand resident who similarly makes both taxable and exempt supplies. 101. Example 11: No apportionment required and Example 12: How apportionment applies to a non-resident – financial services, demonstrate how apportionment will apply to a non-resident. Example 12 was used in Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Assets Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill: Commentary on the Bill (Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue, September 2012. Example 11: No apportionment required Redstock Wines is a winery operating in South Australia. It supplies local wholesalers and exports the balance of its wine stock to a leading supermarket in the United Kingdom. It sends some winemakers to New Zealand to train viticulture students under a contract with a University and incurs GST on the winemakers’ travel and accommodation costs. If Redstock Wines were a New Zealand–resident company, its supplies would all be taxable. The expenditure is incurred as part of carrying on its taxable activity of winemaking and supplying wine for sale. As a result, Redstock Wines is entitled to claim all the GST incurred as a deduction. Assuming Redstock Wines makes no taxable supplies in New Zealand, the GST incurred will be available as a refund. 102. A question arises as to whether a non-resident providing financial services can apply s 20F in determining the percentage of GST input tax they can claim. T he very nature of the s 54B registration is that it applies to persons who are not making supplies in New Zealand or are making supplies to registered persons in New Zealand which are able to be treated as made outside New Zealand. However, for the purposes of the election under s 20F, and s 11A(1)(q) and (r), the supplies need to be made to New Zealand registered recipients. This means that non-resident financial services providers cannot use s 20F to determine the level of input tax claimable. IS 21/03 | 28 May 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 31 | 38 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Example 12: How apportionment applies to a non-resident – financial services Bank Co is a financial services and insurance provider that is registered for GST in Australia and looking to expand into New Zealand. It registers for GST in New Zealand and incurs GST on professional services fees it receives from a New Zealand provider. Bank Co’s Australian business comprises 50% household mortgages, 25% life insurance and 25% health and contents insurance. Both the mortgage provider and life insurance components of Bank Co’s business would be exempt if they were made and received in New Zealand because they are financial services. Therefore, Bank Co can claim 25% of the GST incurred as a deduction in its New Zealand return. 103. In Example 12, if Bank Co registered under s 54B and subsequently started making supplies in New Zealand then, under ss 54B(2) and 51B(1)(d), it would be treated as being registered under the general registration provision of s 51. Sections 54B(2) and 51B(1)(d) state: 54B Requirements for registration for certain non-resident suppliers ... (2) If a non-resident person who is registered under this section starts making taxable supplies, or becomes a member of a group of companies that is making taxable supplies, they are treated as registered on the date specified by the Commissioner under subsection (1), and not being registered under this section from the date on which they start making taxable supplies or the date on which they join the group, as applicable. ... 51B Persons treated as registered (1) For the purposes of Parts 3 and 6, and of Part 9 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, the following are treated as registered persons making supplies in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity: ... (d) a non-resident person referred to in section 54B(2). ... Refunds and timing 104. For non-residents registered under s 54B, the Commissioner has 90 working days from the day after the return is filed, to either make the refund or notify the registered person of any further information required or of any investigation into the claim: s 46(1B). IS 21/03 | 28 May 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 32 | 38 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 105. The period of 90 days is intentionally longer that the standard period for a registered person to give the Commissioner enough time to make appropriate enquiries before releasing the refunds. Cancellation of registration 106. If the person is not carrying on a taxable activity anywhere in the world, the Commissioner can cancel the person’s registration: s 52(5). Cancellation takes effect from the last day of the taxable period in which the Commissioner makes that decision or another date if the Commissioner determines it appropriate. 107. For non-residents registered under s 54B, the Commissioner also has the power to cancel the registration, if the person:  no longer meets the requirements of s 54B(1)(a); or  has either not filed a return or filed a late return for three consecutive periods. 108. Section 54C provides: 54C Cancellation of registration of certain non-residents (1) Section 52 applies to the cancellation of registration of a non-resident person registered under section 54B as modified by this section. (2) The Commissioner may, in addition to the powers provided under section 52(5) and (5A), cancel the person’s registration if— (a) the Commissioner is satisfied that the person no longer meets the requirements of section 54B(1)(a): (b) for 3 consecutive taxable periods, the person has either not filed a return or has filed a late return. 109. The power of cancellation given in s 54C(2) is described in “Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Assets Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2013”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 25, No 9 (October 2013): 33 as being for two reasons:  Cancellation for failure to comply with s 54B(1)(a) is to ensure only genuine businesses are eligible to register. This provision means that if a non-resident’s overseas registration lapses or the value of their supplies drops below the $60,000 threshold, the Commissioner can de-register them.  Cancellation for non-filing or consistent late-filing is a measure to encourage compliance. Where a non-resident’s involvement with New Zealand is limited or non-existent for periods, the filing of nil returns demonstrates an intention to maintain registration. IS 21/03 | 28 May 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 33 | 38 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Supplies on cessation 110. When the registration of a person ceases, s 5(3) deems a supply to be made of any goods and services forming part of the taxable activity. This means the person needs to account for GST output tax on their business assets. The supply is deemed to be made in the course of that activity and to be made immediately before the person ceases to be registered. However, s 5(3B) was inserted to ensure that on cessation of registration of a non-resident, two adjustments are made. The first is to limit the deemed supply of goods to only goods present in New Zealand at the time the person ceases to be registered. Secondly, an adjustment must be made for services that would be performed in New Zealand. 111. Section 5(3B)(c) and (d) states: 5 Meaning of term supply ... (3B) For the purposes of this Act, when a person who is a non-resident ceases to be a registered person,— ... (c) any goods that are part of the assets of the taxable activity carried on by the person that are present in New Zealand at the time the person ceases to be registered are treated as supplied by the person in the course of the taxable activity at a time immediately before the person ceases to be registered: (d) any services that would be performed in New Zealand as part of the taxable activity carried on by the person at the time the person ceases to be registered are treated as performed by the person in the course of the taxable activity at a time immediately before the person ceases to be registered. Examples 112. The following additional examples show how s 54B applies to more detailed scenarios. Example 13: Satisfying all s 54B requirements Kingland is a manufacturing company in a manufacturing group in the United Kingdom. It is registered for VAT in the UK. Kingland has a contract to supply machines to Wallaby Co in Australia. The machines require an additional electronic component for them to meet Australian standards. Kingland decides to send the machines to New Zealand and have a New Zealand Company, Black Engineering, make the necessary adjustments. This involves fitting a IS 21/03 | 28 May 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 34 | 38 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] component, adjusting, testing and certifying each of the machines. The engines are shipped to the NZ warehouse owned by Black Engineering. Once the work has been completed the machines are exported to Australia. None of the machines are supplied to customers in New Zealand. Black Engineering charges GST on the goods and services provided, as the goods (the components) and the services (the fitting, testing and certifying) are in New Zealand at the time of supply. As this is a significant contract incurring more than $500 GST, Kingland wants to know if it can register under s 54B to claim back the GST charged on supplies it receives in New Zealand. Each of the s 54B requirements needs to be considered to determine whether Kingland can register on this basis:  Non-resident: Kingland is a non-resident for income tax purposes. The warehouse in New Zealand is the premises of Black Engineering and is not a fixed or permanent place of Kingland. It is not a place available to Kingland and will not make Kingland a resident for GST purposes.  Not liable to register under s 51(1): As Kingland is a non-resident, under s 8(2) the supplies it makes are treated as made outside New Zealand. It is not making any supplies in New Zealand and therefore does not have a liability to register under s 51(1).  Registered for a consumption tax (s 54B(1)(a)): Kingland is registered for VAT in the UK so satisfies s 54B(1)(a).  Input tax of $500 or tax levied under s 12(1) - (s 54B(1)(b)): Kingland is the recipient of goods and services in New Zealand and incurs input tax exceeding $500 so satisfies s 54B(1)(b).  Non-resident’s taxable activity involves a performance of services received by someone other than for making taxable supplies - (s 54B(1)(c)): Kingland’s taxable activity involves the manufacture and supply of engines. It has customers in the UK, Europe, Canada and Australia. Its customers are manufacturers who incorporate the engines into their products. No person receives the performance of services in New Zealand as a result of Kingland’s taxable activity. Therefore, Kingland is not precluded from registering under s 54B(1)(c).  Not making, or intending to make a supply in NZ, that would be taxable if the person was registered under s 51(1)-(s 54B(1)(d)): Kingland does not make supplies in New Zealand, nor does it intend to. Therefore, Kingland is not precluded from registering under s 54B(1)(d).  Not part of a group of companies, making taxable supplies in New Zealand, or intending to become part of a group making taxable supplies – (s 54B(1)(e)): While Kingland is part of a group in the UK, no member of the group makes taxable supplies in New Zealand. Therefore, Kingland can register for GST under s 54B and claim back the GST charged by Black Engineering. IS 21/03 | 28 May 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 35 | 38 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Example 14: Effect of supplying into New Zealand Kingland is approached by a New Zealand company TuiCo, who is registered for GST. TuiCo wants to trial using one of the engines in their small boutique manufacturing business. The value of the supply is $45,000. Kingland wants to know whether supplying an engine to TuiCo will affect its GST registration under s 54B. As noted above, one of the key requirements is that Kingland is not liable to register under s 51. Kingland could become liable to register under s 51 if it makes supplies in New Zealand and is required to register.  The supply by Kingland to TuiCo is below the threshold for being liable to register under s 51. This means that Kingland is not liable to register under s 51.  Provided Kingland remains a non-resident for GST purposes (and does not have a fixed or permanent place) it will be treated as making supplies outside NZ (s 8(2)). However, because the engines are being improved and certified by Black Engineering, the goods (being the engine) are in NZ at the time of supply so are treated as supplied in NZ by s 8(3)(a). But, because the supply to TuiCo is to a registered person, under s 8(4), the supply can be treated as supplied outside New Zealand. Therefore, the supply is not a “taxable supply in New Zealand” and Kingland would not be prevented from registering under s 54B(1)(d)(i). It would also not be prevented from registering by s 54B(1)(d)(ii) because the supply is to a person for making taxable supplies.

This Interpretation Statement considers when a non-cash transfer of company value from a company to a shareholder is treated as a dividend for tax purposes (often referred to as a deemed dividend). It focuses on the types of transactions that are entered into between small and medium-sized companies and their shareholders. 2. The Interpretation Statement first discusses the general rules for determining when a non-cash dividend will arise and provides some simple examples to assist readers to IS 21/05 | 2 July 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 2 of 25 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] understand the concepts. It then summarises the more complex rules for calculating the amount of a dividend in different situations, also with examples. 3. This Interpretation Statement is intended to raise awareness of when simple non-cash transactions will give rise to dividends. It does not consider the more complex rules relating to share repurchases, statutory producer boards, co-operative companies, foreign unit trusts, superannuation schemes, share-lending arrangements or emigrating companies. It also does not consider the rules relating to dividends arising within groups of companies. 4. In addition, the payment of a cash or non-cash dividend gives rise to a number of administrative obligations, including disclosures, requirements to provide dividend statements and withholding tax obligations. These obligations are not discussed in this Interpretation Statement. However, taxpayers should be aware that these obligations exist and seek further advice on how to comply with them. Interaction with other rules 5. Non-cash transfers of value from a company to a person can arise for a number of reasons. In particular, a company may transfer value to a person because:  they are, or are associated with, an employee of the company, as compensation for the employee’s services; or  they are, or are associated with, a shareholder of the company. In the case of small and medium sized enterprises it is often the case that people involved in the company are both employees and shareholders. 6. Because transfers of value can be caused for various reasons, the first question to ask in determining the tax treatment of the transfer is – what is the reason for the transfer? 7. Where the transfer of value is caused by an employment relationship, the transfer will usually be taxed either as employment income, or as a fringe benefit. Employment income is usually paid in cash but can also include some non-cash benefits, including the provision of accommodation. This is discussed in more detail from \[50\]. A fringe benefit is a non-cash benefit an employer provides to an employee in connection with their employment. This is discussed in more detail from \[54\]. 8. Where a transfer of value is caused by an employment relationship it will, usually, not be a dividend. However, in some cases where the non-cash benefit is provided to an employee who is also a shareholder, the fringe benefit rules either require that the benefit be treated as a dividend and not as a fringe benefit, or allow the company to choose whether to treat the benefit as a fringe benefit or a dividend. These situations are discussed at \[57\]. IS 21/05 | 2 July 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 3 of 25 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 9. Where the transfer of value is not caused by an employment relationship, or the fringe benefit rules allow the company to choose, or require the company to treat the transfer as a dividend, the dividend rules become relevant. These situations are the focus of this Interpretation Statement. 10. This process of determining which tax rules apply to a transfer of value is illustrated by the following graphic: Amounts that are a dividend 11. Subpart CD describes what is and is not a dividend. Under s CD 4, a dividend is a transfer of company value from a company to a person, if:  the cause of the transfer is a shareholding in the company; and  none of the exclusions in subpart CD apply. 12. This statement focuses on the provision of non-cash dividends. 13. The following flow-chart illustrates how to determine whether a non-cash dividend has been paid: IS 21/05 | 2 July 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 4 of 25 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Transfers of company value 14. Section CD 5 defines a “transfer of company value” for the purpose of the dividend rules in subpart CD. Under s CD 5(1) a transfer of company value from a company to a person will occur when:  the company provides money or money’s worth to the person; and  if the person provides money or money’s worth to the company in exchange, the market value of what the company provides is more than the market value of what the person provides. 15. Case law indicates that the expression “money or money’s worth” requires that a benefit be in money or be convertible into money, either directly or indirectly (Tennant v Smith (1892) 3 TC 158 (HL), Stagg v CIR \[1959\] NZLR 1,252 (HC), Abbott v Philbin (Inspector of Taxes) \[1960\] 2 All ER 763 (HL), Heaton (Inspector of Taxes) v Bell \[1969\] 2 All ER 70 (HL) and Dawson v CIR (1978) 3 NZTC 61,252 (SC)). A benefit will be directly convertible into money where the benefit can be exchanged for a monetary equivalent (Dawson at 61,257). For example, shares that are capable of being sold for money will Is there a transfer of value from the company to a shareholder (or associate (discussed from \[6\])? There is a non -cash dividend Was the transfer caused by a shareholding in the company (discussed from \[14\])? Do any of the exclusions in subpart CD apply (discussed from \[19\])? There is not a non-cash dividend Yes No No No Yes Yes IS 21/05 | 2 July 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 5 of 25 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] be money’s worth. Non-cash dividends are transfers of money’s worth from a company to a shareholder. 16. The remainder of s CD 5 clarifies whether money’s worth arises in four situations. 17. First, money’s worth is provided by a company to a person where the person is released from repaying a debt to the company, either by agreement or by operation of law (unless the company and the person are part of the same wholly-owned group) (s CD 5(2)). This means a dividend may arise if a company releases a shareholder from repaying a debt. 18. Secondly, money’s worth is not provided by a person to a company on the cancellation of a share the person holds or the cancellation of the person’s rights as a shareholder (s CD 5(2B)). This section means that in cases where a transfer of money or money’s worth from the company to a shareholder occurs on the cancellation of a share, the shareholder is deemed to provide nothing in return. This may be a dividend. 19. Thirdly, money’s worth is not provided by a company to a person where the company provides services to the person (s CD 5(3)). This means a dividend will not arise simply because a company provides services that it ordinarily provides as part of its business to a shareholder for less than market consideration. “Services” are anything that is not goods, money or a chose in action (a chose in action includes the right to use property). 20. And fourthly, money’s worth is provided by a company to a person if the company is a close company and the company provides services consisting of the benefit of expenditure by the company to the person (s CD 5(4)). This means, where a company is a close company and the company incurs expenditure on behalf of a shareholder, a dividend may arise. A close company is generally a company with five or fewer natural persons or trustees whose total voting interest in the company is more than 50% (treating all natural persons associated at the time as one person). 21. Example 1 to Example 5 illustrate when a transfer of company value occurs under the provisions discussed above. T he examples show when a transfer of company value occurs. How the transfer of company value is taxed (for example, whether as a dividend or under the fringe benefit tax (FBT) regime) is considered below. Example 1 – Simple transfer of company value Hannah is a shareholder in Hannah’s Bananas Ltd. In the 2020 income year, Hannah’s Bananas Ltd provides Hannah with a lot of fresh bananas. Hannah’s Bananas Ltd has provided money’s worth to Hannah. Hannah has not provided any money or money’s worth to Hannah’s Bananas Ltd. Therefore, there is a transfer of company value from Hannah’s Bananas Ltd to Hannah. IS 21/05 | 2 July 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 6 of 25 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Example 2 – Release from repayment of a debt Ike is a shareholder in Ike’s Bikes Ltd. I ke’s current account is overdrawn by $100. In the 2021 income year, Ike’s Bikes Ltd agrees to release Ike from having to repay the current account debt. By releasing Ike from the obligation to repay the current account debt, Ike’s Bikes Ltd has provided money’s worth to Ike under s CD 5(2). I ke has not provided any money or money’s worth to Ike’s Bikes Ltd. Therefore, there is a transfer of company value from Ike’s Bikes Ltd to Ike. Example 3 – Cancellation of shares Fiona is a shareholder in Fiona’s Feijoas Ltd. Fiona’s Feijoas Ltd buys back Fiona’s shares for $100. In buying back Fiona’s shares, Fiona’s Feijoas Ltd has transferred value to Fiona. Under s CD 5(2B), Fiona has not transferred any value to Fiona’s Feijoas Ltd by giving up her interest in the shares. Therefore, Fiona’s Feijoas Ltd has transferred value to Fiona. Note: This example does not consider whether the share repurchase will give rise to a dividend. The rules for determining whether a share repurchase will result in a dividend are in ss CD 22 to CD 25. Generally, an amount will not be a dividend to the extent to which it is equal to or less than the available subscribed capital per share, provided various bright-line tests are met and the payment is not in lieu of a dividend. Example 4 – Provision of services Cam is a shareholder in Cam’s Coms Ltd, which is a widely held company. Cam’s Coms Ltd provides telecommunication services. Cam’s Coms Ltd provides Cam its telecommunication services for free. Under s CD 5(3), the provision of the telecommunication services by Cam’s Coms Ltd to Cam is not money’s worth. Therefore, the provision of these services at an undervalue will not give rise to a transfer of company value. IS 21/05 | 2 July 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 7 of 25 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Example 5 – Provision of services in a close company Mel is a shareholder in Mel’s Mowing Ltd. Mel’s Mowing Ltd is a close company. Mel’s Mowing Ltd pays for Mel’s personal car to be cleaned at a cost of $50. By incurring expenditure that gives rise to a benefit to Mel, Mel’s Mowing Ltd has provided money’s worth to Mel under s CD 5(4). Therefore, the expenditure on cleaning Mel’s personal car gives rise to a transfer of company value from Mel’s Mowing Ltd to Mel. Caused by a shareholding 22. Under s CD 6, a transfer of company value will be caused by a shareholding where:  the recipient is a shareholder in the company or is associated with a shareholder in the company; and  the company makes the transfer because of that shareholding. 23. One indication that a transfer is caused by a shareholding is if the terms of the arrangement that results in the transfer are different from the terms on which the company would enter into a similar arrangement if no shareholding were involved (s CD 6(2), Case V9 (2001) 20 NZTC, 10,101 (TRA) and Campbell v CIR \[1968\] NZLR 1 (HC)). 24. As discussed above, if the transfer of value is caused by an employment relationship and is not caused by the person’s shareholding in the company, then it will not be a dividend. Instead, the benefit will be subject to the employment income or fringe benefit rules. Where a person is both a shareholder and an employee, one indication that the transfer of value is not caused by the shareholding may be that the person is the only shareholder who received a transfer of value. 25. The following examples explain when a dividend will be caused by a shareholding. IS 21/05 | 2 July 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 8 of 25 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Example 6 – Dividend caused by a shareholding – distribution of goods Grant is a shareholder in Grant’s Plants Ltd. He is not an employee. During the 2020 income year, Grant acquires an inner-city apartment and as part of furnishing it, uses an extensive selection of plants from Grant’s Plants Ltd. The distribution of plants is a transfer of company value from Grant’s Plants Ltd to Grant. Grant’s Plants Ltd would not have given its plants to Grant if Grant was not a shareholder in the company. Therefore, the transfer of company value is caused by the shareholding. Example 7 – Dividend caused by a shareholding – private use of assets Pat is a shareholder in Pat’s Pears Ltd. Pat’s Pears Ltd allows Pat to use one of its vehicles for his private purposes (Pat is not an employee of Pat’s Pears Limited). Pat does not make any payment to Pat’s Pears Ltd in exchange for the use of the vehicle. Pat’s Pears Ltd has transferred value to Pat by allowing him to use one of its vehicles without requiring any payment in exchange. Pat’s Pears Ltd would not allow a person unconnected with the company to use its vehicles. Pat’s only connection with the company is his shareholding. Therefore, the transfer of company value is caused by the shareholding. Example 8 – Dividend not caused by a shareholding Linda is a shareholder in Linda’s Lamingtons Ltd. She is not an employee. Linda’s Lamingtons Ltd has a sale and sells its products at a discounted price. Linda purchases some discounted products in the sale. Linda’s Lamingtons Ltd has provided money’s worth to Linda because it has sold Linda goods at an undervalue. However, the transfer of value is not caused by the shareholding. This is because the same discounts are offered to all of Linda’s Lamingtons Ltd’s customers. IS 21/05 | 2 July 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 9 of 25 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Example 9 – Dividend paid to an associate Angel’s Family Trust owns all the shares in Angel’s Antiques Ltd. Angel is a settlor, trustee and beneficiary of Angel’s Family Trust. Angel is not an employee of Angel’s Antiques Ltd. Angel’s Antiques Ltd gives Angel a valuable antique from its store. The gift of the valuable antique is a transfer of company value from Angel’s Antiques Ltd to Angel. While Angel is not a shareholder of Angel’s Antiques Ltd, she is associated with the sole shareholder, Angel’s Family Trust. Angel’s Antiques Ltd would not have given Angel the antique if she was not associated with a shareholder. Therefore, the transfer of company value is caused by a shareholding. Specific transactions that are treated as dividends 26. As well as defining a dividend in general terms, subpart CD also specifies types of transactions that will give rise to dividends:  Making a bonus issue in lieu (s CD 7) – being an arrangement where shareholders of a company are given an election as to whether to receive a bonus issue of shares for no consideration, or money or other money’s worth.  Issuing a share under a profit distribution plan (s CD 7B) – being a scheme where a company notifies shareholders that shares are to be issued and gives the shareholders an option to have some or all of the shares repurchased by the company (other than the issue of shares under an employee share scheme or a share repurchase scheme).  Making a taxable bonus issue (s CD 8) – being a bonus issue fully paid from reserves that the company chooses to treat as a dividend.  Dividends arising under specific avoidance provisions (s CD 11) – being: o Where shares are disposed of in substitution for a dividend (that is, dividend stripping arrangements) (s GB 1); o Where the company employs a relative of a director or shareholder to provide services, and the Commissioner considers the income payable to the relative is excessive (s GB 23); or o Where a close company provides remuneration for services to a shareholder, director, or relative of a shareholder or director who is not an adult employed substantially full-time in the business who participates in IS 21/05 | 2 July 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 10 of 25 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] the management or administration of the company, and the Commissioner considers the remuneration is excessive (s GB 25). Sections GB 23 and GB 25 concerning excessive payments are considered in “QB 14/09 : Income tax – meaning of ‘excessive remuneration’ and ‘excessive profits or losses’ paid or allocated to relatives, partners, shareholders or directors”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 26, No 9 (1 October 2014): 22.  Providing non-cash benefits to shareholders (s CD 20) – being: o unclassified benefits provided to employee shareholders that the company chooses to treat as a dividend; and o non-cash benefits provided to a non–executive director who is a shareholder of the company. The treatment of non-cash benefits that are fringe benefits is discussed from \[54\]. Specific transactions that are not treated as dividends 27. The final requirement in determining whether an amount is a dividend is to determine whether the amount is specifically excluded from being a dividend under ss CD 22 to CD 37. 28. This Interpretation Statement does not consider all of the situations in which an amount will not be a dividend. However, in the context of the scenarios covered by this item, the most common exclusion that will apply is the exclusion for a transfer of value that is treated as a fringe benefit (s CD 32), which is discussed further from \[54\]. 29. Subpart CD also confirms that transactions that will not give rise to dividends include:  non-taxable bonus issues (s CD 29); and  a flat-owning company making residential property available to a person (s CD 31). 30. For completeness, other transactions that also do not give rise to dividends are:  share repurchases (ss CD 22 to CD 25).  capital distributions on liquidation or emigration (ss CD 26); and  transactions within a group of companies (ss CD 27 and CD 28). 31. Further consideration of these provisions is outside the scope of this Interpretation Statement. IS 21/05 | 2 July 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 11 of 25 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Calculating the amount of a dividend General rule 32. Under s CD 38, the amount of a dividend is calculated using the formula: value from company – value from person 33. The “value from the company” is the market value of the money or money’s worth that the company provides to the person. The “value from the person” is the market value of the money or money’s worth, if any, that the person provides to the company in exchange. This excludes any amount attributable to holding or giving up rights as a shareholder in the company. This is shown in Example 10. Example 10 – Value of the dividend Jon is a shareholder in Jon’s Scones Ltd. Jon’s Scones Ltd has recently replaced one of its ovens. Jon thinks the old oven would be useful in his refurbished farmhouse. Jon takes the oven for his own personal purposes. Jon gives Jon’s Scones Ltd $50 for the second-hand oven when its market value is $500. Jon’s Scones Ltd has provided value of $500. Jon has provided value of $50. Therefore, the value of the dividend is $450 (being $500 less $50). 34. Generally, a dividend will be treated as having been paid on the date the transfer of value arises. Making property available 35. Specific rules also apply to calculate the amount of a dividend where a company makes property available to a person (s CD 39). A company makes property available to a shareholder when the company allows the shareholder to use property that the company owns for the shareholder’s private purposes. As noted at \[19\], the right to use property is a chose in action and, therefore, is not a “service” as defined. It could be argued that a company provides a “service” to a shareholder by allowing them to use its property, which is excluded from being a transfer of value under s CD 5(3). However, the Commissioner considers the better view is that, by allowing a shareholder to use property that the company owns, the company is providing the shareholder with a right to use property, which is a chose and action, and not a service. This view is more consistent with the fact that the Act includes rules for calculating the amount of a dividend where a shareholder uses a company’s property. IS 21/05 | 2 July 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 12 of 25 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 36. Under these rules, the amount of the dividend is calculated for each quarter during which the property is made available. The dividend is treated as being paid six months after the end of the company’s income year, unless the company gives the shareholder earlier notice of the amount of the dividend. 37. Where the property is not a loan, the amount of the dividend for each quarter is the value of the fringe benefit that would arise under the fringe benefit rules if the benefit was provided to an employee. Example 11 illustrates this. Example 11 – Making property available Cath is a shareholder in Cath’s Cabin Ltd. Cath is not an employee of Cath’s Cabins Ltd. Cath’s Cabin Ltd owns a holiday home that it rents out on Airbnb for $400 per night. Cath uses the holiday home for her own personal benefit for three nights. Cath pays $50 per night. The amount of the dividend is the value of the fringe benefit that would arise under the fringe benefit rules if the benefit was provided to an employee. Under s RD 41, the value of the fringe benefit is the price ordinarily charged by Cath’s Cabin Ltd as part of its business. Under s RD 54, the value of the benefit is reduced by the amount Cath paid. Therefore, the amount of the dividend in this example is $1,050 (being $400 less $50 ($350) per night for three nights). 38. Where the property is a loan, the amount of the dividend for each quarter can be calculated in two ways. The amount is either the difference between:  the benchmark rate and the actual amount of interest accruing on the loan; or  the benchmark rate and the amount of income accruing to the company in the quarter calculated under the yield to maturity method. 39. The “benchmark rate” is the interest calculated for the quarter on the daily balance of the loan calculated as:  where all amounts are expressed in New Zealand dollars, and the company notifies the Commissioner when it files its tax return, the prescribed rate of interest declared by regulations; or  where all amounts are expressed in a single currency other than New Zealand dollars, and the company notifies the Commissioner when it files its tax return, the benchmark rate the Commissioner set for that currency (if any); or  in all other cases, a market rate determined at the end of the quarter for a loan made on the same terms between persons at arm’s length. 40. Example 12 shows how a simple dividend is calculated under an interest-free loan. IS 21/05 | 2 July 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 13 of 25 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Example 12 – Interest-free loan Kiri is a shareholder in Kiri’s Construction Ltd. She is not an employee. Kiri borrows NZ$1,000, interest free, from Kiri’s Construction Ltd. Kiri is deemed to have received a dividend equal to the difference between the benchmark rate and the actual amount of interest accruing on the loan. Kiri decides to rely on the prescribed rate of interest declared by regulation rather than determining what a market value for a loan of this type would be. From 1 July 2020, the prescribed interest rate is 4.5%. For the quarter 1 July 2020 to 30 September 2020, the amount of the non-cash dividend is: 푁푁푁푁푁푁 −푐푐푐푐푐푐 ℎ 푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑 푁푁푑푑=푂푂푂푂푂푂 푐푐푂푂푐푐푁푁푑푑푑푑푁푁 푂푂 푙푙푁푁푐푐푁푁 푥푥 푑푑푁푁푂푂푑푑푖푖 푑푑푐푐푂푂 푖푖푐푐푂푂푑푑 푥푥 푑푑푐푐푑푑 푐푐 푑푑푁푁 푞푞푂푂푐푐푖푖푂푂푑푑푖푖 365 푁푁푁푁푁푁 −푐푐푐푐푐푐 ℎ 푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑 푁푁푑푑=$1,000 푥푥 4. 5% 푥푥 92 365 푁푁푁푁푁푁 −푐푐푐푐푐푐 ℎ 푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑 푁푁푑푑=$11.34 41. In calculating the daily balance of the loan, an amount repaid during the tax year is treated as having been applied in repayment of the loan on the later of the start of the company’s tax year or the day the loan was made, if:  the amount is repaid by applying salary, wages, extra pay, dividends or interest payable by the company to the borrower;  the amount payable by the company is income of the borrower in the tax year or an earlier tax year; and  the amount payable by the company is payable without any amount of tax being withheld under the PAYE, resident withholding tax or non-resident withholding tax rules, or is a fully imputed dividend. 42. Example 13 shows how the timing rule works for dividends applied in repaying loans. Example 13 – Repayment of a loan Michelle is a shareholder in Michelle’s Marvellous Muffins Ltd. During the 2020 income year, Michelle borrows NZ$1,000, interest free, from Michelle’s Marvellous Muffins Ltd. In the same year, Michelle’s Marvellous Muffins Ltd pays Michelle a fully imputed dividend of $200 (gross dividend of $277.78 including imputation credits of $77.78) that is applied to repay part of the loan. Because the repayment is made IS 21/05 | 2 July 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 14 of 25 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] in the same year that the loan was provided, Michelle is treated as having made the repayment on the day the loan was originally made, and any dividend arising from the fact the loan was interest-free will reduce accordingly. Michelle’s Marvellous Muffins Ltd pays Michelle another fully imputed dividend of $200 in the 2022 income year that is also applied to repay part of the loan. Because the repayment is made in the income year after the loan was provided, the repayment is treated as being paid at the start of Michelle’s Marvellous Muffin’s 2022 tax year. Imputation credits 43. A company may attach imputation credits to a dividend when it is paid (s OB 60). This is the case whether the dividend consists of money or money’s worth. However, the requirement that imputation credits be attached when the dividend is paid means an ordinary company cannot attach imputation credits retrospectively if it discovers that a non-cash dividend has arisen unintentionally. In determining when a non-cash dividend is paid it may be necessary to have regard to the calculation rules, which specify when a dividend is treated as having been paid in some situations (discussed above from \[32\]). 44. The benchmark dividend rules will apply where a company pays more than one dividend during any tax year (including a non-cash dividend). Under those rules the first dividend of the year is the benchmark dividend and the imputation ratio of all dividends paid during the year must match the benchmark dividend (s OB 61). This means that if an unimputed non-cash dividend is the first dividend paid in a tax year, no other dividends paid in that year can be imputed. 45. The benchmark dividend rule also requires that any dividend paid after the benchmark dividend that is not imputed at the same rate as the benchmark dividend (including a non-cash dividend), will result in a debit to the imputation credit account (s OB 61(5)). This will occur despite no imputation credits having been attached to the dividend. The debit is calculated based on the highest amount of imputation credits attached to any distribution during the year, such that it will arise whether the unimputed dividend is paid first, or subsequent to a fully imputed dividend. 46. The benchmark dividend rules can, however, be overridden if the company notifies the Commissioner by providing a ratio change declaration (IR 407) before paying any subsequent dividends, stating that the dividend is not part of an arrangement to obtain a tax advantage under ss GB 35 and GB 36 (s OB 61(6)). This declaration must be witnessed by a Justice of the Peace, solicitor, or other person authorised to take a statutory declaration. IS 21/05 | 2 July 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 15 of 25 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Recovered amounts 47. Calculation rules ensure the treatment of some dividends is reversed if the transaction is reversed. These rules apply where:  a company recovers a dividend from a shareholder (s CD 40);  a dividend arises because a person was released from an obligation to repay debt, and the debt is later repaid (s CD 41(1));  a dividend arises because a close company provided services consisting of the benefit of expenditure by the company to the person and the shareholders believe on reasonable grounds that the expenditure was only for the benefit of the company and the expenditure is later repaid (s CD 41(2));  a dividend arises because of a difference between the market value of the property provided by or to the company and the consideration paid for it (s CD 42), and: o the consideration paid was an amount the company considered was market value having taken reasonable steps to ascertain the market value; and o the recipient of the dividend later paid the company:  additional consideration to reflect market value; or  a refund of any excess consideration paid by the company. 48. In all cases, the Act ensures the recovered dividend and any imputation credits are disregarded for tax purposes, and a refund of any tax paid occurs. This is shown in Example 14. Example 14 – Recovered amounts Taniela is a shareholder in Taniela’s Tables Ltd. Taniela is not an employee of Taniela’s Tables Ltd. Taniela’s Tables pays a dividend to Taniela. However, after the dividend is paid the directors realise that the solvency test has been breached, and they claw back the dividend. Due to the clawing back of the dividend, the dividend is reversed under s CD 41. Dividends are not deductible 49. No specific provision in part D denies a deduction for a payment that is deemed a dividend to the recipient. However, the payment of a dividend to a shareholder is generally denied deductibility because it does not have any nexus with the derivation IS 21/05 | 2 July 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 16 of 25 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] of income or carrying on a business as required by s DA 1. Case law confirms that a distinction exists between the expenses incurred in earning profits, which are deductible, and any post-profit distribution, which is non-deductible (Mersey Docks and Harbour Board v Lucas (1883) 8 AC 891, (1883) 2 TC 25 (HL)). Example 15 shows this. Example 15 – Deductibility Dinesh is a shareholder in Dinesh’s Dinners Ltd. Dinesh is not an employee of Dinesh’s Dinners Ltd. Dinesh’s Dinners Ltd incurs $200 paying Dinesh’s private power and phone bills. This payment is discovered in a compliance review of Dinesh’s Dinners Ltd a couple of years later. The $200 of private expenditure that Dinesh’s Dinners Ltd paid is treated as a dividend for Dinesh, so the expenditure is not deductible for Dinesh’s Dinners Ltd. If a deduction had previously been taken for that expenditure it will be reversed as part of the review. Amounts that are not a dividend Employment income 50. As discussed above, where a shareholder or an associate of a shareholder is also an employee of the company and receives an amount as payment for services provided, that will not give rise to a dividend. This is because the money or money’s worth provided by the company to the person (the payment) is equal to the money or money’s worth provided by the person to the company (the services). In addition, even if there is a transfer of value, it will be caused by the employment relationship, and not by the shareholding. This is subject to the avoidance rules for excessive payments made to relatives, shareholders or directors (under s CD 11), discussed at \[26\] and in QB 14/09. 51. However, while amounts received by an employee are not treated as dividends, they do give rise to income for the employee under s CE 1. Employment income is usually in the form of cash payments. However, it can include some non-cash items. Under s CE 1, an amount derived in connection with employment or service is income if it is:  salary, wages or an allowance, bonus, extra pay or gratuity;  the value of accommodation (including accommodation allowances, payments or reimbursements) provided to a person when it is provided in relation to employment or service (ss CE 1B to CE 1E); IS 21/05 | 2 July 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 17 of 25 \[UNCLASSIFIED\]  expenditure on account of an employee, being a payment made by an employer relating to expenditure incurred by an employee or to be incurred by an employee (s CE 5);  a benefit received under an employee share scheme (as described in s CE 2);  director’s fees;  compensation for loss of employment or services; or  any other benefit in money. 52. Se ction CD 32 also confirms that the value of accommodation provided to a person in relation to employment or service which is employment income is not a dividend. 53. The amount a company incurs paying employment income will usually be a cost incurred in deriving assessable income or in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income, such that the payments will be deductible under s DA 1. However, where amounts are paid to employees who are working on a capital project, the payments may not be deductible (Christchurch Press Co Ltd v CIR (1993) 15 NZTC 10,206). Section DB 1 confirms that the company is also allowed a deduction for PAYE paid in relation to employment income. Example 16 shows how employment income is treated differently from dividends. Example 16 – Employment income Dani is a shareholder and an employee of Dani’s Doughnuts Ltd. Dani receives $2,000 per month from Dani’s Doughnuts Ltd. This payment is compensation for Dani’s services to Dani Doughnuts Ltd. The money transferred by Dani’s Doughnuts Ltd to Dani is equal to the money’s worth provided by Dani to Dani’s Doughnuts Ltd. Therefore, the payment is not a dividend. However, it will be taxable employment income for Dani and will be deductible for Dani’s Doughnuts Ltd. Fringe benefits 54. Under s CD 32, a benefit provided to an employee is not a dividend if it is a fringe benefit subject to FBT. 55. A “fringe benefit” is a benefit an employer provides to an employee in connection with their employment that is (s CX 2):  the private use of a motor vehicle (s CX 6);  subsidised transport (s CX 9); IS 21/05 | 2 July 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 18 of 25 \[UNCLASSIFIED\]  an employment-related loan (s CX 10);  a service provided to members of Parliament (s CX 12);  a contribution to a superannuation scheme (s CX 13), sickness, accident or death benefit fund (s CX 14), funeral trust (s CX 15), or life or health insurance (s CX 16); or  an unclassified benefit, being a benefit subject to FBT other than those listed above. 56. A fringe benefit is excluded income of the employee (s CX 3) and is, instead, subject to FBT under s RD 26. 57. However, if a company provides a non-cash benefit to an employee who holds shares in the company, other than a non–executive director, the company may choose to treat the benefit as a fringe benefit or a dividend (s CX 17). Section CX 17 will apply only if the benefit:  would have given rise to a dividend (that is, the benefit related to the shareholding); and  is an unclassified benefit. 58. Section CX 17 will not apply if the fringe benefit arises from the private use of asset which is subject to the mixed-use asset rules in subpart DG. If that is the case, the company must choose to treat the benefit as a dividend and not as a fringe benefit. 59. In addition, if a company provides a benefit to a person who is associated with an employee and with a shareholder in the company, and that benefit would have been a dividend if provided to the shareholder, the benefit is subject to FBT and is not treated as being a dividend (s CX 18). 60. As for other employment income, the amount a company incurs in providing benefits to employees will usually be a cost incurred in deriving assessable income or in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income such that the payments will be deductible under s DA 1. Section DB 1 confirms that the company is also allowed a deduction for FBT paid on fringe benefits. 61. Example 17 and Example 18 illustrate when fringe benefits will arise. IS 21/05 | 2 July 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 19 of 25 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Example 17 – Fringe benefit Noah is a shareholder and an employee of Noah’s Needles Ltd. Noah uses a car owned by Noah’s Needles Ltd for his private purposes. Because Noah is an employee of Noah’s Needles Ltd, the private use of a company vehicle will give rise to a fringe benefit rather than a dividend. Because the provision of a motor vehicle is not an unclassified benefit, Noah’s Needles Ltd cannot choose to elect that the amount be treated as a non-cash dividend under s CX 17. Therefore, Noah’s Needles Ltd must pay FBT on the private use of the vehicle. Noah’s Needles Ltd will be entitled to deduct the FBT paid. Example 18 – Unclassified benefits Jaya is a shareholder and an employee of Jaya’s Jet Skis Ltd. Jaya regularly uses Jaya’s Jet Skis Ltd’s jet skis for her own private use. Because Jaya is an employee of Jaya’s Jet Skis Ltd, the private use of the company’s property will give rise to a fringe benefit. The use of the jet skis is an unclassified benefit. Therefore, Jaya’s Jet Skis Ltd can choose to treat the private use as a dividend or a fringe benefit by either including it in their FBT return for the relevant period, or complying with the withholding and other obligations that arise from paying a dividend. Look-through companies 62. Shareholders (or persons with an “effective look-through interest” (see s HB 1(5) and YA 1)) in a look-through company (LTC) are treated as:  carrying on the activity carried on by the LTC;  holding the property that the LTC holds;  being party to any arrangements to which the LTC is a party; and  doing and being entitled to do all the things the LTC does or is entitled to do (s HB 1). 63. To that end, the shareholders in an LTC are treated as receiving all income and incurring all deductions personally. Given all income of an LTC is treated as being derived personally by its shareholders, distributions from the LTC to its shareholders IS 21/05 | 2 July 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 20 of 25 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] are ignored for tax purposes. LTCs are also excluded from the definition of “company” in s YA 1, excluding them from the application of the dividend rules. 64. Shareholders are, however, entitled to a deduction for their share (based on their effective look-through interest) of any payments made to a working owner of the LTC (s DC 3B(1)). A “working owner” is a person who is an owner of the LTC who personally and actively performs duties that are required to be performed in carrying on the business of the LTC and are performed by the person under a contract of employment (s YA 1). The contract of employment must be in writing and must specify the terms and conditions of the services to be performed by the working owner and the amount payable for the performance of those services (s DC 3B(3)). An LTC cannot have a working owner, if the LTC is wholly or mainly engaged in investing money or in holding, or dealing in, shares, securities, investments or estates and interests in land. 65. Example 19 and Example 20 show how distributions are taxed under the LTC rules. Example 19 – Distribution from an LTC Chen is a shareholder in Chen’s Hens Ltd, which is an LTC. Chen receives a distribution of $100 from Chen’s Hens Ltd. The distribution is ignored for tax purposes. Instead, Chen is taxed on his share of Chen’s Hens Ltd’s income as if he derived it directly. Example 20 – Working owner Kyle is a shareholder in Kyle’s Smiles Ltd, which is an LTC. Kyle performs services for Kyle’s Smiles under a contract of employment, which specifies the duties he is required to undertake and his salary. Kyle’s salary is a deductible expense for Kyle and the other shareholders in Kyle’s Smiles Ltd. Qualifying companies 66. While it is not possible for a company to elect to become a qualifying company anymore, qualifying companies still exist. Any dividend paid by a qualifying company to a person resident in New Zealand is exempt income of the person to the extent to which it is more than the fully imputed distribution (ss HA 14 and CW 15). Imputation credits are automatically treated as being attached to any dividend that is not a non- cash dividend (other than taxable bonus issues) to the extent that imputation credits IS 21/05 | 2 July 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 21 of 25 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] are available (calculated at the end of the tax year) (s HA 15). Example 21 illustrates this. Example 21 – Dividend from a qualifying company Angelina is a shareholder in Angelina’s Ballerinas Ltd, which is a qualifying company. Angelina’s Ballerinas Ltd makes a distribution to Angelina of $100 during the 2021 tax year. Angelina’s Ballerinas Ltd has $28 of available imputation credits at the end of the 2021 tax year. The distribution is treated as an imputed dividend to the extent of the available imputation credits (that is, $72). The remaining distribution is exempt income for Angelina. More examples Example 22 - Overdrawn shareholder loan account Alex is a shareholder in Alex’s Axolotls Ltd. Alex is not an employee. On 14 June 2020, Alex borrows NZ$1,000, interest free, from Alex’s Axolotls Ltd. On 31 December 2020, Alex’s Axolotls Ltd pays Alex a fully imputed dividend of $200 (gross dividend of $277.78 including imputation credits of $77.78) that is applied to repay part of the loan. Because the repayment is made in the same year that the loan was provided, Alex is treated as having made the repayment on the day the loan was originally made, and any dividend arising from the fact the loan was interest free will reduce accordingly. When preparing the monthly management accounts for Alex’s Axolotls Ltd in March 2021, its accountant notes that Alex’s loan account is still outstanding and that there is the potential for a non-cash dividend to arise: Shareholder loan account – Alex Date Debit Credit Balance 1/4/20 Opening balance 0.00 14/6/20 Loan to Alex 1,000.00 1,000.00 31/12/20 Dividend 200.00 800.00 The accountant advises the directors that they have some options in terms of dealing with the tax consequences of Alex as receiving a non-cash dividend. The first option is that Alex is treated as deriving a non-cash dividend. The amount of the non-cash dividend is calculated on the outstanding balance of the loan, IS 21/05 | 2 July 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 22 of 25 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] allowing the fully imputed dividend to be credited against the loan on 14 June 2020, the date the loan was drawn down. 퐷퐷푑푑푑푑 퐷퐷푑푑푑푑 푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑 푁푁푑푑=푂푂푂푂푂푂 푐푐푂푂푐푐푁푁푑푑푑푑푁푁 푂푂 푙푙푁푁푐푐푁푁 푥푥 푑푑푁푁푂푂푑푑 푖푖푑푑푐푐푂푂 푖푖푐푐푂푂푑푑 푥푥 푑푑푐푐푑푑 푐푐 푑푑푁푁 푞푞푂푂푐푐푖푖푂푂푑푑푖푖 365 푁푁푁푁푁푁 −푐푐푐푐푐푐 ℎ 푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑 푁푁푑푑 푄푄1 =$800 푥푥 5. 26% 푥푥 16 365 푁푁푁푁푁푁 −푐푐푐푐푐푐ℎ 푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑 푁푁푑푑 푄푄1 =$1.84 푁푁푁푁푁푁 −푐푐푐푐푐푐 ℎ 푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑 푁푁푑푑 푄푄2−푄푄4 =$800 푥푥 4. 5% 푥푥 274 365 푁푁푁푁푁푁 −푐푐푐푐푐푐 ℎ 푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑 푁푁푑푑 푄푄2−푄푄4 =$27.02 푇푇푁푁푂푂푐푐푙푙 푁푁푁푁푁푁 −푐푐푐푐푐푐 ℎ 푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑 푁푁푑푑=$28.87 Under option 1, Alex would be treated as deriving a dividend of $28.87 on the earlier of 30 September 2021 or when notified by Alex’s Axolotls Ltd of the payment of the dividend. Because the accountant is preparing the accounts soon after balance date, this dividend could have imputation credits attached to it like the earlier dividend did (attaching imputation credits is discussed from \[43\]). The accountant advises that option 2 is to charge Alex interest on the loan in the amount of $28.87 to 31 March 2021. This would increase the balance of the loan to $828.87 as at that date. In Alex assuming liability for this further amount, the value of the non-cash dividend would be reduced to nil. Alternatively, the accountant advises Alex’s Axolotls Ltd that as it has had a very successful year, it could just pay Alex a further dividend of $800. This dividend could be declared and paid by 31 March 2021. It could be imputed and credited back to the date the loan was drawn down. Example 23 – FBT rules apply Jon is a shareholder and employee of Jon’s Jeeps Ltd. Jon’s Jeeps Ltd allows Jon to use one of its vehicles for his private purposes. Jon does not make any payment to Jon’s Jeeps Ltd in exchange for the use of the vehicle. Is there a transfer of value? Yes - Jon’s Jeep Ltd has transferred value to Jon by allowing him to use one of its vehicles without requiring any payment in exchange. IS 21/05 | 2 July 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 23 of 25 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Was the transfer caused by a shareholding? Potentially – Jon’s Jeeps Ltd would not allow a person unconnected with the company to use its vehicles. Given Jon is a shareholder in Jon’s Jeeps Ltd the transfer of value could be caused by the shareholding. Do any of the exclusions apply? Yes – Given Jon is also an employee of the company, the private use of the vehicle would also be subject to the FBT rules. Private use of a vehicle is not an unclassified benefit. Therefore, the benefit would be subject to FBT and not be taxed as a non-cash dividend under s CD 32. Example 24 – FBT rules apply Angie is a shareholder and employee of Angie’s Apricots Ltd. Angie’s Apricots allows Angie to take an amount of apricots home with her each night as a supplement to her salary. Is there a transfer of value? Yes – Angie’s Apricots Ltd has transferred value to Angie by providing her with apricots free of charge. Was the transfer caused by a shareholding? No – Angie has been provided with the apricots as a supplement to her salary. The apricots have been provided as payment for her services and not because she is a shareholder in the company. Therefore, no non-cash dividend will arise. FBT consequences However, the provision of apricots to Angie in connection with her employment will give rise to an unclassified fringe benefit, such that FBT will be payable by Angie’s Apricots Ltd based on the market value of the apricots provided.

UNCLASSIFIED \[UNCLASSIFIED\] FACT SHEET Income tax and GST – Treatment of meal expenses Issued: 26 November 2021 IS 21/06 FS 1 This fact sheet accompanies interpretation statement IS 21/0 6 (Income tax and GST – Treatment of meal expenses (Inland Revenue, 2021)), which considers the income tax and GST treatment of meal expenses incurred by self-employed people. It also discusses the treatment of meal allowances paid to employees and entertainment expenditure. This fact sheet also includes a table indicating deductibility in different scenarios. Deductibility – self-employed taxpayers If you’re self-employed you cannot usually deduct meal expenses. The Income Tax Act 2007 denies deductions for private or domestic expenditure. This is expenditure that individual members of society have to incur to live (for example, expenditure on food and shelter) and expenditure relating to the household or family. Food and meals are usually private and domestic expenditure. Narrow exception for extra expenditure A narrow exception exists for extra expenditure on food where the requirements of your business impose extra meal costs. You may be allowed to deduct the extra expense where you are required to work in a remote location or unusual hours. Merely “working away” is not enough for the expenditure to come within the exception – the circumstances must be such that you have no choice but to incur additional expenditure on meals. IS 21/06 FS 1 | 26 November 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 2 of 4 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Other scenarios Sometimes customers who would otherwise be self-employed operate through a closely- held company or have employees who incur meal expenses. I nterpretation statement IS 21/06 explains how the tax treatment differs in these circumstances. Outcomes differ depending on whether the expenditure is for meals or light refreshments at a work event, an overtime meal or a meal while travelling on business. Provided the requirements are met:  the amount will be deductible for employers; and  employees receiving an allowance or reimbursement for meals consumed while away performing their duties can treat the amount they receive as “tax free” because it is exempt income and not subject to fringe benefit tax. The treatment of meal expenditure is also different if you are self-employed and incur meal expenditure that is entertainment expenditure. You can effectively deduct 50% of the cost of the entertainment expenditure, including the cost of your meal. For instance, if you pay for a business lunch for yourself and clients, then you can deduct 50% of the cost. What is entertainment expenditure? The Income Tax Act 2007 contains a regime specifically for entertainment expenditure. The regime applies to certain types of entertainment expenditure that have both private and business elements. If you come within the rules (and provided the expenditure has a sufficient relationship with your business or deriving income), you are allowed a deduction of 50% of the amount incurred. For more information about entertainment expenditure and fringe benefit tax, see Ngā whakapaunga whakangahau: Entertainment expenses (webpage, Inland Revenue). Guide to likely income tax treatment of meal expenses The following table lists the most likely tax treatment for different forms of expenditure.

Goods and services used for private and domestic purposes are not used to make taxable supplies. This means if you are not allowed to deduct expenses for income tax purposes, then you cannot deduct the input tax on the expense for GST purposes. It will be relatively rare that a self-employed person who is GST registered can claim GST input tax for meal expenses. For more information, see the interpretation statement. Record keeping It’s important that you keep good records to support your expense deductions. You’ll need the receipt or invoice but it may be useful to also make a record of the wider circumstances. For entertainment expenditure it’s helpful to also record the date, the reason for the expense, the names of the individuals who the expenses relate to and the business they represent. Where can I find out more? This fact sheet is a quick reference guide and provides general guidance only. Individual circumstances are inevitably different, so you may wish to obtain advice from a tax advisor.

UNCLASSIFIED \[UNCLASSIFIED\] INTERPRETATION STATEMENT Income tax and GST – Treatment of meal expenses Issued: 7 July 2021 IS 21/06 This statement covers the income tax and GST treatment of meal expenses incurred by self- employed persons. It also discusses the treatment of meal allowances paid to employees to illustrate the differences with the treatment of self-employed persons, and also the treatment of entertainment expenditure for the same reason.

The main focus of this interpretation statement is the deductibility of meal expenses by self-employed persons. But in considering that issue the statement also considers the treatment of employees. In general, self-employed taxpayers cannot deduct meal expenses for income tax purposes. This is because:  In a broad sense expenditure on the necessities of life (meals, clothing, shelter etc) could be described as incurred by a person in deriving their assessable income for the purposes of the general permission in s DA 1 (Hunter v CIR (1989) 11 NZTC 6,242 at 6,258);  However, the Act denies a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is of a private or domestic nature (the “private limitation”, s DA 2(2)); IS 21/06 | 7 July 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 2 of 36 \[UNCLASSIFIED\]  An outgoing is of a private or domestic nature if it is “exclusively referable to living as an individual member of society and domestic expenses are those relating to the household or family unit” (CIR v Haenga (1985) 7 NZTC 5,198 at 5,207);  Food is in the private or domestic category (Hunter at page 6,257, Case E80 (1982) 5 NZTC 59,421); and  There are limited circumstances where amounts expended on food may be deductible, such as where the requirements of a taxpayer’s business imposed extra meal costs because of a remote working location or unusual working hours (Case F117 (1984) 6 NZTC 60,125, discussed below from \[28\]). 2. This conclusion means there is a difference between self-employed taxpayers’ meal expenses compared to:  Employees receiving meal allowances or reimbursements while performing their duties (deductible expenditure to the employer, exempt income of the employee, not subject to FBT); or  “Self-employed” persons incorporating a closely-held company and becoming an employee to receive the same treatment as any other employee. 3. These differences reflect the different legal arrangements in existence in these fact situations, and these different arrangements do give rise to significant legal effects. For example, there are differences in terms of personal liability, application of tax regimes (such as dividends, FBT), and so on. There is also a difference with the treatment of entertainment expenditure. 4. In the GST context, where meal expenses are of a private or domestic nature for income tax purposes, and non-deductible, input tax on the expenses cannot be deducted for GST purposes. The main reason for this is that goods and services used for private and domestic purposes are not used for making taxable supplies. Introduction 5. The principal legislative provisions involved with the income tax issue are the general permission (s DA 1) and the private limitation (s DA 2(2)). For GST, the relevant sections of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (“the GST Act”) are ss 20(3) and 20(3C) dealing with the claiming of input tax. 6. For income tax the principal issue is whether a self-employed person’s meal expenses are deductible, and if so in what circumstances. This statement will also compare the tax treatment of a self-employed person with the treatment of an employee receiving a IS 21/06 | 7 July 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 3 of 36 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] meal allowance and consider the effect of the entertainment expenditure regime on the deductibility of meals. 7. For GST, the principal issue is whether input tax incurred on meals by a self-employed person is deductible, in whole or in part. Income tax deductibility 8. The deductibility of expenditure on meals is governed by the general permission and the private limitation. DA 1 General permission Nexus with income A person is allowed a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss, including an amount of depreciation loss, to the extent to which the expenditure or loss is— (a) incurred by them in deriving— (i) their assessable income; or (ii) their excluded income; or (iii) a combination of their assessable income and excluded income; or (b) incurred by them in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving— (i) their assessable income; or (ii) their excluded income; or (iii) a combination of their assessable income and excluded income. DA 2 General limitations ... Private limitation A person is denied a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is of a private or domestic nature. This rule is called the private limitation. Cases on the general principles 9. New Zealand courts have provided general principles for applying both the general permission and the private limitation (or their predecessor sections before they were known by such terms). IS 21/06 | 7 July 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 4 of 36 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 10. A good starting point for considering the general permission is the approach taken in the Court of Appeal decisions of CIR v Banks (1978) 3 NZTC 61,236 and Buckley and Young Limited v CIR (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271. In both cases the decisions of the Court were delivered by Richardson J. In Banks at page 61,240 his Honour said a deduction is available only where expenditure has the necessary relationship both with the taxpayer concerned and with the gaining or producing of assessable income. Relationship with the taxpayer is not sufficient as the prohibitions for deductions for capital expenditure and private and domestic expenditure make clear. The Court found there must be the statutory nexus between the expenditure and the assessable income of the taxpayer claiming the deduction. 11. Banks touched on the question of the character of the expenditure, which was also addressed in Buckley and Young at page 61,274 by Richardson J: ...The heart of the inquiry is the identification of the relationship between the advantage gained or sought to be gained by the expenditure and the income earning process. That in turn requires determining the true character of the payment. It then becomes a matter of degree and so a question of fact to determine whether there is a sufficient relationship between the expenditure and what it provided or sought to provide on the one hand, and the income earning process on the other, to fall within the words of the section (C. of I.R. v Banks (1978) 3 NZTC 61,236, 61,242). 12. The private limitation has been the subject of several court decisions including the Court of Appeal decision in CIR v Haenga (1985) 7 NZTC 5,198 and the High Court decision of Hunter v CIR (1989) 11 NZTC 6,242. 13. In Haenga the taxpayer, an employee of New Zealand Railways, was obliged (by statute) to make contributions to the Government Railways Welfare Society. The taxpayer claimed a deduction for the expenditure, which the Commissioner denied. The Court of Appeal upheld the decisions of the TRA and the High Court that the expenditure was deductible. Richardson J, at page 5,206, considered that in some circumstances it may be helpful to focus on the essential character of expenditure, but not always: ...In some circumstances it is helpful to focus on the essential character of an outgoing in the sense of its being incidental and relevant to the gaining or producing of the assessable income. But not always, for some expenses such as rates, repairs and travel costs are not inherently or even prima facie of either an income related or non-income related character. In other cases to label the character of the activity as private may be misleading, for example, where accommodation and meals are obtained away from home. Further analysis is required. IS 21/06 | 7 July 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 5 of 36 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 14. After observing that it is a matter of degree and so a question of fact to determine whether there is a sufficient nexus between the expenditure and the income earning process his Honour said (at page 5,206): The legal answer is complicated where, as here, the asset or advantage in respect of which expenses are incurred may serve private and income earning purposes. Thus expenses of travelling between home and work and expenses of child care have conventionally been regarded by the Courts as a private matter, a form of consumption. Inasmuch as they are a prerequisite to the earning of income it is arguable that they are incurred in the gaining of the assessable income. But depending on one's perspective a similar argument could even be advanced to justify deduction of outlays on such basic items as essential food, clothing and shelter which may be said to maintain and enhance the physical and psychological wellbeing of the individual, and in turn his or her ability to perform his employment. In one sense then any such expenditure has a relation to the purpose of earning income, even if it is described as an ordinary living expense. But it is not to be expected that the Legislature ever contemplated such an erosion of the income tax base in respect of employment income; and with careful emphasis on the character of the expenditure incurred the Courts have denied the notion that an expense properly characterised as consumption is incidental and relevant to the derivation of income merely because it is necessary in that sense (Lodge v FC of T 72 ATC 4174 at p 4176 (1972) 128 CLR 171 at p 175; Lunney v FC of T (1957-8) 100 CLR 478). On this approach deduction may be refused in this class of case where the expenditure is of a private nature and sec 105(2)(b) and sec 106(1)(j) raise essentially the same considerations. In such a case the exclusion of expenditure made on private matters comes from the requirement of the first limb of sec 104 (and sec 105(2)(b)) which limits deductions to expenditure incurred in gaining assessable income, and the express exclusion in sec 106(1)(j) may be regarded as having been inserted by way of precaution or emphasis (Handley v FC of T 81 ATC 4165 at p 4174 (1981) 148 CLR 182 at p 200). (Emphasis added.) 15. At page 5,207 his Honour said that the private limitation (then s 106(1)(j) of the Income Tax Act 1976) could be regarded as having been inserted in the Act by way of precaution or emphasis. In other words, the exclusion of expenditure made on private matters comes first from the requirement that deductions be limited to expenditure incurred in gaining assessable income. Further on page 5,207 his Honour went on to discuss what is meant by an outgoing of a private nature: An outgoing is of a private nature if it is exclusively referable to living as an individual member of society and domestic expenses are those relating to the household or family unit. 16. McGechan J in Hunter returned to the question of the denial of deductions for expenditure of a “private or domestic” nature. This arose in the context of IS 21/06 | 7 July 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 6 of 36 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] unreimbursed relocation expenses incurred by the taxpayer during a promotion and transfer as a police officer. The deduction claimed was denied and McGechan J upheld this decision of the Commissioner. 1 17. At pages 6,256 to 6,262 of the judgment, his Honour considered the question of whether expenditure was private or domestic. At page 6,256 his Honour referred to Richardson J’s observations in Haenga in looking at the policy behind the denial of private or domestic expenditure: I look first for statutory intention. The policy underlying prohibition of deduction of expenditure of a private or domestic nature is obvious enough. It is to overcome openings otherwise available, as a matter of logic, and to protect an important tax base from undue erosion. I refer generally to the observations of Richardson J in C of IR v Haenga (1985) 7 NZTC 5,198 at pp 5,205 to 5,207; \[1986\] 1 NZLR 119 at pp 127-128. If sec 105(2) and cl 8 stood unqualified, they could permit deduction of expenditure on matters such as food, clothing, medical expenses, travel, and shelter. All, in a broad sense, would be incurred in gaining assessable income, or for the purposes of employment. One does not gain assessable income, or hold employment if starving to death, or dying from disease or exposure. On a sine qua non approach, the logic would be unanswerable. ... The policy solution is prohibition of so-called personal or domestic expenditure. To say food, clothing, or shelter or the like is an essential requirement for the purposes of gaining an income might remain logical, but it is not generally to be legal. A line is to be drawn, placing beyond the pale that which “properly” is expenditure of a personal or domestic nature. No statutory definition is given. Obviously, there will be borderline cases involving line drawing. The Courts are expected to do so in a manner which promotes this statutory object. (Emphasis added.) 18. Having considered the underlying statutory policy for the prohibition, McGechan J went on to consider authority, and specific examples of expenditure which courts have considered to be private and domestic including food (at pages 6,256-7): I turn to authority. Traditionally, at least until recently, a conservative approach has been taken. A few examples in cognate areas will illustrate. Child minding expenses may well be a pre-requisite to the earning of income, but generally have been rejected for reasons including labelling as “private or domestic” eg Lodge v FCT (1972) 128 CLR 171 at p 176. Food, whether ordinary or exceptional to meet taxpayer needs, may be essential for a 1 McGechan J’s decision in Hunter relating to relocation expenses was overturned by the Court of Appeal in Hunter v CIR (1990) 12 NZTC 7,169 on the basis that the expenditure was incurred solely for the purpose of, and as a condition of, employment and there was no private or domestic element. However, the Court of Appeal did not dispute the law applied by McGechan J and did not discuss meal expenses (as McGechan J had in the High Court). As such, the discussion from the High Court judgment is still usefully retained for his Honour’s comments on meal expenses. IS 21/06 | 7 July 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 7 of 36 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] taxpayer to earn, but is regarded as in the personal or domestic category; eg Case K82 (1988) 10 NZTC 648 \[also known as TRA Case 35 (1988) 12 TRNZ 444\] (distinguishing at NZTC p 650; NZLR p 446 business entertainment).... TRA cases on meal expenses 19. Meal expenses have specifically been dealt with by the TRA in a number of cases. A good starting point is the decision of Judge Barber in Case E80 (1982) 5 NZTC 59,421. This decision undertook a comprehensive summary of the law relating to the deductibility of meal expenses. The taxpayer in question was an owner-driver of a furniture removal van who worked for a cartage contracting company. In undertaking his services, the taxpayer would at times have to stay overnight away from his home and take a number of meals “on the road”. The taxpayer claimed that the meals were necessary items of expenditure incurred in producing his income. 20. From page 59,424 onwards Judge Barber discussed a number of authorities from Australia, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand on the deductibility of meal expenses. The predominant theme from these cases was that meal expenses are non-deductible as a private expense. One exception (referred to in cases discussed at page 59,245) was the meal expenditure incurred in business entertaining. (This is discussed from \[71\] in the context of New Zealand’s statutory regime for entertainment expenditure in subpart DD.) 21. At pages 59,428 to 59,429 his Honour concluded: In my view there is no necessary relationship between the expenditure by O on meals and the earning of O's income. The meals were purchased by O in order to live and not to perform O's job. The expenditure was not incidental and relevant to the earning of income but was incidental and relevant to O's physical sustenance. Although the expenditure was made in the course of O's cartage jobs the expenditure was not in my view, made in the course of earning income. The expenditure was necessary for living rather than for earning income. Hence as a matter of degree I find that there is no sufficient relationship between the expenditure and what it provided and the income earning process. ... I find no grounds for distinguishing between meals eaten at home and meals eaten “out of town” except perhaps where extra cost is incurred due to the taxpayer being required by his employment to eat “out of town”. Although O stated in evidence that he was involved in extra cost when purchasing meals on his cartage trips, no evidence was given as to the amount or quantum of this extra cost. Nor was there any evidence that extra cost was incurred for the purpose of employment. IS 21/06 | 7 July 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 8 of 36 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] I can understand and accept that there may well have been extra cost. It seems to me that, despite some dicta to the contrary in the meal cases, there may well be a sufficient statutory nexus between the extra cost of such meals and the income earning process if the quantum of the extra cost could be proved. ... 22. Judge Barber referred to a possible sufficient nexus between the “extra cost” of some meals (due to their being eaten “out of town”) and the income earning process. This will be discussed later in relation to another TRA case (Case F117). Judge Barber’s comprehensive review of case law in Case E80 included discussion of a couple of earlier TRA cases where deductibility was also denied on the “private or domestic nature” ground – Case A12 (1974) 1 NZTC 60,088 and Case B14 (1975) 1 NZTC 60,108. In Case A12 a polytechnic tutor who was required to work late twice a week was refused deductibility of meal expenses for those nights he had to work late. Similarly, in Case B14 a lecturer (at both a polytechnic and a university) was required to work late a couple of nights per week (until 7.30pm). He was unable to claim meal expenses for those evenings. 23. Judge Barber again denied meal expenses to a taxpayer in Case P1 (1992) 14 NZTC 4,001. The taxpayer in this case was a member of an “informal partnership” of scriptwriters. The three members of the group would meet up, at the home of any one of them, to write a comedy script for a television programme. At around lunchtime they would travel to a restaurant where they would have (to quote Judge Barber) “a moderate amount of good food and wine”. The bill for the lunch was divided equally between them and the taxpayer was seeking to deduct his share of the bill for a number of these lunches. Part of the taxpayer’s argument was that if he had been at home working on his other writing commitments, he would have had a very modest lunch of negligible cost. 24. Judge Barber drew a careful distinction between the cost of meals to a person in their own capacity and the cost of meals incurred as entertainment expenditure. Where lunch costs were a cost of entertaining others (such as clients, customers, or employees) they might have been deductible entertainment expenditure 2 . In such a case the private benefit to the payer of the meals is regarded as incidental to the business purpose of the meal expenditure. But this was not an example of that. 25. At page 4,004 Judge Barber began his reasoning with a very strong statement of principle: Expenditure on food (or liquor) is not intrinsically non-deductible. However, expenditure on food for oneself, merely as sustenance, will always be private expenditure and non- 2 This case predated the 1993 introduction of the limitation on entertainment expenditure which is discussed from \[71\]. IS 21/06 | 7 July 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 9 of 36 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] deductible. Nevertheless, in the course of business or the seeking of income, there are many variations on the theme that expenditure on food (and wine or liquor) may assist business. This type of expenditure can usually be termed “entertainment expenditure”. It would be a misnomer to refer to the objector's expenditure as “entertainment expenditure”, because it was not spent to entertain anybody; but it seems to have been put to the respondent's Department under that concept. Entertainment expenditure, normally, is the cost to a taxpayer of entertaining others in the course of an income earning process for the genuine purpose of that process. 26. At pages 4,008 to 4,009 his Honour weighed up the conflicting arguments in favour and against deductibility and concluded that the lunches were not deductible: ...However, on reconsidering the evidence of the objector overall, I must find as a fact that, while the lunches did create an inspirational environment which greatly assisted the script writing activity and assisted the journalists to meet deadlines and time was not lost during lunch breaks, the actual expenditure on food and liquor was made by the objector journalist to nourish and relax himself as a human being. The fact that in the course of partaking that nourishment, and enjoying that relaxing period, he and his associates continued working does not convert private expenditure on food to business expenditure.... I appreciate the objector's evidence that the prime purpose of the meals was not to eat with business being incidental, but to continue business with the eating being incidental. In my view, the problem is still that the expenditure on food was not to facilitate business, but to refuel and relax as a human being. I accept that the lunches were a continuation of the working process but this does not convert private expenditure into business expenditure in this case. 27. In short, the expenditure was primarily for the sustenance of the taxpayer which is generally a matter of a private nature. There was an insufficient link to the taxpayer’s income earning process for deductibility. This is the general approach or position that Judge Barber took to meal expenses. However, there are a number of cases where he or other TRA judges found in favour of taxpayers being able to deduct meal expenses. Some of these are now discussed. IS 21/06 | 7 July 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 10 of 36 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 28. Case F117 (1984) 6 NZTC 60,125 concerned an actress who claimed, among other things, meal expenses. These meal expenses were described as “extra” expenses because of the hours of work or the requirements of her work. The actress’s film set was often in the countryside so that there was often only one available eating place with food at a higher price than normal. Judge Barber summarised the situation at page 60,129 saying that “often she must stay at hotels in other cities or in another country but due to irregular filming or rehearsal hours cannot be expected to find food away from the hotel”. Further: ...Her meal allowance is modest and she now seeks some of the excess cost over that allowance. Her point is that generally when seeking a meal late at night only the more expensive meals are available when she is working away from her home. Sometimes when working in home territory her preferred home meal is spoiled by unexpected and irregular work commitments. Accordingly late at night or during a short and irregular meal break, the only practical meal to obtain is one which costs more than the normal cost of living. 29. This context of meals being consumed “away from home” calls to mind Richardson J’s caveat in Haenga (at page 5,206). That was where His Honour said that to label the character of the activity as necessarily private may be misleading, for example meals obtained away from home. And Case F117 (a case involving meals obtained away from home), in allowing deductions for meals demonstrates that point. 30. At page 60,129 Judge Barber explained why he considered the claim was deductible; and in this context it was important that the claim was only for extra costs: ...I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the claim has been properly quantified by O's oral evidence that it relates only to extra food costs required by unusual working conditions. The claim for meals has been brought about by the circumstances under which O works as an actress. In my view there is a sufficient nexus in this case between excess expenditure on meals and O's income earning process. The only contrary approach could be that sustenance is caused by O being human, but this case involves the extra cost of sustenance caused by the nature of O's job... 31. His Honour considered that the case was consistent with his decision in Case E80. 32. The decision in Case F117 can therefore be explained on the basis that the expenditure in question (the “extra” expenditure) was only incurred as a result of the taxpayer’s income earning process and the peculiarities of her occupation. But for the demands or requirements of her occupation the taxpayer would not have been put to that extra cost for her meals. 33. A case where meal deductions were allowed, but which seems inconsistent with the cases previously discussed, is Case H82 (1986) 8 NZTC 567. This case involved a IS 21/06 | 7 July 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 11 of 36 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] university lecturer who attended a conference in Brisbane in his capacity as an employee of the university and attended another conference in Sydney in a separate capacity as a self-employed consultant. For the Brisbane conference his employer paid most of his expenses. However, for the Sydney conference he was obliged to pay his own expenses. These included an amount of $160 that he incurred in treating his friends (with whom he was staying) to dinner in appreciation of hospitality they had given him. 34. The TRA (Judge Moore) quickly found that the portion of the $160 that related to his friends’ meals was private expenditure and not deductible. But the taxpayer’s own meal expenses were in a different category. The taxpayer had argued that while he was away in Sydney at the conference his household expenses (including the cost of providing family meals) continued. At page 572 of the decision Judge Moore set out his understanding of the reason for the expenditure: The objector's expenditure on meals in the course of the Sydney conference was incurred not because the objector needed to eat but because he had good professional reasons for attending the conference and did so. Some of his work (from which he had derived income that year) was in a competition conducted in conjunction with the conference. Attendance at Sydney was not only normal participation in a professional conference but created an opportunity for the objector to exploit the business advantages inherent in having an entry in such a competition. Had the objector not attended the conference he would still have eaten but would not have had to incur the cost of meals in Sydney. 35. He drew a distinction between meal costs incurred in a taxpayer’s own home compared to meal costs incurred while living away from home for income earning purposes (at pages 572-3): Although it is not determinative it seems to me that there is a significant difference between a claim for the cost of meals consumed at a time when the taxpayer is living in his own home (albeit not eating there on the particular occasion) and the cost of meals incurred whilst temporarily living away from home for income earning purposes. Such a distinction would not necessarily assist a taxpayer who has jobs in two different places because in effect he may have taken on a commitment to have two sets of domestic expenditure. 36. His Honour also contrasted the treatment of a self-employed taxpayer with the position of an employee receiving an allowance, and also the anomalous or unreal consequences of denying the deduction to the taxpayer: \[page 573\] Meal allowances, that is payments to employees of fixed sums of money when more than certain hours are worked, such payments being for the purpose of enabling the IS 21/06 | 7 July 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 12 of 36 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] employee to purchase a meal, have long been accepted by the respondent as non- taxable allowances. If expenditure on meals were always of a private or domestic nature the non-taxable nature of such allowances would be difficult to justify. It is not a situation in which an employer pays for something (eg, the costs of shifting house) that would be private expenditure if the employee paid. Meal allowances are provided for in many industrial awards and are a cash payment. There is no requirement that the employee actually use such an allowance to purchase a meal. \[page 574\] It does not necessarily follow that the rules for self-employed taxpayers are or should be the same as those for employees. There are many distinctions, some of which might be seen to favour one group, some the other. In the context of the general proposition that the cost of meals must always be an expense of a private or domestic nature, the treatment within the scope of the taxation system of payments to employees for meals is relevant. Recently fringe benefit tax has been introduced to cope with what were seen as some undesirable aspects of the provision of tax-free benefits for employees but that is not a matter which need concern me here, apart from noting that the legislation has not prohibited the provision of various tax-free benefits to employees but has imposed a particular form of tax on the employer. I am satisfied that the objector is correct when he refers to the treatment of his claim as being anomalous in the context of the conferences he attended. A self-employed person is in one sense an employee and an employer in the same person. The proposition that such a person can go to a conference with a member of his staff, they have a meal together, the employer pays for both, the employee's meal is tax deductible but the employer's meal is not, seems to me to have a degree of commercial unreality which is approaching the comic. Many persons who are in reality self-employed operate through the medium of small private companies and so avoid this particular type of problem. 37. His Honour concluded that the taxpayer’s share of meal costs in relation to the Sydney conference were deductible. The costs were a part of the expenditure incurred in gaining or producing the taxpayer’s taxable income. The difficulty with this case is that it is contrary to the earlier TRA decision of Case E80. It is also a challenging case as, unlike the taxpayer in Case F117, the extra expense of meals (at the restaurant) was not imposed on the taxpayer by the circumstance of his work but by his own decision to treat his friends to dinner as a sign of appreciation for their hospitality. 38. Another decision that allowed deductibility but, with respect, seems out of step with most of the case law, is Judge Barber’s decision in Case T16 (1997) 18 NZTC 8,095. In this case, a couple shifted to a new city where they bought a new home. They retained their former home which they rented out. In carrying out their rental activity, they travelled back to their former city of residence to find a suitable tenant. The visits included cleaning and maintaining the property, selecting tenants, and acquiring IS 21/06 | 7 July 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 13 of 36 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] furniture for them. They claimed various expenses in doing so, including meals and accommodation. The Commissioner did not dispute the deduction of accommodation costs but did deny the meal expenses. 39. The Commissioner’s counsel referred to earlier decisions of Judge Barber in Case E80 and Case P1 as support for denying the deduction of meal expenses. However, his Honour allowed the expenditure and put forward the treatment of the accommodation expenses as one of the reasons for this result. At page 8,099 he said: I note that the respondent did not dispute deductibility for the associated cost of accommodation for the objector and members of his family. Those accommodation expenses related to the said trips to the first city in connection with the letting activity and were incurred on the same dates as the respective meal expenses. Presumably, the respondent's rationale is that the accommodation expenditure would not have been incurred unless overnight travel had been undertaken in the course of the letting activity. It seems to me that such a rationale must also apply to the meal expenditure. Also, it seems rather pinpricking to, somehow, calculate what the cost of the relevant meals for the objector (and, where appropriate, his wife and/or daughter) might have been at their home in the second city and then deduct that from the sum to be deducted for meal expenditure. I think that aspect is de minimis but may have some significance regarding the partaking of alcohol — although there is a large mark-up in the cost of alcohol in a restaurant or hotel compared with cost for home consumption. 40. On the same page he further explained why he considered the meal expenses had a sufficient link to the income earning process to be deductible: It seems to me that had it not been necessary for the objector (with family members) to travel to the first property to deal with its maintenance and letting, then the meal expenditure would not have been incurred. To put the matter another way, it seems to me that the meal expenditure is sufficiently linked with the letting business, or the income earning process of letting, to be a part of the overall letting activity and therefore deductible as a revenue expense of the gaining of rent. 41. This reasoning is, with respect, not convincing. To say the meal expenditure would not have been incurred in the absence of the need to travel to the rental property is out of step with the case law that has found meal expenses to be an outgoing exclusively referable to living as an individual member of society. It appears that Judge Barber has focused solely on whether the general permission was satisfied without considering whether the private limitation applied. 42. There is arguably a distinction between accommodation expenditure and meal expenditure in the circumstances of this case. Accommodation, in the sense of the person’s home, is essentially a fixed cost that is incurred irrespective of the use of the home. Costs such as mortgage repayments and interest, local authority rates, IS 21/06 | 7 July 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 14 of 36 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] insurance premiums, fixed daily costs for energy connections (etc) mean that a person has a daily cost in owning a home (a similar analysis applies for persons who rent a home). Therefore, where a person has to travel for an income earning process and incurs accommodation expenditure (such as hotel or motel accommodation) then that cost is in addition to the existing cost of accommodation the person is incurring for their home. In the absence of the travel for the income earning process the extra accommodation costs would not have been incurred. 43. Meals are different. A meal consumed in a location different to the person’s usual place of residence is consumed in substitution for the meal they would have consumed in their usual location. For example, if a family is on holiday staying in a motel and prepares and consumes their evening meal at that place, it is not necessarily an additional cost incurred over and above the cost of the meal being prepared in their usual location. This is because a meal in their usual location is not being prepared and consumed at all. Another way of describing it (contrary to the view of Judge Barber in Case T16) is that the meal expenditure would have been incurred even if overnight travel had not been required for the income earning activities. In the example here, the family would have had to eat wherever they were based. T he nature of meals being inherently private does not seem to have been considered. 44. Even in the case of accommodation there is analogous TRA case authority to the effect that accommodation would not be deductible, contrary to the decision in Case T16. See, for example, Case G57 (1987) 7 NZTC 1,251 where short-term accommodation expenditure incurred to allow a taxpayer to attend to his mussel farm was not deductible. Also in Case M128 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,825 longer-term accommodation expenditure incurred by a taxpayer working away from his family home in a different location was not deductible. In both cases meals consumed while away from home were also non-deductible. 45. However, case law provides for the possibility of deductions where the circumstances of the income earning process mean the taxpayer incurs extra costs over and above normal. Case F117 is an example of this. Another possible example could be where a taxpayer has limited accommodation options. Perhaps the only reasonable accommodation in the vicinity of the location of the income-earning process is not self-catering or is not near a supermarket such that it is not realistic to expect a person to be able to prepare their own meals. In such a case the costs of purchasing meals may be greater than normal and therefore the extra cost deductible. 46. The sorts of factors which would lead to the deductibility (in whole or in part) of meal expenses requires some sort of objective justification. The taxpayer’s personal preference will not be enough. For example, choosing to stay in a hotel without self- catering facilities (and thus having to pay for purchased meals) when other accommodation options are available will not be enough. So too, choosing not to IS 21/06 | 7 July 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 15 of 36 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] prepare a person’s own meal just because they are away from their home is not sufficient reason of itself to make a meal deductible. There must be something external to the taxpayer imposing these extra costs of the sorts discussed in the previous paragraph. In this context it is considered that the decision in Case T16, to the extent it suggests anything to the contrary, is out of step with the earlier court and TRA decisions. 47. The deductibility of meal expenses by self-employed persons, as can be seen from the above discussion, is not affected by whether the travel is “travel on business”. Perhaps obviously if the travel was not related to the business there would be no deductibility – it would just be private travel. But even “travel on business” is not enough to give rise to deductibility of meals by the self-employed except in the limited circumstances discussed above. Summary of the law on deductibility of meal expenses 48. In general, meal expenses incurred by a self-employed person are non-deductible because they are of a private or domestic nature. The only exception for which there is convincing authority (Haenga in conjunction with Case F117) is where the income earning process of the taxpayer requires extra meal expenses in which case that extra element will be deductible. It is considered that case law suggesting any wider deductibility, particularly TRA cases Case H82 and Case T16, are inconsistent with the higher authority. Allowances and other employee-type considerations 49. As discussed above (at paragraph 36), the TRA in Case H82 seemed strongly influenced to allow deductibility for meals of a self-employed person by looking at the tax treatment of the meal expenses incurred by persons other than self-employed persons. In that case Judge Moore looked at the treatment of employees receiving allowances or having a meal purchased for them by their employer. He also considered a person operating through a “small private” company who is “in reality self-employed”. Given these factors influenced the TRA in Case H82 they are worth considering here. Allowances 50. In Case H82 meal allowances (paid in circumstances where more than certain hours were worked) were said to have been long accepted by the Commissioner as non- taxable allowances. The Act now exempts a number of types of meal allowances. Section CW 17C(1) provides that an amount an employer pays to or on behalf of an employee for a meal when the employee is working overtime is exempt income. IS 21/06 | 7 July 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 16 of 36 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] CW 17C Payments for overtime meals and certain other allowances Exempt income: overtime meals (1) An amount that an employer pays to or on behalf of an employee for a meal for the employee when the employee is working overtime is exempt income of the employee. 51. Section CW 17C(2) exempts certain sustenance allowances but this subsection is relatively narrow and can be left out of the discussion here. 52. Section CW 17CB(1) provides that when the employment duties of an employee require them to work away from their employer’s workplace, expenditure that the employer incurs for or on behalf of the employee for a meal for the employee is exempt income. “Expenditure” includes a reimbursement payment or a meal allowance. CW 17CB Payments for certain work-related meals Exempt income When the employment duties of an employee require them to work away from their employer’s workplace, expenditure that the employer incurs for or on behalf of the employee for a meal for the employee is exempt income of the employee. For these purposes, expenditure includes a reimbursement payment or a meal allowance. Inclusions: work-related events For the purposes of subsection (1), a meal includes— (a) food and drink that the employee consumes as part of a working meal arranged as part of or as an alternative to a formal meeting for business discussions: (b) food and drink that the employee consumes at a conference or training course: (c) light refreshments in the form of snack foods such as biscuits and fruit, or liquid refreshments such as tea, coffee, water, or similar refreshments, provided for the employee, but only if— (i) their employment duties require them to be away from their employment base for most of the day; and (ii) the employer would normally provide the refreshments to the employee on the day; and (iii) it is not practicable for the employer to provide the refreshments on the day. IS 21/06 | 7 July 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 17 of 36 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Inclusions: meals when travelling on business For the purposes of subsection (1), a meal also includes food and drink that the employee consumes when their employment duties require them to travel in the performance of those duties. 53. The remainder of s CW 17CB provides the detailed rules around this, including what is meant by a “meal” (s CW 17CB(2)) and meals when travelling on business (s CW 17CB(3)). 54. “Meals” includes, by virtue of s CW 17CB(2)(c), light refreshments in the form of snack foods such as biscuits and fruit, or liquid refreshments such as tea, coffee, water, or similar refreshments, provided for the employee, but only if:  their employment duties require them to be away from their employment base for most of the day; and  the employer would normally provide the refreshments to the employee on the day; and  it is not practicable for the employer to provide the refreshments on the day. 55. Section CW 17CB(3) provides that, for the purposes of subsection (1), a meal also includes food and drink that the employee consumes when their employment duties require them to travel in the performance of those duties. 56. Section CW 17CB(5) provides that the time limit for such meal expenses is a maximum of three months, except for expenditure under subsection (2) (light and liquid refreshments) where there is no such limit. The implication is that a wide range of expenditure on meals can be paid or reimbursed by an employer tax-free to their employee when the employee is required to work away from their employer’s workplace. The only limit is the three-month maximum for an employee working away from their employer’s workplace. 57. The expenses incurred by the employer in such circumstances would be deductible expenditure to the employer under s DA 1. Furthermore, s CX 5(1) provides that to the extent to which a benefit that an employer provides to an employee in connection with their employment is exempt income, the benefit is not a fringe benefit. CX 5 Relationship with exempt income Exempt income not fringe benefit To the extent to which a benefit that an employer provides to an employee in connection with their employment is exempt income, the benefit is not a fringe benefit. IS 21/06 | 7 July 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 18 of 36 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 58. As a result of these provisions it is important in the employer/employee context to know what it means to be working away from an employer’s workplace, and what it is to travel in the performance of an employee’s duties. 59. Inland Revenue has two published items of particular relevance to the question of travel “on work”. The first is IS3448 Travel by motor vehicle between home and work – deductibility of expenditure and FBT implications (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 16, No 10 (November 2004)). The second is Operational Statement OS19/05 Employer-provided travel from home to a distant workplace – income tax (PAYE) and fringe benefit tax (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32, No 1 (February 2020)). Neither of these statements concerns the treatment of meal expenses but they do address whether travel between home and work is private travel/expenditure or business/work-related travel/ expenditure. These concepts are relevant for the purposes of the exemptions in s CW 17CB. The law is well summarised at paragraphs 19 to 24 of the 2019 Operational Statement: 19. The general rule is that home-to -work travel is private expenditure as it is expenditure to get to work and reflects the employee’s personal choice as to their home location. The two main reasons for this rule are that the: • cost of home-to -work travel is predominantly determined by the private choices of the employee (where to live, how to get to work); • expense of commencing work is distinguished from expenses while “on work”, and employees are expected to bear the cost of commencing work. 20. This means the starting point is that employer-provided travel from home to work is private expenditure and would not be deductible to the employee (if employees could claim deductions). This is the case even if the employee’s travel is funded by the employer or the employee’s attendance at the workplace is required by the employer. 21. The courts have recognised exceptions to this general rule. The cases relating to deductibility of travel expenditure between home and work have identified four broad factual situations where travel between home and work is regarded as business or work-related travel. These situations are where: • a vehicle is essential for transporting goods or equipment necessary for the performance of employment duties at the home and elsewhere; • the taxpayer carries on an “itinerant occupation” (that is, the taxpayer does not work from a fixed work place, and the home is the taxpayer’s base of operations; IS 21/06 | 7 July 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 19 of 36 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] • the taxpayer is required to be accessible at their home for employment duties and is required to undertake travel in response to emergency calls; • the travel is “on work” travel between two workplaces, one of which is also the taxpayer’s home. 22. It can be seen from the cases that for home-to -work travel to be deductible, the employee must actually undertake work at home. 23. It is not sufficient to establish that the home is or can be a workplace. For expenditure to be deductible, the need for the work to be performed at the home, and, therefore, the need for the travel, must arise from the nature of the work and not from the personal choice or personal circumstances of the taxpayer. 24. In addition, the actual travel must be travel undertaken in the course of performing work (that is, the travel is “on work”). If that is the case, then the cost of that travel is not private expenditure of the employee; rather, it is expenditure that would be deductible if employees were not otherwise prevented from claiming deductions. This means the employer does not have to deduct PAYE in respect of the reimbursement or allowance, and the employee is not liable for income tax on the payments. (Emphasis added.) 60. Much of this material is not of direct relevance because the deductibility of meals is not concerned with home to work travel. But the associated notion of travelling “on work” is definitely relevant. What is meant by travel “on work” was discussed at pages 35 to 36 of IS3448 in the November 2004 TIB. The interpretation statement says that the four exceptions to the non-deductibility of travel between home and work relate to situations where travel can be regarded, in some sense, as travel in the course of performing work rather than travel in order to commence work or travel from work. 61. The interpretation statement summarises the general position around travel “on work” at page 36: Therefore, generally travel from a taxpayer’s home to the taxpayer’s place of work (or to make the first business call of the day) and travel between the last business call of the day and the home would be private use, being travel to enable the taxpayer to commence work or after work has finished. Travel between the place where the first business call is made and the taxpayer’s work base, or to make subsequent business calls, would be business use, being travel in the course of performing work. IS 21/06 | 7 July 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 20 of 36 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 62. Operational Statement OS19/05 also specifically covers one-off or very occasional travel: One-off or very occasional travel 43. Inland Revenue considers that one-off or very occasional travel from home to a distant location for work (when required by the employer) can be treated as not taxable on an incidental or de minimis basis. For example, attendance at a two- day conference at a distant location. 44. This approach will apply to employees who work at an office of their employer located in their hometown as well as employees who work all the time from their home. 63. Accordingly, an employee travelling on his or her employer’s business who receives a meal allowance or reimbursement is treated as receiving exempt income, and such an amount is not a fringe benefit. The employer can still deduct the cost of the allowance or reimbursement as a business expense. 64. This is in contrast to the treatment of the same type of expense incurred by a self- employed person (except in the limited circumstances discussed above for the previous issue). 65. The other two circumstances considered by Judge Moore in Case H82 are discussed next (as mentioned above at paragraph 49). Employer paying for meals for themselves and an employee 66. The first of these was the case of an employer paying for a meal for himself or herself and for an employee, when working away from their home base, and only being able to take a deduction for the meal expense of the employee and not their own meal. Judge Moore described this as having “a degree of commercial unreality which is approaching the comic”. 67. As a matter of legal principle these different treatments are not anomalous. One is an expense incurred on an employee, and like wages or salary and other employee expenses, has a nexus with their business; s DA 1(1)(b)(i). The other expense is the employer’s own personal meal expense which has regularly been found to be of a private or domestic nature. Closely-held companies 68. The second circumstance considered by Judge Moore in Case H82 was a case of a “self-employed” person operating through a “private company”. His Honour thought IS 21/06 | 7 July 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 21 of 36 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] that “many persons who are in reality self-employed operate through the medium of small private companies and so avoid this particular type of problem”. By this it is assumed that Judge Moore meant that the company was able to deduct the cost of meals it reimburses for an “employee” (the person who is “in reality” self-employed). 69. Again, as with the first circumstance, as a matter of legal principle the difference between a self-employed person and an incorporated closely-held company is not anomalous. The company is a separate entity and expenditure it incurs in paying employee expenses has a nexus with their business; s DA 1(1)(b)(i). The fact that the company is in effect the alter ego of a self-employed person who has incorporated their activity is not relevant as a matter of legal principle. 70. It is noted that although the company can take a deduction for the cost of allowances or the provision of meals, the payment of an allowance to an employee or the provision of a meal may be taxable income to the employee or subject to FBT (as the case may be). Even where expenditure is deductible to the company, the requirements discussed above for exempting income or being outside of the scope of FBT still must be satisfied. This does not extend to private meal expenditure unconnected to work. 71. If the company is a look-through company under subpart HB of the Act then the income and expenses of the company are treated as the income and expenses of the owners of the look-through company (ss CB 32B and DV 22 of the Act). This means that a deduction for meal expenditure allowed to a “normal” company would most likely not be allowed as a deduction for the owner of a look-through interest in a look- through company as it would be private in nature. Entertainment Expenditure 72. The other issue referred to in the TRA cases is the question of entertainment expenditure. The treatment of entertainment expenditure is covered by subpart DD of the Act. The regime was originally enacted as s 106G of the Income Tax Act 1976 with general application from 1 April 1993. DD 1 Entertainment expenditure generally When this subpart applies This subpart applies when, in deriving income, a person incurs expenditure on entertainment that provides both a private and a business benefit. No deduction (with exception) IS 21/06 | 7 July 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 22 of 36 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] The person is denied a deduction for expenditure that they incur on the forms of entertainment set out in section DD 2, except for 50% of the amount that they would have been allowed in the absence of this subsection. Meaning of limitation rule Limitation rule means the rule described in subsection (2). Link with subpart DA This section overrides the general permission. 73. Section DD 1(1) sets out the basic principle of the regime which relates to when, in deriving income, a person incurs expenditure on entertainment that provides both a private and a business benefit. The “limitation rule” is described in s DD 1(2). A person is denied a deduction for expenditure they incurred on entertainment set out in s DD 2 except for 50 percent of the amount they would have been allowed in the absence of the subsection. This requires that the expenditure would meet the general permission in section DA 1 by having a sufficient nexus to deriving income or carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving income. 74. In Case P1 (which was decided before the entertainment expenditure regime was enacted), Judge Barber discussed the deductibility of entertainment expenditure as a general proposition. This is relevant because the limitation rule applies to the expenditure that the taxpayer would have been able to deduct in the absence of s DD 1(2). At pages 4,008-9 his Honour said: Obviously, it would only require fairly minor adjustments to the facts to create deductibility. For instance, if it had been necessary or appropriate for the journalists to entertain others as they partook these luncheons, that cost would have been deductible entertainment expenditure. Then, they would probably have been unable to progress their script writing work because they would have been devoted to the entertainment and promotion of other business aspects. Strictly speaking, even in that entertainment situation, the normal cost of the taxpayer's own meal, whatever “normal cost” might be, is an ingredient of the expenditure which is non- deductible. In practice, that element is not normally isolated, presumably, because even the respondent regards it as de minimis. Also, it would hardly be worthwhile for the respondent to deny deductibility to the payer of the expenditure in that respect, because the respondent would need to isolate that taxpayer's own meal expenditure and then apportion it between his (or her) normal luncheon expenditure and the excess on each occasion for which deductibility is sought. As I said in the above extracts from Case K82, any private benefit to the payer is regarded as incidental to the business purposes of the meal expenditure. (Emphasis added.) IS 21/06 | 7 July 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 23 of 36 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 75. This suggests that a strict legal approach would be to remove a self-employed person’s meal expenditure before applying the 50% limitation on expenditure. However, Judge Barber commented that the practice was not to isolate this element of the expenditure because it is de minimis. It also might be considered a double exclusion of the private element of expenditure. That is, if the TRA were to exclude the taxpayer’s own meal expenditure in such a situation on the basis of the private limitation, and then apply the limitation rule to the remaining expenditure (and the limitation rule is designed to exclude the private benefit of entertainment expenditure) then they would have, in a sense, excluded the private benefit of meals twice. However, it must be acknowledged that there is a level of uncertainty about this in the legislation. 76. Section DD 1(4) provides that s DD 1 overrides the general permission. That is, even if the general permission had been satisfied by the entertainment expenditure it will be denied (to the extent of 50%) based on the limitation rule in subpart DD. 77. Section DD 2 describes the expenditure to which the limitation rule applies. It includes corporate boxes, holiday accommodation, pleasure craft, food and drink expenditure off premises, and food and drink expenditure on premises in certain circumstances (which are more limited compared to food and drink expenditure off premises). DD 2 Limitation rule ... Entertainment off premises The limitation rule applies to deductions for expenditure on food and drink that a person provides off their business premises. Entertainment on premises The limitation rule applies to deductions for expenditure on food and drink that a person provides, other than light refreshments such as a morning tea and whether or not guests are present,— (a) on their business premises at a celebration meal, party, reception, or other similar social function: (b) in an area of the premises that at the time is reserved for senior employees to use and is not open to all the person’s employees working in the premises. 78. Section DD 4(1) provides that the limitation rule does not apply to a deduction for expenditure on food and drink consumed by a person while travelling on business or for their employment duties. However, there are limits to this exclusion. IS 21/06 | 7 July 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 24 of 36 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] DD 4 Employment-related activities Business travel expenditure The limitation rule does not apply to a deduction for expenditure on food or drink consumed by a person while travelling in the course of business or for their employment duties. However, the limitation rule applies if— (a) the travel is mainly for the purpose of enjoying entertainment; or (b) the food or drink is consumed at a meal or function involving an existing or potential business contact as a guest; or (c) the food or drink is consumed at a celebration meal, party, reception, or other similar social function. 79. Section DD 4(3) provides that the limitation rule does not apply to a deduction for expenditure of an amount that is exempt income under ss CW 17B, CW 17C, and CW 17CB (the latter two of which have been dealt with above). 80. Section DD 4(1) refers to the limitation rule not applying to a deduction for expenditure on food or drink consumed by a person while travelling on business (subject to the condition set out in paragraphs (a) to (c) of s DD 4(1)). It is arguable this may extend to a self-employed person, as they can be travelling in the course of business. However, even if s DD 4 did apply such that the limitation rule did not apply to the self-employed person, they still face the difficulty of having to overcome the private limitation. 81. It is difficult to draw much guidance from the treatment of entertainment expenditure. It might be said that it would be anomalous to allow a 50 percent deduction of entertainment expense where a person (other than a self-employed person) incurs entertainment expenditure, but only allow 50 percent of the net entertainment expenditure (that is, entertainment expenses less private or domestic expenditure) when a self-employed person incurs the expenditure. This might be seen as denying private expenditure twice. However, s DA 2(2) denies private expenditure and s DA 2(7) provides that each of the general limitations in s DA 2 override the general permission. Therefore, any potential deduction in s DA 1 is overridden either by the private limitation or by the limitation rule in subpart DD (and see s DD 1(4) too). Goods and Services Tax 82. The GST input tax treatment of the meal expenses of the self-employed person follows the income tax deductibility of such expenses. That is, where it was concluded that the IS 21/06 | 7 July 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 25 of 36 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] meal expenses were of a private or domestic nature for income tax purposes, and non- deductible, input tax on the expenses would also not be deductible for GST purposes. 83. The deductibility of input tax for GST purposes is dependent on at least three things 3 :  There is an amount of “input tax” as defined in s 3A of the GST Act;  The person is a registered person for GST purposes, which requires they have a taxable activity; and  Being able to satisfy the test in s 20(3C) of the GST Act. 3A Meaning of input tax Input tax, in relation to a registered person, means— (a) tax charged under section 8(1) on a supply of goods or services acquired by the person: (b) tax levied under section 12(1) on goods entered for home consumption under the Customs and Excise Act 2018 by the person: (c) an amount determined under subsection (3) after applying subsection (2). 84. For there to be “input tax” for a registered person in the usual case of s 3A(1)(a), means there must be “tax charged under s 8(1) on a supply of goods and services acquired by the person”. This would very often be the case for meal expenses as most suppliers of meals would be registered persons who will be charging GST. 85. The self-employed person must be a registered person in order to deduct input tax. 20 Calculation of tax payable ... Subject to this section, in calculating the amount of tax payable in respect of each taxable period, there shall be deducted from the amount of output tax of a registered person attributable to the taxable period— (a) in the case of a registered person who is required to account for tax payable on an invoice basis pursuant to section 19, the amount of the following: (i) input tax in relation to the supply of goods and services (not being a supply of secondhand goods to which section 3A(1)(c) of the input tax definition applies), made to that registered person during that taxable period: 3 There are also administration requirements like holding a valid tax invoice (see s 20 of the GST Act). IS 21/06 | 7 July 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 26 of 36 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] (ia) input tax in relation to the supply of secondhand goods to which section 3A(1)(c) of the input tax definition applies, to the extent that a payment in respect of that supply has been made during that taxable period: (ii) input tax invoiced or paid, whichever is the earlier, pursuant to section 12 during that taxable period: (iii) any amount calculated in accordance with any one of sections 25(2)(b), 25(5), 25AA(2)(b) or 25AA(3)(b); and ... (3C) For the purposes of subsection (3), and if subsections (3D) or (3L) do not apply,— (a) input tax as defined in section 3A(1)(a) or (c) may be deducted to the extent to which the goods or services are used for, or are available for use in, making taxable supplies: (b) input tax as defined in section 3A(1)(b) may be deducted to the extent to which the goods are used for, or are available for use in, making taxable supplies other than— (i) the delivery of the goods to a person in New Zealand: (ii) arranging or making easier the delivery of the goods to a person in New Zealand. 86. The test in s 20(3C) is that, for the purposes of s 20(3) of the GST Act, input tax may be deducted to the extent to which the goods or services are used for, or are available for use in, making taxable supplies. Consuming meals in one’s private capacity is not using goods or services in making taxable supplies. 87. The TRA case of Case P5 (1992) 14 NZTC 4,034 supports the view that input tax cannot be claimed for goods to the extent that they have been acquired for private or domestic use. Case P5 concerned the old “principal purpose” test for deducting input tax 4 . However, the TRA’s analysis at page 4,037 can also be applied to the new test for deducting input tax: The essential problem faced by the objector, in my view, is that his main use of the vehicle was to travel from his home on the farm to his chartered accountancy practice. There can be no doubt that such type of travel is not in the course of any business or taxable activity, but is for the purpose of getting the objector from his home to his office as a chartered accountant. The law is clear that the nature of such travel is private rather than business. This is because the travel is not in the 4 “Input tax” meant the tax charged on the supply of goods and services made to a person where those goods and services were acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. IS 21/06 | 7 July 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 27 of 36 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] course of any business but is aimed at conveying a person to the site where his business activity will commence that day. (Emphasis added.) 88. At page 4,038 the TRA concluded as follows: I find that the vehicle was not used for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies, and, therefore, in this case, was not acquired for that purpose. Accordingly, the input claimed is not allowable. 89. Although the case relates to the previous test for “input tax” (an all or nothing test for the initial deduction of “input tax”) the conclusion would also support the view that private use of goods or services would not be used for making taxable supplies. 90. In the limited circumstances where meal expenses are deductible, on the basis the expenses are not of a private or domestic nature, then similar reasoning would allow for GST input tax deductions. That is, if the meal expenses satisfy the general permission as being incurred in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income, then the goods or services are used for making taxable supplies. Such circumstances are relatively rare. 91. If the meal expenditure is subject to the entertainment expenditure regime, then the person is deemed to have supplied entertainment with a value equal to the amount of the deduction prevented under ss DD 1 and DD 2: ss 21I(4), (4B) and (5) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. This effectively means that input tax is only allowed to the extent that the entertainment expenditure regime does not apply. IS 21/06 | 7 July 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 28 of 36 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Examples 92. The following examples are intended to show how the law applies. Example 1 – Meal expenses of self-employed persons Rob is a self-employed engineer who specialises in repairing and maintaining complex machinery and manufacturing premises. He is based in Auckland, where most of his work takes place, but he also regularly travels up to Northland and down to the Waikato and Bay of Plenty to undertake specialist repairs. On occasions he has travelled further afield when required. Rob has a small office/workshop where he stores spare parts and consumables, and where his wife works doing the admin work for the business. The office has enough space for tea and coffee facilities and a microwave. Variation 1 – Travel around town Rob has a busy day travelling between three client sites in South Auckland, which is a fair distance from his office on the North Shore. As a result, he does not return to his office/workshop from the beginning of the day until the end of the day as it is not practical to do so. During the day, he buys takeaway coffee on a couple of occasions and also picks up lunch from a bakery near to where he is working. Rob asks if he can claim his coffee and lunch expenses as they were incurred in undertaking his income- earning process. Rob is unable to deduct his expenses as they are expenses of a private and domestic nature. Consistent with Case E80 and Case P1 these expenses were incurred to enable Rob to live rather than to earn income in the required statutory sense for s DA 1(1). The requirements of the job did not impose expenditure on Rob that would not have existed but for the job. Variation 2 – Travel on business The next day Rob has two jobs lined up in Rotorua. Due to the distance it takes to get to Rotorua and back, and the length of time taken to undertake the work, Rob does not make it back to Auckland until 9pm. As well as picking up a couple of cups of coffee and lunch (as in Variation 1) Rob eats his evening meal in Rotorua rather than waiting to get home. He asks whether any of his meal and drinks expenses are deductible. Again, Rob is unable to deduct these expenses as they are expenses of a private and domestic nature. They relate to living as an individual member of society (Haenga), IS 21/06 | 7 July 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 29 of 36 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] and both Case A12 and Case B14 support non-deductibility. However, as Judge Barber recognized in Case E80, extra costs may be incurred when a taxpayer is required by their work to eat “out of town”. Evidence will need to be provided to indicate that such extra costs had been incurred and the quantum of such costs. Variation 3 – Overnight travel on business The next week Rob has two days’ work in Hawkes Bay requiring him to stay a couple of nights away from home. He pays for breakfast at his motel, incurs expenditure on drinks and lunch during his working day, and eats out at a restaurant both nights he is away from his home. Is any of Rob’s expenditure deductible? On the face of it none of the meal and drinks expenditure is deductible because it is of a private and domestic nature. Rob may argue that being away from home has imposed an extra cost on him. However, his choosing to have his evening meal at a restaurant does not make Rob’s working conditions sufficiently unusual as described by Judge Barber in Case F117 when he said the taxpayer could claim extra food costs. The result is also consistent with the TRA decision in Case G57. Variation 4 – Remote travel on business A month later Rob is required to work for a couple of days on some machinery in a very remote part of New Zealand, where the only accommodation is not self-catering, and there are no supermarkets within reasonable travelling distance in any case. Rob is required to take his meals at the hotel he is staying at. Is any of Rob’s expenditure deductible? While the starting point is that meal expenditure is of a private and domestic nature, these circumstances are like those Judge Barber described in Case F117. Rob can argue that the cost of meals here reflects the extra food costs required by the unusual working conditions he finds himself in. The extra meal costs have a sufficient nexus with the earning of Rob’s income from fixing the machinery in the remote location, and there are no practical and realistic alternatives for accommodation and meals. Accordingly, the extra cost of the meals over and above Rob’s normal expenditure would be deductible. Rob calculates he would normally spend $15 on his evening meal, so any cost above this is deductible. Variation 5 – Employee expenses Rob employs Esther to help with the workload in his business. Esther has two days’ work in Hawkes Bay requiring her to stay a couple of nights away from home. Pursuant to the terms of her employment contract, Rob reimburses Esther for her meal IS 21/06 | 7 July 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 30 of 36 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] expenses and also pays her a daily amount for light and liquid refreshments. How should Rob treat the payments to Esther for meals? As an employee expense Rob, will be able to deduct the amounts he is obliged to pay Esther under the employment contract. The private limitation will not apply to this expenditure. Rob should also treat the payments to Esther as exempt income either under section CW 17CB(2) (for the light and liquid refreshments) or section CW 17CB(3) (for reimbursements for meals). Example 2 – Meal expenses of employees Darlene is also an engineer who specialises in repairing and maintaining complex industrial machinery. She is employed by Fix It Quik Limited. Her place of work is Fix It Quik Limited’s work premises in Upper Hutt, but most of her work is undertaken at the premises of the customers of Fix It Quik Limited. As such she only spends time at her work premises at the beginning and end of the day, and if she needs to pick up spare parts or consumables during the day. Variation 1 – employee allowances Darlene has a full day travelling between five client sites in Wellington, a good distance from Fix It Quik Limited’s office in Upper Hutt. She does not check back into the office until the end of her working day. During the day she has bought a couple of takeaway coffees, and also buys lunch at a lunch bar near where she is working. Fix It Quik Limited pays Darlene a daily allowance of $15.00 to cover the costs of “light refreshments” and “liquid refreshments” which she would be able to enjoy if she was working at Fix It Quik Limited’s premises. The payment is for those days when she is working off premises. How should Fix It Quik Limited and Darlene treat this payment? Section CW 17CB allows payments for certain work-related meals to be exempt income. The payment can include a reimbursement payment or a meal allowance. Under s CW 17CB(2)(c) a “meal” includes light refreshments in the form of snack foods such as biscuits and fruit, or liquid refreshments such as tea, coffee, water, or similar refreshments. Under s CW 17CB(5) there is no time limit on expenditure incurred for meals covered by s CW 17CB(2) (for other meals there is a three month time limit). Accordingly, for Darlene the daily payments received are exempt income. For Fix It Quik Limited the expenditure is deductible as an expense incurred in the course of carrying on a IS 21/06 | 7 July 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 31 of 36 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] business of deriving their assessable income (s DA 1(1)(b)). The private limitation does not apply to a company, so even though the expenditure relates to an employee’s “meals” the expenditure is not denied under the private limitation. Variation 2 – employee reimbursements The next day Darlene has two jobs in Taihape. Due to the distance to get to Taihape and back and the length of time taken to undertake the work, Darlene does not get back home until 9pm. As well as buying a couple of cups of coffee and lunch (as in Example 1, Variation 2) Darlene eats her evening meal in Palmerston North rather than waiting to get home. Fix It Quik Limited’s work policy is to cover all meal costs when employees are sent on such “out of town” jobs. How should Darlene and Fix It Quik Limited treat the reimbursement payments for meals, light refreshments, and liquid refreshments? For Darlene, as in Variation 1, any payments for coffee and light refreshments will be exempt income under s CW 17CB(2). The payment for lunch will be exempt income under s CW 17CB(3) (“meals when travelling on business”), and the payment for dinner is exempt income under either s CW 17C(1) (payment for overtime meals) or under s CW 17CB(3) for the same reason as the payment for lunch. For Fix It Quik Limited the expenditure is deductible for the same reasons as in Variation 1, and similarly the private limitation does not apply to deny the deduction. Variation 3 – employee travelling out of town on business The next week Darlene is sent to Timaru for two days (and two nights) to service and repair some machinery. While she is in Timaru she stays at a motel with full kitchen facilities. Fix It Quik Limited reimburses Darlene for her meals while she is in Timaru according to company policy, and also pays a daily amount for light refreshments and liquid refreshments. Darlene claims reimbursement for lunch and dinner, and she eats out rather than preparing her own meals at the motel. How should Darlene and Fix it Quik Limited treat the payments for meals, light refreshments, and liquid refreshments? For Darlene, as in Variations 1 and 2, any allowance she receives for coffee and light refreshments will be exempt income under s CW 17CB(2). The reimbursements for lunch and dinner will be exempt income under s CW 17CB(3). If Darlene is just working normal hours while in Timaru the payments she receives will not come within the rules for overtime meals under s CW 17C(1). For Fix It Quik Limited the expenditure is deductible for the same reasons as in Variations 1 and 2, and similarly the private limitation does not apply to deny the deduction. IS 21/06 | 7 July 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 32 of 36 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Variation 4 – employee’s remote travel on business A month later Darlene is required to spend a couple of nights on a remote offshore island to repair and maintain machinery. The only accommodation at the island is a luxury resort. There is no self-catering accommodation and no supermarkets on the island. Darlene is paid an allowance for light refreshments and liquid refreshments and is reimbursed for the cost of all meals. How should Darlene and Fix It Quik Limited treat the payments for meals, light refreshments, and liquid refreshments? There is no difference in this example from Variation 3. The reimbursing payments and allowances are exempt for Darlene and the payments are deductible to Fix It Quik Limited. Example 3 – Entertainment expenditure for self-employed Variation 1 – providing hospitality for clients Rob is finding that his market for machinery repair and maintenance in Auckland is under threat from a newcomer in the form of Fix It Quik Limited. Rob decides he needs to work harder on maintaining customer loyalty and begins taking the key people at his most important clients out to dinner. Every Wednesday night he takes one group out for dinner and drinks. Rob asks if he can claim a deduction for the expense of providing this hospitality to his clients. Rob’s deduction of expenses will be subject to the entertainment expenditure regime in subpart DD of the Act. The expenditure is covered by the regime by virtue of s DD 2(5) (deductions for expenditure on food and drink that a person provides off their business premises). The operative rule for entertainment expenditure is in s DD 1(2). This provides that the person is denied a deduction for expenditure that they incur on entertainment except for 50% of the amount that they would have been allowed in the absence of s DD 1(2). But for the entertainment expenditure rules Rob would have been allowed a deduction for the hospitality expenditure he has incurred (treating the private benefit of a meal to Rob as incidental to the business purpose, Case P1). Therefore, section DD 1(2) allows Rob to claim 50% of the full meal expenditure incurred in taking his clients out for dinner. If Rob had just been eating out by himself, he would not have been able to deduct any amount of the meal expenditure. It may seem anomalous that by eating out with business contacts he is, in effect, able to deduct 50% of his meal. However, the IS 21/06 | 7 July 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 33 of 36 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] limitation rule means that Rob is unlikely to be in a better overall position under the entertainment expenditure regime as he will be denied 50% of the deduction he would have otherwise been allowed for the expenditure incurred for his customers. Variation 2 – providing hospitality to friends On a Friday night Rob often gets together with a group of other self-employed persons from the business park where his office/workshop is located. They go to a local bar and have a few drinks and often a meal too. Rob’s friends Brent and Richard have been struggling financially recently as a result of a downturn in business so Rob shouts them a meal at the bar, and also pays for a round of drinks for them and the rest of the group. Rob asks if he can claim a deduction for the expense of providing these meals and drinks. He also asks if the entertainment expenditure regime applies. Rob cannot deduct the cost of providing meals to his two friends (and himself) and for shouting a round of drinks to the group. Such expenditure has no nexus to either deriving his income or to carrying on his business for the purpose of deriving income. It is a private expense and does not satisfy the general permission. As for the entertainment expenditure regime, because the expenditure would not have been allowed in the absence of section DD 1(2) there is no ability to claim 50% of the expenditure under that regime. Example 4 – Entertainment expenditure for employers Fix It Quik Limited realises that to break into the lucrative Auckland machinery repair market it needs to “wine and dine” the key people at certain industrial plants. Darlene is sent to Auckland to introduce herself to some of these key people and to take them out for dinner and drinks. Can Fix It Quik Limited deduct all the costs of the hospitality provided? The limitation rule in s DD 1(2) of the entertainment expenditure regime applies in the same way for Darlene and Fix It Quik Limited as it did for Rob in Example 3. The expenditure on the meals and drinks is entertainment expenditure under s DD 2(5) and only 50% of the expenditure is allowed by s DD 1(2). Section DD 4(1) provides that the limitation rule does not apply for expenditure on food or drink consumed by a person while travelling in the course of business or for their employment duty. However, the limitation rule continues to apply if, among other things, the food or drink is consumed at a meal or function involving an existing or potential business contact as a guest (s DD 4(1)(b)) as is the case here. This same principle applies for Rob in Example 3. IS 21/06 | 7 July 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 34 of 36 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Example 5 – Meal expenses of a shareholder-employee Meg and John are the only shareholders of Brooke’s Books Limited, a provider of bookkeeping services. Meg is employed by the company and often travels to conferences and seminars to promote the business. Pursuant to her employment agreement with the company, she is entitled to reimbursement for her meal expenses while away from home on company business and is also entitled to a daily allowance for light refreshments and liquid refreshments. On Meg’s most recent business trip to a conference, John also attends to get a better idea of what occurs at these type of events and the company pays for all his meal expenses as well. John is not an employee of the company and is not related to Meg. How should Brooke’s Books Limited treat the payments it makes to Meg and John for their meals? As Meg is genuinely undertaking her employment duties for Brooke’s Books Limited, the treatment of her expenditure would be the same as the treatment of Darlene in Variation 3 of Example 2. That is, the allowance for light and liquid refreshments can be treated as exempt income of Meg under section CW 17CB(2), and the reimbursements for meals will be exempt income under section CW 17CB(3). The amounts paid will be deductible to Brooke’s Books Limited and the private limitation will not apply. In John’s case none of the exempt allowance provisions can apply as John is not an employee of the company. Instead, the payment of John’s meal expenses by the company is likely to give rise to a non-cash or ‘deemed’ dividend (see interpretation statement IS 21/05: Non-cash dividends, paragraph 20 and example 5, for more discussion of this issue).

They may address specific situations we have been asked to provide guidance on, or they may be about how legislative provisions apply more generally. While they set out the Commissioner’s considered views, Interpretation Statements are not binding on the Commissioner. However, taxpayers can generally rely on them in determining their tax affairs. See further Status of Commissioner’s advice (December 2012). It is important to note that a general similarity between a taxpayer’s circumstances and an example in an Interpretation Statement will not necessarily lead to the same tax result.

UNCLASSIFIED Page 1 of 7 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] FACT SHEET Interpretation Statement for Content Creators IS 21/08 FS 1 This Fact Sheet accompanies Interpretation Statement IS 21/08 . What is the Interpretation Statement about? The statement is to help content creators get their tax obligations right from the start. Content creation is a dynamic and evolving industry, and content-creation customers may be unsure whether they need to pay tax. Who are content creators? Content creators are online gamers, streamers, bloggers, influencers and other creators of online content. Income Income can come from a wide variety of sources, including:  payments from platforms based on the number of times content is viewed;  subscriptions;  payments for promoting products or brands in a content creator’s online content;  payments for advertisements embedded in the online content;  commissions earned from affiliate marketing and links;  sales of merchandise; IS 21/08 FS 1 | 28 September 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 2 of 7 \[UNCLASSIFIED\]  donations or gifts (including non-monetary gifts); and  prize money (for example, from e-sports competitions). In deciding whether you have income, labels such as “hobby” or “side hustle” are unhelpful. Rather it’s important to consider your activity in its entirety, including the regularity of payments, the relationship between you and payers, and the reason for the payments. If you monetise content and receive regular amounts from subscribers or platforms, then this suggests the amounts are income and taxable. However, not everything received is income for tax purposes. If you receive one-off or occasional payments, then you are less likely to have income. The statement discusses other factors you should consider such as whether what you receive can be relied on to help pay for living expenses and whether what you receive normally covers the cost of the activity (although this doesn’t mean an activity must always make a profit for the revenue to be income). Are there exceptions? The statement explains the special rules that mean young people still at school and people earning very low amounts may not have to pay tax. Gifts or donations Payments received through online payment or donation platforms, often described as “gifts” or “donations”, can also be income. In most cases, a payment a viewer makes to a content creator will be a product of the content creator’s activity. These payments will normally arise because the content creator has included a link to a payment platform in the description of their post and the payer has viewed the content and used the link to make a payment. Deductions If you have an income-earning activity, you may be able to claim deductions for expenses and depreciation losses. These deductions will reduce your taxable income. Whether deductions are allowed depends on the tests discussed in the statement. Some expenses will not be deductible because they are private or domestic in nature (for example, most clothing expenses). Private and domestic expenses are essentially living costs and costs associated with the home or family. IS 21/08 FS 1 | 28 September 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 3 of 7 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] For expenses that relate to an income-earning activity but also have a private component (for example, household costs where a person has a home office) you must do an apportionment calculation. Expenses on capital assets (for example, a car) are also not deductible. However, you may be allowed a deduction for depreciation losses on some capital assets, if the assets are used in your business or income-earning activity. What activity expenditure may be deductible?  Home office, phone and internet expenses.  Depreciation losses on equipment and other assets.  Certain vehicle or travel expenses.  Fees for professional and creative services.  Subscriptions for online content or apps used in content-creation activity. Non-monetary items or “contra” Content creator customers are sometimes confused about the tax rules for non-monetary items or “contra”. Not all non-monetary items will be considered income, but where they are, then the value of the items should be included in your tax return. This applies where non-monetary items are received in addition to or instead of monetary payment. Therefore, if you receive both money and products then both might be taxable. Whether non-monetary items are income In considering whether a non-monetary item is income, the principles are similar to those for monetary amounts discussed above. The answer depends on your particular circumstances. For example, if you like fashion and post online in your spare time, and from time to time you receive unsolicited samples and giveaways, then they are unlikely to be income. But if you are an established fashion content creator working to promote brands and you regularly accept unsolicited products, then they will be income. An additional consideration in the case of non-monetary items is whether the item is convertible into money – can the item be sold? Generally, where items cannot be on-sold they will not be income. This might be the case where there is no market for the item or resale is prohibited. IS 21/08 FS 1 | 28 September 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 4 of 7 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] In summary, the general rule is that if an item received as a product of your income-earning activity can be sold, then you will have income. Where a non-monetary item is received in exchange for services, then it is valued at the realisable value, that is what the item can be on-sold for (for example, on marketplace websites). Where the item is a gift, then the law deems the transaction (the gifting) to happen at market value (for example, what the item is sold for at retail in shops or online). Subsequent use of non-monetary items The point of taxation is when the item is received. Where you accept an item and then give it to friends or to charity, it will still be taxable because you accepted the item (and then chose to give it away). If you do not want to be taxed, do not accept the item. Although you are taxed on receipt of an item, there may be further tax consequences depending on what you do with the item. Where you on-sell items, you may receive an amount of income, from which you can deduct an amount for the cost of the item. For example, you could have two amounts of income where you received an item valued at $100 and subsequently sold it for $100. In this case, you can deduct $100, being the cost of the item, from the $200 received in total. This effectively means you are not taxed twice on the same item. It may also be possible to claim a deduction where non-monetary items are used in the content-creation activity. Where this happens, the deduction effectively cancels out the income. The following table is a quick reference guide and is not intended to be an exhaustive list. The table indicates the most likely tax treatment of different forms of payment, but individual situations may vary.
