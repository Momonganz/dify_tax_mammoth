We have attached our submissions on the deemed PE and transfer pricing strengthening proposals. Fairness Our approach has been to consider whether the proposals achieve some measure of making the tax system “fair”. We refer to our submissions on the Hybrids consultation where we noted that “fairness” remained undefined. We further noted the apparent reliance on a global consensus for implementing the OECD’s hybrids actions. The current document proposes a number of changes which do not apply the global consensus. It is possible that the proposals will produce an unfair result. In particular, there are opportunities for double taxation and in the context of a global allocation of taxable profits, over- taxation for the economic activity carried out in New Zealand. Resource intensive nature of transfer pricing We have tried to make sense of the Officials concerns regarding the resourcing requirements of transfer pricing. These are used as justification for reversing the burden of proof and increasing the statute bar period. The current rules are: — taxpayers document their transfer pricing in accordance with OECD guidelines and methods. If Inland Revenue disagrees with that result, Inland Revenue must prove the taxpayer is wrong. This creates work (because invariably the taxpayer disagrees). — taxpayers do not document their transfer pricing. Inland Revenue disagrees. The onus of proof is with the taxpayer who will need to document compliance with OECD guidelines and methods. If Inland Revenue continues to disagree, Inland Revenue must do sufficient work to show the taxpayer is wrong. The proposals will not in our view change this. If taxpayers have carried out the work, they will consider they have discharged the onus of proof. To show that is not the case, Inland Revenue will need to show why that is wrong. This will require the same work from Inland Revenue as currently. (Inland Revenue will not be able to simply make an assessment as otherwise the taxpayer will have discharged the onus of proof through the work they have done.) It is difficult to see Inland Revenue’s complaint as no more than taxpayers disagree/do not accept Inland Revenue’s position.

We would be happy to discuss our submissions. Please do not hesitate to contact John (on 04 816 4518) or Kim (on 09 363 3532). Yours sincerely John Cantin Partner Kim Jarrett Partner BEPS 13 April 2017 10477529\_1.docx 3 Permanent establishment avoidance Proposal Under the proposed rules (for both DTA and non-DTA countries), a non-resident will be deemed to have a PE in New Zealand (among other conditions) if there is an arrangement under which a related entity carries out an activity in connection with the particular sale made by a non-resident to a person in New Zealand for the purpose of bringing it about. As an indication of a deemed PE under the definition above, the paper provides an example of a non-resident located in a low-tax jurisdiction selling computer equipment to New Zealand customers, with its subsidiary undertaking certain sales related activities. These activities include locating customers, promoting the non-resident’s products to them, discussing their needs and tailoring equipment packages for them, and indicating likely pricing/delivery dates and other key terms subject to the non-resident’s approval (which is rarely withheld). Submission KPMG considers that the PE avoidance rule should be explicitly limited in legislation to those arrangements which are artificial or contrived. If Inland Revenue is concerned that tax leakage is occurring in the digital and technology industries (e.g. through their ability to service a New Zealand customer base remotely), we consider that the PE mechanism is not the appropriate way to address this. Rather we suggest Inland Revenue consider refinements to the GST system, or work with the OECD to address taxation of the digital economy. Comment KPMG is concerned that Inland Revenue may not take into account modern commercial practice, particularly for technology based businesses. In our experience these companies often operate sales activities in a highly integrated manner across borders, with New Zealand based employees only performing a part of the sales function with New Zealand customers. Attribution of all sales revenue to a New Zealand PE, in circumstances where the core value- adding sales functions are performed outside of New Zealand, would not reflect the true economic situation of the arrangement and would likely lead to double taxation. A nuanced and fact-specific approach needs to be taken to all such analyses, ensuring that Inland Revenue does not penalise completely commercial (non-tax driven) transactions. We are concerned that the example provided in the paper may indicate the Commissioner making assumptions based on incomplete industry knowledge. Specifically we comment as follows: — ‘Well paid employees’: In the technology sector it is common to have highly paid employees at multiple points in the supply chain, given the qualifications, scarcity of skill set and industry experience needed. This will not be limited to employees that work to build local demand for products in New Zealand, but will generally be a common feature of employees in technology roles across the organisation as a whole. Looking at the salaries of New Zealand employees in isolation provides a false impression of the level of ‘value add’ provided in New Zealand. — Use of third party channel providers: In our experience, third party channel providers will almost always be independent agents, and are fully compensated for their role in the sale of products to New Zealand customers under their commercial arrangements with the BEPS 13 April 2017 10477529\_1.docx 4 supplier. New Zealand income will arise on these transactions, and will be subject to income tax. The use of a third party channel provider, or reseller, should not ordinarily be relevant in considering whether a non-resident has a PE in New Zealand. — Furthermore, third party channel providers often bundle products from multiple suppliers in order to provide a solution to their New Zealand customer. Again, this is not reflective of an arrangement where a PE could be said to exist for a specific non-resident supplier. — The term ‘specialised services’ is not defined or clear. The labelling of the proposals for DTA countries does not clearly achieve the desired override Submission The override of DTAs may not be effective and will at best be uncertain and subject to dispute and cross country disputes. The proposal should be deferred until the effect of the MLI is determined. Comment The basis of the DTA anti-PE avoidance proposal is that an anti-avoidance rule is accepted as overriding a DTA. Given that New Zealand and its DTA partners have the opportunity to enter into the MLI and to accept the MLI’s proposals to amend the relevant DTAs PE rules: — It is not clear how the proposed avoidance rule will interact with DTAs which are amended in the same way as the deemed PE rules propose. It would be an odd result if the proposed rule continued to apply despite the DTA allowing New Zealand to tax the profit. — It is not clear that the substance of the rule is an anti-avoidance rule for those DTAs which are not amended in line with the MLI. Simply, if two countries have not agreed to amend their DTA PE rule, it cannot be contemplated that the structures covered by the deemed PE rule avoid the PE rule in the relevant (un-amended) DTA. o We expect this position to be a point of contention between taxpayers, their home jurisdiction and Inland Revenue. o This is because the New Zealand proposal is inconsistent with the OECD global proposed approach. o The labelling of the proposal as a “deemed PE” rather than a “diverted profits tax” is a mere labelling. It has similar terms to Australia’s Multi-National Anti-Avoidance Legislation and parts of the UK diverted profits tax. o New Zealand does not follow the OECD authorised approach to attributing profit to a PE. See our submission on the MLI for further comment and discussion. The authorised approach to profit attribution Proposal New Zealand will continue to apply its position that a PE is not a separate entity. BEPS 13 April 2017 10477529\_1.docx 5 Submission The proposals will put pressure on New Zealand’s reservation to the OECD’s authorised approach to profit attribution to a PE so that the rules will not apply with certainty The proposals require further clarification of New Zealand’s position. Comment 1 The Issues Paper notes that New Zealand does not accept that a PE should be treated as a separate entity. This means that New Zealand does not accept that a margin can be added to deductible costs of a PE. This difference is in part the reason why the Issues Paper notes that significant revenue can be expected from the proposals. A potential outcome of applying the deemed PE proposals to DTAs, which are not amended in accordance with the MLI, is that those countries dispute New Zealand’s position on profit attribution. Given the push to have a global consensus, this would put pressure on New Zealand to amend its position. We acknowledge that this pressure may have been previously successfully resisted by New Zealand in the past. This may have been accepted in part because both parties have the same view of what New Zealand can tax. That constraint would no longer apply under the deemed PE proposal if the DTA is not amended. Further, if the other party has accepted the MAP, without accepting the PE changes, New Zealand’s position will be in the hands of an arbitrator. The status of the reservation in the context of an arbitration is in our view unclear. Comment 2 We note that in practice Inland Revenue has accepted an implied margin for core functions. For example, in attributing income to New Zealand, a reduced amount may be allocated because an offshore manufacturer is entitled to a profit. The Issus Paper implies that no margin is allowed at all under the proposed rules. This conflicts with past positions that Inland Revenue has allowed. Supply chain restructures Proposal None Submission That the acceptability of supply chain restructures be explicitly confirmed Comment The expected reaction to the Australian and UK diverted profits taxes (due to their penal nature) is that taxpayers restructure their agreements and supply chains to create actual PEs or to ensure that their sales are made in either Australia or the UK via buy-sell subsidiaries. This is BEPS 13 April 2017 10477529\_1.docx 6 likely to be a natural reaction to New Zealand’s proposals as well. (Particularly as an abusive tax position penalty is proposed). Such a restructure is likely to have the effect of eliminating: — The full profit margin from the sale, that would arise in a deemed PE, reducing this to the appropriate transfer pricing margin under transfer pricing rules for the activities actually carried out in New Zealand; and — Removing the New Zealand source for expenses incurred offshore (as these will be captured in the price of goods sold to New Zealand). Alternatively, the restructure may move sales to a higher tax jurisdiction (see further below). As these would have the effect of “avoiding the deemed PE rule”, explicit confirmation that these are contemplated results is required to ensure that the desired and expected restructure is not subject to section BG 1. Low tax jurisdiction Proposal That a deemed PE arises if a low tax jurisdiction is involved. Submission Clarity on what is a low tax jurisdiction is required. Comment We assume that it is not intended that the statutory tax rate should be used to determine whether a country is a low tax jurisdiction. The BEPS project has shown that the effective tax rate can be lower than the statutory tax rate. We assume that is not the test that will be applied. Determining the effective tax rate will be a complex matter. As an example we understand that the USA is considering tax reform which, simply, would deny a deduction for expenses paid offshore while exempting foreign sales. Understanding how and whether the particular aspects of such a reformed system applied to New Zealand transactions would not be either simple or clear. Appropriate and clear rules are required to make this an objective test that can be applied by taxpayers. Strengthening the transfer pricing rules Proposal # 1 The Government proposes that New Zealand’s transfer pricing legislation should include an explicit reference to the latest OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines. Submission KPMG agrees that New Zealand’s transfer pricing legislation should include an explicit reference to the OECD Transfer Pricing guidelines. Comment KPMG considers that an explicit reference to OECD Guidelines will provide better certainty to taxpayers, Inland Revenue and the Courts. BEPS 13 April 2017 10477529\_1.docx 7 We consider this is required because in our view it is Inland Revenue that does not consistently apply the OECD Guidelines in disputed transactions. Legislating the OECD Guidelines will reconfirm to Inland Revenue the tests that it should be applying. Proposal # 2 It is proposed that New Zealand introduce reconstruction rules based on those in Australia’s transfer pricing legislation. Consistent with Australia’s rules, the proposed reconstruction rules would not be explicitly limited to “exceptional circumstances”. Submission An exceptional circumstances clauses should be explicit and included in legislation. Comment In the revised version of Chapter I of the OECD Guidelines, the OIECD strongly cautions against the hasty application of a reconstruction provision noting that, “Because non-recognition can be contentious and a source of double taxation, every effort should be made to determine the actual nature of the transaction and apply arm’s length pricing to the accurately delineated transaction, and to ensure that non-recognition is not used simply because determining an arm’s length price is difficult.” The OECD Guidelines state further, “Restructuring of legitimate business transactions would be a wholly arbitrary exercise the inequity of which could be compounded by double taxation created where the other tax administration does not share the same views as to how the transaction should be structured. It should again be noted that the mere fact that the transaction may not be seen between independent parties does not mean that it does not have characteristics of an arm’s length arrangement.” The OECD has clearly stated that recharacterisation should be undertaken in exceptional circumstances only. KPMG considers that this should be explicit in the legislation, to avoid any suggestion that these powers may be used arbitrarily or because pricing a transaction is ‘difficult’. An exceptional circumstances clause could ideally include specificity around what would be considered exceptional circumstances similar to what has been outlined in the OECD Guidelines Chapter I. To address one of the concerns raised by Inland Revenue, the clause could specify that even if the arrangement is not unique, the “exceptional circumstances” test may be satisfied. However, we note that the Government and Inland Revenue should respect and recognise that just because a transaction is not seen between independent parties does not mean it should be subject to reconstruction. This is outlined in the OECD Guidelines, “Importantly, the mere fact that the transaction may not be seen between independent parties does not mean that it should not be recognised. Associated enterprises may have the ability to enter into a much greater variety of arrangements than can independent enterprises, and may conclude transactions of a specific nature that are not encountered, or are only very rarely encountered, between independent parties, and may do so for sound business reasons.” BEPS 13 April 2017 10477529\_1.docx 8 Proposal #3 It is proposed that the burden of proof should be shifted onto the taxpayer rather than the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. This would align the burden of proof in transfer pricing cases with the standard for other tax matters. As transfer pricing is driven by specific facts and circumstances and involves comparisons with similar arm’s length transactions, the taxpayer is far more likely to hold the relevant information to support its pricing than Inland Revenue or any other party. Submission KPMG acknowledges that the taxpayer bearing the burden of proof is consistent with other jurisdictions globally. However the burden of proof should be with Inland Revenue when the Commissioner uses information that is available to her and not the taxpayer. If the proposal proceeds, it should be clear that an Inland Revenue proposed transfer pricing assessment meets a threshold level of reasonableness so that arbitrary and unsupportable positions are not taken by the Commissioner. Comment KPMG submits that, should the change in the burden of proof occur, then there should be legislated limits to the ability of the Inland Revenue to leverage what is referred to as “secret comparables” or information pertaining to other companies that are privately held when determining its transfer pricing position. This is even more important given the depth of information that will soon be at Inland Revenue’s disposal with the Business Transformation project, the automatic sharing of information with treaty partners, Country-by-country reporting and other taxpayer information collection mechanisms. In order to ensure a fair and reasonable determination of transfer prices, the comparable information to be used should be limited to what would reasonably be at the company’s disposal whether its internal data or data in the public domain. This requirement is of the utmost importance and therefore should be legislated. We note that currently the burden of proof is only shifted if the taxpayer has applied a transfer pricing method i.e. undertaken the transfer pricing work necessary in relation to their transactions. We consider that this is an appropriate encouragement, in a self-assessment regime, for taxpayers to do the work necessary in order to take a tax position. A better solution to Inland Revenue’s concerns would be to consider either: — a requirement to disclose the existence of the work at the time of filing the return; or — filing of the transfer pricing reports and documentation with the returns to justify the change in the burden of proof. This should assist Inland Revenue with its risk assessment. In the alternative, if the burden of proof is changed proposed adjustments by Inland Revenue should be capable of being reasonably arguable. This is to prevent Inland Revenue proposing arbitrary or unreasonable adjustments. (We assume that information requested by Inland Revenue, providing that request is itself reasonable, has been provided to allow the Commissioner to propose a reasonable adjustment.) Proposal #4 There is currently no explicit statutory requirement in New Zealand to prepare and maintain transfer pricing documentation. BEPS 13 April 2017 10477529\_1.docx 9 Rather than making it mandatory for all arrangements to be documented, the Government proposes shifting the burden of proof onto the taxpayer to encourage higher quality documentation. Submission While KPMG does not support legislating that taxpayers prepare mandatory contemporaneous transfer pricing documentation, we submit that a general requirement to prepare transfer pricing documentation, appropriate for demonstrating that a taxpayer has complied with its obligations to undertake related party transactions in accordance with the arm’s length standard, should be legislated. We further note that retaining the current burden of proof in these circumstances would encourage that this be done. This would assist Inland Revenue with its risk assessment and therefore with its efficient deployment of resources. Comment Transfer pricing compliance obligations are increasing in nearly every other jurisdiction around the world, and with the introduction of Country-by-country reporting, multinational groups are needing to allocate their resources amongst these compliance requirements. As a result, KPMG is seeing instances of some multinational groups choosing to only prepare formal transfer pricing documentation for countries with an explicit, legislated, transfer pricing documentation requirement. The need to prepare documentation is implicit in the current transfer pricing legislation. However KPMG considers that this should be an explicit legislated requirement in order to ensure appropriate documentation standards are met by the taxpayer, providing greater assurance of compliance with transfer pricing rules for Inland Revenue, and better certainty for taxpayers. The preparation of transfer pricing documentation provides an opportunity to reassess whether the pricing of a group’s related party transactions are continuing to meet the requirements of the arm’s length standard. KPMG is therefore concerned that continuing to operate under an ‘implicit’ and somewhat looser documentation standard in New Zealand, which is increasingly out-of-step with other jurisdictions, may result in poorer transfer pricing outcomes for New Zealand. Proposal #5 The Government proposes increasing New Zealand’s time bar for transfer pricing matters to seven years. Submission Increasing the statutory time bar for transfer pricing matters to 7 years is inconsistent with the need to provide certainty to taxpayers on tax positions taken. It is also unnecessary in light of the increasingly timely information gathering mechanisms at the disposal of Inland Revenue, enabling Inland Revenue to undertake transfer pricing risk assessments promptly once a tax position is taken for any given year. Comment — Providing certainty for taxpayers is one of the primary purposes of the time bar. This purpose is as important and relevant for transfer pricing matters as it is for any other provision in the Income Tax Act. Taxpayers require certainty that, after a reasonable period of time has passed to enable Inland Revenue to audit their related party BEPS 13 April 2017 10477529\_1.docx 10 transactions if considered necessary, no reassessment will be sought by Inland Revenue on transfer pricing matters. We consider the current time bar is fully adequate and sufficient for Inland Revenue to perform any necessary audit procedures and reassessments on transfer pricing matters. — The rationale provided by Inland Revenue for the extension of the time bar is that it is difficult for tax authorities to adequately identify transfer pricing risk, apply the arm’s length principle and amend an assessment within four years, given the need to undertake a detailed analysis of facts and circumstances, comparable data and arm’s length arrangements. — KPMG considers that Inland Revenue now has access to significant amounts of information on the intercompany transactions undertaken by multinationals, and receives this in a very timely manner after the completion of an income tax return for any given income year. Specifically this information includes: o Information provided by taxpayers as part of the Basic Compliance Package process o Information provided by taxpayers completing the International Tax Questionnaire o Information provided by taxpayers who complete transfer pricing questionnaires  Information that will begin to be received by Inland Revenue in the short to mid-term through information received from overseas tax jurisdictions through the automatic exchange of Country by Country reporting information and Advance pricing Agreements Given this, Inland Revenue is able to perform risk assessment procedures within a very short time of a tax position being taken by a taxpayer. Furthermore, given that most, if not all, larger multinationals with a significant level of intercompany transactions, will have already been subject to Inland Revenue risk assessments, reviews and/or audits of their transfer pricing practices, Inland Revenue’s focus should be on new or significantly changed transactions. A full reassessment of a taxpayer’s transfer prices should not be required every year. Given the vast amount of information at Inland Revenue’s disposal, and its receipt of that information in short order after a tax position has been taken for a given income year, KPMG considers that it is entirely reasonable for a taxpayer to expect Inland Revenue to have completed any necessary audit procedures and reassessments within 4 years. — The discussion document references the Australian and Canadian statute bar on transfer pricing matters as support for longer statute bar on transfer pricing matters. Inland Revenue’s own data however demonstrates that both the US and UK have 3 or 4 year time bars for both Transfer Pricing and other tax matters. In addition, most of the other jurisdictions listed have the same time bar for both transfer pricing and other income tax matters. This isolated focus on Australia and Canada does not show the broader position. — The whole focus of Business Transformation is that taxpayers are able to be provided certainty more quickly and more robustly. There is no reason to separate transfer pricing from other matters for which Inland Revenue and taxpayers desire finality. General comment on transfer pricing and interest limitation rules A number of references are made in the Discussion Document to the demands that transfer pricing matters place on Inland Revenue resources. KPMG considers that this is an area where BEPS 13 April 2017 10477529\_1.docx 11 Inland Revenue should be looking to increase the level of specialist staff that it employs, in order to address this complex, and globally significant, area of tax law. We submit that Inland Revenue should consider this as part of its repositioning its workforce, post Business Transformation, into those skill sets that will be most necessary in addressing increasingly complex tax issues arising from commercial changes in global businesses, and an international tax landscape that increasingly complex and prone to double taxation. This is consistent with changes made in other Revenue Authorities, most notably the Australian Tax Office which has publically announced significant recruitment of international tax and transfer pricing specialists. Administrative measures Proposal #1 The Government proposes introducing a new administrative measure to address “non-co- operation” by multinationals. Submission #1 If such an administrative practice is considered necessary, then KPMG agrees that it should be explicitly legislated for, without reliance on internal administrative practice within Inland Revenue. This should include legislation explicitly stating when a taxpayer will be considered non-cooperative, the threshold at which this will be found and the process that will be used by Inland Revenue before making such a finding (e.g. notice requirements). Comment #1 The Discussion Draft notes that the non-cooperative administrative measure is not intended to impose unreasonable demands on multinationals. As such, KPMG considers it important that all material aspects of a non-cooperation rule be explicitly legislated for in order to provide certainty, and clear guidance on what is considered by Inland Revenue to be an unacceptable practice or delay, to taxpayers. Proposal #2 The Government proposes bringing forward the time at which tax in dispute must be paid. There are two potential payment dates being considered for this purpose: — Within 90 days of Inland Revenue issuing an assessment for the tax (which would only occur at the end of Inland Revenue’s current dispute process); or — Within 12 months of Inland Revenue issuing a NOPA in respect of the tax, if Inland Revenue and the taxpayer have not been able to resolve the dispute. Submission #1 KPMG considers that there is no reason to have a different rule for the payment of tax in dispute in a transfer pricing matter than for any other tax matter. Comment #1 The general rules for tax in dispute is that this tax becomes payable on the day of final determination. We see no reason why this should be any different for transfer pricing matters. © 2017 KPMG, a New Zealand partnership and a member firm of the KPMG network of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Cooperative (“KPMG International”), a Swiss entity. Supplementary submission We have provided submissions on the deemed PE and transfer pricing strengthening proposals. We have a further submission on the proposals to amend the life insurance rules. The Document notes that under New Zealand’s double taxation agreements (“DTAs”) with Russia, Japan, and Canada that New Zealand is unable to tax the life insurance business if a resident of those countries does not have a permanent establishment in New Zealand. Briefly, New Zealand’s framework for taxing insurance business of a non-resident is: — For life insurance, to tax all business offered or entered into in New Zealand; — For non-life insurance to tax 10% of the premium income if there is no fixed esta blishment in New Zealand. New Zealand’s DTAs typically preserve New Zealand’s entitlement to tax insurance business in this way whether or not a permanent establishment exists. The document does not say why these DTAs have not followed this approach. We have only been able to determine two possibilities: — New Zealand accepted a proposal by those countries to change its standard approach to taxing insurance business; — The change in these DTAs was inadvertent, mostly likely due to a change in drafting go the r elevant provision. Neither of these reasons support the proposals. In fact, they indicate that the proposal is unprincipled. The proposals unilaterally alter the basis of taxation. The correct approach would be to renegotiate the relevant provision with the other country. We do not accept a technical response that the proposals do not tax the non-resident insurer. The denial of the deduction for a premium (albeit offset by not taxing claims received), makes the policyholder a proxy taxpayer for the non-resident insurer. This change is likely to lead the policyholder to try to alter the terms of the agreement so the non-resident insurer is effectively bearing the tax. The substance of the proposal is the non-resident’s profit is taxed. Further, the proposal to amend the FIF rules potentially creates double taxation.

We are not aware of insurers using the relevant DTAs. However, we consider the proposals unprincipled in their unilateral change. As we note in our submissions on Interest Rate Limitations, it is also a worrying trend that the substance of a proposal is not made transparent. In this case, the proposal seems to be directed to correcting an error rather than addressing a matter of principle.

Yours sincerely John Cantin Partner Nick Hope Director Deputy Commissioner Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue Department P O Box 2198 Wellington 6140 Taxation of Multinationals - Discussion Documents Dear Madam, Oxfam welcomes positive steps by this Government to address the unfair situation where the world’s richest and most powerful companies and people are avoiding paying their fair share of tax. Tax is key to making sure everyone has vital public services. It is an essential tool to ending extreme inequality, and could help lift millions of people out of poverty. It is estimated that poor countries are losing at least $170 billion every year because of tax avoidance - this is more than the total amount that these same countries are receiving in aid. When taxation works fairly, the majority benefit. New Zealand could be missing out on up to $500 million a year in tax from multinational companies - money that could be spent on health, education and housing. On a broad level we support the proposals in the documents however we are concerned that they do not go far enough; • in ensuring that New Zealand receives its fair share of tax from multinationals operating in New Zealand • in committing New Zealand to collaborate on issues of greater transparency around tax practices globally. Our comments on proposed rules and recommendations are below. BEPS - Transfer Pricing and Permanent Establishment Avoidance Oxfam has long been concerned about multinationals not paying tax in the countries they operate in and trade with as it deprives the host countries of tax revenues to spend on desperately needed social services for the local populations. Diverted profits tax To that end Oxfam has been supportive of and has called for a Diverted Profits Tax to counter such behaviour. We are supportive of the government's moves to bring in an equivalent measure. We note however that the tests suggested include a consideration of whether the structure is contrary to the purpose of the respective double tax agreement. BEPS – TP + PE #002 BEPS – Interest limitation #002 1 Recommendation: Oxfam recommends that the proposed diverted profits tax equivalent does not reference any double tax agreement but focus simply on the other objective tests. • a non-resident supplies goods or services to a person in New Zealand; • a related entity (either associated or commercially dependant) carries out an activity in New Zealand in connection with that particular sale for the purpose of bringing it about; • some or all of the sales income is not attributed to a New Zealand permanent establishment of the non-resident; Recommendation: Oxfam recommends that New Zealand’s double tax agreements are reviewed to ensure New Zealand can receive its fair share of tax revenue from multinationals and if favourable renegotiation is not possible then the double tax agreements should be rescinded. BEPS - Interest Limitation Rules Interest deductions Oxfam notes that the government has chosen not to implement the earnings stripping rules recommended by the OECD. We are comfortable with this only if the government can assure the people of New Zealand that what it is proposing is equally effective. On that basis we support the proposals in this document as interest deductions are a very straightforward way of reducing profit by multinationals. For this reason we particularly support: ● The removal of non-debt liabilities from the assets component of the debt to assets test. Such a move will level the playing field between multinationals that would commercially use debt to fund fixed assets and those that wouldn’t. For this reason Oxfam strongly supports this move. ● The other proposal we particularly support is the removal of the 10% related party debt allowance for conglomerates including Public Private Partnerships (PPP). Currently PPPs are allowed to deduct all unrelated party debt plus 10% of their related party debt. As related party debt is a “profit stripping” device Oxfam does not see the logic of this and we are pleased to see the proposal to remove it. Excessive interest rates Oxfam is aware of the current loophole where high levels of debt can feed into a high interest rate for transfer pricing purposes. We therefore support the intent of the proposals to eliminate this. We note that the proposals are to: ● apply the credit rating of senior unsecured debt for multinationals with an identifiable parent; 2 ● assess the level of arms-length debt and then the applicable interest rate when there is not an identifiable parent. It is the second option that causes us concern. Multinationals without an identifiable parent include Private Equity (who are known to take a tax aggressive approach to investment). To find a comparable level of arms-length debt our understanding is that you need to find the debt level of a comparable New Zealand owned firm. Given the high levels of foreign ownership in all our major industries, Oxfam would question whether identifying such a comparable firm was possible. We note that even iconic New Zealand firms such as Spark and Fletcher Building have significant levels of foreign ownership. Even in industries that still have some level of New Zealand ownership such a move will incentivise full foreign ownership so that high levels of interest deduction can become the norm. Recommendation: It is not our first preference to require all related party interest to be disallowed but if these are the only options available, they have to be taken to ensure entities such as Private Equity pay their fair share of tax. We suggest that if related party interest disallowance is considered excessive; earning stripping rules must be reconsidered for this group. Omissions on current proposed rules Global collaboration on tax Oxfam is an international development agency and our mission is to eliminate poverty globally. We see progressive tax systems (spent progressively) as one of the levers to be able to achieve this goal. While there is a lot that governments can and are doing on their own to improve the progressiveness of their tax systems, such as this consultation on tax policy in New Zealand, there is a limit to what countries can do unilaterally. Earlier this year, Oxfam released a report that revealed that 8 men own the same wealth as 3.6 billion people who make up the poorest half of humanity. Tax havens are part of this problem. In order to end poverty and inequality; we have to end tax avoidance globally. Recommendation: Oxfam is calling on all countries to allow for greater collaboration on taxation. A fair and level playing field on corporate tax requires transparency measures, including full public country by country reporting, transparency on beneficial owners and transparency by governments on the tax incentives they grant and in particular on tax rulings. Non-resident finance companies Another omission is any move to apply specific interest limitation rules to non-resident finance companies. The issue is they currently only have the on-lending concession apply to them meaning they can have unlimited and unconstrained interest deductions (as was the case with the Australian banks before the specific bank rules were implemented). 3 We understand that there is currently not a high level of non-resident finance companies operating in New Zealand. Oxfam accepts that this may be currently the case but this can change very quickly (as was the situation with the banks). Recommendation: While all the other measures are correcting issues that have been in place for some time, we suggest that it would be preferable to fix identified issues before they become a ‘significant drag’ on the tax base thereby affecting the government's ability to provide social services. Oxfam welcomes these consultation documents and we recognise that this a positive first step to ensure multinational companies pay their fair share of tax from profits earned in New Zealand. As stated above we do strongly recommend the inclusion of policies that promote greater collaboration on tax globally to tackle the growing issue of inequality. Oxfam wishes to acknowledge the significant assistance provided by Andrea Black, adviser to Oxfam, in the research and analysis of the Tax Consultation Documents. Oxfam also greatly appreciates the access to your officials and the open and insightful discussions they had with Andrea Black. We would be happy to discuss any of these points in more detail.

Yours sincerely, Rachael Le Mesurier Executive Director Oxfam New Zealand 4 Submission of the New Zealand Council of Trade Unions Te Kauae Kaimahi to the Inland Revenue Department on the Proposals to strengthen New Zealand’s rules for taxing large multinationals (BEPS) P O Box 6645 Wellington 18 April 2017 BEPS – TP + PE #003 BEPS – Interest limitation #006 1.1. This submission is made on behalf of the 30 unions affiliated to the New Zealand Council of Trade Unions Te Kauae Kaimahi (CTU). With 320,000 members, the CTU is one of the largest democratic organisations in New Zealand. 1.2. The CTU acknowledges Te Tiriti o Waitangi as the founding document of Aotearoa New Zealand and formally acknowledges this through Te Rūnanga o Ngā Kaimahi Māori o Aotearoa (Te Rūnanga) the Māori arm of Te Kauae Kaimahi (CTU) which represents approximately 60,000 Māori workers. 1.3. Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the three discussion papers on “Base erosion and profit shifting” (BEPS): 1 • BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance • BEPS – Strengthening our interest limitation rules • New Zealand’s implementation of the multilateral convention to implement tax treaty related measures to prevent BEPS. 1.4. We have read these and support their general directions. We make this brief submission in order to indicate our ongoing interest in these matters and our wish to be consulted as this area of policy progresses. 1.5. The loss of revenue from tax avoidance and evasion has a direct impact on our members in loss of revenue for public services which we value, and in higher taxes than otherwise necessary on working people. 1.6. One area is of special concern: the avoidance of tax by multinational internet-based corporations such as Google and Facebook puts local carriers of advertising such as newspapers and broadcast television and radio at a competitive disadvantage. The business model of conventional news media is already severely weakened by changes in technology brought largely through the internet and other forms of digital media and communications. The advertising revenue on which the conventional media depend is undermined by these new technologies, which they are struggling to respond to. It makes it even more difficult if their competition can lower their costs by avoiding paying tax on their activities. 1 http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/consultation 2 1.7. This is a matter of public interest: the conventional media are still the principal ori ginators of the content on which we largely depend for reliable news, and particularly for news about New Zealand. The steady loss of capacity through lay- offs of journalists and other media staff is creating a major failure in the news media market. 1.8. There is therefore a strong public interest case to ensure that provision of advertising services and platforms is tax neutral. We are gravely disappointed that the proposals do not address the tax avoidance of Google, Facebook and others. We urge IRD to address this. 1.9. The only other matter we would like to comment on is that it would be very valuable for IRD to regularly publish summary information on the taxation of multinationals in the New Zealand. This would give the public the information that is necessary and sufficient for informed discussion of such matters and to judge whether measures such as those discussed in the present documents are effective. We urge IRD to do so. 3 TP EQuilibrium | AustralAsia LP A Duff & Phelps Transfer Pricing Alliance Partner To: Deputy Commissioner of Taxation, Policy and Strategy, New Zealand Inland Revenue From: Leslie Prescott-Haar, Stefan Sunde / TP EQuilibrium | AustralAsia LP Subject: BEPS – Transfer Pricing and PE Avoidance Date: 18 April 2017 TP EQuilibrium | AustralAsia (“TPEQ”) has prepared this submission in respect of the New Zealand Government’s discussion document, BEPS – Transfer Pricing and PE Avoidance, published in March 2017. TPEQ has prepared these comments on the discussion document specifically, and selectively, from a transfer pricing perspective. Our comments are based on our transfer pricing experience with Australian and New Zealand transfer pricing matters. In this regard, we have limited our comments to certain proposals contained in Chapters 5 and 6 of the discussion document. As such, TPEQ has not commented on all aspects of the various proposals. Our comments with respect to Chapter 5 are substantive, whereas our comments with respect to Chapter 6 are practical. We are comfortable discussing these points raised further with the Inland Revenue or Treasury officials, as may be requested. The submission is generally structured in alignment with the structure of the discussion document, unless otherwise indicated. #004 2 Overall ‘General’ Comments Whilst we welcome alignment with the most current OECD guidance, and we recognise the importance of trans-Tasman trade flows, we caution against a desire for alignment with Australia’s transfer pricing rules, simply for the sake of alignment. Australia’s revised transfer pricing regime is exceptionally burdensome, excessive in terms of compliance costs, over-steps the OECD Guidelines in various respects, will likely result in a materially increased number of disputes, and remains unchallenged in the Australian courts. Therefore, we urge caution against interpreting that legislation as “a good way” to challenge situations where legal form does not match economic substance. Moreover, the discussion document appears to misinterpret Section 815-130 of Australia’s revised transfer pricing regime as a reconstruction provision, rather than a provision to identify the arm’s length conditions of a transaction. Proposals to consider reconstruction of transactions are unduly aggressive, and such should be avoided unless in exceptional circumstances The proposals contained in the discussion document relating to the reconstruction of a transaction where its form does not align with the economic substance must be considered carefully. In particular, Para. 5.39 notes that, under the proposals, New Zealand’s rules would not restrict reconstruction to only “exceptional circumstances”. We also note that, contrary to the OECD Guidelines, there appears to be an intent (para. 5.29) to target transactions only rarely occurring between third parties. Per the revised OECD Guidelines 1 : The key question in the analysis is whether the actual transaction possesses the commercial rationality of arrangements that would be agreed between unrelated parties under comparable economic circumstances, not whether the same transaction can be observed between independent parties. The non-recognition of a transaction that possesses the commercial rationality of an arm’s length arrangement is not an appropriate application of the arm’s length principle. Restructuring of legitimate business transactions would be a wholly arbitrary exercise the inequity of which could be compounded by double taxation created where the other tax administration does not share the same views as to how the transaction should be structured. It should again be noted that the mere fact that the transaction may not be seen between independent parties does not mean that it does not have characteristics of an arm’s length arrangement. The structure that for transfer pricing purposes, replaces that actually adopted by the taxpayers should comport as closely as possible with the facts of the actual transaction undertaken whilst achieving a commercially rational expected result that would have enabled the parties to come to a price acceptable to both of them at the time the arrangement was entered into. Any New Zealand legislative and/or IRD approach which is inconsistent with the OECD guidance would be unsatisfactory in New Zealand’s transfer pricing framework, having regard to the evidential burden placed upon multinationals to disprove hypothetical reconstructions; this would result in excessive compliance costs for operations that are insignificant (for most multinationals); and would likely materially increase in the number of disputes, Competent 1 Final OECD BEPS Reports – Actions 8-10, paras. 1.123 – 1.124. 3 Authority cases, and instances of economic double taxation. In this regard, the New Zealand avoidance regime and case law are already highly effective deterrents against aggressive taxation arrangements, as the Commissioner already has broad discretion to reconstruct tax avoidance arrangements appropriately, and adequately address such ‘problematic’ structures. Given the effective workings of New Zealand’s anti-avoidance regime, it is not necessary for New Zealand to introduce separate reconstruction provisions within the transfer pricing rules. As such, it is inappropriate for the Inland Revenue to “re-write” the terms and conditions of multinational transactions for a variety of reasons, except in exceptional avoidance circumstances. Instead, a provision making reference to the OECD Guidelines, as the most current internationally accepted guidance, would appear to suffice with regards to alignment of substance with legal form. Per Para. 5.29, we caution against ‘risk shifting’ as an indicator for any recharacterisation. We note that, for example, there is limited rationale to establish a low-risk distributor, other than to create a stable, low-risk entity, which for a multinational reflects a commercial arrangement that may simply not be available to independent parties. The limited risk distributor approach is a common and well accepted inbound and outbound structure which minimises transfer pricing risk for the distributor and its group, including by the Inland Revenue in APAs. Conversely, the financial results of full risk marketer-distributors are often highly variable (as a result of market/economic conditions, currency exchange rates, etc.) and such variability of distribution profitability inevitably attracts the scrutiny of revenue authorities around the world. This is only one example of various possible structures that apportion risk in a particular way, with sound commercial basis, but do not indicate aggressive profit shifting. Further, risks are contractually transferred globally every day in uncontrolled transactions. Hence, risk shifting should not be a primary factor considered as part of a potential recharacterisation. We note that section 815-130 of Australia’s Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 does not address risk in such a granular fashion. Further to the above, the nature of the New Zealand dollar as a ‘commodity’ currency, making NZS exchange rates typically more volatile, provides further justification for limited risk approaches in respect of controlled transactions with New Zealand, to improve stability, certainty and long term profitability of New Zealand businesses. Administrative Measures The comments below are based on TPEQ’s practical audit experience. In our experience, audit delays are typically not attributable to taxpayer non-cooperation. In this regard, multinationals would \[almost always\] prefer to respond to audit queries and resolve audits as quickly as reasonably possible, with a view to progressing the matter to its final conclusion, achieving certainty over the outcome at the earliest opportunity. Audit issues experienced by the Inland Revenue may, to a large extent, reflect requests for information that simply does not exist within multinationals, or is not prepared in the normal course of business management and / or decision-making. It is inevitable that there would be some delay in providing such information, as it may take considerable time to collate or prepare, this having to be balanced with other commercial imperatives. The necessity for broad administrative legislative changes is therefore lacking. Instead, we believe a flexible process facilitating ‘open discussions’ with the Inland Revenue relating to their audit information requests would be more effective and should be implemented, to balance the Inland Revenue’s information needs with multinationals’ compliance costs. Per the general USA IRS procedures, information requests are initially 4 provided to taxpayers in draft form, providing an opportunity to discuss the nature and extent of the information requested as compared to what is available, and tailor the request to the specific circumstances and risk profile of the taxpayer. On Para. 5.71, should the 7-year statute bar for transfer pricing assessments become law, then the Inland Revenue should, as a practical matter, become more open to longer term APAs. We note the intent that the proposed measures would leave co-operative multinationals largely unaffected (para 6.13), but we have concerns in practice that this would not be the case. We also note the intention to implement internal review processes to ensure such measures could not be applied lightly (para. 6.18), but the discussion paper remains vague on what would be considered “reasonable in the circumstances” (para. 6.17). On Para 6.19, for non-cooperative major multinationals, it could presumably be evidentially unfavourable for the Inland Revenue to issue NOPAs that are based on incomplete evidence and / or insufficient analysis, as well as being procedurally inefficient for both the Inland Revenue and multinationals. Whilst we understand the Inland Revenue’s need to address the minority of taxpayers that are non-compliant, we believe that the existing provisions represent an adequate and effective arsenal available to the Commissioner. On Para 6.26, it is unfair to penalise all multinationals for the sins of a few, by requiring all taxpayers to make upfront ‘pay to play’ tax payments based on insufficiently evidenced NOPAs. Also, limiting repayment of disputed tax only in the event of a successful court challenge (para. 6.25) excludes the possibility of other dispute resolution mechanisms. Payment of disputed tax should be made upon resolution of the matter by any means. Para 6.35 appears quite draconian and punitive, as a New Zealand person could potentially be convicted for the directions and/or actions of others, or alternatively, in connection with an information request covering information that does not actually exist. In relation to the latter point, the proposed approach does not recognise that, even where the relevant person is willing to co-operate, it may be difficult for them to prove that the requested information simply does not exist.

In summary our submissions are as follows: General comments  We accept that the Government is concerned about BEPS and committed to introducing appropriate measures to combat BEPS.  We agree that BEPS is detrimental to the public perception of our tax system; and may also be detrimental to New Zealand’s economy.  We are concerned that by implementing unilateral measures outside the OECD BEPS Action Plan the Government could harm our relationships with treaty partners.  We are not convinced that the PE model will always be appropriate for digital business models and suggest another model is needed.  We believe any new rules must be clear and specific to give certainty to taxpayers, particularly foreign investors.  We believe any recommendations adopted as a result of this Discussion Document should be factored in to Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation project so that the Commissioner can develop specialist teams to meet changing customer demands. Permanent establishment avoidance  It is unclear why, if the proposed rule is to counteract an entity avoiding the application of a relevant treaty, that the Commissioner cannot apply section BG 1 currently.  It is unclear how the proposed avoidance rule will fit into our existing treaty framework.  An uncertain rule will discourage foreign investment so it is critical that, if a rule is required, the rule is targeted and clear.

Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ.  The Commissioner should specify all of the relevant factors she considers indicate the presence of avoidance. For example she should be specific about which countries the Government considers to be “low tax jurisdictions”, and how other indicia will be considered, including what is meant by a “well paid employee”.  Guidance should be given as to how the Commissioner will attribute any resulting profit. Amendments to the source rules  The Government should provide examples to explain how the proposed PE source rule would apply and to which foreign income.  The anti-avoidance source rule goes further than the BEPS measures proposed by the OECD and we do not believe this is appropriate.  We agree that there is a discrepancy in tax treatment for life insurance businesses depending on the particular DTA but believe this discrepancy should be resolved by amending the particular DTAs.  We agree that it is not necessary to have a royalty substitution rule. Transfer pricing  A legislative reference to the OECD transfer pricing guidelines should state that the guidelines apply only to the extent they have been adopted by New Zealand – or the guidelines should be put into regulation with reservations specified in a separate schedule or appendix.  We are concerned that an “economic substance” test would be uncertain and difficult to administer and believe the test needs to be clearer and more tightly defined.  If a reconstruction provision is introduced, the standard should be whether a taxpayer would be “more likely than not” to have agreed such an arrangement with a third party and an “exceptional circumstances” type test should be explicit. The same test should be adopted if a criterion of arm’s length “conditions” is introduced into legislation.  We do not believe the burden of proof should simply be reversed. If the burden is to be shifted to the taxpayer then, at the least, the burden should be on the Commissioner in situations where she is using data that is not available to the taxpayer.  We understand most multinational enterprises of this size provide the proposed documentation already and we do not have a problem with the requirements being formalised in legislation.  Moving the time bar to seven years for transfer pricing issues is inconsistent with Inland Revenue’s move to customer centric, real time service and should not proceed. If resourcing is an issue, more resource should be allocated.  As a practical matter, many investors with minor interests will not be involved in transfer pricing decisions and will not have access to transfer pricing documentation so the rule needs to have some flexibility to allow for this. Administrative measures  We question whether the new administrative measures are needed when most multinational enterprises cooperate with Inland Revenue.  Any increase in administrative sanctions should be accompanied by corresponding measures to encourage and assist taxpayers to comply.  We do not believe the Commissioner should have the power to impose fines.

General comments The OECD has issued the BEPS Action Plan in order to reset the global consensus on how to tax cross-border commercial activities. We believe the New Zealand Government must first be clear on its desired international tax policy settings and then the extent to which these are already achieved through current legislation, including an anti-avoidance rule, and adoption of the Multi-lateral Convention (MLC). If not, the Government must then determine the extent to which any further legislative reform might be needed. We understand the Government is concerned about BEPS activities in New Zealand and we agree that BEPS is undesirable, in particular, because it affects the public perception, and thus the integrity, of our tax system. It may also be detrimental to New Zealand’s tax take. It is not clear whether the Government has developed the current proposals because it has decided to unilaterally act, outside of the MLC, to achieve its international policy settings; or whether it has developed them to deal with perceived issues with the public perception of the tax system. Existing treaty framework It is unclear how the proposed rules will fit into our existing treaty framework. The proposal is stated to be a new avoidance rule. However it is not clear in the discussion document as to what the Government asserts is the test that, if avoided, will cause the proposal to be applied. We presume that if a foreign jurisdiction implements the MLC then the proposed avoidance rule would not apply as the treaty should apply to any suggested avoidance. However it seems unclear what could occur if the relevant treaty partner does not implement the MLC in full. Is it proposed that New Zealand will apply the avoidance rule notwithstanding the negotiation with the treaty partner concluded on a different basis? If another country does not accept the relevant MLC it is more difficult to make the argument that the proposal is an anti-avoidance rule. The parties will contemplate that a PE (and, therefore, a taxing right) would not arise. A unilateral action also creates a risk that our other treaty partners may respond in a similar way. A similar response from other countries could limit New Zealand’s tax take, rather than increase it, by having the reverse impact for New Zealand businesses trading overseas. We suggest Officials consider delaying the application of the deemed PE rule for DTA countries until after the implementation of the MLC. Effect on foreign investment In our view, many of the proposed rules seem to be directed towards perceived problems. The proposed rules are framed widely and in many cases the boundaries are unclear. We are pleased that Officials first developed an overarching inbound investment framework and believe that has been a Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand Level 1, Carlaw Park, 12-16 Nicholls Lane, Parnell, PO Box 3334, Shortland Street, Auckland 1140, New Zealand 0800 469 422 P +64 9 430 8859 charteredaccountantsanz.com Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. useful reference for New Zealand’s policy settings. We believe Officials must now develop a coherent and cohesive set of rules within this framework that target only those arrangements that are of real concern. If the rules are not sufficiently clear, they will have a significant effect on taxpayer certainty, particularly for overseas companies looking to conduct business here. In our specific submissions, we have made suggestions for areas where we believe explicit criteria are needed. Relevance of the PE model In our view, the proposals in chapters three and four attempt to force the PE model on to a type of business that does not fit into this model. It is a natural consequence of the information age and the sharing economy that, for many businesses, the value will be in its operational model, network and/or customer list. Its business may be conducted from a website rather than from bricks and mortar premises. We do not believe that the traditional concept of a PE is useful for taxing digital age businesses in all cases. It is not the subject of the discussion document, however we consider that the OECD needs to develop a new model that will be more appropriate for taxing new economy businesses. In the absence of a new model, the Government runs the risk that anti-BEPS measures will disadvantage taxpayers with new or innovative business models in the future. Encouraging growth and innovation is firmly on the Government’s agenda. New and innovative businesses, including those from overseas, will be critical in growing the economy. In order to encourage foreign investment it is critical that we have clear and workable tax rules that are fit for purpose Implementation Inland Revenue has embarked on a Business Transformation programme which, we understand, will include a significant re-allocation of resources and restructure of many roles. This presents an opportunity to develop specialist teams to resource the initiatives outlined in this Discussion Document. For example, the Discussion Document assumes that Inland Revenue will need to audit to discover the relevant transactions and corresponding transfer pricing documentation. The transformation project provides an opportunity for Inland Revenue to establish customer service teams to assist taxpayers at the time the transactions occur and provide real time signoff on compliance. Such an approach would give greater certainty to taxpayers and as a consequence would not require the Government to change the statute bar or the burden of proof as currently proposed.

Chapter 3: Permanent establishment avoidance The Government proposes to deem a PE to exist where a non-resident makes sales into New Zealand, a related entity carries out activities in relation to the sale and the sales income is not all attributed to a New Zealand PE of the non-resident. Application of the rule The proposed rule is outlined at paragraph 3.21 of the Discussion Document. Paragraph 3.24 outlines the factors that will be relevant in determining whether the test is met. We do not believe it will always be clear when an arrangement “ought to” result in a PE. Therefore it is imperative that the rule is clearly articulated with particular attributes clearly specified. It is important that the rule is crafted using language using specific criteria and is neither vague nor emotive in terminology. While the proposed rule is touted as an avoidance rule it is not clear that in fact the typical indicia of avoidance are in fact required before the rule is implemented. Further it is not clear what PE test the Government is concerned with. Any application of avoidance in New Zealand would typically include the consideration of the economic reality of the arrangement and whether there are the relevant indicia, such as artificiality, circularity, or non-commercial features that lead to the conclusion that the arrangement was an avoidance arrangement. It appears that in this instance the Government is suggesting that the existence of certain factors could trigger the rule notwithstanding these could be commercial activities. Paragraph 3.25 states that the legislation may specify some of the factors. We agree and believe that, if possible, it should specify all of the factors. But more so the Commissioner should be required to show that the non-resident had in fact entered into a tax avoidance arrangement. At para 3.2 the Government suggests that “The proposed rule is an anti-avoidance measure. It is intended to apply where the non-resident’s economic activities in New Zealand should result in a PE here, but the non-resident has been able to restructure its legal arrangements to avoid one arising”. However what test of a PE is to be applied in this instance? What PE test is to be considered to have been avoided? In para 3.45 it is proposed that no reference will be had with the particular PE test in the relevant DTA. It is perhaps implied in paras 3.40 and 3.41 that reference is to be had to the PE test that is in the Model Convention, which will presumably mirror the MLC. If this is to be the case is the Government suggesting that it would seek to apply the proposed test to a taxpayer of a foreign jurisdiction that has not accepted the MLC PE test? This has the potential to result in large and time consuming MAP disputes. “Low tax jurisdiction” Of the factors listed, the most significant is the last bullet point and, in particular, the “involvement of a low tax jurisdiction”. We believe the Government must give concrete guidance on the meaning of “low Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand Level 1, Carlaw Park, 12-16 Nicholls Lane, Parnell, PO Box 3334, Shortland Street, Auckland 1140, New Zealand 0800 469 422 P +64 9 430 8859 charteredaccountantsanz.com Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. tax jurisdiction”. One of the issues for all involved is whether “low tax” criterion refers solely to the corporate tax rate, or to preferences in the tax system more broadly. For example, we understand the US proposes to allow income from sales to non-residents to remain untaxed. Would this qualify it as a “low tax jurisdiction”? If not, what more would be needed? We believe the Government should publish lists of countries whose tax systems it considers to have the features of a “low tax jurisdiction” and a list of those whose it does not. This was an approach used successfully for many years under New Zealand’s former Foreign Investment Fund (FIF) rules. Specific lists would provide certainty for taxpayers as to the Government’s concerns. “Well paid employee” The Discussion Document also states one of the factors to consider would be an entity that is allocated a low amount of profit, on the basis that it is carrying our low value services, while having a number of “well paid employees”. In our view any legislation must be specific about what is meant by “well paid employee”. This is an example of vague and emotive terminology and should be replaced by or elaborated by reference to specific criteria. Abusive tax position penalty The Discussion Document states (paragraph 3.38) that, if the proposed rule is applied, an abusive tax position penalty would also apply. We are not convinced that this is appropriate, as the proposals seem intended to target arrangements that would not meet the criteria of “tax avoidance”. In addition, if a taxpayer may be subject to an ATP penalty (and thus double their tax bill), there is an onus on Inland Revenue to clearly articulate the rule. In addition, we believe IR must give greater access to binding rulings, within commercial time frames, to allow taxpayers certainty for their transactions. “But for” test The Discussion Document also proposes a “but for” test (paragraph 3.26). The rule will deem a PE to exist only if the non-resident would have had a PE but for the arrangement with the related party. The “but for” test is intended to prevent a PE being created where one does not exist in substance – consistent with paragraph 3.22, which states that preparatory or auxiliary activities would not be sufficient. We believe this test will be useful and should be specifically included in the legislation. We note that the definition of “preparatory or auxiliary” activities will change once the MLC is implemented but assume the reference is to the current definition. Consequences of application The Discussion Document states (at paragraph 3.36) that Officials expect that the application of the principles will result in a “fairly significant” amount of the sales income being attributable to the deemed Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand Level 1, Carlaw Park, 12-16 Nicholls Lane, Parnell, PO Box 3334, Shortland Street, Auckland 1140, New Zealand 0800 469 422 P +64 9 430 8859 charteredaccountantsanz.com Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. PE and a “material amount” of net profit to remain. It is important to clarify what is meant by “fairly significant” and “material amount”. We would like to discuss this further with you and work through some examples to clarify. We believe any legislation should also be accompanied by specific guidance as to how profit is to be attributed. In the absence of a clear statement, taxpayers are more likely to err on the side of caution and decide not to place any personnel in New Zealand. Such a decision to exit employees from New Zealand would be motivated not by a desire to pay no tax in New Zealand, but by the uncertainty inherent in a profit attribution. Moreover, future inbound investment into New Zealand depends on foreign investors being able to cost future commercial arrangements accurately. Foreign investors are generally willing to budget for a New Zealand tax liability but the calculation method must be clear. Interaction with New Zealand’s double tax agreements It is not clear how these proposed rules will fit into our existing treaty framework. The Discussion Document states (paragraph 3.42) that the proposed rule is an anti-avoidance rule that will apply only to an arrangement which defeats the purpose of the DTA’s PE provisions. However, as the Discussion Document acknowledges at paragraph 5.45, there is an increasing variety of commercial arrangements in multinational enterprises. We believe it will not always be obvious when a Government may consider an arrangement is intended to defeat the purpose of the DTA’s PE provisions. The concept of “commercial and economic reality” is not defined and is often problematic in practice. An unusual arrangement may be undertaken for genuine commercial reasons. It is critical that the proposed rule allows for a distinction between “novelty” and “avoidance”. The focus should be on artificial arrangements. If the proposals are implemented in the form proposed, they will leave taxpayers and advisors with a lack of clarity as to when an employee of an overseas company located in New Zealand would have function and responsibility sufficient to give rise to a PE. For example, would a person located in New Zealand who plays a principal role but does not conclude contracts constitute a PE here? The Discussion Document states (paragraph 3.39) that the ultimate aim of the proposed rule is to “discourage non-residents from entering into PE avoidance structures in the first place”. We understand this objective but believe there needs to be a balance between discouraging investors who would engage in avoidance behaviour and encouraging genuine foreign investment. The resulting lack of certainty may result in taxpayers and advisors taking a conservative approach and not basing employees in New Zealand, so that there is no risk of inadvertently creating a PE. This outcome does not seem sensible and would stifle growth and investment. We agree with the statement (paragraph 3.45) that taxpayers should not be able to rely on DTAs to protect tax avoidance arrangements. However, we believe that taxpayers should otherwise be entitled to rely on DTAs.

Chapter 4: Amendments to the source rules Permanent establishment source rule The permanent establishment source rule would give income a New Zealand source where the income is attributable to a PE in New Zealand, whether or not the income has a New Zealand source under any other source rule. We assume this rule is intended to refer to foreign income created by activities of the New Zealand PE that was hitherto not taxable here. We would appreciate some examples to illustrate how the rule would work in practice. Anti-avoidance source rule The Government proposes that a non-resident’s income would have a source in New Zealand if it would have a source, treating the non-resident’s wholly owned group as a single entity. This would effectively introduce a “force of attraction” type of rule into New Zealand legislation. Such a rule – where a country can impose tax on the total income of a business with a PE there, even if the income is not earned by that PE – would be out of step with New Zealand’s international tax framework, which taxes on PE and source, and goes further than the rules to be adopted via the MLC. We do not agree with this. The Discussion Document refers to section CV 1 in support of the proposal. It is our understanding that section CV 1 is a recharacterisation rule intended to prevent income splitting. For example, if a share dealer were to establish fifty different companies, each owning shares in a different company, in order to suggest that none of the companies are dealers. Section CV 1 would apply and consider the position of the group as a whole. We believe a recharacterisation rule to target fragmentation and contract splitting could be appropriate, however, this would be a significant extension of our current PE rules. Life insurance source rule We agree that the combination of section DR 3 and the wording of Article 7 in the DTAs with Canada, Russia and Singapore results in a more favourable tax treatment for life insurance businesses operating out of those countries. In our view, this would best be rectified by agreeing a protocol as part of the DTAs involved, rather than imposing a domestic law override. We also wonder whether there could be wider foreign policy implications of creating a domestic law override to a negotiated agreement. Royalty substitution rule We agree that a royalty substitution rule is not necessary in New Zealand. We already have an “in substance” royalty definition.

Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. Chapter 5: Strengthening the transfer pricing rules Including an explicit reference to the OECD transfer pricing guidelines In our view, most businesses and advisors, as well as Inland Revenue investigators, generally apply the latest OECD transfer pricing guidelines. We do not believe the proposals will result in a significant change in practice. However, the amendment will make any New Zealand reservations more important (for example, we do not view a branch as a separate entity). The legislative provision should specifically state that the guidelines apply domestically only to the extent that New Zealand has adopted those guidelines and do not apply to the extent of any reservations we have made. We suggest the guidelines we have adopted are put into regulations, with a separate schedule detailing the areas where New Zealand has entered reservations. It will be more imperative than ever that the Government remain engaged in the negotiations to ensure that the guidelines are adopted only to the extent that they are consistent with our domestic law and that the Government is able to enter reservations if that is not the case. Aligning the transfer pricing rules with economic substance We understand the rationale behind the proposal to introduce an “economic substance” test. However, we have concerns about how the test will be implemented in practice. The concept is a matter of judgement and, inevitably, there will be grey areas. By its nature transfer pricing documentation reflects an agreement between related parties. It is possible that a taxpayer would request a different arrangement, or different terms, if they were negotiating with a third party. We were recently given an example of a multinational entity with related entities in many countries. The MNE decided to enter into a new country and to license a third party in the new country to perform the services there. The same services were undertaken by related parties in all other countries. The presence of the new third party agreement immediately raises the issue of whether all related party agreements must now have the same terms as the third party agreement. We believe Inland Revenue should explain to interested parties how it intends to administer the concepts in practice (and how this administration will be resourced). For example, in the above situation, would all related party agreements need to have the same terms and conditions as the new third party agreement? What factors would the Commissioner take into account in making her decision? The Discussion Document states (paragraph 5.30) that the OECD guidelines focus on funding, intangible assets and legal risk. If the New Zealand Government also intends to focus on these three areas they should also be included in the legislation or, at the least, referred to in guidelines or a policy special report.

Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. Reconstruction The document states at paragraph 5.35 that the reconstruction should “make the related party dealing align with a commercially rational arrangement that would be agreed by independent businesses operating at arm’s length”. It goes on to say that “if the commercially rational alternative is that an independent business would not enter into a similar arrangement, then the arrangement may be disregarded”. We agree that prices should be arm’s length but do not agree that this proposed threshold is appropriate. In our view the appropriate test is whether a taxpayer would be “more likely than not” to have agreed such an arrangement with a third party. This should be specified in legislation. Paragraph 5.39 states that the reconstruction rules would be limited to “exceptional circumstances”, although not explicitly so. We believe the legislative provision should legislate for the “exceptional circumstances” if this is the intention. If the words “exceptional circumstances’ are not appropriate then another description should be used. The description in paragraph 5.40 of “aggressive and commercially irrational” arrangements may be appropriate if these terms were defined. Paragraph 5.40 of the Discussion Document encourages taxpayers to seek APAs to increase certainty. We appreciate the Government seeking to provide certainty to taxpayers given the inherent uncertainty of a reconstruction provision. However, for many taxpayers, obtaining an APA is not realistic. We understand from our members that securing an APA does not happen at the speed of commercial business – it is a long process, and often expensive. We understand from speaking to our members that many attempts to procure APAs are abandoned due to the length of time taken and none we spoke to had succeeded in obtaining a bilateral APA. If Inland Revenue wishes taxpayers to obtain greater certainty through APAs we believe it must act to make the process as streamlined as possible, including resourcing a large team dedicated to performing this work. Arm’s length conditions We understand the reasons for the proposal to amend the legislation to refer to arm’s length “conditions” rather than an arm’s length “amount”. In our view it is sensible to view the entire agreement rather than the price in isolation (and we understand this currently happens in practice). However, the proposal again adopts the Australian approach which we believe would involve significant overreach. As with the “economic substance” proposal, this one is also based on section 815.130 of the Australian Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. The full text of the section requires that one disregards the form of the arrangement to the extent that it is inconsistent with the substance and also provides (in subsections 3 and 4) as follows: “ ... if: 1. independent entities dealing wholly independently with one another in comparable circumstances would not have entered into the actual commercial or financial relations; and Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand Level 1, Carlaw Park, 12-16 Nicholls Lane, Parnell, PO Box 3334, Shortland Street, Auckland 1140, New Zealand 0800 469 422 P +64 9 430 8859 charteredaccountantsanz.com Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 2. independent entities dealing wholly independently with one another in comparable circumstances would have entered into other commercial or financial relations; and 3. those other commercial or financial relations differ in substance from the actual commercial or financial relations; the identification of the \*arm's length conditions must be based on those other commercial or financial relations. (4) Despite subsection (1), if independent entities dealing wholly independently with one another in comparable circumstances would not have entered into commercial or financial relations, the identification of the \*arm's length conditions is to be based on that absence of commercial or financial relations.” As we have stated under “economic substance”, above, in most cases is likely that the arrangement would be different if it had been entered into by a third party; it is also likely that the parties would not have entered into the arrangement had it had not been with a related party. Businesses do not always negotiate the best deal every time. Sometimes they simply need to move forward. As we have stated under “reconstruction”, above, we believe this this proposed threshold is uncommercial and therefore not appropriate. In our view the appropriate test is whether a taxpayer would be “more likely than not” to have agreed such an arrangement with a third party. This should be specified in legislation Burden of proof The document proposes the burden of proof be reversed for transfer pricing issues and be placed on the taxpayer. We understand this is also the position in Australia. We appreciate the taxpayer has better information about their affairs than the Commissioner does. However, we understand that the reason for the burden of proof being on the Commissioner in transfer pricing cases is due to the nature of the issues involved. Transfer pricing issues are often matters of judgement. The Commissioner and taxpayers use benchmarks and comparables to show that the arrangement is “arm’s length”. The Commissioner has access to the tax records of every taxpayer in New Zealand, and has access to offshore information from overseas tax authorities, so can be in the best position to determine whether the arrangement is similar to one that has been entered into elsewhere. We do not believe the burden of proof should simply be reversed. If the burden is to be shifted to that taxpayer then, at the least, the burden should be on the Commissioner in situations where she is using data that is not available to the taxpayer.

Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. Transfer pricing documentation We understand most multinational enterprises over the proposed turnover threshold provide this information already and we do not have a problem with the requirements being formalised in legislation. We agree compliance costs will be low because most or all affected taxpayers undertake this work currently. Compliance costs can often be an issue in transfer pricing requirements and we believe the proposal is smart and pragmatic. Time bar The Discussion Document proposes that the time bar for transfer pricing assessments be increased from four years to seven years, noting that this would be consistent with other jurisdictions. The table on page 37 gives information on the time bars for ten other countries. Of these, Australia and Canada have the four year / seven year split; all others seem to have the same or a similar time bar for transfer pricing matters as for other tax matters. Given this, we do not believe that consistency with other jurisdictions is, in itself, a reason to make the change. We understand Officials’ concerns regarding the complexity of modern commercial arrangements but in our view these concerns should be addressed by increasing resource to investigate and deal with arrangements at the time they occur. We do not believe spreading the work over an additional three years to be a useful solution. Increasing the time bar also seems inconsistent with the direction Inland Revenue is heading in its customer-centric approach. We understand one of the goals of the Business Transformation project is to provide more “real time” advice, information and assurance. A key aim is to encourage taxpayers to “get it right from the start”. In addition, Inland Revenue’s compliance management approach for multinational enterprises has been to move to resolving any issues with commercial transactions in real time. It is doing this by providing more pre-filing reviews and risk reviews. In our view this is working well. The time bar has remained at four years but many taxpayers are now able to achieve practical certainty within one year. The proposal to move the time bar for transfer pricing to seven years is out of step with and other Inland Revenue initiatives and, in our view, is a retrograde step. If this move were to go ahead it would be imperative that the change were prospective only – i.e. would include only transactions and documentation from when the change were enacted and not documentation from six years ago. Applying the transfer pricing rules to investors acting in concert We understand Officials’ wish to align the “associated persons” rules for thin capitalisation and transfer pricing. However, we are concerned that, as a practical matter, many minor investors would not be involved in Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand Level 1, Carlaw Park, 12-16 Nicholls Lane, Parnell, PO Box 3334, Shortland Street, Auckland 1140, New Zealand 0800 469 422 P +64 9 430 8859 charteredaccountantsanz.com Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ).

Chapter 6: Administrative measures The new administrative measures proposed generally provide more incentives for taxpayers to comply with Inland Revenue requirements and more sanctions when they do not comply. We question whether the new administrative measures are needed when most multinational enterprises cooperate with Inland Revenue. However, if such measures are to be implemented, we agree that this should be done by way of legislation and not by reliance on administrative practice. It is our view that any increase in administrative sanctions must be accompanied by corresponding measures to encourage and assist taxpayers to comply. In practical terms, this means initiatives to give taxpayers certainty that they are doing the right thing, such as greater access to rulings; real time Commissioner’s opinions; greater access to earlier signoffs via risk reviews; and assistance from Inland Revenue – from staff or a website – when required. As we have previously discussed, the Inland Revenue restructure provides an opportunity for the Commissioner to redeploy resources to areas where they will be most needed going forward. In addition, in our experience, most multinational enterprises cooperate with Inland Revenue and so we question the need to introduce new administrative measures to encourage cooperation. In terms of the specific proposals, we do not agree that Inland Revenue should have the power to unilaterally fine taxpayers for not providing information. Fines should be imposed only by an independent body such as a court. If the Government wishes Inland Revenue to have the power to impose fines we believe, at the least, that this power should exist only with the signoff from an independent party such as a TRA judge, the Solicitor-General or the Attorney-General.

BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidanceforms part of an interconnected package, alongsideBEPS – Strengthening our interest limitation rules andNew Zealand’s implementation of the multilateral convention to implement tax treaty related measures to prevent BEPS.The package is a powerful combination, which will put New Zealand at the forefront of worldwide approaches to BEPS implementation. This submission should therefore be read alongside our submissions on the other elements of the package. Permanent establishment avoidance and amendments to source rules We agree that economic activities which should result in a permanent establishment (“PE”) in New Zealand should be subject to tax here. Nevertheless, the discussion document does not provide a compelling case for the adoption of measures in domestic legislation regarding PEs and source-based taxation. In general, we support New Zealand’s implementation of the multilateral convention to implement tax treaty related measures to prevent BEPS. 1 As elaborated in Appendix A, the multilateral convention is the best opportunity for a coordinated international approach, with significant risks inherent in New Zealand departing from international norms through the introduction of standalone rules. New Zealand’s position can be distinguished from that of Australia and the United Kingdom. Those countries’ early action has had the effect that their equivalent rules will be in place for a period of several years before the multilateral convention applies: the impact of their rules includes being a transitional bridge for an interim period. New Zealand’s later application means this argument has little force here. 1 See our submission regardingNew Zealand’s implementation of the multilateral convention to implement tax treaty related measures to prevent BEPS. #006 A member firm of Ernst & Young Global Limited 2 Should New Zealand seek to introduce the PE and source rules proposed, it will be important that legislation be drafted with great clarity as to scope and application. Our experience in the United Kingdom and Australia shows that poorly drafted rules lead to disputes, with uncertain outcomes for taxpayers and deteriorating relationships between multinationals and tax administrations. Further, if the rules are adopted, there should be a substantial lead time before they take effect. Multinational groups often structure their supply chain consistently across all operating territories. Restructuring will be complex and will require time. As set out in Appendix B, we have a particular concern that amendments to the source rule overreach: they could tax foreign sourced income of non-residents in contravention of New Zealand’s international tax framework. Transfer pricing We support better alignment with Australian transfer pricing rules given the high level of trans-Tasman investment and degree of business integration - but only to the extent those rules remain consistent with the principles set down by the OECD and do not seek to tax a greater than arm’s length proportion of profit. That means we support aligning transfer pricing rules with economic substance and giving Inland Revenue the power to reconstruct transactions. Reconstruction should, however, only be an option in exceptional circumstances and this, or similar, wording should be included in legislation. The Commissioner must not treat unsuccessful commercial decisions as irrational and our support is conditional upon appropriate safeguards to protect taxpayers. It is important for any changes to be prospective, both in law and practice. It is not appropriate for Inland Revenue to apply the 2016 revisions to the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations (“OECD Guidelines”) to transactions that occurred before the publication of the revised Guidelines. If the taxpayer is to bear the burden of proof in relation to transfer pricing, we consider that Inland Revenue should be more prescriptive around what is required by way of evidence. Documentation requirements should be set out in some formal way (rather than through webpages on the transfer pricing section of Inland Revenue’s website). We see little justification for an extension to time bar for transfer pricing enquiries. New Zealand’s current four year time bar is by no means out of step with other countries, with any extension running contrary to the real time approach adopted as a part of Business Transformation. With the expansion of Inland Revenue’s powers under the proposed transfer pricing rules, it will become more important for specific guidance to be available to taxpayers and advisors. Guidance would be welcome regarding documentation requirements, comparable and benchmarking, and the circumstances in which particular transfer pricing methods are favoured by Inland Revenue. This should be provided by way of detailed rulings or interpretation statements rather than informal website changes. We expand these points in Appendix C. A member firm of Ernst & Young Global Limited 3 Administrative measures Collection of information in transfer pricing audits is time consuming and draws heavily on both Inland Revenue and taxpayer resources. We are not convinced that granting the Commissioner extensive additional powers will resolve the difficulties. Instead many of the proposed administrative measures could better be resolved by additional resourcing of Inland Revenue’s transfer pricing and investigations teams. Our comments on the specific measures proposed are provided in Appendix D. Future engagement The consultation period following release of the discussion documents has been short. To that end, our submission is intended to flag issues which we consider require further analysis, and, where appropriate make recommendations on the approach. We look forward to continuing to engage in discussion on the proposals throughout the coming policy-making and legislative stages. We understand that these submissions may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982, and consent to the submissions being made publicly available. We would appreciate the opportunity to discuss our submissions in person. Please contact David Snell (david.snell@nz.ey.com, +64 21 845 361) in this regard. Yours sincerely Aaron Quintal Partner – Tax Advisory Services Ernst & Young Limited A member firm of Ernst & Young Global Limited 4 Appendix A – Permanent Establishment Avoidance Multilateral instrument should be implemented before considering further permanent establishment reforms We agree that economic activities which should result in a permanent establishment in New Zealand should be subject to tax here and support a rule which does not widen the accepted international definition of a PE in substance (paragraph 3.2). New Zealand’s implementation of theMultilateral convention to implement tax treaty related measures to prevent BEPS has the potential to address most, if not all, of these concerns. On this basis, we suggest efforts should focus on its implementation and resultant impact before introducing potentially wide ranging domestic PE and source reforms, with uncertain application. Should that approach not be adopted, it will be of critical importance that legislation be drafted with great clarity as to scope and application. We are concerned that where the wording adopted is in any way ambiguous or uncertain this would lead to significant taxpayer uncertainty around the validity of global operating models and a significant increase in the number of disputes between taxpayers, Inland Revenue and other tax authorities. We have a further concern that the proposals will not be consistent with our existing double tax agreement (“DTA”) commitments and will therefore fail to work in practice. Our concerns are driven by the experience to date with comparable rules in Australia and the United Kingdom. Our understanding is that uncertainty in the wording of the corresponding legislation in these territories has led to: ►A significant rise in the number of cross-border tax disputes. ►Concern among taxpayers that the Australian Tax Office and Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs are “cherry picking’ arguments, leading to greater incidence of the rule being invoked than stated at the time of introduction. This is in contrast to a principled approach taking into account the underlying commercial substance of a given arrangement. ►Apparent administrative difficulties within the Australian Tax Office, evidenced by delays in providing guidance around its diverted profits tax. ►An increase in compliance costs, with costly restructuring imposed on global supply chains for little benefit to revenue authorities or multinationals. ►The threat of the legislation being used to compel taxpayers into costly and impractical changes to their operating models, notwithstanding that there may be strong technical support for the tax position. ►Consequent damage to the relationship and mutual trust between taxpayers and tax authorities. A member firm of Ernst & Young Global Limited 5 Application of the rule (paragraphs 3.20 to 3.26) Need for transitional rule (paragraph 3.20) Paragraph 3.20 provides that the proposed rule will apply to income years beginning on or after the date of enactment. We submit there should be a transitional rule to enable taxpayers to structure out of arrangements that would give rise to a deemed PE. The rule should apply only with effect to income years beginning three years on or after the date of enactment, as reorganising global supply chains can be a complex business, with New Zealand unlikely to be central to many multinational enterprises’ structures. There will be taxpayers subject to these rules with existing investment structures that have previously been reviewed by Inland Revenue, in some cases perhaps having obtained rulings, tax audit sign-offs or Advance Pricing Agreements (“APAs”). Formerly compliant taxpayers should be given time to comply with any new rules. In particular, it is common for multinational groups to structure their supply chain or operating model on a consistent basis across all operating territories. Restructuring in accordance with the proposed New Zealand rule will often not be as simple as amending New Zealand aspects and will often require fundamental change to global operations. This, by definition, has flow on consequences (commercial and tax) in a large number of territories and it follows that this is not something that can (or should) be undertaken quickly. It is considered inappropriate to impose such a short time frame for realignment (with the threat of 100% penalty if that timing is not met) for many or most taxpayers. A related point is considered below in the “consequences of application” section of this submission regarding the imposition of a 100% penalty for currently compliant structures in the absence of grandparenting. We have particular concerns that Inland Revenue may seek to assess companies planning to restructure ahead of these changes. There is a possible case for an Operational Statement regarding implementation. Otherwise companies will be unwilling to change arrangements as this could be seen as an admission of tax avoidance. New concepts will require explanation (paragraphs 3.21 and 3.24) Any legislation needs to be sufficiently clear in what it is intended to do to ensure taxpayers are capable of complying with it at a reasonable outlay of time and cost. In particular the legislation needs to clarify: ►The rule will apply where there is a related entity that is either “associated” or “commercially dependant (sic)” (paragraph 3.21). The discussion document does not provide in-depth analysis as to the meaning of “commercially dependent” - although this appears to be quite broad. There will be many situations where an entity is arguably commercially dependent on a major customer, even though the agent is independent. For example, would an independent agent who received over 50% of revenue from a single foreign entity be “commercially dependent” on that entity? The “commercially dependent” terminology could also pick up relationships such as independent If the PE avoidance rule is adopted, there should be a transitional rule to enable taxpayers to structure out of arrangements that would give rise to a deemed PE. Inland Revenue should provide guidance on the meaning of various new concepts which form part of the rule – notably “commercially dependent”, “in connection with”, “low tax jurisdiction”, “high paid employee” and “specialised services”. A member firm of Ernst & Young Global Limited 6 distributors whose business is limited to one brand, which we assume is not the intent of the rules. A car dealership would be an example of a commercially dependent, but independent, agent, albeit one likely already to have a taxable presence in New Zealand. Alternatively, is “commercially dependent” intended to be consistent with the dependent agent clause in New Zealand’s DTAs? We note that New Zealand businesses, given its relatively small market size, could be particularly susceptible to triggering “commercial dependence” where this is sufficiently widely drafted to catch arm’s length dealings with major or sole offshore customers. Given New Zealand business’ unique bargaining position (or lack thereof) as a function of relative size, particular care should be taken to ensure this concept is not drafted so as to apply far more broadly than intended. ►The rule is to apply where a related entity carries out an activity in New Zealand “in connection” with a particular sale (paragraph 3.21). The discussion document does not address what constitutes “in connection”. This is a broad term and may need more clarification. At present, it is unclear whether there must be a direct causal connection that actually brings about the sale or whether an indirect connection (e.g., any activity which facilitates the sale) is sufficient. We note Australia and the United Kingdom have taken different approaches to this issue, with Australia requiring a direct connection. We would suggest that the Australian “direct” connection approach should be favoured to ensure nebulous connections to sales activity cannot be caught by virtue or “mere” or ancillary connection. ►Indicators of a PE include the involvement of a “low tax jurisdiction” (paragraph 3.24). It will be important to define this term. Does “low tax jurisdiction” mean lower than 28%, 20%, 15% or other? Many corporate tax rates have fallen in recent years, with the United Kingdom currently at 20% but scheduled to fall to 17% in 2020 one example. Is the tax base, as well as rate, a relevant factor? Proposals to introduce a border tax adjustment, combined with a reduced rate, could potentially bring the United States into any definition. There could also be issues regarding jurisdictions which have a low company tax rate but instead tax other bases (such as a resource rent tax or royalties), with state-level taxes, or with tax rate changes over time. ►PE indicators also include the existence of “a number of well paid employees”. Clarity regarding what is meant by a “well paid employee” would be welcome. It can also be argued that a combination of well paid employees and low profits is a transfer pricing, rather than PE, issue. ►Finally, the term “specialised services” is unclear. What are “specialised services” and why is that indicative of a PE? Turning again to the concept of ancillary services, these are often highly specialised and it is suggested that often a high degree of specialisation would support significant separation from sales activity. Arrangements involving third party channel providers (paragraphs 3.27 to 3.31) The concept of “sales promotion and services” is crucial to the application of the rule to arrangements involving third party channel providers and should therefore by explained. For example, if a related party organises a tradeshow for a number of different suppliers, would this constitute “sales promotion and services”? Consequences of application (paragraphs 3.32 to 3.39) More guidance is needed in respect of what would constitute “salespromotionandservices” More guidance is neededonInland Revenue’s approach to profit attribution. Applying a 100% abusive tax position appears harsh given the lack of grandparenting for existing structures which fully comply with current law. A member firm of Ernst & Young Global Limited 7 Paragraph 3.35 notes that profits attributable to the deemed PE will be determined by normal profit attribution principles. We have no issue with this statement, but Inland Revenue guidance on normal profit attribution principles is limited. If Inland Revenue were to apply a method different to that of a trading partner, then double taxation and further pressure on themutual agreement procedure (“MAP”) are likely outcomes. That concern is reinforced by the statement in paragraph 3.36 that application of normal profit attribution principles will “result in a fairly significant amount of the sales income being attributable to the deemed PE” in most cases. It is not clear to us that this should be the outcome: if, as will often be the case, little value is added in New Zealand, then the attributed profit will be small. Expenses will also be attributed to New Zealand, rather than attribution being based on gross sales income alone. As an obvious example, it would be expected that an unrelated New Zealand supplier, albeit one with a degree of “commercial dependence” or reliance on a dominant customer, would negotiate at arm’s length to arrive at a remuneration level fairly reflecting its value additive functionality. We would be concerned were the proposed deemed PE rule seek to re-examine or recharacterise commercial economics negotiated by arm’s length counterparties. We also note that New Zealand would intend to impose withholding tax on any royalty paid by the non- resident in respect of supplies made through the deemed PE. Such a royalty may well relate in part to other supplies made by other jurisdictions. We anticipate that apportionment would be necessary, which would again be difficult to calculate. Detailed guidance as to an apportionment methodology would be necessary should this aspect by introduced. Paragraph 3.38 states that the current 100% abusive tax position penalty will apply for the purposes of the deemed PE rule. This appears to be an unduly harsh penalty for arrangements which are in compliance with current law for which it is currently proposed that no grandparenting is available. We consider Inland Revenue is significantly underestimating the time it will take for a multinational enterprise to reorganise its global supply chain. We note the comments in the discussion document around a significant “lead time” between now and the introduction of the law. Notwithstanding such lead time we emphasise that there is currently no draft legislation or certainty around the time gap between publishing such draft legislation and effective date of final law. It is unrealistic to assume or expect taxpayers to restructure global operating models on the basis of a discussion document given the inherent uncertainty of what the actual law will say and the significant global commercial implications such a restructure would have. We recommend that the potential for grandparenting or non-application periods for particular taxpayers be revisited. Interaction with New Zealand’s double tax agreements (paragraphs 3.40 to 3.45) We agree that taxpayers should not be able to rely on DTAs to protect tax avoidance relations. We are not convinced, however, that the proposed anti-avoidance rule will only capture arrangements which should be treated as avoidance arrangements for the purposes of our DTAs. The proposed permanent establishment avoidance rules maybe inconsistent with New Zealand’s DTA network, thereby creating uncertainty, deterring investment and undermining confidence in New Zealand’s DTAs. A member firm of Ernst & Young Global Limited 8 In fact, the breadth of the proposed unilateral approach is likely to reduce confidence in the integrity of New Zealand’s double tax agreements and to create uncertainty for foreign investment into New Zealand. There is inherent inconsistency between the alignment with suggested OECD approaches to international taxation (including but not limited to the adoption of the multilateral convention, including an enhanced PE definition) and the introduction of New Zealand-specific deemed PE provisions such as that suggested. In addition, the proposals are arguably inconsistent with the generally accepted OECD approach of separate entity taxation that applies in respect of associated enterprises and has been agreed to by New Zealand in all of its DTAs. It is unclear how the proposals will apply in relation to the interaction between deemed PEs and the operation of the arm’s length principle in respect of existing related party transactions. The proposals could potentially apply to transactions to which no actual New Zealand taxpayer is party. More specifically, the proposals would impose new tests that are inconsistent with New Zealand’s obligations under various existing DTAs. Tax could potentially be payable where a multinational operates a business structure that complies with existing DTA concepts of PE, within integrity measures agreed in our treaties and which meets the legal substance requirements of both parties to the DTA. Where this occurs, it is likely that double taxation will occur, with MAP invoked. It appears possible to us that competent authorities would rule in favour of treaty provisions and the proposal’s purported domestic law override would be invalid. This uncertainty would reduce the effectiveness of the proposals as a base maintenance measure, while worsening the impact of the measures on inbound investment. In substance, little revenue may be gained while substantial inbound investment using new or innovative business models may be deterred. A member firm of Ernst & Young Global Limited 9 Appendix B – Amendments to source rules Permanent establishment source rule has potential to overreach (paragraphs 4.18 to 4.22) Income attributable to a PE and royalties that New Zealand can tax under a DTA will automatically be deemed to have a New Zealand source under the new rule. While we understand that the intention in respect of this aspect is to ensure that there is not a “gap” between PE attributed income under New Zealand tax treaties and that may be taxed under our domestic source rules. However, it appears possible to us that such a rule could be indeed be drafted so as to deem, for example, a New Zealand source for the foreign-sourced income of non-residents. Taxing such income would be inconsistent with New Zealand’s longstanding international tax framework and would go significantly beyond the stated purpose of the amendment. A DTA should not be used to create a tax liability where none would exist under domestic law. The PE definitions contained in individual treaties will be used for the purposes of this rule (paragraph 4.19). Before final decisions are made on the design of the source rule, it would be helpful for Inland Revenue to analyse the definitions of PE across our treaty network, as we anticipate these will contain significant differences around, for example, building sites (6/12 months), natural resources, standing timber, or operating substantial equipment. Industry specific guidance may be helpful, as some sectors (such as film or technology) are particularly subject to disputes regarding PE status and income source. Anti-avoidance source rule (paragraphs 4.23 to 4.28) We have no objection to a targeted anti-fragmentation and contract-splitting rule, consistent with the OECD’s BEPS measures aimed at countering PE avoidance strategies. The risk is that a rule treating the non-resident’s income as having a source in New Zealand if it would have had a source, considering the non-resident’s wholly owned group as a single entity will go beyond an anti-fragmentation rule. We consider that where a non-resident is earning income that has no domestic source there should be no tax. This is not a PE avoidance issue as in the absence of a New Zealand PE there is no need to even refer to the DTA. If drafted too broadly, it could seek to tax not only the New Zealand sourced income of the PE but also income derived by other group members with a New Zealand source where those other group members have no PE here (in effect, a “force of attraction” approach). We do not anticipate this is the intent but would welcome clarity on this point. Life insurance source rule (paragraphs 4.29 to 4.35) While we understand what this proposed change is seeking to achieve, we consider this would be better achieved by a change to the relevant DTAs rather than via domestic law creating another boundary for life insurers to navigate. Thepermanent establishment source rule could tax foreign sourced income of non-residents, in contravention of New Zealand’s international tax framework. There is a risk that the anti-avoidance source rule will extendto situations beyond those targeted by the OECD BEPS Action Plan. The life insurance source rules should be changed by way of renegotiating the relevant DTAs. A member firm of Ernst & Young Global Limited 10 Appendix C - Transfer Pricing Broad support for direction of reform We broadly supports better alignment of New Zealand transfer pricing rules with Article 9 of New Zealand’s DTAs and the OECD Guidelines, which are an aid to interpret Article 9: Associated enterprises). Better alignment with Australian transfer pricing rules makes sense given the significant investment by Australian companies and to mitigate the potential for double taxation – but only to the extent those rules remain consistent with the principles set down by the OECD and do not seek to tax a greater than arm’s length proportion of profit. Transfer pricing definition (Paragraphs 5.7 to 5.9) At paragraph 5.7, the document states that transfer pricing is a strategy used by multinationals to “shift profits out of New Zealand and reduce their worldwide tax bills”. We are concerned this interpretation indicates a mind-set that multinationals generally target New Zealand taxable income through their transfer pricing strategy, which overstates the significance of New Zealand in global terms and understates the rigour imposed by the arm’s length principle. Transfer prices rules are defined in the 2016 revisions to the OECD Guidelines 2 as being concerned with determining the conditions, including the price, for transaction within an MNE group resulting in the allocation of profits to group companies in different countries. Transfer pricing might therefore be more neutrally defined as the setting of those prices (whether or not that results in the shifting of profits or a reduction in worldwide tax bills). Multinational enterprises cannot help but engage in transfer pricing, the concept itself is not tax driven and should not be used in derogative terms. The in-market distributor structure (paragraph 5.16 and Appendix) Paragraph 5.16 of the discussion document refers to example 4 in the appendix, which relates to the use of an in-market LRD in New Zealand. The LRD model is one commonly used throughout the world, including in New Zealand. It is especially prominent in the pharmaceutical and technology industries, where a large amount of research and development (“R&D”) happens earlier in the supply chain in foreign jurisdictions. The distribution activity undertaken in New Zealand happens at the end of the supply chain and is often relatively low in terms of the value-adding functions contributing to the system profits of the enterprise. 2 Executive summary,Aligning transfer pricing outcomes with value creation:OECDFinal report on Actions 8-10. The in-market distributor structure given in example 4 is overly simplistic. It leads to an interpretation that the Government considers all distributors with low profits to be problematic, where they happen to be performing distribution activities for a procurement hub in a jurisdiction with a lower corporate tax rate. Inland Revenue should clarify that using a limited-risk distributor (“LRD”) has commercial justification. Use of the example without additional necessary factual information (e.g., regarding the risks actually borne by the respective parties) otherwise creates uncertainty. A member firm of Ernst & Young Global Limited 11 OECD Guidelines (Chapter IX) recognise the LRD model and that companies may convert from full risk to limited risk models. Of course, consideration needs to be given to risk allocation and the revisions proscribe more emphasis on the economic substance of the structure. The structure should not be viewed as lacking “commercial reality” 3 simply because it is not a structure commonly seen between independent parties - yet the trade-off of risk and return is a fundamental commercial principle. At paragraph 5.31, the discussion document quotes the revised OECD Guidelines as endorsing a substance-over-form approach to the allocation of risk. Viewed in isolation, this paragraph might suggest that contractual assumption of risk is not relevant to a transfer pricing analysis. However, the OECD Guidelines confirms that the contractual terms are the starting point in “delineating” a transaction, but not the only consideration. 4 We endorse OECD’s initiatives to ensure that transfer pricing outcomes are consistent with the location of value creation. We also support that under BEPS Actions 8-10 revisions, structures will need to be tested to ensure the pricing aligns with the economic substance of the transaction. However, the discussion document’s commentary on the LRD structure is broad and is concerning in its wholesale designation of the LRD model as a form of profit-shifting (paragraph 5.16). The implication seems to be that, in most cases, LRDs structures lack commercial reality and most risks are controlled by the New Zealand entity. Our experience is that invariably a substantial proportion of market risk is assumed and indeed controlled by the foreign principal (or other affiliates offshore). More often, marketing strategy is conducted offshore and tight control maintained over marketing spend, inventory levels and major business decisions of the LRD. The New Zealand subsidiary will often undertake market activation activity rather than development. State of the law and reference to the OECD guidelines (Paragraphs 5.19 to 5.23) At paragraph 5.23, the discussion document states the OECD Guidelines are “generally consistent with our existing law” and that “Adding a reference to the OECD guidelines into New Zealand’s transfer pricing legislation will simply clarify our existing practice of using the latest guidelines”. We have previously argued in disputes with Inland Revenue that the current transfer pricing rules are not aligned with Article 9 and therefore some aspects of the OECD Guidelines do not sit well with the current New Zealand transfer pricing rules (similar to Australia following the decision in theSNF 5 case). While much of the OECD Guidelines are useful in assisting to interpret the arm’s length principle under New Zealand transfer pricing law, there have been some areas of controversy caused by the non- alignment, notably around the extent to which arm’s length prices should be subject to interpolated arm’s length conditions. We do not agree that the OECD Guidelines can simply be referenced as an authority under current law. Inland Revenue practice of using the OECD Guidelines will not be 3 Appendix, Example 4, page 51. 4 See paragraph 1.78 of the revisions to section D.1.2.1.2 of the OECD Guidelines. 5 Commissioner of Taxation v SNF (Australia) Pty Ltd \[2011\] FCAFC 74. We support adding a reference to the OECD Guidelines into New Zealand’s transfer pricing legislation but dispute this reference will “simply clarify our existing practice”: it is not clear that Parliament intended the OECD Guidelines to be used as an interpretative aid to existing rules. Any law change to incorporate the OECD Guidelines should be prospective - both in law and in practice. It is not appropriate for Inland Revenue to apply the 2016 revisions to the OECD Guidelines to transactions that occurred before the publication of the revised Guidelines. A member firm of Ernst & Young Global Limited 12 consistent with the existing transfer pricing law in all circumstances. It should be clear that any law change to incorporate the OECD Guidelines is prospective - both in law and in practice. We have concerns that some of the 2016 revisions to OECD Guidelines brought about through Actions 8-10 are already being referenced by Inland Revenue for years prior to 2016. Concerns centre on the focus on economic substance, despite the discussion document confirming that existing transfer pricing legislation is focused on the legal form of arrangements (paragraph 5.15). We are not comfortable with Inland Revenue’s current practice of applying all the 2016 revisions to the OECD Guidelines to preceding years. Such practice is applying changes retrospectively. This is of further concern given we do not consider OECD Guidelines fully align with existing transfer pricing law, as noted above. The BEPS initiatives in Actions 8-10 are a substantial revamp of the OECD Guidelines and the revisions made in 2016 to the OECD Guidelines should not be applied retrospectively. A taxpayer cannot be expected to forecast substantive changes to OECD Guidelines when determining tax positions prior to 2016.Taxpayers take tax positions based on the information available to them, and it is unreasonable for Inland Revenue to challenge these tax positions armed with hindsight and a set of guidelines that never existed at the relevant time. In support of our concerns regarding Inland Revenue’s approach towards incorporating the OCED Guidelines, we refer to legislative history. The current transfer pricing rules were substantially enacted by the Income Tax Act 1994 Amendment Act (No. 3) 1995, and came into effect at the beginning of the 1996/1997 income year. 6 The rules effectively legislated the arm’s length principle which had long since been a feature of Article 9 of New Zealand’s double tax agreements (“DTAs”). In turn, the DTAs are largely modelled on the OECD Model Tax Convention. Our domestic legislation in fact makes no reference to the OECD Guidelines. Parliament’s original intention 7 was for the five available methods set out in section GC 13 to be consistent with the then OECD Guidelines (first released in 1995). Parliament did not, however, choose to make explicit reference to the OECD guidelines. Without explicit reference in the legislation, it is not clear how the 2016 OECD Guidelines are relevant for the purposes of the New Zealand transfer pricing rules. We note that the position of the OECD Guidelines is unique in that they are not binding on member states of the OECD, and have not been ratified in domestic New Zealand law. The extent to which Inland Revenue uses them as an extrinsic aid to the legislation, assisting in the interpretation of section GC 13, is questionable. It is not supported by the legislation itself which provides no indication of how the five available methods are to be interpreted. Since the passing of the legislation, the OECD Guidelines have expanded and changed considerably, most recently through the implementation of Actions 8-10 and 13 of the OECD’s BEPS project. The drafters of section GC 13 could not have foreseen the changes that have since taken place. As shown by the legislative history of section DB 34 regarding research and development, 8 it seems unlikely that Parliament would have contemplated the Income Tax Act 2007 be interpreted in light of 6 Tax Information Bulletin \[1210-110\]Arm’s Length Principle, 1 October 2000. 7 Set out in the commentary on the Taxation (International Tax) Bill, August 1995. 8 Section DB 34 which allows a deduction for expenditure incurred on research or development where that expense has been recognised for financial reporting purposes. Section DB 34 not only refers explicitly to the relevant reporting standard but has been consistently updated to reflect changes in generally accepted accounting practice and in the specific reporting standards. Notably, changes have been made in the Taxation (Business Taxation and Remedial Matters) Act 2007 and the Taxation (Consequential Rate and Remedial Matters) Act 2009. The failure of Parliament to consider incorporating specific reference to the OECD Guidelines materially weakens any Government arguments that the Guidelines should be seen as a strong aid to interpretation of section GC 13. A member firm of Ernst & Young Global Limited 13 whatever guidance OECD produce on a prospective basis. Parliament did not delegate responsibility for New Zealand’s transfer pricing rules to OECD officials; rather, it took note those in place at the date of enactment in the design of New Zealand’s rules. Aligning the rules with economic substance (paragraphs 5.24 to 5.33), requirement for arm’s length conditions (paragraphs 5.41 and 5.42) We have no issues with aligning the rules to economic substance in principle. In most respects the rules are already aligned to economic substance; present transfer pricing analyses necessarily involve preparation of a functional analysis. However, reference to “arm’s length conditions” would considerably broaden the scope of section GC 13. Inserting a rule to specify that taxpayers are required to take into account the relevant conditions that a notional third party would be willing to accept is likely to have a subjective and uncertain impact on many arrangements. While the Commissioner is entitled to make enquiries in assessing arm’s length terms and conditions, a commercial negotiation will take into account many factors. Given that the burden of proof will fall on taxpayers to show that the conditions of their arrangements are arm’s length, it is important that Inland Revenue is clear about what is required of taxpayers. Reconstruction of transactions (paragraphs 5.34 to 5.40) The discussion document proposes to grant Inland Revenue a wider mandate to reconstruct arrangements than that contemplated by OECD, similar to that adopted in Australia. According to paragraph 5.39, the proposed reconstruction rules would not be explicitly limited to “exceptional circumstances”. Dropping the “exceptional circumstances” condition (which exists in the OECD Guidelines 9 ) suggests that Inland Revenue would seek to reconstruct a transaction if a taxpayer cannot “benchmark” those particular dealings against those seen in the market between independent parties. We have concerns that taxpayers will be required to demonstrate that such dealings occur between 9 D.2.1.121-125. We agree with the proposed changes toalign the rules with economic substance. This reflects a step-change in the law and drafting of the legislation should set out unambiguously what is required of taxpayers, in order to demonstrate that all conditions of their transfer pricing arrangements are arm’s length. We submit that the test under which the Commissioner should be able to reconstruct transfer pricing arrangements must have a high threshold, consistent with the OECD Guidelines. New Zealand’s legislation should refer to “exceptional circumstances” or provide similar wording that ensures it is only used where the arrangement is aggressive and/or commercially irrational. Adjustments which propose to reconstruct transactions should have a high level of sign-off internally within Inland Revenue, in the same way as our domestic avoidance laws. In conducting investigations, Inland Revenue looks at such arrangements retrospectively. It is important that the merits of any commercial decisions taken prospectively are not labelled irrational by the Commissioner who has the benefit of hindsight simply because they turn out to be unsuccessful. Inland Revenue should release robust guidelines to assist taxpayers on factors it will take into account in considering reconstruction; along with useful examples. A member firm of Ernst & Young Global Limited 14 unrelated parties and the transaction is “commercially rational”. Non-recognition or reconstruction will inevitably result in more international disputes and need for international dispute resolution. The revised OECD Guidelines emphasise the problems inherent in reconstruction. Specifically, paragraph 1.123 of the revised part D.2 of the OECD Guidelines states: “Restructuring of legitimate business transactions would be a wholly arbitrary exercise the inequity of which could be compounded by double taxation created where the other tax administration does not share the same views as to how the transaction should be structured. It should be noted again that the mere fact that the transaction may not be seen between independent parties does not mean that it does not have characteristics of an arm’s length arrangement.” Given the serious risk of double taxation, we consider that reference should be made in the reconstruction rules to be explicitly limited to exceptional circumstances. New Zealand’s reputation as a good place for doing business depends in part on fair and certain regulation. Wording along the lines of the Australian rules, i.e., that “independent entities dealing wholly independently with another in comparable circumstances would not have entered into the actual commercial or financial relations” will create considerable uncertainty for taxpayers. This is because this wording does not take account of the fact that associated enterprises do commonly enter into actual commercial or financial relations which would differ from those entered into by independent parties. It is only where the circumstances of such an arrangement are commercially irrational that the rule should be invoked. Section 1.123 of the revised OECD Guidelines states that the key question is whether the actual transaction possesses the commercial rationality of arrangements that would be agreed between unrelated partiesunder comparable economic circumstances, not whether the same transaction can be observed between independent parties. Paragraph 5.40 of the discussion document acknowledges that the rule will reduce certainty for taxpayers, but should only be the case where the arrangement is aggressive and commercially irrational. If that is the case, then we consider that the legislation should say so. If the concept of an “exceptional circumstance” is subjective, then perhaps some other word or phrase conveying the relevant meaning could be used. Paragraph 5.35 of the discussion documents states that “if the commercially rational alternative is that an independent business would not enter into a similar arrangement, it may make sense to disregard (rather than reconstruct) the arrangement for tax purposes.” This could present worrying outcomes. In most cases, Inland Revenue will be investigating retrospectively and would need to exercise caution that its conclusions as to whether an arrangement is commercially rational is not prejudiced by the benefit of hindsight, which a taxpayer entering into the arrangement would not have. There is risk Inland Revenue will assert that an arrangement cannot be commercially rational simply because it is not seen in practice between unrelated parties. Inland Revenue needs to be cognisant of the important principle emphasised in OECD that cautions tax authorities to take into account that multinationals often enter into transactions that are rarely encountered between by independent parties. Further, we note that disregarding an arrangement entirely should be rare. If an arrangement giving rise to a deduction is considered to be commercially irrational, the relevant counterfactual might not be the lack of any deduction at all. It might be that, but for the arrangement, the taxpayer would have entered into an alternative, commercially rational arrangement, which might have yielded a lesser deduction. Disregarding the arrangement entirely would therefore be unjust. We defer to the revised A member firm of Ernst & Young Global Limited 15 OECD Guidelines which provide additional guidance as to when arrangements should be disregarded, and note that these examples are limited in scope (see for example, those at section D.2.). Advance Pricing Agreements While the proposed law changes will be prospective in effect, this could well impact APAs that have been negotiated and signed under the current law, yet will be subject to any law change. Given that APAs, by their nature, are approached in good faith by a taxpayer to get certainty for a period of time, all APAs should remain unaffected by any law change until such time as the APA is required to be renewed. Burden of proof (paragraphs 5.43 to 5.48) The risk of arrangements being reconstructed or disregarded (and deductions being denied) is serious for taxpayers who, under the proposals, bear the burden of proof in relation to showing that the conditions of their associated party transactions are arm’s length. We submit that Inland Revenue will need to provide some guidance about what evidence should be provided. The proposed rules will necessarily increase compliance costs, with more robust transfer pricing documentation required. The discussion document notes at paragraph 5.48 that the additional compliance costs imposed by a shift of the burden of proof would not be substantial. That may be so if the burden of proof was the only change. However, coupled with the need for taxpayers to show that all conditions of their cross- border associated party transactions are arm’s length, the risk that Inland Revenue could reconstruct their cross-border arrangements and other measures such as the extended statutory time bar, the compliance costs for taxpayers will be substantial. We envisage that these proposals will add considerable expense for multinational companies and will likely increase the occurrence of disputes with Inland Revenue. The additional expense might be mitigated if Inland Revenue set out more clearly what is required from taxpayers and what is not. Documentation supportingall conditions of a transfer pricing arrangement could encompass an almost unlimited amount of analysis. Inland Revenue would need to consider which conditions it deems to present more material risk, and what taxpayers must do to demonstrate that any given condition is appropriate. One specific area on which guidance from Inland Revenue would be helpful is that of the use of the profit split method. If the taxpayer is to bear the burden of proof in relation to transfer pricing, we consider that Inland Revenue should be more prescriptive around what is required by way of evidence. Documentation requirements should be set out in some formal way (rather than through webpages on the transfer pricing section of Inland Revenue’s website). APAsshouldremain unaffected by any law change until such time as the APA is required to be renewed. A member firm of Ernst & Young Global Limited 16 The OECD’s Revised Guidance on Profit Splits 10 states at section C.3 that“the application of a transactional profit split of actual profits reflects a relationship where the parties either share the same economically significant risks associated with the business opportunity or separately assume closely related risks associated with the business opportunity and consequently should share in the resulting profits or losses”. In particular, profit splits are deemed to be more appropriate where multiple parties make unique and valuable contributions such as unique and valuable intangibles. 11 We are concerned that the increasing transparency over a taxpaying group’s entire supply chain in transfer pricing matters and information-gathering powers given to the Commissioner in the proposals will lead to Inland Revenue increasingly seeking to use the profit split method for New Zealand taxpayers in circumstances beyond those envisaged by the OECD. We are finding in practice that, in obtaining more information about the group’s supply chain, Inland Revenue is proposing using the profit split method where we would not have considered it appropriate. We are concerned that, using additional powers to force taxpayers to pay tax early, Inland Revenue could devise profit splits using somewhat arbitrary calculations based on visibility of the group’s global supply chain (and where the role of the New Zealand entity in that supply chain is neither particularly unique nor valuable). Not only is Inland Revenue’s use of the profit split method sometimes problematic, the resulting calculations regarding attributable profit can often be unsustainable. For example, a technology company is unlikely to have been able to allocate losses to New Zealand in its development phase, so application of the profit split method as soon as profits eventuate can lead to inequitable outcomes. Further guidance is needed from Inland Revenue on its use of the profit split and other methods; in practice we consider that its use can often be contrary to the relevant OECD guidance. General requirement to document transfer pricing practices (paragraphs 5.60 to 5.63) Multinationals often ask us whether transfer pricing documentation is required by New Zealand legislation, whether there are monetary thresholds for preparing transfer pricing documentation, and what the penalties are for non-compliance. These questions are driven by taxpayers’ experience in other jurisdictions, where the legislation clearly sets out these matters. In New Zealand the answer is less clear, because: ►Transfer pricing documentation is not explicitly required by legislation, but rather in practice required by Inland Revenue as evidence that taxpayers have exercised reasonable care; ►Monetary thresholds for which documentation is required are not explicitly stated; rather Inland Revenue considers that transfer pricing documentation should reflect the level of risk (without stating what level of risk is material) 12 ; 10 Issued 5 September 2016. 11 See section C.3.2. 12 See paragraphs 317ff of the New Zealand transfer pricing guidelines. We submit Inland Revenue should provide guidance to taxpayers on when transfer pricing documentation needs to be prepared, and what the documentation ought to contain. One approach would be to provide some de minimis rules to allow taxpayers to prepare simplified documentation, along the lines of the simplified record keeping requirements in Australia. Taxpayers with a small amount of related party transactions should be able to take a cost/risk approach to documentation without concern of a potential shortfall penalty. A member firm of Ernst & Young Global Limited 17 ►Penalties are calculable with respect to any tax shortfall (not whether transfer pricing documentation has been prepared at all), for example where the taxpayer has not taken reasonable care. New Zealand’s self-assessment regime therefore places a larger burden on taxpayers to determine for themselves whether their cross-border associated party transactions are material, and the level of documentation that is appropriate. Some multinationals are not well-equipped to determine what the New Zealand Government would deem to be material. What is material for one revenue authority can be insignificant for another. Further, multinationals often determine their transfer pricing obligations centrally. They must enquire into the transfer pricing rules of a large number of jurisdictions, and require straightforward answers as to what level of documentation is required in each. If the requirements are vague and complex, as they arguably are in New Zealand, on a cost/risk basis the multinational may decide only to prepare transfer pricing documentation for those countries whose law explicitly requires it. At paragraph 5.61, the discussion document is critical of the varying quality of documentation prepared by taxpayers. In our experience, multinationals generally prepare their transfer pricing documentation consistent with the OECD Guidelines. Inland Revenue has not specifically stated what it would like to see included in transfer pricing documentation. It did produce its own transfer pricing guidelines (the “IRD Guidelines”). 13 However, it has now stated its intention not to further update the IRD Guidelines and instead follow the 2010 OECD Guidelines. 14 This begs the question: what would Inland Revenue like to see in the documentation (other than what the OECD Guidelines prescribe)? In summary, the present transfer pricing rules do not adequately describe to taxpayers: ►How the arm’s length standard is to be interpreted and how the five available methods should be applied (i.e., whether the OECD Guidelines are authoritative, and if so, which version); ►When taxpayers are required to prepare transfer pricing documentation to comply with the law; ►What documentation should contain so as to satisfy the Commissioner that the taxpayer has taken reasonable care in determining its transfer prices. Inland Revenue is not proposing any compulsory filing of transfer pricing documentation. It will expect transfer pricing documentation, such as a master file and local file, to be provided on request or audit. Experience in Australia under its new transfer pricing laws is that the level of document compliance has increased. Given alignment of the transfer pricing rules with those of Australia, and the concerns we express above, the Government should consider providing some de minimis rules to allow taxpayers to prepare simplified documentation, along the lines of the simplified record keeping requirements in Australia. Taxpayers with a small amount of related party transactions should be able to take a cost/risk approach to documentation without concern of a potential shortfall penalty. 13 An appendix toTIBVolume 12, No 10 (October 2000). 14 See for example: http://www.ird.govt.nz/transfer-pricing/transfer-pricing-guidelines.html. A member firm of Ernst & Young Global Limited 18 Time bar extension (paragraphs 5.67 to 5.72) The discussion paper suggests that an extended time bar would bring New Zealand in line with other jurisdictions. The paper points to Australia and Canada which have time bars that are three years longer than their four year time bars for other tax matters. We note from the table given at paragraph 5.70 that there are several other jurisdictions which have the same time bar for transfer pricing as they do other tax matters; so New Zealand is by no means out of step with the world. The discussion document seeks to draw a distinction in relation to transfer pricing assessments which are more dependent on the facts and circumstances of each case than other tax matters. Other tax matters also are dependent on facts and circumstances; the avoidance regime would be one example where factual inquiries are more necessary and yet the time bar remains the same. It should also be noted that a longer time bar creates the same difficulties for a taxpayer trying to defend its tax position as it does for the Commissioner. This is particularly pronounced where, for example, the taxpayer has since restructured or closed their New Zealand operations and there are no longer staff in New Zealand with institutional knowledge of the taxpayer’s operations. Further, the extension of the time bar would be inconsistent with Inland Revenue’s other moves towards real-time tax compliance. It is contrary to the scheme and purpose of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme. We also note that participation in the Inland Revenue’s APA programme has been strong in recent years, reflecting a willingness on the part of both the Commissioner and taxpayers to settle transfer pricing matters contemporaneously, rather than engage in costly and lengthy disputes. Many other changes are proposed in the discussion document which assist the Commissioner in assessing multinationals on their international tax obligations. We consider that implementation of the statutory time bar could be deferred until the full effect of the other proposals is seen. If the proposed extension of the time bar does go ahead, it should not unfairly reopen any previously closed periods. For example, tax positions assessed in the year ended 31 March 2013 will now be time barred, but could be reopened for a further three years unless any change is prospective. Inland Revenue should provide more substantive rulings and guidelines to assist taxpayers Although not specifically covered in the discussion document, with more complexity and uncertainty in Action 8-10 revisions, we urge Inland Revenue to prepare detailed rulings, interpretation statements or similar guidance in consultation with transfer pricing practitioners. The Australian Tax Office typically assists taxpayers by preparing rulings and other interpretation statements for their transfer pricing We oppose the extension of the time bar for transfer pricing matters. The fact-specific nature of a transfer pricing dispute is neither unique to transfer pricing nor justification for the extension. Inland Revenue should providesome specific guidance to complement OECD Guidelines in the New Zealand context. This guidance should be in the form of detailed rulings or interpretation statements rather than informal website updates. Guidance would be particularly important regarding suitable comparables for benchmarking, and the circumstances in which Inland Revenue views particular methods such as profit split as the most reliable transfer pricing method. A member firm of Ernst & Young Global Limited 19 rules (for example TR2014/6 relating to section 815-130). These rulings tend to provide explicit justification for departures from OECD Guidelines and follow a transparent consultative process with an opportunity for taxpayers and advisors to submit their views. Inland Revenue released final transfer pricing guidelines in October 2000 15 but has ceased updating them. It has more recently relied on website updates, which contains relatively scant detail, have unclear authoritative value, are not widely publicised and may be removed from the website at any time. To ensure better compliance and less controversy, with these changes in law, we recommend Inland Revenue provide some specific guidance to complement OECD Guidelines in the New Zealand context. Fundamental to the OECD Guidelines is comparability. Difficulties in benchmarking comparables for New Zealand companies typically requires taxpayers to seek comparables in geographies outside New Zealand. Inland Revenue has previously suggested (via EY Global transfer pricing surveys) a hierarchy of geographies in terms of reliability of comparables (e.g., Australian companies have traditionally been considered the best geography to search for comparables and Asian countries the least). More recently we have noticed in practice Inland Revenue has been presenting benchmarking based on a wide geographical spread of comparables contrary to previously stated guidance. Further written guidance would be useful to minimise risk of dispute. The administrative measures proposed in chapter 6 of the discussion document will give Inland Revenue more power to seek information held offshore about a multinational group’s affairs and to apply sanctions for non-cooperation. We acknowledge the need for Inland Revenue to be able to collect sufficient information in a timely manner to audit transfer pricing matters, but do have concerns about how the information is used. In particular, and as referred to above, visibility of a multinational group’s global supply chain is not in itself adequate justification for the use of the profit split method. The additional administrative measures therefore confer a responsibility on Inland Revenue to provide some robust guidance on transfer pricing matters, including use of the profit split, so that taxpayers can ensure that they are meeting Inland Revenue’s expectations of transfer pricing analysis and documentation. 15 Tax Information Bulletin, Vol 12, No 10, October 2000, appendix A member firm of Ernst & Young Global Limited 20 Appendix D - Administrative measures Cooperation and resourcing (paragraphs 6.1 to 6.18) We acknowledge that collection of information in transfer pricing audits is time consuming and draws heavily on both Inland Revenue and taxpayer resources. In practice, most multinationals are cooperative with Inland Revenue: it is in their interest to resolve disputes quickly and with certainty. In our experience, Inland Revenue as well as the taxpayer will cause delay. Delays are caused by lengthy periods waiting for Inland Revenue to respond and information requested proving not to be of much assistance to Inland Revenue, thereby requiring alternative information to be requested. We suggest some protocols and guidelines be put in place, agreed with transfer pricing practitioners, around transfer pricing audits so taxpayers can also be assured that matters will be dealt with expediently and Inland Revenue positions reached within a reasonable period of time, with reasonable clarity and with least possible disruption to the taxpayer group. The majority of problems noted above could be resolved through resourcing. Powers to gather more information will worsen transfer pricing administration unless Inland Revenue is able to deal with that information on a timely basis. We are concerned that resourcing issues will be exacerbated by the implementation of other proposals in the BEPS package. In particular, we consider that interaction of the interest rate cap and transfer pricing rule changes will lead to a larger number of cross-border disputes, double taxation and MAPs. We are concerned that Inland Revenue will not have sufficient resources to devote to these requests and procedures. It would be concerning if the Commissioner uses her new administrative powers to push seemingly “uncooperative” taxpayers further into the disputes process due to a lack of available resources at the investigation end. Assessments (paragraphs 6.19 to 6.20) At paragraph 6.19, the discussion document proposes that Inland Revenue be able to issue an assessment based on the information available to Inland Revenue at the time. As a drafting matter, it seems likely that this would need to be added as an exception to section 89C of the Tax Administration Act 1994, which provides the circumstances in which the Commissioner may make an assessment without first issuing a notice of proposed adjustment (“NOPA”). Further, we note that, all other things being equal, section 138E(1)(e)(iv) would operate to ensure that there would be no right of challenge against a decision of the Commissioner. This is concerning given the potential gravity of a taxpayer being caught by the rule and having an assessment made against them. The proposal could be seen as draconian given that the Commissioner’s decision would not be reviewable. Other than that it would need to be signed off by a senior member within Inland Revenue, We submit that many of the proposed administrative measures could better be resolved by additional resourcing of Inland Revenue’s transfer pricing and investigations teams. The administrative measures proposed would give the Commissioner substantial powers to issue an assessment and avoid many formalities of the existing disputes process. We consider that these powers overreach in light of the other proposals advanced, such as the shifting of the burden of proof to taxpayers. Should the proposal for Inland Revenue to issue a NOPA or assessment based on information available at the time proceed, a taxpayer should be able to challenge that assessment. A member firm of Ernst & Young Global Limited 21 there seem to be few safeguards to stop Inland Revenue issuing an assessment based on relatively subjective criteria. Payment of tax in dispute (paragraphs 6.21 to 6.26) It is important to consider the position of a taxpayer against whom an assessment is issued under the new rules. In such a case, the taxpayer would have to challenge the assessment in Court. Even if it succeeds, it would then only receive the Commissioner’s paying rate of interest on the tax recovered. Given that the Commissioner initiated the dispute the current rate of 1.02% per annum 16 this effectively penalises the taxpayer through no fault of its own. The purpose of the use of money interest regime is stated in section 120A of the Tax Administration Act and includes compensating taxpayers for the loss of use of money through their paying too much tax. Further, interest payable under the regime is not a penalty. The proposals only affect large multinationals with revenue of over EUR750 million. Generally these taxpayers do not default on tax payments. Yet, under the current disputes regime, the Commissioner can recover interest at the taxpayer’s paying rate which reflects a higher credit risk than these types of taxpayers actually represent to Inland Revenue. It is unclear why upfront payment of tax would really be necessary for these taxpayers when the use of money interest regime already adequately compensates the Commissioner. Further, no reason has been advanced for why purchases from a tax pooling services should not be accepted as payment of the relevant tax. Denying pooling as an option seems to support that the use of money interest regime is in fact being used to impose a penalty rather than incentivise the correct payment of tax. We submit that purchases of tax from a tax pooling service should be acceptable. Collection of information (paragraphs 6.29 to 6.37) Drafters of the legislation will need to take particular care in relation to the expansion of section 21 of the Tax Administration Act, as described at paragraph 6.37 of the discussion document. One concern is the position of tax advice which is subject to legal privilege. In some circumstances, the Commissioner will request information from a taxpayer in a section 21 request and the taxpayer might have legally privileged advice which arguably falls within the ambit of the request. In such a case, the taxpayer should not be required to disclose the document, but not doing so might affect its ability to later waive privilege should it wish to use the documents as admissible evidence in court. 16 From 7 May 2017 We submit that this measure should not proceed: ►Large multinational enterprises are unlikely to default on tax due ►At current rates, use of money interest will not compensate taxpayers should Inland Revenue’s position not be confirmed Should our main submission be declined, purchases of tax from a tax pooling service should be accepted as payment of tax. We submit that section 21 should have an exception for information which is subject to legal privilege.

Application dates Application date should be no earlier than 1 April 2019 We understand that targeting BEPS is a key focus for the Government and an early enactment date may be its preference. In our view, the proposed application date should be no earlier than the first income year after 31 March 2019 (or the equivalent non-standard tax years). The proposed changes will affect a significant number of taxpayers, and not just those who may be viewed as having adopted unacceptable tax practices. It is reasonable to allow taxpayers time to consider how best to deal with these issues, and to rearrange their affairs if they decide it is necessary. It will be in the interest of continued investment from overseas to allow properly for this. 2. PE avoidance proposal The New PE Rule should adopt the wording used in Article 13 of the MLI We understand Officials’ concern is that multinationals are currently able to structure their tax affairs so that they are subject to no or very little tax in NZ despite carrying on significant economic activity here. From discussions with Officials, we understand that the scope of the New PE Rule is not intended to be wider in scope than the changes to NZ’s double tax agreements (DTAs) to be implemented by Article 13 of the Multilateral Instrument. This policy intention is also stated in paragraph 3.2 of the DD, where Officials say that “the proposed rule is not trying to widen the accepted international definition of a PE in substance”. The best way to ensure that this scope is matched in a domestic context, is to adopt word for word the OECD standard for dependent agent permanent establishments (PEs) used in Article 12(1) of the MLI. That wording has already been through a rigorous process of negotiation between jurisdictions and an extensive submissions process on a global basis, and has been refined to ensure that the language is not wider than the OECD considers it should be. The MLI will also provide the new global standard for when a source country will have taxing rights in relation to a non-resident, and taxpayers will have a greater amount of certainty as to the scope of the New PE Rule if the global standard wording is used. Whilst we understand that Officials have some concerns about how some aspects of the MLI wording will be interpreted, the benefit of global consistency and clarity around how the rule will operate should outweigh these concerns. Furthermore, existing anti-avoidance rules can be used to address any residual concerns. If the New PE Rule is to override tax treaties, this needs to be clear in the legislation Regardless of the drafting approach preferred, it should be made clear in the legislation that the New PE Rule is not wider in scope than the widened PE definition under the MLI – in other words, it should be clear that a non-resident in a jurisdiction which has a treaty amended by the MLI will not have a permanent establishment (PE) under NZ domestic law if it does not have one under the relevant treaty (as amended by the MLI). This approach is consistent with paragraph 3.2 of the DD. We do not think that the concerns raised in paragraph 3.45 arise in a situation where the relevant treaty partner has adopted the widened definition of PE under the MLI. Inland Revenue 1May2017 Page 4 2831194\_4 In cases where a treaty is not amended by the MLI, a non-resident will have a PE under NZ domestic law, but absent specific provision in the NZ legislation, the treaty will override this result so the non- resident will not have a PE. If the intention (per paragraph 3.45 of the DD) is that the New PE Rule will override the treaty, this must be specifically provided for in NZ’s domestic legislation to be effective. There needs to be clarity around where the New PE Rule line is drawn between sales and marketing activity In principle it sounds simple to refer to sales activity being within the New PE Rule but marketing/support activity being outside. However, in reality there is a spectrum of customer relationship activity and it may be far from clear where the line will be drawn as to whether particular activities will result in the new rule applying, or whether identified activity leads to a particular sale or not. At its broadest, any activity carried on by a subsidiary in NZ could be argued as intended to lead to sales of the multinational’s product or service in NZ. Furthermore, there may be a number of activities carried on both inside and outside NZ that lead to a particular sale. Is it the activity which is most influential in leading to a particular sale, or is it any activity in NZ which can be connected to a particularsale,thatmatters?WhatiftheNZaccountmanagerisgenerallyresponsibleforacustomer’s account, but it is not clear whether the activity of the account manager is what leads to a sale of a particular product? For example, will the following multinationals have a deemed PE in NZ under the New PE Rule? a multinational that has a NZ subsidiary, whose staff are contracted to visit existing and potential customers and explain contractual terms, but refer customers to the multinational’s website for orders of goods on standard terms; the multinational’s NZ subsidiary has initial and ongoing contact with customers, but at a certain stage of negotiations for a particular sale refers customers to multinational’s foreign sales force and legal team, which discuss in detail the customer’s needs and negotiate the sales contract; a multinational who has technical support staff in NZ, who occasionally refer a customer directly to the multinational for a sale of a particular product; or a multinational who deals in high value goods where heads of terms for sales contracts are negotiated locally but detailed terms of contracts are entered into directly by a group member in another jurisdiction. Inland Revenue should provide detailed guidance and examples around when the new rule is intended toapply.TheOECDguidanceinthisareaisnotparticularly helpful and we understand Officials acknowledge this issue too. We see this issue as a key area of uncertainty. There needs to be more clarity around the other requirements of the New PE Rule FurtherexplanationisrequiredaroundanumberoftheotherelementsoftheNewPERule.For example: What does “commercially dependent” mean? Guidance should be provided here as to what Officials have in mind. Inland Revenue 1May2017 Page 5 2831194\_4 It does not make sense for qualification criteria to refer to some or all of the profits not being attributed to a NZ PE – if the non-resident already has a PE, it is not necessary for the new rule to deem a PE to exist – rather, any issue should be around profit allocation. What is the “purpose of the DTA’s PE provisions”, and how will this criteria apply when a non- resident is not resident in a treaty country? It would be preferable for any language here to follow language in existing anti-avoidance provisions, such as section BG 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Introducing a new standard for a concept that relates to avoidance will create unnecessary uncertainty and complexity for taxpayers and Inland Revenue, and it may take many years before its meaning is conclusively established. What is the distinction between an “unrelated independent agent” referred to in paragraph 3.22 and not caught by the New PE Rule, and an “independent third party” referred to in paragraph 3.27whoiscaughtbytherule?Isthemeaningof“independentparty”thesameinbothcases,with the scope of the rule determined by the activities of a non-resident or a related entity, or do the independent parties have different features in each case (e.g. is an independent party within paragraph 3.27 nonetheless managed or controlled by the non-resident)? How does a third party within paragraph 3.27 differ from a commercially dependent entity referred to in paragraph 3.21? It may be difficult to distinguish in practice between independent agents, commercially dependent entities, and third party channel partners – it would be helpful for the distinguishing features of each arrangement to be set out in more detail. Should it be clear that publicly traded third parties are independent agents/third parties in all cases? If the third party referred to in paragraph 3.27 carries out sales activity with respect to a particular sale to a consumer, does this mean the New PE Rule would not apply?Further guidance should be provided as to what particular services a related entity might provide that would be relevant – for example, services that include locating a customer, promoting products to that customer, discussing the customer’s needs, tailoring a product to a customer, and indicating pricing, delivery dates and other key terms to the customer. It would be helpful to establish the scope of the new rule if the legislation contained features of arrangements that Officials consider to be indicators of PE avoidance. Urgent guidance is needed in relation to attribution of profits to the deemed PE Our understanding is that Officials view the intended outcome of the New PE Rule as being to match tax paid in NZ by multinational groups with the economic value created by the activity carried on in NZ. This outcome can be achieved if a group enters into a buy/sell model whereby a NZ subsidiary buys products from an offshore group member and on-sells to NZ customers. If the NZ subsidiary pays a royalty to an offshore group member, this is recognised for NZ tax purposes, subject to the application of usual transfer pricing principles, with the result that the taxable profit in the NZ subsidiary properly reflects the value created by that subsidiary’s activities (which are in many cases in NZ limited to routine sales functions). Inland Revenue 1May2017 Page 6 2831194\_4 However, it is uncertain how the intended outcome can be achieved in the context of profit attribution to a PE given that NZ does not endorse the Authorised OECD Approach to profit attribution. The main benefit of the Authorised OECD Approach is that it is possible for profit attribution to properly match economic value by treating the non-resident and its PE as separate entities, and therefore allowing internal arrangements, to be recognised (such as an appropriate royalty to be allocated to the branch from the head office from internally generated intellectual property). In contrast, NZ’s current approach permits only actual costs incurred by the non-resident to be attributed to a NZ PE. The amount of profit subject to NZ tax can therefore be disproportionate to the activity of the PE because value attributed to intellectual property generated offshore may be taxed in NZ. This is the wrong outcome and is not in accordance with our understanding of the desired policy basis for the New PE Rule. Furthermore, this outcome does not align with the proposed changes to the transfer pricing rules, which are intended to base NZ’s tax rules on economic substance rather than legal form. We acknowledge that this issue already exists. However, there are currently relatively few PEs recognised in NZ in this scenario so the issue is limited in practice. It will become much more relevant if the New PE Rule is enacted. It is therefore essential that Inland Revenue assists taxpayers by releasingmoredetailedguidanceinthisarea. This guidance will be particularly important in the case of: “large” multinationals who may be at risk of being seen as uncooperative under the administrative measures proposed by the DD if they do not provide sufficient information to determine the profit attributable to a PE; or “large” multinationals and their wholly owned NZ subsidiaries, who may be required to pay disputed tax early under the DD proposals related to payment and collection of tax in dispute, even if the multinational cooperates with Inland Revenue. A big risk of the New PE Rule to NZ is that multinationals may exit NZ Uncertainties around the scope of the deemed PErule and profit attribution are likely to lead multinationals to restructure their affairs so thenew rule does not apply (as has been the experience in Australia following the enactment of their Multinational Anti Avoidance Rule). There are fundamentally 2 ways in which a restructure can occur: (a) the non-resident and its NZ subsidiary could enter into a buy/sell model, where the NZ subsidiary buys product from the non-resident on arm’s length terms and sells to NZ customers; or (b) The non-resident could wind up its NZ subsidiary and either (i) not sell product in NZ, or (ii) sell product in NZ directly from overseas with no group employees in NZ. This outcome is consistent with the policy outcome identified in paragraph 3.39 of the discussion document. However, in light of the relative size of the NZ market compared to global operations of the multinationals this rule is likely to affect, and time and cost involved in restructuring, (b) is the more likely scenario. The risk is that the multinational will exit from NZ altogether – we have had preliminary discussions with some multinationals who have indicated that this is likely to be their solution if the New PE Rule is enacted. Officials need to consider whether it is an acceptable risk that foreign investment into NZ will be reduced. Inland Revenue 1May2017 Page 7 2831194\_4 100% penalty for abusive tax position should not automatically apply Simply having a deemed PE under the new rule should not be enough to trigger a penalty for taking an abusive tax position. If the multinational’s view is that the group has already returned taxable income in NZ equivalent to the economic value of activities conducted in NZ, it is not appropriate for such a penalty to be imposed. There should be a post-implementation review within 3 years of enactment We would recommend a post-implementation review within 3 years of enactment. Given the OECD work programme and similar domestic law changes being made in other countries, any new law should be measured against necessity and inconsistencies with other jurisdictions, and whether it has resulted in unintended consequences for business and Inland Revenue, such as multinationals exiting their investment into NZ. Amendments to the source rules Royalties deemed to have a NZ source may be subject to double withholding tax A royalty paid by a non-resident to another non-resident may be subject to foreign withholding tax. If all or part of a royalty is deemed to have a NZ source, and is therefore subject to NZ withholding tax, the royalty will be subject to withholding tax twice. Relief would not be available under a DTA. Officials should reconsider whether this is acceptable tax policy. Strengthening the transfer pricing rules Inland Revenue resourcing for transfer pricing matters should be increased In our experience, Inland Revenue’s transfer pricingteam is significantly under-resourced. This leads to frustration for taxpayers because risk reviews, audits and advance pricing agreements (APAs) take a long time and are very expensive for taxpayers, and a lack of regular correspondence with Inland Revenue while matters are ongoing typically exacerbates the issue of uncertainty. We currently have several unilateral APA applications held up with Inland Revenue that were submitted more than 24 months ago. This is in stark contrast to Inland Revenue’s 6 month timeframes for APAs. These frustrations will only increase under the strengthened transfer pricing rules, particularly if the time bar is extended. A better solution, and onemore in line with Inland Revenue’s business transformation project, would be to ensure that Inland Revenue is properly resourced (with adequately trained transfer pricing specialists) to provide guidance as to expected timeframes, and to consistently respond within these timeframes. If the transfer pricing rules are strengthened as proposed (particularly with respect of the timebar extension and change in the onus of proof), it will become critical to ensure that Inland Revenue is able to provide certainty through the APA process in a timely and efficient manner. Accordingly, we recommend the introduction of strict timeframes for Inland Revenue to respond to APA applications to ensure taxpayers can obtain certainty as to process and cost, as well as certainty as to tax treatment of transactions in addition to substantial increases in transfer pricing specialised resources within Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue 1May2017 Page 8 2831194\_4 More guidance is needed from Inland Revenue in a number of areas related to transfer pricing Inland Revenue needs to provide guidance in the following areas to help taxpayers comply with their obligations and manage their risk: What information does a taxpayer need to obtain to be able to discharge the onus of proof? For example, what exact level of documentation will be required? Many taxpayers may form a reasonable view on the arm’s length nature of their dealings without formally preparing documentation – will this be possible going forward? Or will it only be possible through the preparation of full transfer pricing documentation in line with the OECD’s recommended Masterfile/Localfile approach? This issue will be particularly important in the case of large multinationals, who may be at risk of being seen as uncooperative under the administrative measures proposed by the DD if they do not provide sufficient information to determine the arm’s length amount of a related party transaction. Will there be simplification measures to ensure the compliance burden does not outweigh the tax at risk in relation to smaller taxpayers or those with low-risk structures? For example, will standard practice or more de minimis safe harbours be introduced? We strongly recommend these types of measures be considered. What are expected timeframes for risk reviews, audits and APA negotiations? Will there be a period of transitional measures or relaxed enforcement following enactment of the new rules especially in circumstances where taxpayers have existing APAs under existing structures that may be impacted by the changed in the transfer pricing rules. Will the Inland Revenue be providing clear detailed guidance as to the limited circumstances where the Commissioner can reconstruct a related-party transaction. We strongly recommend it is made clear that this power will only be exercised by the Commissioner in extremely limited circumstances (and guidance as to what type of circumstances could be impacted). This power is essentially giving the Commissioner the ability to tell a taxpayer how to conduct its business commercially which clearly will not be appropriate in almost all cases. Thetimebarfortransferpricingshouldnotbeextendedto7years The transfer pricing time bar should not be extended for the following reasons: If Inland Revenue’s transfer pricing team was properly resourced, it would be possible to deal with disputes and other matters within the 4 year time bar already provided for in NZ’s legislation. NZ is a small market, and it should be possible to deal with all matters within the 4 year time bar. A survey performed by the OECD’s Forum on Tax Administration revealed that the average resolution for transfer pricing cases (amongst 43 OECD and non-OECD countries) was 540 days. The proposed time limit of seven years is more than four times this average, which seems unjustifiable in the NZ context. Whilst Australia and Canada allow for 7 years, most other countries have a shorter period. As Officials recognise, extending the time bar will decrease certainty for taxpayers, and will not promote efficiency in transfer pricing disputes. It will also prolong transfer pricing disputes, and Inland Revenue 1May2017 Page 9 2831194\_4 the costs of disputes will increase. These effects are not in the interests of either Inland Revenue or taxpayers. The extension of the time bar in combination with the administrative measure requiring large multinationals to pay tax within 12 months of a NOPA being issued or 90 days of an assessment means that Inland Revenue has little incentive to resolve the dispute in a timely way. The multinational (or potentially a wholly owned subsidiary in NZ) may be out of pocket for a significant period of time if the dispute is resolved in a way which means the multinational is entitled to a refund. Retaining the time bar at 4 years will give the parties a better incentive to resolve the dispute more quickly. Taxpayers will be required to obtain all information necessary to support their positions on an annual basis through the tax return process. We are not aware of any compelling justification as to why Inland Revenue needs a longer period than the 4 years already provided for to consider transfer pricing matters. Whilst we acknowledge that it is possible to seek certainty through APAs, in practice APAs are very expensive and take a long time to obtain, generally due to delays with Inland Revenue due to resourcing constraints (as per our example set out above). IfatransferpricingdisputeisresolvedinfavourofInlandRevenue,thegroupwillbeatriskof double tax in jurisdictions where the time bar has already passed. This is because the group will not be able to claim a corresponding adjustment in the other jurisdiction. This outcome makes NZ appear less attractive for a non-resident considering whether to continue investment in NZ. There will be also commercial consequences to the extension. For example, a vendor selling a NZ company generally gives a tax indemnity to the buyer lasting around 5 years. If the time bar is extended, the buyer will no doubt seek to obtain a tax indemnity of around 8 years. This will significantly extend the time period for tax risk faced by the vendor. Furthermore, if the vendor seeks to mitigate its risk through indemnity insurance, it will need to obtain insurance cover for the extra time period, which will result in an increase in premium costs. If the time bar is extended: as mentioned above, the detrimental effect on taxpayers must be negated by improvements in the APA process for obtaining certainty; and exemptions for small and medium sized entities and for NZ entities investing overseas should be considered. Administrative measures New measures should not apply from enactment to disputes already in progress In fairness to taxpayers, the new administrative measures should not apply to disputes in progress, or there should be transitional rules. Non-co-operation needs to be clearly defined and of a high threshold The concept of significant and persistent non-cooperation needs to be of a sufficiently high threshold to justify the consequences. Our view is that instances of non-cooperation should be specifically Inland Revenue 1May2017 Page 10 2831194\_4 connected to failures to meet legal obligations imposed in the tax legislation – a taxpayer should not be treated as non-cooperative if it does not respond to a non-binding informal information request, or a request that is outside the ambit of the specific provisions. Furthermore, behaviour should be able to be objectively assessed, and based on clear guidelines provided by Inland Revenue. Some of the circumstances listed in paragraph 6.16 of the DD do not seem appropriate to trigger non- cooperativeness. For example: a taxpayer may not be legally obliged to respond to Inland Revenue correspondence in some situations – if so, non-response should not be non-cooperative behaviour; failure to provide sufficient information to determine an arm’s length amount or profit attribution to a PE will require a subjective assessment by Inland Revenue – it seems unreasonable for non- cooperation to arise in such a case. Consequences which follow from transfer pricing and profit attribution issues highlight the need as mentioned above for clear and urgent guidance from Inland Revenue to ensure taxpayers are aware of the standards required for compliance. Imposing an obligation on a NZ subsidiary to pay a multinational’s tax is too harsh It is not clear in the DD whether the proposal applies to all tax payable by a large multinational, or just tax arising in relation to disputes listed in paragraph 6.24. In either case, imposing what could potentially be a large tax liability on a NZ subsidiary that may have limited assets or resources seems disproportionate. Furthermore, imposing such a liability on a subsidiary may have other adverse effects on the subsidiary such as breaching loan covenants, breaching thin capitalisation requirements, and, if a subsidiary is sold, increased risk for a vendor under a tax covenant. If this obligation is introduced, it should only arise in circumstances where the multinational is non- cooperative and has not met its payment obligations under law. Furthermore, the subsidiary should not have an obligation to pay its parent’s disputed tax early as proposed in paragraph 6.22. It will also be necessary to consider how the obligation on a NZ subsidiary to meet its parent’s tax liabilities interacts with directors’ duties under sections 131 to 137 of the Companies Act 1993. We are aware of at least one instance where Inland Revenue has sought to recover unpaid tax liabilities from the directors of a company that could not meet its liabilities on the basis that directors had breached their duties. Tax pooling should be available There is no explanation in paragraph 6.24 regarding why tax pooling would not be available to a multinational with payment obligations under the proposals, and this does not seem justifiable when considering the purpose of tax pooling. Officials should give this issue further consideration. It may be difficult for a NZ subsidiary to adequately demonstrate it has discharged its obligation to provide information requested of its parent WeunderstandfromOfficialsthatitisnotintendedthatemployeesofaNZsubsidiarycanbe convicted of an offence of failing to provide information about an offshore group member. This should be clear in the legislation. Inland Revenue 1May2017 Page 11 2831194\_4 In many cases, it may be difficult for a NZ subsidiary to obtain the information required from its parent. Furthermore, it may be difficult for a NZ subsidiary to demonstrate that the overseas entity does or does not have the information. Section 21 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 needs to be rewritten If section 21 is to be extended as proposed, it needs to be rewritten as a whole to be more balanced and reasonable to taxpayers. The consequences of section 21 applying are severe. Section 21 excludes a taxpayer’s right to access the courts (through the exclusion of challenge rights) and also excludes a taxpayer’s rights to use relevant evidence in challenge proceedings. This effectively means that, where this provision is invoked, an assessment can be treated as final, without the ability to challenge the assessment for its correctness. This is a significant limitation of taxpayer rights and should only occur in the most serious cases. As section 21 is currently drafted, the mere failureto respond adequately to an information request may be sufficient to trigger the severe consequences set out above. There is no requirement for a taxpayer’s failure to be significant or persistent, which means that this provision is inconsistent with the other provisions proposed in the DD. In our view, section 21 should be rewritten to ensure that the severity of the consequences are appropriately matched by the significance and persistence of a taxpayer’s non-co-operation and failure to provide information. As the consequences are more severe than the other measures proposed in the DD, the legislative threshold for its application should be higher.

Our submission focuses on the potential affect of the transfer pricing proposals contained in the discussion document on some of the investments that we manage on behalf of investors. We are not commenting on the permanent establishment proposals. However, this does not mean that we necessarily endorse the comments and outcomes reached by the Commissioner in the discussion document on permanent establishment. Background New Zealand has a broad base, low rate tax system with limited exceptions. We understand what you are trying to achieve which is ensuring that if economic activity occurs here that New Zealand collects tax. Thus where non-residents are carrying on business in New Zealand they should bear their share of tax. However, some of the proposals seem to go too far and will affect the majority of multinationals that you state operate in New Zealand and are tax compliant l. Our comments on the specific transfer pricing proposals set out in the discussion document are detailed below. Economic substance The proposal for transfer pricing practices to align with economic substance 2 moves New Zealand to a "would have test". Under the economic substance test taxpayers may have issues with obtaining relevant external facts that match for comparison to their circumstances. This is applicable to specific industries and distinctive fact taxpayers. This issue needs to be considered and workable solution found. There also needs to be consideration on how Inland Revenue Officials will use and apply the economic substance test in the future. Views may shift over time which could result in detrimental effects on taxpayers. This could result in Inland Revenue with the benefit of hindsight assessing taxpayers based on better level of information than what was available at the original time. Safeguards need to built into any rules that introduce the economic substance test, to ensure that views or interpretation do not shift over time.

There is no explanation on what would or could be considered arrangements that are aggressive and commercially irrational for the proposed reconstruction rules to apply. Further there are no details on what measures or how one measures aggressive and commercially irrational arrangements. We are concerned that test for an arrangement being aggressive and commercially irrational appears subjective and dependant on Inland Revenue Officials. Further, we note the issue of Inland Revenue Officials understanding, awareness and comprehensive of commercial environments, specific industries and the structures in which different businesses operate. For example a lack of familiarity with the commercial and legal implications of managed funds. There need to be safety measures in any rules introduced to ensure that a lack of commercial comprehensive and familiarity does not trigger the application of the reconstruction rules to a taxpayer. Applying an exceptional circumstances test like Australia has to the application of the reconstruction rules, may assist with this. If any reconstruction rules are introduced there needs to be clear legislation and guidance for both taxpayers and Inland Revenue Officials on: • what is meant by arrangements that are aggressive and commercially irrational, • what is measured and how it is tested, and • Inland Revenue sign-off i.e. Deputy Commissioner to apply the reconstruction rules to a taxpayer. Arms length conditions It is proposed that the transfer pricing rules are changed to refer to arms length conditions. This would require taxpayers to take into account the relevant conditions that a third party would be willing to accept when determining an arm's length price 4 . The proposals do not consider the situations of there being no equivalent third party comparisons or data for a taxpayer to use and very limited publically available data. Further there are situations where associated cross-border entities may accept a lessor commercial deal in order to give a better overall outcome for the group e.g. keep a client. How would the types of situations outlined be considered by Inland Revenue? In particular, would Inland Revenue consider each scenario for group member in isolation or can or will the bigger commercial picture of the outcome for a group of entities be taken into consideration? Burden of proof It is proposed that the burden of proof for transfer pricing should be shifted to taxpayers, due to taxpayers being far more likely to hold the relevant information to support its pricing than the Inland Revenue or other parties5 . If this proposal is adopted, then Inland Revenue Officials will need to: • factor in their own preconceptions, biases and assumptions when taxpayers provide their facts, and • be prepared to obtain from taxpayers an awareness and familiarity of commercial environments, industries and specialised taxpayer circumstances, and • be aware of constraints that apply to taxpayer's and the implications of these restrictions. For example trustees or supervisors roles in managed funds. There should be some sort of protection included into the updated transfer pricing rules that preserves presented or stated taxpayer's facts unless exceptional circumstances apply such as the application of the reconstruction rules. Time bar We question the need to extend the time bar on transfer pricing matters from the current four years to seven years given the Inland Revenue will have real time data from its international questionnaires and 3 Pages 30-31, Discussion Document BEPS — Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance 4 Pages 31-32, Discussion Document BEPS —Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance 5 Pages 32-33, Discussion Document BEPS — Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance AMP Capital Investors (New Zealand) Limited transformation project. If there are issues resolving transfer pricing reviews surely it is more appropriate for Inland Revenue to buy in or hire more resources just like commercial operators are required to do, rather than changing the rules. Further obtaining resources with commercial and specific industry experiences could assist Inland Revenue. For completeness, we have experienced significant delays (over a year) in obtaining transfer pricing responses from Inland Revenue Officials. Thus not all delays in this area are taxpayer based and therefore any timing requirements should apply to both Inland Revenue and taxpayers. There is no transition period mentioned in the extension of time bar proposals, the result of this means that periods that are currently statute barring will be reopened for transfer pricing purposes on application of this rule. This will create uncertainty for businesses as they have already assumed that particular years are statute barred. Further this would allow Inland Revenue the benefit of hindsight through applying the amended transfer pricing rules rather than using current transfer pricing rules for a further additional three years. Master and local files It is stated that master and local file transfer pricing documents are to be provided upon a request or audit6 . There is no commentary about the reasoning's behind a request and the form a request should take. To ensure that there is no change in view from Inland Revenue in the future, it would be appropriate to codify the circumstances in which such a request for master and local files can be made and the form of that request. Investors acting in concert There are limited details on how investors will be determined to be "acting in concert" for transfer pricing purposes and in what way this proposal may work. There are no comments on whether other jurisdictions will be applying similar rules; is New Zealand out of step with the rest of the world? New Zealand is a capital importing country thus we need offshore investors for large capital intensive projects and private investments. There will be additional costs for non-resident investors under this proposal through the acquired New Zealand entities being subject to transfer pricing rules and possibly themselves. This is yet another barrier to get non-residents across before they will invest in New Zealand entities or projects. Prima facie it appears that private equity managers may be pushed into assisting non-resident investors and New Zealand acquired entity's with their transfer pricing obligations in these circumstances. This is not a usual role for a private equity manager. The level of fees charged by private equity managers would need to reflect the time and effort spent on transfer pricing matters. Non-cooperation If the proposed rules are introduced about when a taxpayer is being regarded as non-cooperative, they need to clearly define non-cooperation, what is measured and how this is tested. In particular, around any materially misleading information as this appears a subjective test and dependant on points of views which can be different between Inland Revenue and a taxpayer. There needs to be clear guidance, transparent procedures and processes to ensure the application of this type of rule is fair to taxpayers and not subject to preconceptions, biases and assumptions. Any rules introduced need to contain appropriate timeframes that apply to both the multinationals and the Inland Revenue. The Inland Revenues standard of four weeks to six weeks for businesses replying to their requests for information needs to be extended, to account for peaks in work flow. Payment of tax in dispute The proposal for tax to be paid earlier in a dispute by multinationals is justified by the statement that collection of tax can be delayed for several years and this provides an incentive for multinationals to prolong disputes. However, as previously noted Inland Revenue has delayed responding to taxpayers and in these circumstances this would unfairly penalise taxpayers. There is a cost to having funds tied up. If Inland Revenue are holding on to large amounts of disputed tax they should pay the market rate for the opportunity cost of taxpayers having to fund these amounts. Further, checks and balances would need to be put in place to ensure that any assessment of whichever disputed tax issued to a taxpayer has a solid basis behind it. 6 Page 34, point 5.58, Discussion Document BEPS — Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance AMP Capital Investors (New Zealand) Limited No reasoning's have been provided to back up the statement that purchases from a tax pooling service would not be acceptable as the payment of tax'. What is the justification for why this type of payment should be excluded? Collection of Information The fact that the Inland Revenue is having issues with obtaining information about offshore multinational group members of taxpayers from other tax authorities should not be a reason for changing the powers of the Commissioner in this area. Instead Inland Revenue Officials should put effort into their working relationships with other tax authorities to ensure that they obtain the information or assistance they want. Further, this proposal would push information collection onto New Zealand taxpayers of multinational groups as "information would first be passed on to the relevant New Zealand taxpayer who would then supply this information to Inland Revenue" 8. There is a cost impact for taxpayers under this proposal. Inland Revenue seems to be propositioning taking on an international policing role under this proposal, is this appropriate?

In particular, our submission relates to the proposed changes to the life insurance source rules (the “proposed changes”). We appreciate the opportunity to submit on the discussion document and would be happy to meet with Officials to discuss any of the matters raised in this submission further. Summary We submit that: •The proposed changes place an onerous and unfair burden on New Zealand life in surers to ha ve completeness of information regarding a non-resident reinsurer’s pl ace of tax residence an d/or whether the non-resident reinsurer has a New Zeal and permanent establ ishment. This seems a disproportionate response to what we woul d regard as a remote risk. •D ouble tax agreements (“DTAs”) operate to, among other things, protect a co mpany from the ri sk of double taxation. A unilateral change to domestic legislatio n can deny a company the abi lity to rely on a DTA for protection from double taxati on. The proposed change to de ny deductions to a New Zealand life insurance company, repres ents an unfair and unil ateral reconstruction of the tax treatment of life reinsurance and gives ri se to what is in effect a double taxation, with no ability to rely on the relevant DTAs or the protection mechanisms within those DTAs. The appropriate response to this risk woul d be to amend the rel e vant DTAs. #009 27 April 2017 Inland Reveneue Page 2 • The proposed changes could have significant adverse economic implications to the tax treatment of existing life reinsurance contracts (where the reinsurer is resident in Singapore, Canada and Russia, and does not have a New Zealand permanent establishment) and unfairly penalises New Zealand reinsured life insurance companies. Life insurance reinsurance agreements are typically long term agreements. New Zealand life insurance companies will typically not be in a position to renegotiate such agreements part way through the term of the agreements. Therefore, should the proposed changes proceed, they should be restricted to life reinsurance contracts entered into after the enactment of the changes with reinsurers who are resident in Singapore, Canada and Russia and who do not have a permanent establishment in New Zealand. The rules should not apply for existing contracts or for contracts where the reinsurer, subsequent to entry into the reinsurance contracts, changes its tax status by losing its permanent establishment in New Zealand and/or becomes resident in Singapore, Canada or Russia. Life insurance source rules Article 7 of New Zealand’s DTAs provide relief to non-residents such that, broadly, New Zealand is prevented from taxing business profits earned by a non-resident unless they are attributable to a permanent establishment in New Zealand. However, New Zealand DTAs (with the exception of New Zealand’s DTAs with Canada, Russia and Singapore) specifically exclude income from insurance with non-resident insurers from this Article. Therefore, in most cases, New Zealand has a taxing right on any life insurance contract which is entered into or offered in New Zealand by a non-resident life insurer. However, New Zealand’s DTAs with Canada, Russia and Singapore do not exclude income from insurance so a non-resident life insurer in those jurisdictions (with no permanent establishment in New Zealand) will not be subject to New Zealand taxation on life insurance contracts entered into or offered in New Zealand. Proposed changes to life insurance source rules Officials concern seems to be that there may be tax relief for New Zealand sourced insurance income if the reinsurer is resident in Singapore, Canada or Russia, and does not have a permanent establishment in New Zealand. In response to this concern, the discussion document proposes the following amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007: • Section DR 3 The section is to be amended to specifically provide that no deduction is available for the reinsurance of policies if the premium income on that policy is not taxable in New Zealand (including under a DTA). • Section EX 28 The definition of a FIF included in the section is to be amended to specifically provide that New Zealand residents are subject to the FIF rules in respect of policies that are not subject to New Zealand tax under the life insurance rules or any applicable DTA. Essentially, the proposed changes seek to deny deductions for the reinsured party in circumstances where the reinsurance premium income is not taxable in New Zealand (due to DTA relief provided to reinsurers under New Zealand DTAs with Canada, Russia and Singapore). Adverse impact of the proposed changes New Zealand life insurers cannot be expected to have completeness of information regarding a reinsurer’s place of tax residence or whether the offshore insurer has a New Zealand permanent establishment. The proposed drafting places an unfair burden on the New Zealand life insurers to confirm the tax residence of the reinsurer. If the reinsurer is resident in Canada, Russia and Singapore, the New Zealand life insurer may not be in a position to renegotiate their reinsurance contracts. Furthermore, a reinsurer’s tax status can change during a contract. It is unfair to penalise an insured part way through a contract by denying deductions for premiums. 27 April 2017 Inland Reveneue Page 3 Proposed changes are contrary to international tax principles In general, double tax agreements (“DTAs”) operate to allocate taxing rights between contracting states. One of the objectives of DTAs is to protect a company from the risk of double taxation. Double taxation occurs when two jurisdictions seek to tax the same source of income. Where this occurs a company can often rely on a DTA to protect them from tax in one of the jurisdictions. DTAs also provide mechanisms, such as the mutual agreement procedure (‘MAP’), for countries to determine which country has the right to tax income. Despite DTAs, a unilateral change to domestic legislation can deny a company the ability to rely on a DTA for protection from double taxation. In particular, if a country denies a tax deduction for a particular expense, where that amount is taxable abroad effectively gives rise to double taxation. We would submit the proposed change to deny deductions to a New Zealand life insurance company, represents an unfair and unilateral reconstruction of the tax treatment of life reinsurance and gives rise to what is in effect a double taxation. The result of this change also leaves a NZ life insurance company, subject to these changes, with no ability to rely on the relevant DTAs or the protection mechanisms within those DTAs. We would also submit that the appropriate response to this risk would be to amend the relevant DTAs. Grandparenting The current tax treatments of reinsurance contracts have no doubt informed decisions taken when entering into existing insurance contracts. While uncertainty and risk is of course inherent in any long term agreement, particularly over an extended horizon like that used for life reinsurance contracts, we consider that it is a legitimate expectation of life insurer that they should be able to continue under reinsurance arrangements for the remainder of their terms without being subject to significant changes in tax policy. Therefore, we submit that it is important that grandparenting treatment is adopted such that reissuance arrangements that existed before the enactment of the proposed changes are not subject to them. Furthermore, effective grandfathering treatment should apply if the tax status of the reinsurer changes during the contract.

INTRODUCTION 1.1 This letter contains Russell McVeagh's submissions on the Government discussion document "BEPS - Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance" (March 2017) ("Discussion Document"). We would be happy to discuss any aspect of the submissions. 1.2 We use the following references: 2. 2.1 3286820 v1 (a) "DTA" means a double tax agreement that New Zealand has entered into; (b) (c) (d) (e) "Income Tax Act" means the Income Tax Act 2007; "Multilateral Instrument" means the OECD's Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS; "PE" means a permanent establishment; and "T AA" means the Tax Administration Act 1994. PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT AVOIDANCE (CHAPTER THREE) Summary of proposal and its rationale Chapter 3 of the Discussion Document proposes a new anti-avoidance rule that would apply to certain arrangements entered into by multinational groups having annual turnover exceeding EUR750 million which defeat "the purpose of \[a\] DT A's PE provisions" (Discussion Document at paragraph 3.21 ). A similar rule is proposed in respect of third party channel providers. Again, the rule would apply only if (among other criteria) the arrangement "defeats the purpose of the PE provisions" (Discussion Document at paragraph 3.27). 1 of 13 Auckland Vera Centre, 48 Shortland Street, PO Box 8, Auckland 1140, New Zealand OX CX1 0085 P +64 9 367 8000 F +64 9 367 8163 Wellington 157 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10-214, Wellington 6143, New Zealand OX SX11189 P +64 4 499 9555 F +64 4 499 9556 2.2 The Discussion Document refers to the Multilateral Instrument which contains a widened PE definition to counter the avoidance of PE status. Paragraph 3.15 of the Discussion Document explains why the Government is concerned that the OECD's response will not be sufficient to prevent arrangements being entered into to avoid a multinational having a PE in New Zealand: This widened definition should be effective in addressing some of the PE avoidance we see in New Zealand. However an issue with the widened definition is that it will only be included in a DTA if both parties so elect. Several of New Zealand's trading partners are not expected to elect to include the widened PE definition, including some countries from which significant investment into New Zealand is made. Therefore, the Government expects that the OECD's PE amendments will not be sufficient to address the issue of PE avoidance in New Zealand. \[Emphasis added\] 2.3 The Discussion Document therefore proposes (see paragraphs 3.40 to 3.45) that the new PE avoidance rule should override New Zealand's DT As. This aspect of the proposed PE avoidance rule is said to be justified on the basis that "the proposed rule is an anti-avoidance provision \[and\] will only apply to an arrangement which defeats the purpose of the DTA's PE provisions". Submission: PE avoidance rule should not override DTAs 2.4 The definition of PE is an important provision in delineating the source country's taxing rights. lt appears (given the variations to the definition seen in New Zealand's DTAs) that the PE definition in any given DTA reflects a negotiated position. In those circumstances, New Zealand should not enact a rule that could in effect unilaterally vary the agreed definition. For New Zealand to do so could do significant harm to the confidence that foreign investors have in the stability of New Zealand's tax policy settings and ability to rely on what New Zealand has agreed in its DT As. 2.5 For these reasons, we submit that: 3286820 v1 (a) the PE avoidance rule should be drafted so it is clear that it applies only to arrangements that defeat the purpose of the PE definition in the particular DT A; and (b) the PE avoidance rule should not override DTAs. Given the comments at paragraphs 3.40 to 3.44 of the Discussion Document, and the fact that the PE avoidance rule would apply only to arrangements defeating the purpose of the PE definition, there is no justification for the avoidance rule to override a DT A. Rather, the rule should be read alongside the relevant DT A, and in light of the recognition in the OECD Commentary (referred to at paragraph 3.42 of the Discussion Document) that there will generally be no conflict between such anti-avoidance provisions and the DT A. 2 of 13 3. AMENDMENTS TO THE SOURCE RULES (CHAPTER FOUR) Summary of proposals and rationale 3.1 A new source rule is proposed to confirm that income will have a source in New Zealand if it is attributable to a PE in New Zealand ("proposed PE source rule"). A domestic law definition of PE is proposed, so that this rule applies even if the non-resident with the PE is resident in a country with which New Zealand does not have a DT A. lt is also proposed that a non-resident's income be deemed to have a source in New Zealand if it would have a New Zealand source under a particular source rule, treating the non-resident's wholly owned group as a single entity {"anti-avoidance source rule"). Submission: anti-avoidance source rule should not proceed 3.2 The stated rationale for the anti-avoidance source rule is to prevent non- residents from avoiding having New Zealand sourced income by dividing their activities between group members (paragraph 4.23 of the Discussion Document). This issue will, however, be addressed by the broadening of the PE definition in DT As as a result of the Multilateral Instrument, the PE avoidance rule, which will apply to all PE definitions, and the new PE source rule and domestic law PE definition. 3.3 The only examples the Discussion Document provides of situations in which the anti-avoidance source rule is necessary are of contract-splitting and fragmentation of activities arrangements. Again, these arrangements would be addressed by the changes to the PE definition in the Multilateral Instrument and/or by the proposed PE source rule and PE avoidance rule. Possibly for this reason, the Discussion Document does not refer to (and we are not aware of) any international precedent for a wide-ranging anti- avoidance source rule such as is proposed. 3.4 In summary, we therefore submit that the proposed anti-avoidance source rule should not proceed. lt would introduce unnecessary complexity in light of the proposed PE source rule, other source rules and the broadening of the PE definition in a number of DTAs as a result of the Multilateral Instrument. In addition, it runs the risk of conflicting with DT As and appears not to be consistent with international practice. 4. STRENGTHENING THE TRANSFER PRICING RULES (CHAPTER FIVE) Reconstruction power in domestic law is unnecessary 4.1 lt is proposed that New Zealand's transfer pricing legislation include an explicit reference to the latest OECD Transfer pricing guidelines. If our domestic law is amended to incorporate the guidelines, we submit that there is no need for an additional reconstruction power in domestic legislation, as such a power is already contained in the guidelines in appropriate cases (see paragraphs 1.64 to 1.69 of the guidelines). 3286820 v1 3 of 13 Burden of proof should not be shifted to the taxpayer or, alternatively, procedural protections are necessary 4.2 lt is proposed that the burden of proof be placed on the taxpayer rather than the Inland Revenue. The stated reason for the proposed change is that multinational structures and transactions have become more complex since the transfer pricing rules were introduced, and that the taxpayer has better information than Inland Revenue does. 4.3 Under current law, the taxpayer determines the arm's length amount in the first instance, but Inland Revenue may determine the amount where Inland Revenue can demonstrate that another amount is a more reliable measure, or where the taxpayer has not co-operated with Inland Revenue (section GC 13(4) of the Income Tax Act). Therefore, while the underlying transactions may be complex, and while the taxpayer should have access to information supporting its determination of the arm's length amount, the taxpayer must nonetheless justify to Inland Revenue the arm's length rate it has determined and persuade Inland Revenue that another amount (proposed by Inland Revenue) is not a more reliable measure of the arm's length amount. 4.4 The current law recognises that there will usually be a range of arm's length prices rather than one precise arm's length amount. In the context of a self- assessment system, it should be sufficient for the amount determined by the taxpayer to be within the range of arm's length amounts. Section GC 13(4) achieves this, whereas placing the onus on a taxpayer to disprove Inland Revenue's asserted arm's length rate would not. 4.5 In the alternative, if the proposed change to the onus of proof does proceed, Inland Revenue should only be able to rely on publicly available information as the basis for whatever arm's length rate it asserts. This needs to be an express requirement in the legislation. If the taxpayer has the onus of proof in respect of a transfer pricing dispute, they need to have full access to the same information that the Inland Revenue is using. Inland Revenue should not be permitted to rely on tax secrecy to decline to disclose details underlying data that Inland Revenue may be relying on. The time bar should not be extended 4.6 lt is proposed that the time bar for transfer pricing matters be increased to seven years. The policy underlying the time bar and the significant role that it plays in the tax system is well known. In the government 2003 discussion document entitled Resolving tax disputes: a legislative review it was stated (at paragraph 6.2) that: 3286820 v1 Time frames provide certainty and finality in respect of a person's tax position. The finality provided by the four-year statutory time bar is emphasised by the courts as central to tax administration so that after the stipulated period of time taxpayers and Inland Revenue may close their books and dispose of their papers. 4 of 13 4.7 The stated rationale for lengthening the time bar in respect of transfer pricing disputes is that such disputes are very dependent on the facts and circumstances of the specific case. This rationale is difficult to sustain. Tax disputes generally are often very dependent on the facts and circumstances. A number of examples are readily available, for example capital/revenue disputes (such as the Trustpower case) and tax residency disputes. 4.8 To extend the time bar in transfer pricing matters would provide the wrong incentives for all parties. A particular difficulty in transfer pricing matters is that there will usually be no single "right" answer but instead a range of prices or rates that should be consistent with the arm's length standard. A further difficulty is that the search for comparables could (potentially) be endless if there is not a time limit on the parties to bring the issues to a head. 4.9 In our experience, these factors can result in transfer pricing investigations and disputes (already) taking longer than they should. Time limits are especially important in such cases, to encourage the parties to compromise if they can, and if they cannot compromise, setting a time limit within which an assessment must be made so the case can be considered by the court. 4.10 Finally, we submit that the table at paragraph 5. 70 of the Discussion Document comparing the standard time bar and time bar for transfer pricing issues in a number of jurisdictions is not compelling evidence that New Zealand should change its approach. While Australia and Canada have adopted the approach that the Discussion Document proposes, many other jurisdictions, such as the US and the UK, have not done so. 4.11 Accordingly, we submit that the time bar should not be extended. 5. ADMINISTRATIVE MEASURES (CHAPTER SIX) Any determination that a large multinational is non-cooperative (see paragraphs 6.13 to 6.20 of the Discussion Document) should be subject to additional procedural safeguards Criteria and process for determining that a taxpayer is non-cooperative need to be clear, transparent and principled 5.1 A determination that a taxpayer is non-cooperative will not only have adverse consequences for the taxpayer under the proposed rules, but could also have significant reputational consequences for the taxpayer. As such, we submit that the definition of non-cooperative should be set out in legislation and further procedural safeguards should be provided for the taxpayer. Statutory definition 5.2 Any statutory definition should make it clear that a taxpayer is not non- cooperative merely because the taxpayer exercises its right to dispute Inland Revenue's position or to contest any steps that Inland Revenue may take in an investigation. We are concerned that any definition that provides 3286820 v1 5 of 13 otherwise would be inconsistent with section 27(3) of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. Relevantly, section 27(3) provides that: Every person has the right to bring civil proceedings against, and to defend civil proceedings brought by, the Crown, and to have those proceedings heard, according to the law, in the same way as civil proceedings between individuals. 5.3 The White Paper on the Bill of Rights was in the same terms as the current Act. The White Paper commentary noted that the purpose of what is now section 27(3) was: to give constitutional status to the core principle recognised in Crown Proceedings Act 1950: that the individual should be able to bring legal proceedings against the Government, and more generally to engage in civil litigation with it, without the Government enjoying any procedural or jurisdictional privileges. This is central to the rule of law. 5.4 The Courts have interpreted the right consistently with the White Paper. 1 If Inland Revenue could deem a taxpayer to be non-cooperative merely because the taxpayer is questioning or resisting (using proper process) some action Inland Revenue is taking in connection with a dispute, this would provide a procedural advantage to Inland Revenue that is not enjoyed by a lay litigant. This would be contrary to the right enshrined in section 27(3). Further procedural safeguards 5.5 In addition to the statutory definition, Inland Revenue should issue guidance regarding the process to be followed in determining whether a taxpayer is non-cooperative. Such guidance should be in the form of a Standard Practice Statement. 5.6 We agree with the Discussion Document (at paragraph 6.16) that the power to make any such determination should be confined to a relatively small number of officials within Inland Revenue. This should help achieve a consistency of approach. Furthermore, we submit that the senior official making such a determination should be independent from the personnel auditing/investigating or otherwise engaged with the taxpayer. 5.7 We also agree that Inland Revenue should warn the taxpayer before any determination is made. We submit that this should take the form of a written notice specifying the acts or omissions that Inland Revenue considers make the taxpayer non-cooperative. The taxpayer should then have the opportunity to respond to the warning and/or to remedy the acts or omissions that Inland Revenuehasspecffied. 5.8 lt is important for a taxpayer to have a right to challenge (before a court) any decision of Inland Revenue to deem it to be non-cooperative. As noted above, any decision to deem a taxpayer to be non-cooperative may have consequences going beyond the proposals in the Discussion Document. See for example Vinelight Nominees Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (2005) 22 NZTC 19,298 at \[52\]-\[55\]. 3286820 v1 6 of 13 The proposal to bring forward the date for payment for tax in dispute (paragraphs 6.21 to 6.26 of the Discussion Document) is arbitrary and should not proceed Primary submission: proposed amendment is unnecessary and should not proceed 5.9 The Discussion Document proposes that the payment of tax in dispute for large multinationals in a dispute with Inland Revenue in relation to certain disputes be brought forward. We submit that this proposal is unjustified for the following reasons: 5.10 2 (a) The proposed rule is arbitrary. The Discussion Document proposes that the rule apply where the dispute relates to transfer pricing, the amount of income with a New Zealand source or the amount of tax payable under a DTA. We submit that there is nothing special about these matters to warrant the payment of tax in advance. (b) The general rule that disputed tax be payable only following final determination of any dispute should remain. In cases where Inland Revenue considers there to be a significant risk that the tax in dispute will not be paid should the disputant's challenge be unsuccessful, the Inland Revenue can require the taxpayer to pay the tax early (see section 1381(28) of the T AA). (c) Contrary to the suggestion in the Discussion Document (at paragraph 6.21) large multinationals are not currently incentivised to delay the resolution of a dispute. The rate of use of money interest is materially higher than commercial rates for large multinationals. While the ability of a taxpayer to access funds in a tax pooling account can mitigate to some extent the use of money interest regime, it does not eliminate it since the use of tax pooling involves its own costs. (d) The Discussion Document provides no evidence of large multinationals not paying disputed tax found to be owing at the conclusion of the dispute. If there is a risk of non-payment in a particular case, Inland Revenue has the power (in section 1381(28) of the T AA) to require advance payment, as noted above. Further, there is no justification for the Discussion Document proposal to restrict the use of tax pooling in disputes relating to transfer prising, the amount of income with a New Zealand source or the amount of tax payable under a DT A. The tax pooling rules were introduced in order to allow taxpayer to "\[reduce\] use-of-money interest exposure". 2 The Discussion Document offers no justification as to why that rationale does not apply (and tax pooling should not be available) in the three categories of dispute identified. Inland Revenue Taxation (Annual Rates, Maori Organisations, Taxpayer Compliance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill: Officials' Report to the Finance and Expenditure Committee on Submissions on the Bill (November 2002) at 3. 3286820 v1 7 of 13 Alternative submission: If the proposal does proceed, payment should be required within 90 days of Inland Revenue issuing an assessment and there should be further procedural safeguards 5.11 If the proposal does proceed, we submit that the first of the alternative options should be implemented (ie, that payment should be required within 90 days of Inland Revenue issuing an assessment for the tax in dispute). We consider that this would strike a more appropriate balance than the requirement to pay within 12 months of Inland Revenue issuing a notice of proposed adjustment. The power to collect tax from a wholly owned subsidiary of a large multinational in New Zealand (paragraphs 6.27 and 6.28 of the Discussion Document) is unnecessary and inappropriate Primary submission: proposed amendment is unnecessary and should not proceed 5.12 The Discussion Document proposes that any tax payable by a member of a large multinational would be collectible from "any wholly owned subsidiary of the multinational in New Zealand" and from "the related New Zealand entity in a case where the income is attributed to a deemed PE of the non-resident under the proposed PE avoidance rule" (discussed above). 5.13 The proposed rule will have the effect of making all wholly owned group members of a large multinational group jointly and severally liable for the tax obligations of the other members of the group. This overrides the fundamental principle of separate legal personality for companies and limited liability for obligations of a company. 5.14 We are unaware of any existing difficulty resulting from members of a large multinational group not paying tax which is due and payable which would justify this proposed new rule. The Discussion Document does not provide (or even suggest that there is) any evidence of such difficulties arising. 5.15 Under the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, Inland Revenue has the power (see Articles 11 to 16) to request assistance from other jurisdictions in the collection of tax owing. New Zealand should maintain its commitment to international cooperation in BEPS matters by using that convention, rather than seeking to impose unilateral measures which cut across fundamental principles of corporate law. Alternative submission: If the proposal does proceed, further taxpayer protections should be implemented 5.16 If the proposal does proceed, we submit that Inland Revenue should be required to obtain a court order to collect tax from an entity other than the entity against which the tax was assessed. As noted above, the proposed rule is a significant departure from the norms of corporate law and any exercise of such a power should be subject to judicial supervision. 3286820 v1 8 of 13 Collection of information from offshore group members (paragraphs 6.29 to 6.37 of the Discussion Document) Overview 5.17 The Discussion Document proposes to make a New Zealand entity responsible for providing information that Inland Revenue believes is held by another member of the large multinational group. The proposal would go further than the current powers in section 17 of the T AA which requires a person to provide information held by foreign entities which that person controls. 5.18 The Discussion Document at paragraph 6.35 proposes a "consequential change" to section 143(2) of the TAA to allow a person to be convicted of an offence if the person does not provide information alleged to be held by a non- resident associated person. The proposal means that a New Zealand group member could be convicted of an offence in respect of acts or omissions by one or more non-resident associates even though the New Zealand group member may have no control or influence over that associate. The proposed rule has been rejected previously 5.19 An amendment to section 17 of the T AA that would have required a New Zealand person to furnish information held by non-resident associated persons was proposed in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Maori Organisations, Taxpayer Compliance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill as introduced. 3 Following submissions to the Select Committee, it was accepted that the application of the rule should be restricted. 4 This narrowed rule (applying only to information held by foreign entities controlled by the New Zealand person, not to all non-resident associates of the New Zealand person) was subsequently enacted. Reference to Australian and Canadian provisions 5.20 Paragraph 6.34 of the Discussion Document states that the proposed change: 3 4 ... would align New Zealand's offshore information powers with other countries' such as Australia and Canada which have specific provisions that enable their tax authorities to directly request information or documents from offshore \[Footnotes omitted\] For the reasons given below, the Australian and Canadian prov1s1ons are materially different from what is proposed in the Discussion Document. Clause 75. Inland Revenue Taxation {Annual Rates, Maori Organisations, Taxpayer Compliance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill: Officials' Report to the Finance and Expenditure Committee on Submissions on the Bill ((November 2002) at 110. 3286820 v1 9 of 13 Australia 5.21 The Discussion Document refers to section 264A of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth). Unlike the general power to request information in section 17 of the TAA, section 264A of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) is directed at the particular risk to the Australian Commissioner of offshore information not being provided during an investigation and subsequently being used in proceedings to dispute an assessments 5.22 Failure to comply with an information request is not an offence. 6 The only sanction for failure to comply with a notice under section 264A is evidentiary (ie, the information that the taxpayer failed to provide under the notice cannot be used in subsequent proceedings to dispute an assessment).? In addition, there is greater scope to challenge the Australian Commissioner's decision to issue a notice given the more circumscribed nature of the power. 8 Canada 5.23 The Canadian provision in section 231.6 of the Income Tax Act RSC 1985 c 1 also provides more scope for a taxpayer to challenge a decision to request information. Section 231.6(5) sets out the powers of a Judge when reviewing the decision to issue a request for foreign-based information or documentation. A Judge, on application of the taxpayer, may: (a) confirm the requirement; (b) vary the requirement as the judge considers appropriate in the circumstances; or (c) set aside the requirement if the judge is satisfied that the requirement is unreasonable. 5.24 Case law has clarified that a notice must be reasonable in all circumstances. That the information is held by a non-resident who is not controlled by a taxpayer will not make the request unreasonable, 9 however, the fact that the information is held by a non-resident who is controlled by the taxpayer will not make it reasonable. 10 A balancing exercise must be undertaken by the Judge in each case. 5.25 The consequence of failing to comply with a notice is similar to the Australian provision. Section 231.6(8) provides that: 5 6 7 8 9 10 If a person fails to comply substantially with a notice served under this subsection 231.6(2) and if the notice is not set aside by a judge pursuant to section 231.6(5), any court having FH Faulding and Co Lid v the Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia \[1994\] FCA 1492; (1994) 54 FCR 75 at \[30\].

On summary conviction, a taxpayer is liable to a fine of no more than CAN$25,000 and/or up to 12 months imprisonment. Discussion Document's justification for the proposal 5.27 The Discussion Document notes that Inland Revenue can and does request information from foreign tax authorities using its exchange of information rights. The Discussion Document suggests however, that these powers are inadequate for two reasons: 5.28 5.29 5.30 11 Recent improvements to the exchange of information between tax authorities are making it easier for Inland Revenue to request and exchange information that is held by offshore tax authorities. However, relying on an ability to request information indirectly from other tax authorities is not always adequate. In some cases, the relevant information is not held by the offshore tax authority and in other cases the foreign tax authority may be slow or unhelpful in responding to reasonable requests for information. The first reason given is that the relevant information is in some cases "not held by the offshore tax authority". But this is not a compelling argument, since foreign tax authorities can and do exercise their own information gathering powers to obtain information that Inland Revenue requests under the DTA, just as Inland Revenue does when it receives requests for information from foreign revenue authorities. lt is difficult to evaluate the second aspect of the justification (that the foreign tax authority may be slow or unhelpful in responding) without knowing how common this is. lt is to be hoped that this is not often the case given that the DTA or Tax Information Exchange Agreement ("TIEA") (as applicable) imposes an obligation on the foreign Government to comply with a valid request, and that New Zealand (presumably) complies with its obligations under the DTA or TIEA. But to the extent Inland Revenue might sometimes encounter difficulties or delays in obtaining information from a foreign revenue authority, we note that the New Zealand resident companies may be in no better position to compel a non-resident group member to supply information. This has been recognised by the courts in the discovery context. In that context, the courts are unlikely to order discovery when the information is held by an entity which the relevant party has no control over. 11 For the New Zealand company, it is not simply a matter of requesting the information from (or forwarding on Inland Revenue's information request to) the relevant foreign affiliates and expecting that the See for example Howard Trading Auckland Limited and Anor v Nissan New Zealand Limited HC Auckland CIV-2009- 404-003111 at \[32\]. 3286820 v1 11 of 13 5.31 5.32 12 information will be provided. There are more obvious practical difficulties which, we submit, makes this proposal unworkable: (a) Multinational groups may be comprised of a large number of companies in many countries. lt may be impossible for personnel working for the New Zealand entity to know which company holds what information. (b) Inland Revenue information requests are often very broadly worded, and may call for the production of large numbers (not infrequently thousands) of emails and other documents, which in turn could necessitate the review of an even greater number of documents to determine which are within the scope of the request. For such requests to apply not only to the New Zealand group but also to foreign associated persons could make the requests so costly and burdensome to comply with that compliance is for all practical purposes impossible. (c) The New Zealand company will usually have no legal right to require a foreign associate to provide information to it. And even if the foreign associate is willing (in the interests of the group) to devote the time and resources necessary to assist the New Zealand company in locating and providing relevant documents, the foreign associate will need to consider whether it is appropriate to do so. For example, some of the information may be legally privileged. And local privacy and confidentiality laws will need to be considered. 12 Alternative submission: if the proposal does proceed a court order should be required If the proposal does proceed, Inland Revenue should be required to obtain a court order to require the New Zealand entity to provide information not held by it or by an entity it controls. This would provide judicial oversight in respect of the breadth of the request and feasibility of complying with it, and as to whether the need for such an onerous power to be exercised is justified in the circumstances and its exercise would be reasonable. We further submit that Inland Revenue should not have the power to impose a penalty for non-compliance with the offshore information request. New Zealand should follow the Australian and Canadian approach. Failure to comply with the information request should only result in evidentiary consequences unless a court imposes a penalty. These considerations were behind the need for FATCA to be implemented through Intergovernmental Agreements, such as that concluded between New Zealand and the United States. Had New Zealand financial institutions agreed to provide information directly to the United States (pursuant to an agreement with the United States Government under section 1471 of the Internal Revenue Code) they may have been in breach of their implied contractual obligation of confidentiality and/or their obligations under the Privacy Act 1993. For them to disclose the information to another Government to avoid a financial detriment (FATCA withholding) may not have been recognised as falling within the disclosure under compulsion of law exceptions to their confidentiality and Privacy Act obligations. 3286820 v1 12 of 13 Russ.=ll Mc.\\.=agh Penalties for not providing information requested by Inland Revenue Penalty for non-compliance should be required to be imposed by the court 5.33 The Discussion Document proposes that a civil penalty of $100,000 can be imposed by Inland Revenue if a large multinational fails to comply with an information request under section 17 or section 21. We submit that any power to impose such a penalty should rest with the Courts and not with Inland Revenue. Alternative submission: if the proposed rule is introduced, taxpayers should have the right to apply to the court for relief 5.34 We submit that if the proposed rule is introduced, taxpayers should have the right to apply to the Court to have the penalty reduced or set aside. This is a necessary minimum requirement to comply with sect i on 27 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and should be explicit in the legislation. General comments on section 21 of the TAA 5.35 Section 21 of the TAA should be rewritten or repealed. Inland Revenue has comprehensive informat i on gathering powers under section 17 of the T AA. Section 21 is arbitrary in its application (being triggered by the non-response to an information request after 90 days, without regard to whether that time- frame is reasonable in the circumstances) and draconian in its consequences (denying a taxpayer access to the courts to challenge an assessment) . 5.36 We do not consider there to be any reason why section 17 and section 21 should vary in their application. Denying a taxpayer access to the courts is, as discussed above , on the face of it a breach of section 27(3) of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act. Section 21 therefore requires (at a minimum) to be reviewed, and unless on review it can be established that section 21 fulfils a purpose that is not met by section 17 then section 21 should be repealed.

The NFTC, organized in 1914, is an association of approximately 250 U.S. business enterprises engaged in all aspects of international trade and investment. Our membership covers the full spectrum of industrial, commercial, financial and service activities and the NFTC therefore seeks to foster an environment in which U.S. companies can be dynamic and effective competitors in the international business arena. The NFTC’s emphasis is to encourage policies that will expand U.S. exports and enhance the competitiveness of U.S. companies by eliminating major tax inequities in the treatment of U.S. companies operating abroad. To achieve this goal, American businesses must be able to participate fully in business activities throughout the world, through the export of goods, services, technology, and entertainment and through direct investment in facilities abroad. Foreign trade is fundamental to the economic growth of U.S. companies The NFTC appreciates the willingness of the New Zealand Department of Inland Revenue (Inland Revenue) to request and consider comments regarding the discussion document. Contrary to the assertion made in paragraph 1.4 that “\[t\]hey are not intended to make any fundamental changes to the current international tax framework’, the NFTC believes the discussion document diverts from international norms and the OECD Base Erosion & Profit Shifting (BEPS) Action Plan in which New Zealand agreed and actively participated. The NFTC agrees with the statement in paragraph 1.5 that “It is important to enforce the TEL: (202) 887-0278 FAX: (202) 452-8160 Advancing Global Commerce for Over 90 Years www.nftc.org #011 integrity and efficiency of the tax system in designing tax policy so that there is a level playing field.” However, while seemingly justifying the proposals in the discussion document by reference to Australian and UK efforts, enactment of the unilateral actions in the discussion document will make New Zealand an outlier, increase tax uncertainty, negatively affect foreign direct investment into New Zealand, and may lead to other countries enacting unilateral actions that erode progress made in the BEPS Action Plan. A summary of the NFTC’s major points and recommendations are as follows: Source and permanent establishment avoidance 1 The NFTC believes the proposed PE Anti-Avoidance Rule “deeming” a non-resident entity to have a permanent establishment in New Zealand if a related entity carries out sales activity in New Zealand will apply to non-abusive common regional sales structures with New Zealand sales and support entities that are appropriately compensated. This subjective proposal ignores legal entities, is outside of the OECD BEPS Action Plan, will apply to common non-abusive regional sales structures, and creates significant uncertainty and unnecessary disputes with taxpayers and between New Zealand and its trading partners. 2 If Inland Revenue believes these local sales support activities are not appropriately compensated, the NFTC believes the analysis should be considered under the transfer pricing guidelines rather than subjectively “deeming” a permanent establishment which may or may not have any additional profit attributable to the PE. 3 The reference in paragraph 3.24 regarding “\[w\]hether the arrangement has any of the indicators of PE avoidance, such as the involvement of a low tax jurisdiction, specialized services, or a related entity which is allocated a low amount of profit on the basis it is carrying out low value activities while having a number of well paid employees”, illustrates that any concerns should be considered using a transfer pricing analysis rather than creating a ‘deemed” PE. Contrary to the statement made in paragraph 3.26 that “\[i\]t is not intended to deem a PE to exist where one does not in substance”, the discussion document does just that. 4 The helpful examples in the Appendix actually support the case that any New Zealand concerns should be addressed via a transfer pricing analysis rather than “deeming” a PE. 5 In example 1, a direct sale by a non-resident from offshore does not create New Zealand source income or a deemed New Zealand permanent establishment. As mentioned, “\[f\]rom a policy perspective this outcome is entirely in accordance with the current norms of international taxation which New Zealand – as well as other countries – follow.” The NFTC agrees. 6 However, in Example 3, a direct sale from offshore with in-market sales activities would, as a result of the discussion document “ensure that the New Zealand subsidiary’s sales activity created a PE for the non-resident; deem the non-resident to supply its goods or services through the PE; ensure the non-resident’s sales income had New Zealand Advancing Global Commerce for Over 90 Years www.nftc.org #011 source; and allow New Zealand to apply NRWT to the royalty paid by the non-resident to the related entity resident in the no tax jurisdiction under any applicable DTA.” The discussion document notes: “\[u\]nder the in-market support structure, the New Zealand subsidiary is paid a fee for its services, but this fee generally only exceeds its costs by a small margin.” The NFTC submits that this is a transfer pricing issue rather than a permanent establishment issue. As a matter of policy, ignoring legal structures and “deeming” a PE for customary and non-abusive in-market sales activity, will create substantial uncertainty and may result in the non-resident eliminating local sales support functions to minimize PE risk to the detriment of the New Zealand economy and consumers 7 In addition, the NFTC believes that applying the subjective rule in the discussion document to “deem” a permanent establishment “under an arrangement in which those goods or services are to be on-sold to customers in New Zealand by a third party (whether related or not)”, will create additional uncertainty and PE risk that may negatively affect a non-resident’s decision to participate in the New Zealand market. The NFTC is concerned about the unpredictability and uncertainty caused by enacting domestic legislation which overrides the OECD PE standard. In this regard, the statement in 3.45 that the “PE avoidance rule would apply notwithstanding anything in the DTA” seems contradictory to the statement in 3.2 that “the proposed rule is not intended to widen the accepted international definition of PE in substance”. There is also an explanation in Section 3.15 that the domestic rule is being considered to address situations where a DTA does not exist or where the “broadened” language is not accepted in the DTA. The PE standard being considered for adoption is admittedly broader than the OECD definition. 8 The term “third party” buyer in the factors listed in 3.27 should be defined consistently with the description in 3.31 which carves out of the rule entities which purchase goods from a non-resident and independently sell them to third parties. In 3.27, the third bullet should clarify that “carrying out an activity related to the sale” does not apply when the buyer is independently selling to third parties. Otherwise the language in 3.27 is ambiguous. The definition of an independent third party should exclude third parties who are not managed or controlled by the offshore seller or are publically traded.. In these instances, it is not possible to offer sales of supplies on other than arms-length terms. 9 In the bullet point 3.24 where the application of the rule is discussed, the specific bullet addressing the nature of the services carried out should indicate that the rule would potentially apply only where the services include locating customers, promoting products to those customers, discussing the customer’s needs and tailoring the product to be sold for the customer, and indicating pricing and delivery dates and other key terms to the customer”, to be consistent with the example in 3.26. 10 Regarding the interaction with New Zealand’s double tax agreements, paragraph 3.45 provides “’ \[w\]e propose providing that our PE avoidance rule would apply notwithstanding anything in a DTA.” The NFTC believes such unilateral action will Advancing Global Commerce for Over 90 Years www.nftc.org #011 further erode the tax treaty network, erode international tax norms, and result in more tax disputes between New Zealand, taxpayers, and New Zealand’s international trading partners. Chapter 5: Strengthening the transfer pricing rules 11 Paragraph 5.69 notes that “\[I\]t can be difficult for tax authorities to adequately identify the risk, apply the arm’s length principle and amend the relevant tax return within four years.” Citing Australia and Canada as precedent for a seven-year time bar for transfer pricing, the discussion document proposes increasing New Zealand’s time bar for transfer pricing matters to seven years. 12 The NFTC believes the difficulties identified in the discussion document should be adequately addressed by the Government’s proposal to shift the burden of proof from the Commissioner to the taxpayer in transfer pricing matters. Extending the time bar to seven years in transfer pricing cases will increase uncertainty, delay timely resolution, and add to the inventory, time, and administrative costs for New Zealand and its treaty partners. A reasonable time bar benefits both taxpayers and tax administrators by not overly prolonging a transfer pricing determination. As such, the extension of the time bar should not proceed. 13 If the time bar extension does proceed, consideration needs to be given to the interaction of the extended time bar for transfer pricing matters, the impact on competent authority cases, and the time bar applicable for other purposes. An adjustment for transfer pricing could also have an impact on withholding tax and income tax. The NFTC is concerned that extending the time bar for transfer pricing matters may result in unintended consequences including a de facto extension of the time bar for other tax types, an inability for taxpayers to claim offsetting adjustments when transfer pricing matters are reassessed, and a growing inventory of expensive and prolonged competent authority cases for New Zealand and other governments. Chapter 6: Administrative measures Non-cooperation 14 Chapter 6 proposes to introduce new administrative measures that would apply to large multinationals as a result of non-cooperation. The proposed measures include the ability for Inland Revenue to issue an assessment based on information held at the time; and impose penalties for failure to comply with information requests. 15 The discussion document states in paragraph 6.17 that the proposed rules are not intended to impose unreasonable demands on multinationals. However, some of the factors put forward in the proposal in paragraph 6.16 are sufficiently vague and subjective including: Advancing Global Commerce for Over 90 Years www.nftc.org #011 • Failure by the taxpayer to provide information within the possession or control of the taxpayer or its associated parties \[emphasis added\] within a statutory timeframe; • Failure to respond to IR correspondence; the provision of misleading information (including where the information is misleading by omission); • Failure to provide sufficient information to determine the arm’s length amount of a related party transaction, or to determine the amount of profit which should be attributable to a PE; 16 The NFTC believes the threshold at which a large multinational is treated as “non- cooperative” should be carefully considered by Inland Revenue which should consider the following when determining that a taxpayer is “non-cooperative”: • Information requests by Inland Revenue can be onerous and sourcing the level of material can often be difficult to obtain from within large organisations within timeframes set by Inland Revenue. The NFTC notes that delays in obtaining relevant information are generally not driven by unwillingness of taxpayers to provide information, but are a product of practical difficulties of sourcing relevant information from within large organisations. Practical difficulties faced by large multinationals are similar (and probably more significant in comparison) to difficulties experienced by large New Zealand corporations. NFTC does not consider it appropriate or necessary to require a different standard of co-operation for large multinationals in comparison to large New Zealand corporate taxpayers. • Taxpayers that are required to provide a significant amount of information often treat the process of obtaining and providing information to Revenue Authorities as if it was part of the process of legal discovery to avoid costs involved in repeating the process if the matter progresses to litigation. This inevitably involves a more thorough process of data capture, compilation and review, with associated additional time and cost involved. Payment of tax in dispute 17 The NFTC is concerned that payment of tax in disputes in advance of resolution may lead to inappropriate assessments, inappropriate incentives for Inland Revenue officials, and a substantial increase in tax risk and uncertainty which could chill foreign direct investment into New Zealand. Contrary to the assertion in paragraph 6.26 that the rule to impose early payment is intended to remove any incentive to prolong a dispute with Inland Revenue, the NFTC asserts that taxpayers favor early resolution of disputes. In any event, imposing interest on a final assessment, if any, fully compensates the government for the time before a final assessment is ascertained. Collection of information Advancing Global Commerce for Over 90 Years www.nftc.org #011 18 Paragraph 6.33 of the discussion document proposes that the Commissioner be provided with a direct power to request information or documents that are held by or accessible to a group member that is located outside New Zealand. The discussion document recognises that there have been recent improvements to the exchange of information between Revenue Authorities, making it easier for IR to obtain information. However, the discussion document states that in some cases the relevant information is not held by the offshore tax authorities and in other cases the foreign tax authority may be slow or unhelpful in responding to reasonable requests for information. 19 The NFTC notes that in addition to automatic exchange of information with other Revenue Authorities, the ability of Revenue Authorities to collect information from large multinationals has also increased as a result of the OECD country-by-country reporting initiative. 20 The NFTC believes that the proposal to introduce specific provisions to enable Inland Revenue to directly request information or documents from a group member that is located outside of New Zealand is unlikely to result in Inland Revenue receiving information in a timelier manner than it would if it were to request the same information from the New Zealand taxpayer under New Zealand’s existing rules. Delays in responding to appropriate and relevant information requests from Inland Revenue are attributable to practical difficulties of sourcing appropriate and relevant information within large organisations, rather than because of unwillingness by large multinationals to provide relevant information. Penalties for not providing information 21 Paragraph 6.35 of the discussion document proposes that a person may be convicted of an offence for failing to provide information held by an associated offshore group member. 22 The NFTC believes it would be inappropriate for New Zealand to expect officers and/or directors of the relevant New Zealand subsidiary to have access to offshore information, the ability to require offshore parent companies to provide information, or the ability to influence the production of non-New Zealand information appropriately or inappropriately requested by Inland Revenue. Exposing local officers and or directors to substantial penalties for failure to produce documents outside of their control is inappropriate and would materially impact the willingness of individuals to act as officers of New Zealand subsidiaries of multinational groups. The NFTC believes that it would not be reasonable or appropriate to impose penalties on New Zealand officers and/or directors for failing to provide information held by an associated offshore group member outside of their control. The NFTC appreciates Inland Revenue’s willingness to consider our comments and concerns.

Schultz Vice President for Tax Policy Advancing Global Commerce for Over 90 Years www.nftc.org 28 April 2017 BEPS – Transfer pricing, PE avoidance & Interest limitation rules C/- Deputy Commissioner, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 By email: policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz Dear Cath BEPS – Transfer pricing, PE avoidance and proposed interest limitation rules The American Chamber of Commerce in New Zealand Inc appreciates the opportunity to comment on New Zealand’s proposals for international tax reform released on 3 March 2017. The American Chamber of Commerce in New Zealand Inc – better known as AmCham – has been New Zealand’s number one business organisation for the promotion of trade and investment between the United States and New Zealand and the Asia Pacific region for over 50 years. We are “The Voice of American Business in New Zealand”. Our members represent turnover in excess of NZ$50 billion and over 100,000 employees. Our submission covers two Government discussion documents – BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance and BEPS – Strengthening our interest limitation rules. We provide comments on the overall approach which we recommend should be adopted by the Government, supplemented by our recommendations for changes to the specific proposals regarding permanent establishments (“PEs”), interest limitation rules and transfer pricing. 1. Executive Summary Inbound investment from the United States is important to New Zealand – both in absolute dollars (at least 8% of total foreign direct investment \[“FDI”\]) and through wider contributions to the economy and society. Tax policy should recognise the importance of inbound FDI while ensuring that inbound investors, including our members, pay their “fair share”. Fairness and certainty considerations lead us to supporting implementation of the BEPS recommendations in New Zealand where such implementation responds to an observable problem. However, there is a strong case for targeting measures to issues of concern to Inland Revenue rather than imposing compliance costs on members with a good compliance and tax paying history. Interest limitation #023 TP +PE #012 With regards to the proposals concerning PE avoidance: • We support enforcement of the accepted international definition of a PE. This is best done by way of implementing the Multilateral convention to implement tax treaty related measures to prevent BEPS rather than a unilateral PE anti-avoidance rule. • Should New Zealand proceed with the PE anti-avoidance rule, clarity of scope and application is essential, there should be a transitional rule to allow our members the time to restructure and guidance from Inland Revenue regarding profit attribution would be welcome. We agree with aspects of the proposed reforms to interest limitation rules but wonder if the Government has lost sight of the strength of New Zealand’s existing thin capitalisation rules. Members have major concerns regarding the proposed limit on interest rates on related party loans, as it will lead to double taxation in many cases and is incompatible with the arm’s length principle. We agree in principle with the change to require total assets to be calculated net of non-debt liabilities, but our members should be given time to adjust their existing arrangements. Other conditions for our support include that the ability to use net current asset values is retained, deferred tax liabilities are excluded from the definition of non-debt liabilities and existing financing arrangements are grandparented for an extended period. With respect to transfer pricing, we support aligning New Zealand’s transfer pricing rules to OECD Guidelines. Better alignment with the Australian transfer pricing rules is also appropriate, but only to the extent that those rules remain consistent with the principles set down by the OECD and do not seek to target a greater than arm’s length proportion of profit. Members do have concerns regarding the references to limited risk distribution (“LRD”) structures. LRD structures commonly reflect commercial substance and are frequently embedded within a global group’s worldwide framework. The LRD structure is especially prominent in the pharmaceutical and technology industries, where a large amount of research and development happens earlier in the supply chain in foreign jurisdictions. The distribution activity undertaken is often relatively low in terms of value-add. Members also see a number of the administrative measures proposed as inappropriate. We have concerns regarding penalties for not providing information, the factors leading to a finding that a taxpayer is non-cooperative, Inland Revenue’s additional information gathering powers and the enforced early payment of tax in dispute. We expand on these issues below. 2. Importance of New Zealand/United States relationship The United States is New Zealand’s second largest source of foreign direct investment, representing at least 8% of total FDI. Many American inbound investors create substantial value through their business activity here, over and above the tax paid, in ways not visible through financial statements alone. Tax policy should take account of these hard to measure spillover effects while ensuring that inbound in vestors continue to pay their fair share. As the world has become more interconnected FDI has increasingly become a hot topic. For New Zealand how we connect with the world is a major issue since we import most of our technology and have a relatively shallow domestic capital base. New Zealand–United States trade and investment has a considerable impact on the New Zealand economy. The Government has acknowledged our tax settings must “be consistent with maintaining New Zealand’s position as an attractive location to base a business.” There is a broad consensus that taxation is a significant factor in location decisions regarding inbound investment. United States companies operating in New Zealand account for investment totalling in excess of NZD 12.6 billion and thousands of jobs. Direct investment in New Zealand is mostly in the finance/insurance and manufacturing sectors, with many investments having some degree of mobility. The United States accounts for at least 8.0% of foreign direct investment into New Zealand. This figure is likely to be materially understated as it excludes investment ultimately sourced from the United States but routed via third countries such as Australia and Singapore. Inland Revenue’s own statistics show that, of the 314 foreign owned groups completing its international tax questionnaire, some 59 (or 19%) have ultimate American ownership. The United States has become New Zealand’s third largest trading partner, with trade totalling in excess of NZD 11 billion. In particular, New Zealand’s largest imports of tangible goods from the United States include aircraft, jets, motor vehicles, medical instruments, food and appliances. Our members’ businesses have a positive impact on New Zealand society in many ways. Technology companies among our membership are commonly singled out during tax debates due to their digital nature. Yet these members belong to a sector having a transformative effect on the New Zealand economy, with the benefits from their presence extending well beyond New Zealand’s receipt of corporate income tax. Traditional economic and accounting indicators can underplay this effect and lead to the importance of inbound investment being underplayed. The digital economy in particular has the potential to drive future economic growth and productivity when it is adopted by businesses and consumed by users, whereas a large portion of the value of the digital economy goes unmeasured in today’s economic indicators. For example: • In terms of economic development, the digital economy can help alleviate the “double tyranny” of New Zealand’s relative size and distance that affects businesses; • Consumer benefits of digital communication are seen in increased convenience, better access to information, well informed decisions and more time saved in our daily lives; and • With respect to transport, better mapping technology enables improved navigation and helps people find local businesses and tourist destinations. AmCham consider that it is legitimate for the Government to take into account the wider spillover effects of our members’ inbound investment when setting tax policy. We emphasise that we are not seeking any form of tax break or incentive: it is important that taxes are fair and seen to be fair. Our members are happy to pay their “fair share” in accordance with legislation. 3. Overall comments on the approach taken in the discussion documents AmCham supports implementation of the BEPS recommendations in New Zealand where such implementation responds to an observable problem. Our members do not accept that aggressive tax practices are commonplace in New Zealand. There is a strong case for targeting measures to issues of concern to Inland Revenue rather than imposing compliance costs on members with a good compliance and tax paying history. Today’s business structures have evolved within a dated tax system and everyone will benefit from a simpler, more transparent, tax system. The members of AmCham support the work of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) and the G20 towards coordinated tax reform to ensure that global tax rules keep pace with business evolution. We recognise that consistent and fair taxation of multinationals has become more difficult in recent years. We also note the Government’s consistent support for, and major policy contribution to, the OECD’s work. AmCham therefore agrees a proportionate implementation of the OECD recommendations is the right tax policy for New Zealand. Keeping the Government’s response proportionate to the size of the problem, while not deterring inbound investment, will be crucial. To this end, we agree with the Government that the majority of multinational companies operating in New Zealand comply with their tax obligations and with the Minister of Revenue that “most foreign-owned firms operating here have relatively conservative debt positions and pay significant amounts of tax.” We note further recent research conducted by EY which supports the conclusion that the majority of multinationals are not loading their New Zealand subsidiaries with excessive interest-bearing debt and that the majority have an effective tax rate close to, or equal to, the New Zealand corporate tax rate. While the evidence is not fully conclusive, AmCham does not accept that aggressive tax practices are prevalent in New Zealand. We are further concerned that measures enacted unilaterally in New Zealand will over time have a similar impact on our New Zealand members operating in overseas jurisdictions. Should all countries implement the full package of measures proposed in New Zealand, such as the interest rate cap or anti-avoidance source rule, double taxation appears inevitable. AmCham therefore considers it essential for New Zealand to take a measured approach and to stay within international norms. Governments should harmonise tax rules so that businesses can continue to create value. Fragmentation along country lines puts this value at risk. Unilateral action by New Zealand in addressing perceived base erosion and profit shifting (“BEPS”) will be harmful if it also creates double taxation. A coordinated approach to BEPS will lead to more certainty for businesses, more efficient economic outcomes and growth, fewer cross-border tax disputes between revenue authorities and a higher global tax-take. AmCham also endorses New Zealand’s international tax framework. We consider the Government needs to confirm that it is open for business, consistent with New Zealand’s taxation framework for inbound investment. Foreign businesses will respond favourably to certain and predictable tax laws in New Zealand. The benefits of foreign direct investment are endorsed in the discussion documents. We note that the package is a powerful combination. It has gained international attention, and will put New Zealand at the forefront of BEPS implementation worldwide. Given the substantial impact that some components of the package will have, we suggest that the Government consider whether any measures can be targeted at highly geared companies which have sought aggressively to minimise their New Zealand tax liability. Finally, we support the consultative process adopted by the New Zealand Government. 4. Permanent establishment avoidance Support for rule which enforces the accepted international definition of a permanent establishment We agree that economic activities which should result in a PE in New Zealand should be subject to tax here. We therefore support a rule which enforces but does not widen the accepted international definition of a PE in substance. We further agree that there is no need for a separate diverted profits tax. That said, the proposed PE anti-avoidance rule does replicate elements of the United Kingdom diverted profits tax, notably sharing many features with Australia’s multinational anti-avoidance law. We highlight, however, that New Zealand’s implementation of the Multilateral convention to implement tax treaty related measures to prevent BEPS has the potential to address most, if not all, of the attempts to flout PE rules. That approach, being the coordinated international response, is the appropriate mechanism by which to enforce New Zealand’s PE rules. The introduction of more robust transfer pricing rules as proposed in the discussion document will also counteract the need for a specific PE avoidance rule. In particular, the discussion document indicates that the existence of a “number of well paid employees” would be an indicator of the existence of a PE. This could be addressed through the transfer pricing regime, and strengthened transfer pricing rules will assist Inland Revenue in relation to enforcement. We are concerned that implementation of a unilateral response such as the new PE avoidance rule will impede the coordinated global response to BEPS. We therefore do not support its introduction at this time. Uncertainty will not lead to good tax administration There is a risk that vague and uncertain wording within the legislation could lead to disputes about the nature of activities being performed by taxpayers in New Zealand. In particular, a number of phrases and concepts central to the operation of the rule ought to be defined, including “commercially dependent”, “in connection with”, “low tax jurisdiction”, “high paid employee” and “specialised services”. As an example of uncertainty, consider the proposal that an “arrangement involving third party channel providers” should necessarily result in a PE. Any such investigation would be a fact-specific enquiry and would depend on the activities provided by related party and third party channel providers. It will not always be clear whether the related party is performing “sales promotion and services”, and there will inevitably be cases where the activities in New Zealand are in reality something less than this, or where the non-resident and the third party are in fact not working together to sell the goods or services to the end customer. The legislation, or guidance supporting the legislation, should be clear as to what kinds of specific arrangements give rise to a deemed PE. If PE anti-avoidance rules are uncertain or difficult to apply, then the corresponding compliance costs could potentially outweigh the gains to the Government from more tax being paid here. Uncertainty in the rules could dissuade investment into New Zealand. Further, we highlight Inland Revenue’s expectations regarding initiatives to tackle complex technical issues (such as PE anti-avoidance). The Commissioner of Inland Revenue is required to collect over time the highest net revenue practicable within the law having regard to the compliance costs incurred by taxpayers. Inland Revenue’s unaudited target return on income for additional funding voted by the Government in 2015/16 was $13.00 per dollar spent, on the basis of the economic inefficiencies involved in chasing down the last dollar of revenue. There is risk that attempted enforcement of the PE anti-avoidance rule will fall short of Inland Revenue’s targets. An ambiguous rule, combined with the proposed 100% penalty, could dissuade investment in a legitimate PE structure, within New Zealand’s double tax agreements, on the mere potential that New Zealand would take unilateral action. This would not benefit tax enforcement, the New Zealand economy or our members. We submit that taxpayers should be able to obtain confirmation from Inland Revenue that the PE avoidance rule would not apply in respect of a particular business structure. The process should operate similarly to an Advance Pricing Agreement (“APA”) for transfer pricing purposes, and would add clarity for business with unique circumstances that risk breaching the proposed rule. Changes to group structure will take time Reorganising a global supply chain can be a complex business taking a substantial amount of time. New Zealand will often be a small component of a much larger supply chain. The effect of reorganising a global supply chain in a short period of time would be exacerbated for our multinational members operating in a larger number of countries. We are also concerned that the proposed PE anti-avoidance rule could apply to members whose existing investment structures have previously been reviewed by Inland Revenue by way of a ruling, tax audit sign-off or an APA. Further, the proposed 100% penalty applicable would present a punitive outcome for such taxpayers with a history of complying with New Zealand tax law if it is not possible for a multinational to reorganise its supply chain before the PE avoidance rule is implemented. Additional guidance required on profit attribution We anticipate that multinationals will engage more frequently in disputes with revenue authorities regarding the attribution of profits across jurisdictions. It is important that the New Zealand Government consider the risk of double taxation where its preferred method of profit attribution differs from that applied in the jurisdiction of the foreign entity. In light of these substantial proposed changes to the rules around PEs, it would be timely for Inland Revenue to provide additional guidance around the attribution of profit to a New Zealand PE. 5. Interest limitation rules No case for interest rate cap Limiting interest deductions based on credit rating within wider group is uncommercial, a departure from the arm’s length principle and is likely to lead to cross-border disputes and double tax. Our members find that there are many circumstances in which a foreign investor might want to invest in New Zealand through debt funding which should appropriately be priced at an interest rate higher than its group cost of funds. The New Zealand entity might be a high credit risk, for example a start- up or different industry. New Zealand is also a small, isolated, market and presents more risk to a (say) United States investor for which the next best alternative would be to expand its existing operations in the United States. In such circumstances, a third party bank would conceivably lend to the New Zealand subsidiary at an interest rate much higher than the parent company’s cost of funds. It will therefore often be more cost-effective for the parent company to provide funding directly to New Zealand. We anticipate that for our members providing finance into New Zealand, double taxation is a likely outcome. The lender will be required by its home tax authority to charge interest at arm’s length rates, whereas New Zealand would apply its interest rate cap. In such a case, more disputes between tax authorities would result, most likely leading to additional mutual agreement procedures. Additional compliance costs would be inevitable, and it is not clear that the New Zealand Government would prevail. An alternative approach would be for the US parent to provide a guarantee to the New Zealand subsidiary to reduce the cost of borrowing. In such circumstances, OECD guidance suggests that a guarantee fee should be paid to the parent company. The fact that OECD endorses the payment (and therefore deduction) of a guarantee fee reflects the fact that an interest rate anchored to the parent’s cost of funds is not arm’s length. Agreement in principle to change in treatment of non-debt liabilities We agree in principle with changes to require total assets to be calculated net of non-debt liabilities for consistency with the test employed in other jurisdictions, but we note that this would result in a material increase in gearing levels for some members, particularly those with large provisions, trade creditors or deferred tax liabilities. The ability to use net current assets should be retained. The Government is correct to highlight that current thin capitalisation rules work well given their aim of ensuring that excessive interest deductions are not used to shelter New Zealand sourced profits. Most multinationals operating in New Zealand have relatively modest debt levels. EY’s recent research (cited above) supports that conclusion. Members have seen no evidence to suggest that the majority of multinationals are sheltering New Zealand sourced profits using excessive levels of related-party debt. Members do however note that the changes to the treatment of non-debt liabilities will significantly increase calculated gearing levels, particularly for members with large provisions, trade creditors or deferred tax liabilities. That makes it more important for calculations to give fair value to assets and for the definition of non-debt liabilities to be well designed. The ability to use net current asset values should be retained. It allows recognition of the market value of assets where this is not done for financial reporting purposes. Such market values are relevant to a lender of debt so it is appropriate the ability to use such values be retained. The non-debt liabilities definition is based on the Australian definition, and – as in Australia - deferred tax should be excluded. For some of our members, deferred tax liabilities for some entities can be substantial due to financial reporting rules, particularly under IFRS. Using a balance sheet approach, it is frequently necessary to account for liabilities on both permanent and timing differences which have no impact on cash flows. Users of financial information, including banks, frequently look through the large deferred tax liabilities reported by companies. Examples of problem areas include initial recognitions of a deferred tax liability on assets with no tax base, such as buildings, client lists and other intangibles acquired. Revaluations can also give rise to misleading results. Compliance costs will increase The ability for taxpayers to carry out a thin capitalisation calculation once each year should be retained. We note that the changes to the thin capitalisation test will increase the burden of compliance for multinational taxpayers. An example is the proposal that only quarterly or daily calculations should be acceptable for the purposes of the measurement date of the thin capitalisation test. Absent any evidence that multinationals are abusing the annual method, we see no reason to change the rules. To do so would add a compliance burden to the majority in order to address a problem which has not been seen by our members and must be very rare in practice. Existing financing arrangements should be grandparented We are concerned that companies will not have sufficient time to adjust their affairs prior to the start of the first income year following enactment. We note that firms controlled by non-residents acting together will be subject to the rules only on a prospective basis, on the basis that recent changes to the thin capitalisation rules would remain unchanged for some time. This logic applies equally to all multinationals. Lenders have chosen to invest based on current law and instruments will have been costed on that basis. In some cases it may be prohibitively expensive to seek to unwind financing arrangements before applications of the new rule as investors have a legitimate expectation of a particular return. It would not be reasonable to expect borrowers to refinance based on a proposal in a discussion document which may be subject to significant amendment prior to enactment. There should be a considerable grandparenting provision or a period during which restructuring of loans can be undertaken. Grandparenting, or delayed application for a period of at least five years from enactment, would be a reasonable compromise as it would allow the vast majority of existing loans to mature. 6. Transfer pricing Support for alignment with OECD Guidelines and appropriate Australian rules We agree that New Zealand’s transfer pricing regime should be aligned to international best practice. Consistency with the regimes applied in other jurisdictions will also help avoid the incidence of double taxation. In our members’ experience, since reform in 2012, the Australian transfer pricing rules have led to additional disputes between multinationals, the Australian Tax Office and overseas tax administrations. We expect that the proposals to reform the transfer pricing regime in New Zealand will result in a similar increase in the number of disputes, and we note the compliance costs associated with this. Limited risk distributors commonly reflect commercial substance The LRD model is one commonly used throughout the world. It is especially prominent in the pharmaceutical and technology industries, where a large amount of research and development happens earlier in the supply chain in foreign jurisdictions. The distribution activity undertaken in New Zealand happens at the end of the supply chain and is often relatively low in terms of the value- adding functions contributing to the system profits of the enterprise. The implication of the discussion document seems to be that, in most cases, LRDs structures lack commercial reality and most risks are controlled by the New Zealand entity. More often, for these businesses the global marketing strategy is conducted offshore and tight control maintained over marketing spend, inventory levels and major business decisions of the LRD. The New Zealand subsidiary will have substantially smaller resources at its disposal and will often undertake market activation activity rather than development. This point has previously been accepted by Inland Revenue. In one recent example, John Nash, Manager (International Revenue Strategy) was commented: "In terms of the way we tax, is you tax the value-add. I wish it wasn't like this. But you can only tax what gets added in New Zealand and we're right at the end of the value chain. Unfortunately, that's the state of the industry in New Zealand; it's not necessarily a reflection of profit-shifting.” Applying the arm’s length standard We note that, in assessing the transfer prices employed by taxpayers and determining whether adjustment is appropriate, the Commissioner has the advantage of hindsight which our members will not have when entering into the transaction. Shifting the burden of proof onto our members in relation to transfer pricing matters could be problematic, if we are later required to show that the arrangement was arm’s length based on an outcome we could not have predicted. The Commissioner should take care not to impose unrealistic requirements on members in relation to genuine, but underperforming, business ventures. Opposition to time bar extension Tax positions assessed in the year ended 31 March 2013 are now time barred, but under the proposals could be reopened for a further three years. Members consider that this is inappropriate; any changes should be prospective in their application only. Some members have invested considerable time and money in negotiating APAs with Inland Revenue. It is possible that legislative changes could override the effect of these APAs, effectively penalising taxpayers whose intention it was to be proactive in managing transfer pricing risk in a constructive way with Inland Revenue. The agreements should be honoured given their lower risk to the New Zealand revenue base and the inequity that would be created should taxpayers need to renegotiate such agreements. We consider that any need for the extension of the time bar is limited should the proposal to shift the burden of proof to the taxpayer be adopted. This is because, should the taxpayer have the burden of proof, the Commissioner’s concerns in relation to accessing relevant information are mitigated by an ability to more readily adjust transfer pricing outcomes where the taxpayer is non-compliant. In addition, the Government will already have access to improved information flows through country- by-country reporting and automatic exchanges of information between Revenue Authorities. Further, although the proposed extension of the time bar is limited to transfer pricing matters, there are complications associated with an adjustment for the interactions between transfer pricing and other matters, including income tax and withholding tax. If an extension of the transfer pricing time bar is pursued, it should be clear what delimits a “transfer pricing matter” from another, to avoid the Commissioner pursuing something as a transfer pricing matter to “get around” a more restrictive time bar for another regime. Evidence and documentation requirements Given that the revised transfer pricing rules would place a burden of proof on our members to show that their transfer pricing is arm’s length, it is important that it is clear to members what is required. In other jurisdictions around the world, the legislation is notably more prescriptive and sets out clearly what is required in documentation. In New Zealand, Inland Revenue does not habitually set out its requirements in a formal way which creates difficulty for multinationals attempting to assess their documentation requirements (in many cases, by centralised tax functions overseas). Inland Revenue should set out unambiguously what is required of taxpayers. Mere endorsement of the OECD Guidelines does not assist taxpayers with little understanding of the particular risks to the New Zealand revenue base to which Inland Revenue’s concerns more specifically relate. 7. Administrative measures Penalties for not providing information Penalties for failure to provide transfer pricing information should not be imposed on New Zealand business officers and/or directors. It is proposed that changes be made to allow a person to be convicted of an offence if they fail to provide information held by an associated offshore group member. The New Zealand subsidiary of a multinational tends to be small in the context of the group’s global operations. Our members note that officers and/or directors of New Zealand subsidiaries will often have little or no ability to compel offshore parents to provide information. We submit that it is not appropriate to impose penalties on New Zealand officers and/or directors for this reason. Non-cooperation Obtaining information can be difficult for a small subsidiary of a multinational. We note that some of the factors proposed in the discussion document that lead to a finding that a taxpayer is “non-cooperative” are wide in scope (e.g. failure to respond to Inland Revenue correspondence). We submit that there should be some acknowledgement that on occasion delays in obtaining information are not driven by an unwillingness to provide information, but rather by the difficulties in obtaining information from within large organisations generally. Collection of information Additional information gathering powers are unlikely to be effective and should not proceed. We submit that Inland Revenue is likely to have sufficient ability to collect information from large multinationals under existing rules by virtue of country-by-country reporting and automatic exchange of information. As noted previously, the introduction of specific provisions that enable Inland Revenue to directly request information or documents offshore may be unlikely to result in Inland Revenue receiving information in a timelier manner, on the basis that delays in obtaining information tend to be attributable to the internal workings of large organisations rather than deliberate non-cooperation. This is particularly so in light of the size of New Zealand relative to other jurisdictions that multinationals operate in, rather than a result of unwillingness by large multinationals to provide information. Country-by-country reporting and automatic exchange of information arguably provides Inland Revenue with a better method of collecting information than the specific provisions proposed in the discussion documents. Early payment of disputed tax Payment of tax in dispute at an earlier stage of the disputes process is not appropriate. Large multinationals are unlikely to default on the tax due, with use of money interest being an inadequate form of recompense for taxpayers. Taxpayers generally do not enter into a dispute with Inland Revenue to delay the payment of tax. Rather, there is a genuine dispute over the tax position taken and amount of tax payable. In this respect, large multinationals in dispute with Inland Revenue should not be treated differently from any other New Zealand taxpayer. The use of money interest and late payment penalties regime should be a strong enough disincentive not to prolong a dispute. The power of use of money interest is further evidenced by taxpayers using tax pooling services to mitigate its effects. 8. Conclusion AmCham believes that New Zealand’s tax laws are currently among the best in the world. New Zealand has a strong tax treaty network, a proven and effective thin capitalisation regime and a well- established transfer pricing regime. AmCham supports a coordinated global response to BEPS, and endorses the work of the G20 and OECD. To the extent that the New Zealand Government proposes implementing the OECD’s recommendations, our members broadly support the Government’s intentions. However, where the proposals extend beyond implementing OECD recommendations, we do not see the Government has sufficient justification to take unilateral action. A coordinated global approach will lead to better outcomes for tax authorities and for taxpayers. We understand these submissions may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982 and consent to their release.

A number of the members of the DEG have business activities in New Zealand. We are writing to provide the comments of the DEG on the proposal to deem a New Zealand PE of a nonresident enterprise if a related entity carries out sales-related activities for the nonresident in New Zealand (the “PE Anti-Avoidance Rule”), as set forth in the discussion document entitled, “BEPS - Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance” (the “Discussion Document”). Although our comments principally address the PE Anti-Avoidance Rule, we also provide some brief comments on the Discussion Document’s transfer pricing and administrative proposals. We thank the New Zealand Inland Revenue (the “Inland Revenue”) for the opportunity to provide comments on the Discussion Document. We applaud the Inland Revenue for following a transparent approach of soliciting and considering comments on the PE Anti- Avoidance Rule. This approach is particularly welcome in cases such as this, where the proposed changes to domestic legislation deviate from international norms. We also applaud the Inland Revenue for including in the Discussion Document detailed examples that allow interested parties such as the DEG to identify and address the exact causes of the Inland Revenue’s concern with certain business structures. Historically, New Zealand has been a firm advocate that the fundamental concepts of international tax law, such as nexus, source, character, and the application of the arm’s length principle, should be developed and agreed on a consensus basis, and implemented consistently among trading partners. Even before the BEPS consensus is implemented, we are seeing a small number of jurisdictions choose the path of unilateral actions, creating a significant risk of serious fragmentation of the consensus-based international #013 2 tax framework, if other jurisdictions follow that path. Despite these recent examples, we respectfully suggest that New Zealand should maintain its historic position as an advocate for consensus-based rules and uniform implementation. Accordingly, for the reasons we discuss in this submission, we respectfully recommend that the Inland Revenue either withdraw the PE Anti-Avoidance Rule or, in the alternative, defer consideration of the PE Anti-Avoidance Rule until the New Zealand authorities have had an opportunity to evaluate the impact of the BEPS Project recommendations on the common commercial structures that fall within the PE Anti- Avoidance Rule’s scope. We respectfully request a meeting with representatives of the Inland Revenue and the New Zealand Treasury (and/or relevant Ministerial officials) to discuss further the points we raise in this submission. Executive Summary 1.As requested in the Discussion Document, we provide a brief summary of our major points and recommendations in the order in which they appear in this submission. i.As proposed, the PE Anti-Avoidance Rule captures common commercial arrangements involving affiliated New Zealand entities that are not abusive. Transfer pricing adjustments, and not deemed PEs, are the appropriate response to any perceived undercompensation of the New Zealand sales support entity. ii.The PE Anti-Avoidance Rule creates almost a per se PE rule for many multinational groups that sell into New Zealand using a nonresident principal. Imposing direct tax on a nonresident on the grounds that a local affiliate performs any sales related activities would be a radical departure from the established norms for imposing direct tax on a nonresident and thus would constitute a “fundamental change\[\] to the current international tax framework.” iii.We are not aware of any other jurisdiction, including Australia or the UK, that has adopted a rule similar in scope to the PE Anti- Avoidance Rule. The PE Anti-Avoidance Rule therefore represents the most extreme unilateral PE measure in the world. iv.The PE Anti-Avoidance Rule is inconsistent with the consensus approach of the OECD/G20 BEPS Project, which already has developed a consensus based recommendation for changes to the treaty law PE standard to address the in-market support structures on which the PE Anti-Avoidance Rule focuses. As the BEPS Project recommendations already are addressing the concerns the Discussion Document identifies, we believe that the more 3 appropriate course of action is to defer the consideration of the PE Anti-Avoidance Rule until the New Zealand authorities have had an opportunity to evaluate the impact of the BEPS Project recommendations on the structures that are within the PE Anti- Avoidance Rule’s scope. v.We endorse the proposal to adopt the revised OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines (“TPG”) and conform the New Zealand transfer pricing rules to the rules in the TPG. We respectfully recommend that New Zealand not adopt New Zealand-specific transfer pricing rules that deviate from the consensus interpretation of the TPG. vi.If New Zealand shifts the burden of proof in transfer pricing cases from the Inland Revenue to the taxpayer, we respectfully recommend that the taxpayer only be required to prove that a result is within the range of reasonable results. We also respectfully recommend that the existing four-year statute of limitations for transfer pricing assessments be retained. vii.We respectfully recommend that multinationals only be considered “noncooperative” from a tax administration standpoint where there is a willful, reckless, or negligent disregard of the requirement to timely produce truthful information in response to an Inland Revenue information request. We also respectfully recommend that New Zealand preserve the existing payment rule for amounts in controversy, and require taxpayers to pay the disputed tax only once the dispute is resolved. In addition, given the new country-by-country reporting and automatic exchange of information requirements, we believe that there is no need to expand the Inland Revenue’s information-gathering powers in the manner described in the Discussion Document. Centralized Sales Structures 2.We applaud the inclusion of examples in the Appendix to explain the Inland Revenue’s concerns with centralized sales structures. As proposed, however, the PE Anti-Avoidance Rule will include in its scope common commercial structures that are not abusive. 3.In Example 1, a multinational group sells remotely into New Zealand without establishing any actual business presence in New Zealand. The PE Anti- Avoidance Rule does not apply in this case. In Example 4, the PE Anti- Avoidance Rule also does not apply where a multinational group sells into New Zealand using an affiliated New Zealand reseller. In an important comment, the Discussion Document notes that the proposed changes to New Zealand’s transfer 4 pricing rules will allow New Zealand to “appropriately tax” this structure. 4.In contrast, Example 3 states that the PE Anti-Avoidance Rule applies to a multinational group that sells remotely to New Zealand customers because a New Zealand affiliate performs sales support activities. The inference from these examples is that combining the centralized sales model with some degree of local presence is abusive. 5.We respectfully submit that the basic fact patterns in both Examples 3 and 4 reflect extremely common business models that companies in a wide range of business sectors employ for sound commercial reasons. Some of the business reasons for choosing the centralized sales model include: (i) efficient cash management due to a single legal entity receiving all customer payments; (ii) simplified intercompany invoicing; (iii) simplified foreign exchange hedging at the principal company level for all receivables; (iv) consistent enforcement of group legal and financial business policies through centralized customer contract approvals; (v) application of single contract terms and choice of law in customer and supplier contracts; (vi) single legal entity identified as responsible party to pursue or defend IP enforcement claims; (vii) centralized compliance responsibility for regulatory requirements at a single entity; (viii) cost efficiencies arising from hiring personnel who can perform regional roles in a central location; and (ix) avoided costs of implementing financial accounting system support for multiple revenue points and intercompany sales transactions. 6.From a policy standpoint, it is difficult to justify treating the fact pattern in Example 3 as inherently more prone to abuse than the fact pattern in Example 1. If remote sales into New Zealand with no local presence are not abusive, adding local activities that are appropriately compensated for their role in creating value under the revised OECD TPG, as incorporated into New Zealand law, should not change that conclusion. 7.We suspect that the real concern about this structure is expressed in Example 3 itself as an assumed fact: that “the New Zealand subsidiary is a paid a fee for its services . . . \[that\] generally only exceeds its costs by a small margin.” If that indeed is the actual concern, then the proper response is a transfer pricing adjustment, not a deemed PE of the nonresident. We see no reason why the revised TPG, with the recent enhancements expressly written to assure that transfer pricing outcomes are in line with value creation in exactly these cases, would not provide the Inland Revenue with the appropriate tools to “appropriately tax” this structure, just as the revised TPG provide such tools to “appropriately tax” the structure in Example 4. 8.The discussion in Example 3 notes the concern that a proper transfer pricing review of the value created by the local subsidiary would not be possible “as a practical matter (largely due to a lack of visibility over the value added through 5 the entire supply chain).” 1 We believe that these concerns based on lack of transparency will be directly addressed through country-by-country reporting and the enhanced transfer pricing reporting requirements imposed by Action 13. 9. We note that the Discussion Document in Example 4 expressly states that one of the problematic features of structures involving a New Zealand reseller is that principal companies in regional hub structures “typically carr\[y\] on limited actual activities in relation to” New Zealand sales. 2 As a broad generalization, this assumption is incorrect. In most cases, a company centralizes important functions in regional hubs to maximize both the commercial efficiencies of the centralized sales model described above and the company’s ability to achieve market penetration across the region. Of relevance to the proposed PE Anti- Avoidance Rule, however, Example 4 shows that even under the assumption that the principal company carries on “limited actual activities” related to New Zealand sales, a proper application of the TPG will address any cases of undercompensation of the New Zealand in-market distributor. There is no more (or less) reason to assume that the business activities of a centralized sales entity which acts as principal for an in-market support structure conducts “limited actual activities” related to New Zealand sales. Accordingly, it is difficult to see how the tax policy responses to the cases of Examples 3 and 4 can be different. 10. We also believe that the TPG give the Inland Revenue the necessary tools to address third party channel provider arrangements, as set forth in paragraphs 3.27 - 3.28 of the Discussion Document. If transfer pricing adjustments are the appropriate response to perceived abuses in connection with sales into New Zealand through an affiliated New Zealand reseller, as Example 4 clearly states, transfer pricing adjustments, and not deemed PEs, also are the appropriate response to undercompensated New Zealand support affiliates in channel provider arrangements. New PE Standard Under the PE Anti-Avoidance Rule 11. The Discussion Document states that the proposed rule “is not trying to widen the accepted international definition of a PE in substance.” 3 With respect, the proposal does exactly that, as it creates almost a per se rule that applies to business structures that cannot be regarded as abusive, and proposes a PE threshold based on less economically significant activities than anything in current tax treaties or in the BEPS-recommended changes to Article 5. 12. Specifically, the rule applies if an arrangement satisfies the four criteria set forth in paragraph 3.21 of the Discussion Document. Of these four criteria, in practice 1 Discussion Document, Example 3, p. 49. 2 Discussion Document, Example 4, p. 50. 3 Discussion Document ¶ 3.2. 6 only two will be operative terms, as the first and the third criteria are neutral facts - i.e., whether a nonresident supplies goods or services to a person in New Zealand and whether some or all of the sales income is not attributed to a New Zealand PE of the nonresident - which facts by themselves cannot indicate whether a structure is abusive, since they will exist in every case where goods or services are supplied into New Zealand without the involvement of an affiliate acting as a reseller of the goods or services. Therefore, the second and fourth criteria are the relevant subjects for discussion, as those two criteria represent the elements of the proposed standard which are meant to define an abusive structure. 13. Under the second criterion, the PE Anti-Avoidance rule may apply if a related entity “carries out an activity in New Zealand in connection with \[a\] particular sale for the purpose of bringing it about.” This is a far lower threshold of economic activity for creating tax nexus of a nonresident than even the “principal role” standard that BEPS Action 7 recommends. The BEPS standard requires a local affiliate to play “the principal role” leading to the conclusion of contracts that are routinely concluded without material modification by the enterprise, a much more substantive activity than “an activity ... for the purpose of bringing” about the sale. Under the proposed criterion, a New Zealand affiliate could give rise to tax nexus of a nonresident enterprise if it plays any role leading to the conclusion of a sales contract by the nonresident. Further, the requirement in the Action 7 recommendation that the contracts be concluded without material modification by the enterprise was intended to describe cases where there is no material business judgment exercised by the nonresident enterprise at the moment of contract conclusion. That point is absent from the proposed rule, so that a PE could arise even if personnel of the nonresident were heavily involved in contract negotiation and acceptance. Although the Discussion Document expressly excepts auxiliary or preparatory activities (such as advertising and marketing) from the list of tainted activities, 4 a wide range of activities that have never been considered to give rise to a deemed dependent agent PE, such as collaborative product design, routine sales promotion, solicitation, tech support, warranty repairs, etc., could conceivably fall within the scope of this criterion and trigger the application of the rule. 14. We believe that it is difficult as a policy matter to justify imposing tax nexus on a nonresident enterprise based on such limited local activities performed by an affiliate which is appropriately compensated under the arm’s length principle. The objective of the PE standard is to assess when a nonresident enterprise itself conducts sufficient business activity through its actual presence in a state to warrant direct taxation of the nonresident. In considering whether a nonresident should be subject to local tax by virtue of attribution theories based on a dependent agent or similar activity, that policy choice should take into account 4 Discussion Document ¶ 3.22. 7 the fact that the local affiliate is fully taxable in that state. 15. Thus, a nonresident without premises at its disposal in a state should be subject to direct tax in that state only if the nonresident itself could be said to be in fact conducting its business in that state - i.e., concluding contracts - on a regular basis through a local person operating in that state. The “principal role” standard lowers the threshold for tax nexus but still is faithful to the premise that the dependent person must be performing those activities in the state which lead immediately to contract conclusion, without material involvement at that moment by the nonresident, before the nonresident may be subject to direct taxation in that state by virtue of the attributed activities. 16. Imposing direct tax on a nonresident on the grounds that a local affiliate performs any sales related activities would therefore be a radical departure from the established norms for imposing direct tax on a nonresident. It is difficult to reconcile this feature of the PE Anti-Avoidance Rule with the statement in the Discussion Draft that the proposed measures “are not intended to make any fundamental changes to the current international tax framework.” 5 17. Under the fourth criterion, the PE Anti-Avoidance Rule applies where an “arrangement defeats the purpose of \[the relevant tax treaty’s\] PE provisions.” Nothing in the hypothetical case of a nonresident enterprise selling remotely into New Zealand with the assistance of a local sales support affiliate defeats the “purpose” of the PE standard, which is to define when the actual commercial facts indicate that the nonresident seller itself has sufficient actual presence in a state to justify the state’s imposition of direct tax on the nonresident. Thus, unless a particular arrangement has some unique hallmarks of treaty abuse, nothing in what is otherwise a common commercial arrangement in itself should be considered to defeat the “purpose” of the treaty. 18. The Discussion Document states that the objective of the fourth criterion is to assess whether supplies are made “through a PE in substance.” 6 The Discussion Document then proposes five factors to use in determining whether this test is met. The first three factors (the commercial and economic reality of the arrangement, the relationship between the nonresident and the related entity in New Zealand, and the nature of the services carried out by the related entity) are exceedingly vague, and provide no particular guidance as to whether the nonresident has the requisite degree of physical or other business presence in New Zealand. 19. The fifth factor seems to be the key to the proposal, as that factor purports to list indicators of PE avoidance, which indeed is the policy focus of the proposal. It is 5 Discussion Document ¶ 1.4. 6 Discussion Document ¶ 3.24. 8 hard to see, however, that the proposed indicators (i.e., whether the arrangement involves a low tax jurisdiction, specialized services, or a related entity which is allocated a low amount of profit on the basis it is carrying out low value activities while having a number of well paid employees) actually point towards abusive structures. 7 Whether a principal company has a tax rate that is lower than the New Zealand rate has no relationship to whether activities actually conducted in New Zealand directly by or on behalf of a nonresident rise to a level that could justify imposing direct tax on the nonresident. This element of the proposal suggests that New Zealand intends to apply different PE standards to different trading partners based on whether a partner has a tax rate that is acceptably high from a New Zealand perspective. Whether the New Zealand affiliate performs “specialised” services and the amount of profit allocated to the New Zealand affiliate based on that entity’s functions, assets and risks also are not relevant to whether the nonresident itself has the requisite degree of actual business presence in New Zealand to warrant direct taxation. Rather, these issues relate to whether the pricing of the relevant intercompany arrangements complies with the arm’s length principle. 20. Only the fourth factor is relevant to whether a nonresident could be said to have the requisite physical presence in New Zealand, but this factor is the most radical feature of the proposal. The fourth factor allows the Inland Revenue to test whether a nonresident enterprise would have had a New Zealand PE but for the separate legal existence of the nonresident and a New Zealand affiliate. This factor is contrary to New Zealand’s treaties, which include an article based on Article 5(7) of the OECD Model, as explained in paragraph 40 of the Article 5 Commentary: “It is generally accepted that the existence of a subsidiary company does not, of itself, constitute that subsidiary company a permanent establishment of its parent company. This follows from the principle that, for the purpose of taxation, such a subsidiary company constitutes an independent legal entity.” (emphasis added) 21. The practical consequence of this factor would be to create a New Zealand PE of a nonresident in every case in which the activity of the New Zealand affiliate is not preparatory or auxiliary, as the premises and personnel of the affiliate would be attributed to the nonresident. This factor therefore would create an almost per se PE rule for multinational groups with New Zealand sales support affiliates. 22. We are not aware of any other jurisdiction that has adopted a rule that eliminates the distinction between separate legal entities for the purpose of asserting a PE. This rule effectively imposes PE reporting obligations on all groups which sell remotely into New Zealand using a local affiliate. This element does not exist in other anti-avoidance rules, such as the Australian Multinational Anti-Avoidance 7 We assume that the last two criteria refer to attributes of the New Zealand affiliate, but there is no indication in the text as to which entity is being referenced. 9 Law (“MAAL”) or the UK Diverted Profits Tax (“DPT”). Accordingly, as proposed, the PE Anti-Avoidance Rule represents the most extreme unilateral PE measure in the world. We believe that such a rule would not be consistent with the historic policy and practice of New Zealand. 23. We also struggle to see the potential PE abuse in channel provider arrangements. As the Discussion Document acknowledges, multinational groups use channel provider arrangements for “good commercial reasons.” 8 There is no doubt that the channel provider (a New Zealand taxpayer) is compensated at arm’s length for its services because it is unrelated to the nonresident. In addition, since the channel provider has taken over some or all of the sales responsibilities, the logical inference is that there is less reason for PE concern than in a pure related party arrangement on the grounds that the New Zealand affiliate is less likely to play “the principal role” leading to the conclusion of the contract with the New Zealand customer. The Discussion Document nevertheless justifies a finding of a PE on the grounds that the nonresident and the channel provider are “working together” to sell to the New Zealand customer, and that the New Zealand affiliate therefore assists the nonresident by assisting the channel provider. 24. The Discussion Document does not provide any detail on the level of activity that could give rise to a PE in connection with a channel provider arrangement, leading to the conclusion that a local affiliate merely “working together” with the channel provider to pursue a sale could give rise to a PE. That standard would be remarkably low and ambiguous (e.g., would merely accompanying a channel provider to a customer site trigger the application of the rule?). That standard also would discourage nonresidents from engaging unrelated New Zealand channel providers to support New Zealand customers since such arrangements now would give rise to PE uncertainty in addition to requiring the nonresident to compensate both the channel provider and address the PE exposure arising due to the affiliate’s activities. 25. We fully acknowledge that any tax administration must possess tools to properly address true cases of treaty abuse. The Discussion Document indicates that one such case is that in which a multinational group takes the position that a New Zealand affiliate performs only general support activities (e.g., marketing), but, in substance, the affiliate negotiates and concludes contracts on behalf of a nonresident. 9 As the Discussion Document appears to acknowledge, New Zealand’s existing domestic and treaty law rules provide tools, including anti- abuse rules, that allow the Inland Revenue to address these arrangements. The fact that employing these tools may require resource intensive audits is not a sufficient justification for the radical legal change that the Discussion Document 8 Discussion Document ¶ 3.29. 9 See Discussion Document ¶ 3.13. 10 proposes. Furthermore, the introduction of the information gathering, transparency and cooperation measures the Discussion Document proposes will ultimately ease the Inland Revenue’s administrative burden on audit, thereby reducing further the need for an unfocused rule of convenience like the PE Anti- Avoidance Rule. 10 Profit Attribution Under the PE Anti-Avoidance Rule 26.The Discussion Document states that the Inland Revenue expects “a fairly significant amount of . . . sales income \[to be\] attributable to the deemed PE” under the PE Anti-Avoidance Rule. 11 We believe that this assumption is not likely to be correct in reality. Specifically, it is difficult to envision what additional profits could be attributed to a deemed PE with respect to in country sales activities where those activities already have been fully rewarded under the revised OECD TPG, as implemented in New Zealand law. The Discussion Document correctly acknowledges that income attributable to the nonresident’s offshore activities will not be subject to direct tax in New Zealand. 12 Since in general all value other than value arising from the sales functions performed by the affiliate will have been created outside of New Zealand, the profit attribution result under the PE Anti-Avoidance Rule is likely to be zero in most, if not all, cases. 27.T his result is even more likely for a deemed PE created under the proposed PE Anti-Avoidance Rule than is the case for deemed PEs arising under the current Article 5(5) or the BEPS Action 7 “the principal role” test, since the activities which give rise to a deemed PE under the PE Anti-Avoidance Rule almost invariably will create less value through the in-country functions, and involve the use of fewer assets, than deemed PEs arising under the other two rules. The BEPS Project Addresses These Issues Through an I nternational Consensus 28.The OECD/G20 BEPS Project constitutes “the most fundamental changes to international tax rules in almost a century.” 13 From the beginning, the expressed goal of the BEPS Project has been to create a consensus set of revised international tax rules, and implement them consistently around the world. 14 The 10 See Discussion Document, Ch. 6. 11 Discussion Document ¶ 3.36. 12 Discussion Document ¶ 3.8. 13 Statement of OECD Secretary-General, Angel Gurría, May 10, 2015, available at http://www.oecd.org/tax/oecd-presents-outputs-of-oecd-g20-beps-project-for-discussion-at-g20-finance- ministers-meeting.htm. 14 See Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting at 13 (2013) (“This Action Plan calls for . . . the adoption of new consensus-based approaches, including anti-abuse provisions, designed to prevent and counter base erosion and profit shifting.”); Pascal Saint-Amans - The Face of BEPS, Tax Analysts, Dec. 22, 11 proposed PE Anti-Avoidance Rule clearly is a statement by New Zealand that it is prepared to follow the route of unilateral actions and depart from the consensus positions. With respect, we believe that decision would be shortsighted. 29. We note that many of the “in-market support structure” cases identified as “problematic” would be addressed directly by the new “the principal role” standard (and even by the current Article 5(5) standard in cases of actual abuse). The OECD/G20 consensus recommendation to change the OECD Model PE standard already has had an impact on company structures, even though the treaty ratification process has not yet been completed. Many multinational groups, including significant participants in the digital economy, have begun the process of reorganizing their commercial structures. These have included reorganizations of in-country sales and purchasing functions into resellers in multiple sales jurisdictions. Despite the commercial efficiencies of centralized sales structures noted above, groups are taking their lead from this new international tax consensus to reorganize their commercial structures in the direction encouraged by the BEPS Project. 30. Through the OECD/G20 transparency initiatives, including country-by-country reporting, these structural changes will become apparent in the coming years. These changes may not yet be visible to tax administrations which develop information through audit procedures, as those procedures necessarily focus on past years. 31. Accordingly, we believe that the ongoing implementation of the BEPS Project will address exactly the concerns identified in Examples 3 and 4 of the Discussion Document. We respectfully suggest that the more appropriate course of action at this point is to defer the consideration of the PE Anti-Avoidance Rule until the New Zealand authorities have had an opportunity to evaluate the impact of the BEPS Project recommendations on the structures that are within the PE Anti-Avoidance Rule’s scope. 32. We note that the Discussion Document mentions that some of New Zealand’s treaty partners may not adopt the BEPS Action 7 recommendations, which the Discussion Draft asserts justifies a unilateral approach for New Zealand. 15 These passages transparently communicate that New Zealand is prepared to substitute a unilateral New Zealand standard for the OECD/G20 consensus, including in trading relationships where New Zealand’s treaty partner chooses not to adopt the Action 7 recommendation. Essentially, New Zealand is challenging the OECD/G20 view that countries may choose whether or not to adopt the 2014, (“A major reason for the project’s two-year timeline, Saint-Amans said, is that the OECD had to move quickly to keep consensus among all countries and to prevent them from acting unilaterally to tackle sources of BEPS.”). 15 Discussion Document ¶ 2.9. 12 “principal role” rule in their treaties. In contrast with the four minimum standards to which all participants in the BEPS Project committed, participants are free to choose whether to incorporate the BEPS Action 7 recommendations in their treaties. New Zealand essentially is saying that New Zealand treaty partners do not have that choice. 16 33. We observe that this approach is unusual for New Zealand, which has been a conscientious participant in the BEPS Project. This approach also is inconsistent with New Zealand’s historic active role in helping to develop an OECD consensus to be applied on a consistent basis. In addition, the rule is ultimately inconsistent with the core treaty policy of establishing a framework for taxing nonresidents to which treaty partners bilaterally agree. 34. We note that some countries may be choosing to not adopt the Action 7 recommendations broadly through the Multilateral Instrument in order that they may choose selectively which treaty partners to approach with a view towards negotiating appropriate treaty changes on a bilateral basis. The Inland Revenue might consider this approach as a more targeted response to the perceived issues. 35. We respectfully suggest that unilateral actions intended to bypass the OECD/G20 consensus recommendations will not be healthy in the long run for New Zealand. If New Zealand adopts this rule, other jurisdictions may well reference the PE Anti-Avoidance Rule as a justification for adopting their own radical, nonconsensus positions. These positions ultimately will impact New Zealand enterprises engaging in cross-border trade, creating greater possibilities of double taxation and enhanced disputes on cross-border transactions. Interaction with Treaty Network 36. We note the statement that the PE Anti-Avoidance Rule would apply “notwithstanding anything in a DTA.” 17 We assume that this statement signals that the rule would be legislated in the same way as the current General Anti- Avoidance Rule (“GAAR”), ostensibly allowing enforcement of the rule outside the scope of New Zealand’s tax treaties. We also note that the Discussion Document points to the UK DPT and the Australian DPT as prior examples of this approach. 18 We note, however, that a principal element of the justification that those taxes can be imposed outside the scope of tax treaties already in force 16 We note that paragraph 2.9 of the Discussion Document suggests that additional measures to counter PE and transfer pricing avoidance are necessary as several trading partners will not adopt the BEPS treaty measures. We note that the revisions to the TPG are effective regardless of any adoption of the Action 7 proposals, so decisions by a country whether to adopt the Action 7 proposals will have no effect on the ability of New Zealand to apply the revised TPG, as incorporated into New Zealand law. 17 Discussion Document ¶ 3.45. 18 Discussion Document ¶¶ 2.15; 3.34. 13 is the assertion that the DPTs are not taxes on income or capital that are covered by Article 2. 19 While that view is subject to considerable doubt, since both DPTs in fact impose tax by reference to the profits of the enterprise, it is important to note that this justification cannot apply to support a treaty override under the New Zealand proposal. The PE Anti-Avoidance Rule sets a different definition of which nonresident enterprises are subject to the New Zealand corporate tax, but the tax that is imposed is indeed the same tax of general applicability imposed on all corporations. Thus, we believe that the PE Anti-Avoidance Rule conflicts with New Zealand’s treaties, and any override based on GAAR-type principles could apply only in the case of actual abuse of the treaty. 37. In essence, the proposal constitutes a unilateral, selective rewriting of the PE Article for certain of New Zealand’s treaty partners. We respectfully suggest that changes of that sort are best left to bilateral negotiations. Substantive Transfer Pricing Rules 38. The Discussion Document characterizes transfer pricing as a “strategy” that multinational groups can use to shift profits out of New Zealand. 20 Transfer pricing is not a “strategy.” Transfer pricing simply is the implementation of the legal requirement that associated enterprises conduct their affairs at arm’s length. Since the arm’s length principle applies to all cross-border transactions, transfer pricing rules must focus on providing clear guidance to taxpayers and tax administrations alike. 39. With that objective in mind, we endorse the proposal to adopt the revised OECD TPG and conform the New Zealand transfer pricing rules to the rules in the TPG. The TPG have proven to be a useful expression of international consensus. To preserve the benefit of this consensus, we respectfully recommend that New Zealand not adopt New Zealand-specific transfer pricing rules that deviate from the consensus interpretation of the TPG. One clear example of such a deviation is the Australian non-recognition / reconstruction rules. These rules are unique to Australia, are inconsistent with the rules in the TPG, and would make New Zealand an outlier from a transfer pricing standpoint if they were to be incorporated into New Zealand law. 21 40. Every cross-border transaction involves another jurisdiction. Thus, every New Zealand specific transfer pricing rule or interpretation is likely to result in an increase in transfer pricing controversies. Such controversies will result in a 19 Discussion Document ¶ 2.11 (“The DPTs that have been proposed in Australia and enacted in the UK tax the diverted profits of large multinationals. Their DPTs are an anti-avoidance measure and are entirely separate taxes levied at a penal rate compared with income tax.”). 20 Discussion Document ¶ 5.7. 21 See Discussion Document ¶¶ 5.34 - 5.40. 14 burden on cross-border trade, to the detriment of New Zealand residents. Procedural Transfer Pricing Rules 41. The Discussion Document proposes to shift the burden of proof in transfer pricing cases from the Inland Revenue to the taxpayer. 22 In many cases, the relevant comparability analysis will produce a range of results, all of which could be arm’s length. 23 Accordingly, we respectfully recommend that the principle be clear that the taxpayer only needs to prove that a result is within the range of reasonable results. An alternative approach, in which the taxpayer must prove that the specific result within that range is correct, is unworkable. Under that latter approach, taxpayers could never have certainty that their transfer pricing would be accepted since the Inland Revenue always could propose a different result within the arm’s length range. 42. The Discussion Document also proposes to extend the “time bar” for transfer pricing assessments from four years after the end of the year in which a company provides the relevant return to the Inland Revenue to seven years after that date. 24 The Discussion Document justifies this proposal on the grounds that the non- arm’s length nature of certain transfer pricing arrangements only becomes apparent after a longer period of time. 25 We respectfully recommend that the existing statute of limitations on transfer pricing assessments be retained. If, as the Discussion Document proposes, the burden of proving that a transaction is arm’s length shifts to the taxpayer, a longer time bar is not necessary, since the taxpayer must affirmatively demonstrate, using the information at its disposal, including financial projections, the arm’s length nature of an arrangement. In this case, the Inland Revenue has the opportunity to assess whether or not an arrangement will give rise to an arm’s length result even for periods outside the assessment period. 43. In addition, extending the time bar for transfer pricing assessments, but not for other tax items, such as income tax, withholding tax, and indirect tax, could further complicate the audit process, because transfer pricing and other tax items often are interrelated. 22 Discussion Document ¶ 5.47. 23 See OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines, Ch. III ¶ 3.55 (“In some cases, it will be possible to apply the arm’s length principle to arrive at a single figure (e.g. price or margin) that is the most reliable to establish whether the conditions of a transaction are arm’s length. However, because transfer pricing is not an exact science, there will also be many occasions when the most appropriate method or methods produces a range of figures all of which are relatively equally reliable.”). 24 See Discussion Document ¶¶ 5.67 - 5.72. 25 Discussion Document ¶ 5.68. 15 Administrative Measures 44. The Discussion Document proposes to introduce new administrative measures to apply to multinational groups that are “noncooperative” with the Inland Revenue. 26 As a threshold matter, we note that many of the actions that the Discussion Document characterizes as “noncooperative,” such as a “\[f\]ailure to comply within a statutory time-frame with Inland Revenue’s reasonable requests” and a “failure to respond to Inland Revenue correspondence,” 27 may in fact reflect events that are beyond the taxpayer’s control. Based on our members’ experience, it is often difficult and time-consuming to procure the information that the Inland Revenue requests because of the large size of a multinational enterprise and the significant scope of the enterprise’s activities. In addition, where the Inland Revenue requests a large volume of information, the enterprise may wish to obtain and provide information to a standard that is sufficient for the legal discovery process so as to avoid duplicating the effort a second time should an inquiry progress to litigation and, if necessary, seek the Inland Revenue’s agreement to this. 45. Thus, based on our members’ experience, the perceived delay in providing information requested to the Inland Revenue within the Inland Revenue’s desired timeframe is generally attributable to the amount of time it takes any large enterprise to source information from within the organization. This delay is not attributable to any unwillingness to provide the information timely on the part of the taxpayer; rather, it typically is due to the constraints on those internal resources required to respond to large information requests received from multiple jurisdictions. Accordingly, we respectfully recommend that the Inland Revenue limit those actions that constitute evidence of “noncooperation” to actions that represent a willful, reckless, or negligent disregard of the requirement to timely produce truthful information in response to an Inland Revenue information request. 46. The Discussion Document proposes to require nonresident enterprises to pay tax that is the subject of a dispute before the dispute is resolved. 28 We respectfully recommend that New Zealand preserve the existing payment rule for amounts in controversy, and require taxpayers to pay the disputed tax only once the dispute is resolved. 47. Late payment interest fully compensates the New Zealand Treasury for any tax that is paid after the year to which the tax relates. Demanding payment of tax before a dispute has been resolved has been used in other jurisdictions as leverage 26 Discussion Document ¶ 6.13. 27 Discussion Document ¶ 6.16. 28 See Discussion Document ¶¶ 6.21 - 6.26. 16 to compel nonresident taxpayers to settle disputes due to lack of confidence in that jurisdiction’s judicial and administrative review and refund procedures. We respectfully submit that New Zealand need not align itself with such a heavy handed approach to tax compliance. 48.The Discussion Document proposes to allow the Inland Revenue to request information from the group’s New Zealand affiliate regarding non-New Zealand group members. 29 The Discussion Document further proposes to change the New Zealand criminal rules to allow a person to be convicted of a criminal offense if that person fails to provide information in response to such a request. 30 In addition, the Discussion Document proposes to allow the Inland Revenue to deem income attributable to a New Zealand affiliate or PE of a multinational group if the group fails to provide information in response to such a request. 31 49.We believe that the proposed expansion of the Inland Revenue’s information- gathering powers is unnecessary. The new country-by-country reporting and automatic exchange of information requirements, once fully implemented across the world, will provide the Inland Revenue with effective tools to obtain information regarding nonresident enterprises. \* \* \* For the reasons noted above, we respectfully recommend that the Inland Revenue withdraw the PE Anti-Avoidance Rule and address perceived abuses under New Zealand’s existing domestic and treaty law rules. In the alternative, we respectfully recommend that the Inland Revenue defer consideration of the PE Anti-Avoidance Rule until the New Zealand authorities have had an opportunity to evaluate the impact of the OECD/G20 BEPS Project recommendations on the common commercial structures that fall within the PE Anti-Avoidance Rule’s scope. We also respectfully recommend that the Inland Revenue revise the Discussion Document’s transfer pricing and administrative proposals in the manner described above. We thank the Inland Revenue for the opportunity to provide our comments on the Discussion Document. We would welcome the opportunity to meet with the Inland Revenue to discuss our recommendations and are prepared to provide additional input as needed.

Further detail is included in the attached appendices: Appendix One: General comments Appendix Two: Permanent establishment avoidance Appendix Three: Amendments to the source rules Appendix Four: Transfer pricing rules Appendix Five: Administrative measures Summary of our submission The key points in our submission are: General comments The Group is very concerned that the compressed timeframe for consultation on these issues has not allowed the private sector and other stakeholders of the tax system adequate time to fully work through the issues which may arise from these proposals. The Group does not support proposals which deviate from what the OECD has recommended. These proposals will result in double taxation and remove taxpayers’ rights under double tax agreements. 1 Workshop with Sam Rowe, Gordon Witte, Steve Mack and Matt Cowen on 13 April 2017. #014 CTG – BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance 28 April 2017 Page 2 of 32 CTGCTG  In the Group’s view, many of the proposed changes negatively impact on the attractiveness of New Zealand as an investment destination. New Zealand’s tax system plays a critical role in our competitive position with our major trading partners and competitors. At our workshop, Officials acknowledged that these proposals are in substance a Multinational Anti-avoidance Law (“MAAL”) and they have many features of a Diverted Profits Tax (DPT).  As inferred in paragraph 2.22 of the discussion document, many of the proposals in the document do not alter the outcomes under the existing law, should Inland Revenue use the full suite of tools currently available to it. The effect of these proposals is to potentially reduce compliance costs for Inland Revenue in enforcing the law against a very small number of taxpayers, but to significantly increase them for all taxpayers operating cross-border. Therefore the Group questions whether the changes are warranted, particularly given the negative impact that the perception of these changes may have on investment in New Zealand.  The Group notes that if the rules governing New Zealand’s tax system become too complex for foreign companies, they will no longer sell into New Zealand or may fundamentally change the way they sell into New Zealand, resulting in a loss of economic activity in relation to support functions.  The Group appreciates that the Inland Revenue may find auditing multinational organisations “resource intensive” (as noted in paragraph 3.13), however this does not justify imposing large compliance costs on all compliant taxpayers.  The Group considers that overall these proposals will be detrimental to tax certainty for taxpayers.  The Group does not support the proposed application dates. Any changes implemented need to be complemented by appropriate grandparenting provisions for existing arrangements. Taxpayers need to be allowed a reasonable amount of time to undertake any necessary restructuring. Permanent establishment (“PE”) avoidance  In the Group’s view, departing from such core principles risks New Zealand falling out of step with the rest of the world, and in turn risking retaliatory action in jurisdictions in which we operate. New Zealand’s best chance of ensuring that its exports are not overtaxed is to ensure that it does not act unilaterally and seek to assert taxing rights over revenue where the income earning activity (including IP) is located outside of New Zealand.  The importance of DTAs cannot be understated: they exist to facilitate international trade. Having concluded a DTA with a foreign jurisdiction, New Zealand needs to be very cautious in implementing domestic legislation that has the effect of undermining the deal struck in a DTA. Such action risks not only undermining New Zealand’s international reputation but also risks foreign jurisdictions taking retaliatory action against New Zealand companies operating “in” their jurisdiction.  In our workshop we provided an example of a Group member with two employees in Japan. These employees are Japanese natives as it is necessary to have people on the ground who speak the language and understand the customs under which its customers operate. These employees talk to customers and translate communications back into orders that the Group member acts upon. In no way do the two Japanese employees have any role in concluding contracts or fulfilling orders. In the Group’s view this type CTG – BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance 28 April 2017 Page 3 of 32 CTGCTG of example should not give rise to a PE in Japan and cause allocation of profits to be taxed in Japan. However, in our workshop it was concluded by Officials that this was an example that was “close to the line” if the New Zealand proposals were to be applied to the arrangement.  The Group submits that there are valid reasons why multinationals may conclude contracts outside of New Zealand. This is not necessarily about PE avoidance, but relates to the size and importance of New Zealand operations relative to the rest of the multinational organisation. New Zealand has a very small domestic economy, geographically remote from the rest of the world, and the activities undertaken in country reflect this. For example, in many instances it does not make sense for the multinational to have a legal team based in New Zealand. Linked to the point above, just because an individual in New Zealand is “well paid” does not mean that they are able to conclude contracts.  A natural consequence of the introduction of these rules could be for non-residents to stop hiring any staff in New Zealand. It is critical that, if these proposals proceed, Inland Revenue should provide clear commentary for taxpayers on how it considers profits should be attributed to PEs. The rules cannot act as a “force of attraction” principle and seek to bring into the New Zealand tax base all New Zealand sales revenues simply because some functions are carried on in New Zealand. Any attribution of profit to New Zealand must reflect the actual degree of activity and effort in New Zealand – value added outside of New Zealand cannot be taxed in New Zealand.  The Group submits that it should be clarified what the “purpose of the DTA’s PE provisions” is in relation to the deeming of a PE in New Zealand (as per paragraphs 3.21 and 3.27). In the Group’s view, whether an organisation has a PE or not, is an ‘in or out’ test – an organisation either has enough of a presence in New Zealand or not. The Group queries whether an organisation that is close to having a PE but does not have quite enough ‘presence’ could be considered to have defeated the purpose of the provisions.  The Group notes that there are PE rules in DTAs and then there are the PE rules in the OECD Action 5 material. In the Group’s view, the proposed rules in this discussion document are unnecessary, add complexity to the rules and disregard the purpose of DTAs.  The rules proposed in paragraphs 3.21 and 3.27 both contain a criterion that “the arrangement defeats the purpose of the PE provisions”. The Group submits that any such criteria should refer to the dominant purpose of the arrangement.  This proposal should not have the effect of overriding New Zealand’s DTAs. It is important that taxpayers continue to have access to MAP and arbitration procedures guaranteed in New Zealand’s network of treaties. Amendments to the source rules  In the Group’s view, the proposed changes to the source rules are unnecessary as the current source rules are sufficiently broad to capture any situations the Commissioner is concerned with. CTG – BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance 28 April 2017 Page 4 of 32 CTGCTG Strengthening the transfer pricing rules  Overall the Group does not believe that further strengthening of the transfer pricing rules are required. Inland Revenue already has a number of tools available to it and these tools should be applied.  The Group does not support the extension of the time bar for transfer pricing positions to seven years. In the Group’s view, this goes against Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation principles and incentivises bad behaviour by Inland Revenue to not close out matters in a timely manner. In the Group’s view, an adequately resourced Revenue should be able to complete this process within four years. The Group notes that there are significant costs involved in a transfer pricing dispute and extending the time bar to seven years will only increase these costs.  The Group does not support shifting the burden of proof from the Commissioner to the taxpayer. However, if the onus does shift then it is important that the information required to prove that a particular transaction is arm’s length must be limited to publicly available information / comparables. If the Commissioner seeks to rely on “secret information”, then that information must be disclosed; and if such information cannot be disclosed with breaching confidentiality, then it is not appropriate that the Commissioner have regard to that information.  The Group submits that there needs to be sufficient controls put in place when the Commissioner wishes to reconstruct a related party transaction. The Group notes that this power is essentially the Commissioner telling a company how to run its business and this kind of decision should only be made in exceptional circumstances. In the Group’s view it must be clearly defined what activities / transactions are ‘aggressive’ and ‘commercially irrational’ – there needs to be structure and transparency around who decides this. Any powers of reconstruction need to be limited to only the most extreme circumstances and should only be assessed at the highest levels within Inland Revenue.  The Group foresees difficulty in applying transfer pricing rules to investors acting in concert. The mere fact that there are unassociated parties coming together indicates there should already be arm’s length pricing in place; i.e. there is natural tension to ensure each party is not receiving more than their fair share.  It is important that Inland Revenue is appropriately resourced with skilled transfer pricing resource so that reviews can be completed efficiently (within four years) and the disputes process can run as intended - i.e. there are independent and impartial transfer pricing experts available to participate in taxpayer conferences and adjudication. There also needs to be sufficient resourcing to allow for an increase in the volume of APAs that will likely be sought if these proposals are enacted. Administration measures  There will need to be clear guidelines as to when a taxpayer may be deemed to be non- cooperative. In particular: (i) "non-cooperative" should have a legislated definition and that definition should confirm that a taxpayer is not considered non-cooperative merely because the taxpayer exercises its rights to dispute Inland Revenue's position or contest any steps Inland Revenue may take in an investigation; (ii) there should, in addition, be guidelines issued in the form of a Standard Practice Statement. These guidelines should record the process for determining whether a taxpayer is non- cooperative. In the Group’s view this power should rest with a select few senior officials CTG – BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance 28 April 2017 Page 5 of 32 CTGCTG within Inland Revenue. These officials should be independent from the officials auditing or otherwise engaged with the taxpayer.  The Group submits that a taxpayer should have the right to apply to the High Court to challenge any decision of Inland Revenue to deem the taxpayer non-cooperative. Given the reputational damage and other consequences that could result from being deemed "non-cooperative" it is important that taxpayers have a means of challenging such a determination.  The Group does not support the proposal to require taxpayers to pay the tax earlier in the disputes process. The general rule that disputed tax be payable only following final determination of any dispute should remain, except in cases where there is a risk of non-payment of tax found owing (in which case Inland Revenue already has power (see section 138I of the Tax Administration Act (“TAA”)) to require early payment). Further, taxpayers are not incentivised to delay resolution of disputes (as suggested by the Discussion Document) given the imposition of use of money interest at rates considerably higher than commercial rates.  The Group does not support the restriction on the use of tax pooling for disputes involving transfer pricing, the application of the source rules or tax payable under a DTA.  The Group does not support the proposal to introduce a new statutory power to collect tax from wholly owned subsidiaries of multinationals in New Zealand. This is an unnecessary legislative amendment which may cause significant issues for New Zealand taxpayers in assessing their liabilities (in relation to lending covenants, the solvency test etc.). Inland Revenue already has powers to request assistance in the collection of tax under the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, therefore this rule is unnecessary. If the proposed rule were to proceed, Inland Revenue should be required to obtain a court order to impose on the New Zealand company liability for taxes owing by a different legal entity. The proposed rule is a major departure from the usual corporate law principle of limited liability and so requires judicial oversight in its application.  The Group does not support a power for Inland Revenue to make a New Zealand entity legally responsible for providing information Inland Revenue may believe is held by another member of the multinational group. It is inappropriate for a New Zealand company to be subjected to monetary penalties and potentially criminal liability for failure to provide information over which that person has no control. If the proposed rule were to proceed, Inland Revenue should be required to obtain a court order to impose on the New Zealand entity or person liability for non-provision of such information. This would provide judicial oversight in respect of the breadth of the request and feasibility of complying with it, and as to whether the need for such an onerous power to be exercised is justified in the circumstances.  The Group submits that it is not appropriate for Inland Revenue to have the power to impose a $100,000 penalty on taxpayers who fail to comply with section 17 or 21 of the TAA. Such a power should be left to the courts. This is especially so when taxpayers could be subject to penalties when information is not provided by a member of its multinational group and may have no control over whether the member provides the information or not.  Section 21 in any event needs to be rewritten. It is arbitrary in its application (e.g. it is triggered by the non-response to an information request after 90 days without regard to whether that time-frame is reasonable in the circumstances, and is disproportionate CTG – BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance 28 April 2017 Page 6 of 32 CTGCTG in its consequences (in denying a taxpayer access to the courts to contest the correctness of Inland Revenue's assessment)).  Any changes implemented need to be complemented by appropriate grandparenting provisions for existing arrangements. Taxpayers need to be allowed a reasonable amount of time to undertake any necessary restructuring. At the very least the proposals, to the extent that they proceed, should only apply in respect of income years for which a tax position is taken after date of enactment.

Yours sincerely, John Payne For the Corporate Taxpayers Group CTG – BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance 28 April 2017 Page 7 of 32 CTGCTG APPENDIX ONE: DETAILED SUBMISSION POINTS – GENERAL COMMENTS Disclaimer: no comments on practicalities or mechanics of the proposals are intended to be read as an endorsement of the proposals unless explicitly stated. 1. General comments Timeframes 1.1 The Group is very concerned that the compressed timeframe for consultation on these issues has not allowed the private sector and other stakeholders of the tax system adequate time to fully work through the issues which may arise from these proposals. 1.2 The timing of release of all three BEPS related documents (3 March 2017) was unfortunate as many taxpayers are heavily committed to tax compliance activities during the month of March. 1.3 Given the breadth of issues being consulted on and the potential overlap of proposals between this discussion document and BEPS – Strengthening our interest limitation rules the Group believes that a further round of consultation should take place later in 2017, prior to any changes being included in a tax bill. General comments 1.4 The Group understands the need to address the wider BEPS issues in New Zealand and is generally supportive of targeted proposals to protect New Zealand’s tax base. It is pleasing to see thought being taken on this issue. However, in the Group’s view, the appropriate balance needs to be found between discouraging avoidance behaviour (including by simply using existing tax rules) and encouraging genuine commercial activity. The Group does not think that this balance has been appropriately struck and does not support these proposals proceeding. 1.5 It is also important that New Zealand does not rush into new rules before other jurisdictions, and that any measures remain proportional to the problem. As the Commissioner noted in the 2016 Multinational Compliance Focus Document: “In the last few years Inland Revenue has placed an increased level of scrutiny on the tax practices of multinationals. I’m pleased we have found nearly all businesses open and willing to engage with us positively, and proud to contribute to New Zealand.” 2 1.6 In the Group’s view, these proposals adopt an approach that targets the ‘lowest common denominator’, in that they apply to a large number of businesses, the majority of which are compliant. The Minister of Revenue, Hon. Judith Collins, noted in her speech to IFA releasing the three BEPS consultation documents: “It is important that these BEPS measures do not lead to unnecessary uncertainty for compliant taxpayers and to unintended double taxation.” 3 The Group considers that the current proposals are too broad and it would be more appropriate to target only those taxpayers who are non-compliant. 1.7 As inferred in paragraph 2.22 of the discussion document, many of the proposals in the document do not alter the outcomes under the existing law. Inland Revenue should use the full suite of tools currently available to it to resolve BEPS issues. Therefore the Group does not consider these changes warranted given the negative 2 http://www.ird.govt.nz/resources/6/2/62414b82-6ab8-4017-b04d-cc5d950cab47/compliance-focus- 2016.pdf Page 1 3 http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/news/2017-03-03-beps-consultation-documents-released#speech CTG – BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance 28 April 2017 Page 8 of 32 CTGCTG impact that the perception of these changes may have on investment in New Zealand. Consideration should be given to documenting why the structures / arrangements are unacceptable in an Inland Revenue publication, such as a revenue alert. Paragraph 2.22 states (emphasis added): Inland Revenue is currently investigating or disputing several BEPS related cases. Nothing in this document is intended to prejudice any of those disputes or investigations. In particular, none of the proposed amendments in this discussion documents should be regarded as evidence that Inland Revenue cannot address the BEPS activities it is currently investigating or disputing under the current law, or that such BEPS activities are within the policy intent of the current law. 1.8 In the Group’s view, many of the changes proposed are being driven from a service delivery standpoint and not from a “what is best policy” point of view. Fundamental changes to New Zealand’s tax system, such as those proposed in this discussion document, should have a clear policy intent behind them and must be for the benefit of New Zealand as a whole. Tax policy changes should not be overtly influenced by ease of application by Inland Revenue staff or be based on “nice to have” tax audit tools. 1.9 The Group’s overarching concern is that the proposals contained in the issues paper have the potential to significantly impact on the cost of capital for New Zealand businesses. This will actively discourage foreign direct investment, resulting in a detrimental effect on the wider economy. The imposition of complex and burdensome tax rules will actively discourage foreign direct investment into New Zealand or multinational corporations from using New Zealand as a base for their operations. This is because other jurisdictions may become comparatively more attractive than New Zealand to invest in. 1.10 If foreign companies no longer invest into New Zealand because the tax rules are too onerous in comparison to the size of the potential market, this will have a direct impact on the New Zealand economy through reduced GDP (growth) and employment levels. There is an obvious negative effect of a loss of revenue for New Zealand (including GST to be claimed) and a reduction of consumer choice. In the Group’s view, many of the proposed changes negatively impact the attractiveness of New Zealand as an investment destination. New Zealand’s tax system plays a critical role in our competitive position with our major trading partners and competitors. The Group considers that it is important that New Zealand should provide a business environment that is at least as good as that which exists in competing countries, in particular our nearest and most significant competitor, Australia. In this respect it is important to consider the changes occurring in Australia and the perceived impact (whether negative or positive) of those changes. 1.11 Tax influences a company’s decision to trade in a country, especially companies that are in a low margin business. For example, a member of the Group has noted that if the proposed US tax reforms go ahead and large duties are placed on imports, then it is likely that they will retreat from that market and look at other jurisdictions without such tax barriers. We do not want businesses discouraged from investing in New Zealand in a similar fashion. 1.12 The Group is of the view that there needs to be further analysis of the economic impact of these proposals before they can proceed, particularly in relation to the creation of a PE and attribution of profits. Tax changes that have the potential to increase the cost of capital and / or restrict the flow of foreign capital should not be made lightly and full consideration must be given to the economic impact of these CTG – BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance 28 April 2017 Page 9 of 32 CTGCTG proposals. It is the Group’s view that the proposals have the narrow focus of tax revenue enhancement and there is little evidence in the issues paper that the broader economic issues have been considered in any meaningful way. There must be a broader enquiry into the likely economic effect of these proposals before they proceed any further. Certainty, compliance costs and competitiveness 1.13 The Group believes that a good tax system should be built around three principles in particular: certainty, compliance costs and competitiveness. As noted above, it is important that international competitiveness is maintained, especially in relation to Australia, as higher costs of doing in business in New Zealand flow through to less investment, fewer jobs and lower wealth. New Zealand’s tax system plays a critical role in the attractiveness of New Zealand for both inbound and outbound investment. For New Zealand to remain competitive it is important that it is recognised that complex taxes can cause significant compliance cost for businesses. 1.14 The Group appreciates that Inland Revenue may find auditing multinational organisations “resource intensive” (as noted in paragraph 3.13). However this does not justify imposing large compliance costs on all compliant taxpayers. Compliance costs are a ‘deadweight economic cost’ that represent resources consumed for the production of very little (or nothing at all). These resources would be better employed creating jobs and raising the wealth of New Zealand. In the Group’s view, these proposals will shift significant compliance costs onto taxpayers and this is only justified where the benefits outweigh the costs. 1.15 The Group considers that overall, these proposals will be detrimental to tax certainty for taxpayers. The proposals add unnecessary complexity to the rules and increase business risk by creating uncertain or unexpected tax outcomes. For the corporate sector, tax is not just a cost of doing business but is also a very significant risk by creating uncertain or unexpected outcomes. To lower business risks caused by the tax system, tax rules need to be administered and interpreted consistently and quickly, and should be as simple as possible to increase certainty. In the Group’s view, the proposals as they currently stand increase complexity without any corresponding benefit. Diverted Profits Tax and Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law 1.16 The Group is pleased to see that a diverted profits tax (“DPT”) has not been recommended. In the Group’s view, a DPT would discourage investment in New Zealand and may arbitrarily impose tax on compliant taxpayers. The Group supports the view in last year’s Cabinet Paper that a tailored approach is more appropriate for New Zealand. 4 1.17 As noted in the Cabinet Paper, a DPT “could impact on foreign investor’s perceptions of the predictability and fairness of New Zealand’s tax system for foreign investment”. Even if a DPT has not been introduced, many of the proposed changes carry the same effect and there are elements of the proposals that are similar to a DPT (absent the punitive tax rate). Caution must be taken as the same arguments in relation to discouraging investment apply. The introduction of cumbersome and prescriptive rules reduces the attractiveness of New Zealand as an investment destination. 4 Measures to strengthen transfer pricing rules and prevent permanent establishment avoidance – a Government Discussion Document. CTG – BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance 28 April 2017 Page 10 of 32 CTGCTG 1.18 In our workshop, Officials indicated that the rules are intended to act as a multinational anti-avoidance law (“MAAL”). The Group cautions against introducing a MAAL for the same reasons it does not support a DPT. If it is intended that a MAAL is introduced, it should be consulted on as a MAAL and full consultation should be undertaken on its features, as was the case when Australia introduced its MAAL. Interaction with existing treaty framework 1.19 In the Group’s view, it is unclear how the proposals will fit into New Zealand’s existing treaty framework. It is important that care is taken to consider the views of our treaty partners and their approach to this issue. If they respond in a similar way, there will be a risk that New Zealand’s tax take is reduced (rather than being increased) due to other tax authorities taking the same action. Further, New Zealand businesses trading overseas may encounter greater taxes due to the changes, leading ultimately to less global trade which is clearly contrary to the Government’s economic growth agenda. 1.20 It is noted that France has adopted a DPT, but in doing so, acknowledged that the definition of a permanent establishment in a relevant tax treaty would prevent the application of the DPT 5 . 1.21 Officials have positioned the PE proposal as an avoidance rule however at our workshop with Officials it was suggested that the rule goes beyond even the expanded definition of a PE as included in the multilateral instrument and to be included in the OECD model treaty. Officials conceded that there may be instances where the expanded treaty definition does not apply but this domestic PE avoidance rule would deem a PE to exist. In the Group’s view this takes the proposal beyond an avoidance rule and results in the fundamental shifting of the PE boundary beyond what has been agreed globally at OECD and with our treaty partners. This type of unilateral action is not justified particularly given the numerous occasions officials and successive Ministers of Revenue had publically confirmed New Zealand’s commitment to the OECD BEPS project and the actions agreed globally. This action harms our reputation as an investment destination and a place where business can be conducted with ease. Application date 1.22 The Group does not support the proposed application date for the administrative rules being the date of enactment of the relevant legislation. In the Group’s view, it is fundamentally uncertain to have the date of enactment as the application date of a proposal. In particular, such a date is not appropriate where it introduces significant changes that may impact arrangements that have been in place for a number of years without previous challenge by the Commissioner. 1.23 As taxpayers have experienced from the recent enactment of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2016-17, Closely Held Companies, and Remedial Matters) Act 2017 on 30 March 2017, having only two days’ lead in time before the next income year begins does not give taxpayers adequate lead in time. The Group considers that taxpayers should be able to plan their future business with a degree of certainty and be afforded the opportunity to consider their options moving forward. All existing arrangements should have appropriate grandparenting. 5 https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/Tax/dttl-tax-alert-france-23-december- 2016.pdf CTG – BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance 28 April 2017 Page 11 of 32 CTGCTG 1.24 The Group submits that the Commissioner should clearly establish the status of existing advanced pricing arrangements (“APAs”) as a consequence of any changes enacted. The Group notes that binding rulings are binding on the Commissioner until there is a legislative change and queries whether the position will be the same for APAs. In the Group’s view, it is important to establish a position to reduce any uncertainty taxpayers may face in light of the changing environment. The Group considers that all existing APAs should be grandparented and allowed to run their course, particularly given they often only run three years. Without grandparenting, taxpayers are dis-incentivised to engage with Inland Revenue in the interim as the high cost of obtaining an APA proportionally increases if the length of the APA is shortened. CTG – BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance 28 April 2017 Page 12 of 32 CTGCTG APPENDIX TWO: DETAILED SUBMISSION POINTS – PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT AVOIDANCE Disclaimer: no comments on practicalities or mechanics of the proposals are intended to be read as an endorsement of the proposals unless explicitly stated. 2. Permanent establishment avoidance Summary 2.1 The Group is concerned that these proposals are inconsistent with the purpose of DTAs. At a minimum, these proposals should only apply where New Zealand does not have an applicable DTA in place. 2.2 The Group is concerned about the sentiments expressed in paragraph 3.36 of the Discussion Document in relation to attribution to deemed PEs. 2.3 Taxpayers should have certainty about when these rules will apply by having a New Zealand dollar turnover threshold or ensuring that the threshold is set with reference to a previous fiscal year. 2.4 There are genuine commercial reasons why contracts may not be concluded in New Zealand. For example, it is not efficient for a multinational to have a legal team in every jurisdiction in which it operates. Having efficient and centralised management functions should not be prejudged as PE avoidance. 2.5 Inland Revenue needs to provide clear guidance to taxpayers about how profits should be attributed to PEs. The rules cannot act as a “force of attraction” principle and seek to bring into the tax base all New Zealand sales revenue simply because some functions are carried on in New Zealand. Any attribution of profit to New Zealand must reflect the actual degree of activity and effort in New Zealand – value added outside of New Zealand cannot be taxed in New Zealand. Large multinational threshold 2.6 The Group submits that the large multinational threshold (non-residents part of a multinational group with more than €750 consolidated global turnover) should be given an equivalent New Zealand Dollar value (e.g. NZ$1.15b), as it would be inappropriate to have a large company fall in and out of the rules based on exchange rate volatility. This approach would be consistent with Australia’s adoption of an AU$1b threshold. Alternatively, the Group submits that the threshold could adopt the wording of the OECD country-by-country threshold (MNE groups with annual consolidated group revenue in the immediately preceding fiscal year of more than €750 million or a near equivalent amount in domestic currency) 6 . This would also clarify the date / point at which the threshold is to be measured and provide certainty to taxpayers as to whether they meet the threshold. Permanent establishment test 2.7 The Group submits that there are valid commercial reasons why multinationals may conclude contracts outside of New Zealand (for example to centralise management functions to improve management practices and reduce corporate risk). This is not necessarily about PE avoidance and obtaining a tax advantage, but relates to the size and importance of New Zealand relative to the rest of the multinational organisation. 6 https://www.oecd.org/ctp/beps-action-13-guidance-implementation-tp-documentation-cbc-reporting.pdf CTG – BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance 28 April 2017 Page 13 of 32 CTGCTG For example, in many instances it does not make sense for the multinational to have a legal team based in New Zealand (and every other jurisdiction it operates in). Any proposed rule must focus on arrangements that are artificial and contrived to ensure that legitimate commercial arrangements are not captured. 2.8 The discussion document notes at paragraph 3.22 that “only activities designed to bring about a particular sale should potentially result in a deemed PE” and any activities that are merely preparatory or auxiliary are not sufficient to trigger a possible PE. The Group submits that additional guidance should be given as to the degree of connection required with sales into the New Zealand market, and whether this requires direct connection with a specifically identifiable sale that is in the contemplation of the New Zealand related party at the time it carries out its activity. As an example, will marketing activity that directs consumers to a website operated by a non-resident amount to the New Zealand related entity carrying out activity in connection with any resulting sale by the non-resident? Similar clarification should be provided as to the meaning of the “for purpose of bringing it about” and the requisite connection of the activities to the ultimately successful sale by the non- resident. 2.9 The Group considers that a natural consequence of the introduction of these rules could be for non-residents to stop hiring any staff in New Zealand. This will have a detrimental effect to the New Zealand economy, the cost of which needs to be weighed against any proposed changes. 2.10 The Group submits that it is important that any avoidance rule introduced is consistent with OECD and our international obligations. The current proposals fail on that front. For example OECD standard language in relation to concluding contracts is as follows: “habitually concludes contracts, or habitually plays the principal role leading to the conclusion of contracts that are routinely concluded without material modification by the enterprise via an intermediary” Whereas the proposed New Zealand rule encompasses the following: Utilise New Zealand-based staff to support the sales function, through a New Zealand subsidiary, branch or “dependent” persons or entities contracted to an off-shore entity. 2.11 It does not make sense to depart from language and concepts that are already internationally recognised and understood. 2.12 New Zealand should not be implementing rules when it would not be comfortable with other countries imposing those same rules on New Zealand exporters. The Group believes that the application of a similar rule to that being proposed in the discussion document by overseas jurisdictions presents a real risk to New Zealand’s revenue base. This is especially relevant noting that the New Zealand economy is export driven with growing exports being the key plank in the Government’s economic growth policy. 2.13 At our workshop with you we discussed the example of a New Zealand company selling product into Japan (or any other country). In this example the company had two employees on the ground in Japan who are responsible for liaising with clients and facilitating orders (noting that contracts are concluded outside of Japan). The reason for adopting this sales strategy is largely cultural. Experience has shown this CTG – BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance 28 April 2017 Page 14 of 32 CTGCTG company that Japanese customers prefer to deal with someone who is in country, speaks Japanese and understands local customs. 2.14 In the Group’s view, in this example the activity in Japan should not give rise to a permanent establishment. However, at the meeting Officials noted that based on the current proposal in the discussion document they consider this scenario to be ‘close to the line’ and could in fact give rise to a PE in Japan. The Group submits that if this is the case New Zealand must be prepared for Japan to deem a PE to exist and take a share of the profits. It is the opinion of the Group that this is a wholly undesirable outcome, yet there doesn’t appear to be any consideration of the implications of overseas jurisdictions applying this type of PE avoidance rule. 2.15 At the workshop, Officials indicated that pure marketing activity undertaken by an organisation is not sufficient to give rise to a PE. However, if there is customisation for a particular sale, a line is crossed and a PE may exist with profits attributed to it accordingly. In this scenario the Group would expect that all ‘business development’ costs should be deductible. In many business models there can often be several lost sales for every sale that is actually converted. If New Zealand wishes to take a share of the completed sales, costs associated with the unsuccessful sales in New Zealand should also be deductible against the income of the “deemed PE”. 2.16 As the Group has discussed with Officials, New Zealand has a very small domestic market. The reality of this is that, even if a particular taxpayer were inclined to use “profit-shifting” techniques, the application of such techniques to New Zealand operations would serve very little benefit. The majority of taxpayers just want to get on with running their business, which includes complying with all relevant tax laws. To do this, laws need to be clear and certain. The Group submits that the proposed PE avoidance rule creates significant uncertainty which would be a undesirable feature of our international tax rules. 2.17 The Group submits that the factors in determining whether the PE test is met (see paragraph 3.24 of the Discussion Document) should be clarified. In particular, the definition of “well paid” employees should be clarified as the Group considers that just because staff are “well paid”, that does not mean that they have authority to conclude contracts. Recent transfer pricing questionnaires indicate that Inland Revenue considers staff to be “well paid” if they earn over $150,000 per annum. Members have noted that often they have a handful of New Zealand staff working overseas, managing a team of local staff in their overseas operations and that these New Zealand staff are paid well because it is necessary to have trustworthy staff overseeing operations. The level of pay does not relate to any decision-making ability. The Group also queries whether, in the case of a foreign PE of a New Zealand resident taxpayer, the Commissioner would expect a greater level of profit to be attributed to the PE on account of its employment of “well paid” staff. 2.18 The Group submits that guidance should be given as to the meaning of “low tax jurisdiction” (see paragraph 3.24). At this stage it is unclear what this refers to - whether it is a reference to the country’s corporate tax rate, their tax system more broadly or some other measure. Given the importance of this as a factor and to provide some certainty to taxpayers, the Group submits that the Government should publish a list of countries whose tax systems it considers to have the features of a “low tax jurisdiction”. The Group notes this approach was used successfully under New Zealand’s former Foreign Investment Fund rules and a list of low tax jurisdictions is also included with Transfer Pricing Questionnaires issued by the Commissioner. For example, would the corporate tax rates of the important markets of the UK (17%) CTG – BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance 28 April 2017 Page 15 of 32 CTGCTG and the US (15%, assuming announced reforms are enacted) deem them to be low tax jurisdictions? 2.19 Paragraph 3.36 of the discussion document states (emphasis added): We expect that the application of these principles will result in a fairly significant amount of the sales income being attributable to the deemed PE in most cases. We also expect a material amount of net taxable profit to remain in the PE after the deduction of related expenses. In this regard, we note that New Zealand, like many countries, has not adopted the OECD’s revised methodology for attributing profits to a PE. The OECD’s revised methodology is also not currently reflected in many DTAs. New Zealand instead applies the earlier version of the OECD’s methodology. 2.20 The Group is concerned about the sentiments expressed in paragraph 3.36 and considers that the application of the proposals should be clarified, in particular what is meant by “fairly significant” and “material amount” in relation to sales income being attributable to the deemed PE and the net profit to remain (see paragraph 3.36). Thought should be given to the outcome if other countries also seek to grab a “fairly significant” and “material amount” of tax from New Zealand exporters. As noted previously, in the absence of clarity, taxpayers are likely to err on the side of caution and not place any personnel in New Zealand due to the lack of certainty in profit attribution. The Group acknowledges that foreign investors are willing to accept a New Zealand tax liability, but in making their decision rely on being able to cost future commercial arrangements accurately. It is important to make New Zealand as attractive as possible to encourage future inbound investment into New Zealand. 2.21 The Group notes that there are PE rules in DTAs, PE rules in the OECD Action 5 material and the PE rules as proposed in this discussion document. In the Group’s view, the proposed rules as they are worded in this discussion document merely add complexity to the rules. The Group submits that the wording of Action 5 should be used where possible, as these are the standards that other countries will be implementing. 2.22 It is critical that, if these proposals proceed, Inland Revenue should provide clear commentary for taxpayers on how it considers profits should be attributed to PEs. The rules cannot act as a “force of attraction” principle and seek to bring into the New Zealand tax base all New Zealand sales revenues simply because some functions are carried on in New Zealand. Any attribution of profit to New Zealand must reflect the actual degree of activity and effort in New Zealand – value added outside of New Zealand cannot be taxed in New Zealand. 2.23 Under New Zealand’s existing profit attribution principles, it is expected that the “profit calculated as being linked to the PE is in line with that which would be expected from a comparable business operating entirely at arm’s-length.” 7 In effect this means that the PE should earn a profit that is consistent with its functional profile. As this is not different to what is expected of legally separate entities, where a deemed PE is established by operation of the proposed rule, the profit taxable in New Zealand is unlikely to be higher than that currently provided to the New Zealand entity under the transfer pricing rules. In that event, the proposed rule would have no effect, other to impose significant and unnecessary compliance costs on the non-resident and risk non-residents eliminating jobs and investment in New Zealand. 2.24 In the Group’s view, departing from such core principles risks New Zealand falling out of step with the rest of the world, in turn risking retaliatory action in jurisdictions 7 http://www.ird.govt.nz/transfer-pricing/practice/transfer-pricing-practice-branches.html CTG – BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance 28 April 2017 Page 16 of 32 CTGCTG in which we operate. New Zealand’s best chance of ensuring that its exports are not overtaxed is to ensure that it does not act unilaterally and seek to assert taxing rights over revenue where the income earning activity (including IP) is located outside of New Zealand. It is extremely important to remember that the New Zealand rules do not stand alone and must be considered in the context of the worldwide environment. Arrangements involving third party channel providers 2.25 The Group submits that the proposed rules should not cover arrangements where sale of supplies are made to a non-affiliated entity. It is intended that the proposed rules will also apply where an independent third party is interposed between the non- resident and the New Zealand customer as part of the arrangement. The discussion document suggests (at paragraph 3.29) that the non-resident and third party are working together to sell the particular goods or services to the end customer with the assistance of the related New Zealand entity. 2.26 In the Group’s view, in the majority of these situations the non-resident will not have control over the sales activities of the third party and the arrangements do not amount to a “single arrangement” as discussed at paragraph 3.28, and therefore the proposed PE rules should not apply. The unrelated nature of the non-resident and the third party means that the transactions between them are at arm’s length. The Group considers that distributors and retailers will operate independently and will not contravene the purpose of the DTA PE rules, noting that the sales by the third party are already within the New Zealand tax net. 2.27 The Group acknowledges that there may be limited situations where a related subsidiary works closely with, or directly controls, the activities of the unrelated third party. However, in the Group’s experience, this arrangement does not occur in practice and if it does, then any detrimental tax effect may be able to be caught by the anti-avoidance rules in subsection GB of the Income Tax Act 2007. Accordingly, it is not justification for the proposal to fundamentally change New Zealand’s approach to the concept of permanent establishment. 2.28 The Group submits that the proposed rules should be limited to situations where the sale is made directly by the non-resident to the New Zealand customer. Purpose of the PE provisions 2.29 The rules proposed in paragraphs 3.21 and 3.27 both contain a criterion that “the arrangement defeats the purpose of the PE provisions”. The Group submits that any such criterion should refer to the dominant purpose of the arrangement. 2.30 The Group also submits that it should be clarified what the “purpose of the DTA’s PE provisions” is in relation to the deeming of a PE in New Zealand (as per paragraphs 3.21 and 3.27). In the Group’s view, whether an organisation has a PE or not is an ‘in or out’ test – an organisation either has enough of a presence in New Zealand or not. The Group queries whether an organisation that is close to having a PE but doesn’t have quite enough ‘presence’ could be considered to have defeated the purpose of the provisions. 2.31 The Group considers that the focus should be on artificial arrangements. There are many unusual commercial arrangements that are undertaken for genuine commercial reasons. The discussion document notes at paragraph 5.45 that there is an increasing variety of commercial arrangements being undertaken by multinationals and CTG – BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance 28 April 2017 Page 17 of 32 CTGCTG consideration should be given to this. These arrangements are not inherently to avoid tax and merely represent the evolving nature of business. 2.32 The Group considers that this proposal should not have the effect of overriding New Zealand’s DTAs. It is important that taxpayers continue to have access to MAP and arbitration procedures guaranteed in New Zealand’s network of treaties. 2.33 The Group submits that these proposals should not apply to arrangements involving countries with which New Zealand has a DTA. Further, New Zealand should not be looking to impose a rule beyond what has been agreed by OECD. Any domestic PE avoidance rule should follow the language used in the OECD model treaty. Inconsistencies 2.34 Paragraphs 3.21 and 3.27 set out proposed rules where PEs will be deemed to arise. Notwithstanding the Group’s comments on these paragraphs above, the Group notes there is an inconsistency in terminology between paragraphs 3.21 and 3.27 of the discussion document. 3.21 describes an activity “in connection with”, while 3.27 describes an activity “in relation to”. The Group considers that this wording should be consistent in order to avoid any confusion. 2.35 Similarly, the Group also submits that the inconsistency between “that particular sale” in 3.21 and “the sale” in 3.27 should be consistent. 2.36 The Group notes that, at paragraph 3.21, a PE will be deemed to exist where certain criteria are met, including where “some or all of the sales income is not attributed to a New Zealand PE of the non-resident”. These rules deal with deeming a PE to exist, not how to attribute profits as suggested by the above phrase. In the Group’s view, the wording of this particular criterion does not make sense and should read as “none of the income is attributed to the PE” as, if some but not all of the income is attributed to the PE, any shortfall arises due to issues with the application of the profit attribution rules, and not the PE recognition rules. Penalties 2.37 The Group does not agree with the proposal at paragraph 3.38 that “the current 100% penalty for taking an abusive tax position (under section 141D of the Tax Administration Act 1994) will also apply for the purposes of the proposed PE avoidance rule.” The Group does not consider that the abusive tax position penalty, or even the unacceptable tax position penalty should automatically be applied in these situations. These penalties should only apply to extreme cases. CTG – BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance 28 April 2017 Page 18 of 32 CTGCTG APPENDIX THREE: DETAILED SUBMISSION POINTS – AMENDMENTS TO THE SOURCE RULES Disclaimer: no comments on practicalities or mechanics of the proposals are intended to be read as an endorsement of the proposals unless explicitly stated. 3. Amendments to the source rules Summary  Amendments are unnecessary as the existing source rules are comprehensive.  The proposals unfairly penalise reinsured parties. Proposed source rules 3.1 In the Group’s view, the proposed changes to the source rules are unnecessary as the current source rules are sufficiently broad to capture any situations the Commissioner is concerned with. Under the current rules, if sales income has a New Zealand source under our domestic legislation it is taxable unless New Zealand is prevented from doing so under any applicable DTA. 3.2 Paragraphs 4.23 and 4.23 do not respect the existing source rules in part YD of the Income Tax Act 2007 which clearly contemplate apportionment through the use of the words “to the extent...”. At the end of the day, New Zealand can only tax what has an actual source in New Zealand. 3.3 It is proposed that a new source rule be introduced under which income will have a New Zealand source if it is attributable to a PE in New Zealand. If a DTA applies in respect of the income, then the definition of a PE in that particular DTA will be used for this purpose. In the Group’s view, the addition of this rule is circular and does not add anything to the rules. It is a belts and braces approach and it is hard to envisage a situation in which the proposed source rule will be employed that is not already covered. Life insurance source rules 3.4 The Group understands the life insurance source rule proposal has been introduced due to the (theoretical) possibility that there may be tax relief for New Zealand sourced insurance if the reinsurer is resident in Singapore, Canada and Russia and doesn’t have a PE in New Zealand. This is due to the fact that New Zealand’s DTAs with these countries carve out life insurance income from the business profits exemption in Article 7 - i.e. non-resident life insurers who are residents of one of the above three countries receive an (unintended) tax advantage by being able to deduct reinsurance premiums. 3.5 The Group submits that the proposals unfairly penalise the reinsured by placing a significant burden on them with regard to the denial of deductions. In particular, they cannot be expected to have completeness of information regarding their insurers’ place of tax residency and PE status in New Zealand.

Strengthening the transfer pricing rules Summary  Overall the Group does not believe that further strengthening of the transfer pricing rules are required. Inland Revenue already has a number of tools available to it and these tools should be applied. Inland Revenue should ensure that it is appropriately resourced with transfer pricing expertise in order to ensure that it is able to apply the rules as they currently stand, and do so within the current four year time bar period.  Any powers of reconstruction need to be limited to only the most extreme circumstances and should only be assessed at the highest levels within Inland Revenue. The same applies for the deeming of any taxpayer to be non-cooperative.  The Group does not support the extension of the time bar to seven years. This proposal is counter to Inland Revenue providing more certainty to taxpayers.  The Group does not support shifting the burden of proof to taxpayers. The Group is concerned that Inland Revenue has access to comparables which are not available to taxpayers.  The Group would like to see Inland Revenue provide an online resource setting out what OECD materials expect taxpayers to be following.  The Group foresees difficulty in applying transfer pricing rules to investors acting in concert. The mere fact that there are unassociated parties coming together indicates there should already be arm’s length pricing in place; i.e. there is natural tension to ensure each party is not receiving more than their fair share. Time bar 4.1 The Group does not support the extension of the time bar for transfer pricing positions to seven years. This represents a 75% increase in the time bar, which in the Group’s view, goes against Inland Revenue’s customer centric approach and incentivises bad behaviour by Inland Revenue in not closing out matters in a timely manner. The Group understands that one of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation goals is to provide more “real time” advice, information and assurance, as well as to encourage taxpayers to “get it right from the start”. This proposal is inconsistent with these principles. 4.2 The Group notes that Inland Revenue’s compliance management approach for multinational enterprises has been to move to resolving issues with commercial transactions in real time. This approach has been achieved through provision of more pre-filing reviews and risk reviews and has allowed for practical certainty in a short period of time (well within the four year time bar). CTG – BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance 28 April 2017 Page 20 of 32 CTGCTG 4.3 The Group submits that the proposal to extend the time bar is particularly egregious given the nature of transfer pricing arrangements and disputes. These arrangements are fundamental part of the way a taxpayer structures their business and for this reason will generally span several income years. The Group notes these are not one- off events (like many other tax disputes) and there will be an impact year after year. To have tax years open for seven years leaves taxpayers open to far too much risk and uncertainty. 4.4 The discussion document asserts that the extension of the time bar will bring New Zealand in line with other countries. New Zealand operates in a smaller marketplace than these other countries, and the Group considers that an adequately resourced Revenue should be able to complete this process within four years. 4.5 The discussion document uses the time bar period of other jurisdictions as justification for increasing the time bar. However the Group submits that the selection of seven years is simply an example of “cherry picking” the worst option for taxpayers as this is the longest time bar (excluding China who applies a ten year time bar across all taxes, not just transfer pricing). As is shown from the table below (taken from paragraph 5.70 of the discussion document), the majority of jurisdictions do not differentiate between the time bar applying to transfer pricing vis-à-vis other tax issues. It is difficult to understand why Inland Revenue does not consider itself able to complete its transfer pricing reviews within the same time period that applies for other complicated areas of tax such as financial arrangements and tax avoidance. Country Transfer pricing time bar Standard time bar for other tax matters China 10 years 10 years Australia 7 years 4 years Canada 7 years 4 years Malaysia 7 years 5 years Hong Kong 6 years 6 years Japan 6 years 5 years Ireland 4 years 4 years Germany 4 years 4 years UK 4 years 4 years US 3 years 3 years 4.6 The Group also submits that increasing the time bar puts New Zealand at risk of transfer pricing reassessments. In particular, other jurisdictions will have longer to claim a larger share of revenue which has been taxed in New Zealand. On the other hand, New Zealand businesses who find themselves subject to transfer pricing adjustments in New Zealand will not have the benefit of obtaining offsetting reassessments in the other jurisdiction if that country’s time bar period is shorter (e.g. Hong Kong, Japan, Ireland, Germany, UK and US). 4.7 The Group submits that if the time bar is to be raised (which we disagree with), it should only be raised by one or two years and then only for non-cooperative taxpayers (see below for more discussion on what is a non-cooperative taxpayer). The Group notes that there are significant costs involved in a transfer pricing dispute and extending the time bar to seven years will only increase these costs. These costs will be compounded by the proposed administrative measures discussed below. CTG – BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance 28 April 2017 Page 21 of 32 CTGCTG 4.8 If the time bar is extended, the Group submits that the extended time bar should only apply to tax returns filed after the date of enactment. All tax returns filed before enactment should still be subject to the four year time bar in place when those returns were filed. Burden of proof 4.9 The Group does not support shifting the burden of proof from the Commissioner to the taxpayer. In the Group’s view this shift, coupled with an increase in the time bar, significantly increases compliance costs imposed on taxpayers without a sufficient trade off. The Group submits that the burden of proof should remain with the Commissioner if the taxpayer has been preparing documentation and has been open and transparent with the Commissioner. 4.10 However, if the onus does shift, then it is important that the information required to prove that a particular transaction is arm’s length must be limited to publicly available information / comparables. If the Commissioner seeks to rely on “secret information”, then that information must be disclosed or it cannot be relied on in in the dispute, including Court proceedings. If such information cannot be disclosed without breaching confidentiality, then it is not appropriate that the Commissioner have regard to that information. 4.11 The Group submits that if a taxpayer has sufficient proof that a transaction is within a range that can be considered arm’s length, then Inland Revenue should not be able to tell a taxpayer that the transaction should have been completed at a different point within that range without providing the taxpayer with detailed economic analysis to support that position. For example, a taxpayer may have prepared a benchmarking study and identified an arm’s length range of comparable margins between 2%-4% (supported by compliant transfer pricing documentation). The taxpayer may choose to apply the 2% margin because this is consistent with what they have done globally and is appropriate given the functional profiles of the relevant parties. However, it may be difficult for the taxpayer to negate an assertion by Inland Revenue that 4% is a more appropriate rate. In the Group’s view, in this situation Inland Revenue should not be able to insist on the 4% result merely because it is also in the range supported by the taxpayer’s benchmarking study. OECD guidance 4.12 The Group submits that Inland Revenue should have links to the OECD Guidelines available on its website so that taxpayers can easily access this information. This will increase certainty as it is important that taxpayers have easy access to the rules that may affect them. 4.13 In the Group’s view, if the OECD Guidelines are referenced in legislation it must be made clear what will occur if the OECD makes changes to the Guidelines. The Group submits that the legislation should contain reference to the OECD Guidelines that apply at the time a return is filed. The legislation should also reference reservations New Zealand may have entered in to and note that the guidelines will not apply to the extent of any of these. 4.14 Officials observe at 5.23 that “Inland Revenue and taxpayers routinely apply the latest versions of the guidelines in cases from earlier years, as the guidelines are generally consistent with our existing law.” The Group notes that in practice this approach is only acceptable to the extent that it is not detrimental to the taxpayer. CTG – BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance 28 April 2017 Page 22 of 32 CTGCTG It is inappropriate for the Commissioner to retrospectively rely on guidance that was not available to the taxpayer at the time its tax position was taken. Arm’s length conditions 4.15 It is proposed that the transfer pricing rules will move away from an assessment of the appropriateness of arm’s length consideration to one of the “arm’s length conditions”. While little detail has been provided in the discussion document, Officials propose that this change will be aligned with the provisions present in Australia. 4.16 The Group notes that “arm’s length conditions” are a much more difficult to identify than arm’s length consideration. This is because the transfer pricing methods routinely applied in assessing cross-border transactions between associated parties typically identify only a comparable price or margin (or a range thereof) for a certain type of transaction. 4.17 Where the Commissioner seeks to look beyond this, to the wider terms and conditions of the arrangement, it becomes more difficult to support any proposed adjustment based on anything more than hypothetical constructs. The Group therefore submits that legislation and guidance must be clear as to the situations in which the Commissioner can establish “arm’s length conditions” other than those identified by the taxpayer, and what must be provided to support this. 4.18 The Group is also concerned that the move away from arm’s length consideration to “arm’s length conditions” may see investigators seeking to adjust a taxpayer’s result, rather than the underlying transactions. The Group considers that it is critical that any adjustment to align a taxpayer’s result with “arm’s length conditions” must be aligned with an adjustment to an identifiable transaction. This is because adjustments to different transactions may have different tax implications. For example, if a taxpayer enters into both services and royalty transactions with foreign associates and the Commissioner seeks to reassess the taxpayer’s tax position, it is important for the taxpayer to know whether it is the services transaction or royalty transaction that is adjusted. This is because royalties typically attract withholding tax obligations, while service fees do not. These considerations flow through any attempt to gain equal and opposite treatment in the jurisdiction of the foreign related party. Reconstruction of transactions 4.19 The Group notes the Commissioner already relies on an assessment of economic substance of cross-border associated party transactions when assessing the appropriateness of the consideration paid or earned under their legal form. 4.20 The Group submits that there need to be sufficient controls put in place when the Commissioner wishes to reconstruct a related party transaction. The Group notes that this power is essentially the Commissioner telling a company how to run its business, and this kind of decision should only be made in “exceptional circumstances”. The Group notes that there are a large number of commercial tensions that work to influence a transaction and it should not be up to the Commissioner to judge the appropriateness of these (unless there are significant enough grounds to do so). In the Group’s view, “exceptional circumstances” can be tested objectively (and is not measured by “uniqueness” as suggested by the discussion document at paragraph 5.39). 4.21 When reviewing transactions, Inland Revenue is doing so with the benefit of hindsight – something taxpayers do not have at the time they are running their business. When CTG – BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance 28 April 2017 Page 23 of 32 CTGCTG considering the appropriateness of commercial arrangements, Inland Revenue should be putting themselves in the shoes of the taxpayer at the time the transaction / arrangement took place. 4.22 The Group submits that it must be clearly defined what activities / transactions are “aggressive” and “commercially irrational”. It must be clear to taxpayers what the rules are and what the standard to be maintained is. The Group also submits that there needs to be structure and transparency around who decides what is an “aggressive” or “commercially irrational” transaction and the process for deciding this. This is necessary to protect taxpayers from overzealous investigators. 4.23 As noted for “arm’s length conditions” above, the Group considers that it is important for any reconstruction by the Commissioner under the proposed reconstruction provisions to be aligned with an actual cross-border arrangement. This is particularly important where taxpayers may enter into a number of transactions, some of which attract withholding obligations. Transfer pricing documentation 4.24 The Group appreciates that Officials do not currently consider it necessary to include a legislative requirement for taxpayers to prepare contemporaneous transfer pricing documentation. However, the Group is concerned about inconsistencies between statements in the discussion document and experience in practice. 4.25 Specifically, the Group notes that the discussion document states at paragraph 5.65 that: “Inland Revenue would already apply a ‘lack of reasonable care’ penalty to incorrect transfer pricing positions taken by taxpayers who have failed to adequately document their transfer pricing positions at the time those tax positions were taken.” In practice, the Group notes that it is common for penalties to be levied only where a taxpayer has failed to provide transfer pricing documentation following a request, and prior to commencement of an audit. This does not require the documentation to have been prepared prior to the filing of the income tax return. In light of this, the Group considers that clarity is needed if the Commissioner will now pursue penalties for “lack of reasonable care” if a taxpayer cannot prove that its documentation was prepared prior to the filing of the tax return. 4.26 The Group considers that this is critical for certainty and would prefer confirmation that contemporaneous documentation is required for penalty protection (as in the Australian legislation), over potential ambiguity. The transfer pricing team / resources 4.27 It is important that Inland Revenue is appropriately resourced with skilled transfer pricing resource so that audits can be completed efficiently and the disputes process can run as intended (i.e. there are independent transfer pricing experts available to participate in taxpayer conferences, adjudication and arbitration). Currently there are so few transfer pricing Principal Advisors within Inland Revenue that it is not possible to obtain an independent / impartial review of a dispute and positions become entrenched. CTG – BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance 28 April 2017 Page 24 of 32 CTGCTG 4.28 There also needs to be sufficient resourcing to allow for an increase in the volume of APAs that will likely be sought if these proposals are enacted. 4.29 The Group notes that for many taxpayers the costs of obtaining an APA are too great for an APA to be a realistic option. Paragraph 5.40 of the discussion document encourages taxpayers to seek APAs to increase certainty. The Group notes that to obtain an APA is a long process that can often end up being very expensive. In the Group’s view, if APAs are to be encouraged, it is important that the process is as streamlined as possible (and as noted above, sufficient resources must be allocated to a team dedicated to this work). The Group also notes that any position that would be agreed under a unilateral APA should be equally acceptable if supported through transfer pricing documentation outside the APA programme. 4.30 As mentioned above, an adequately resourced Revenue should be able to deal with transfer pricing issues within a reasonable time. Taxpayers should not be unfairly penalised with additional compliance costs and uncertainty because there is a lack of resources available. Investors acting in concert 4.31 The Group sees real difficulty with the proposal to apply transfer-pricing rules to investors acting in concert. Where the investors do not have the same economic interests, natural pricing tension will ensure pricing for goods or services by one shareholder is at an arm’s length rate. Treating a different group of persons as the one economic entity would not, therefore, reflect the economic reality unless all members of that group had the same proportional economic interests (for example, all were supplying the good or service in proportion to their shareholding). 4.32 The Group therefore suggests that the proposal should only apply where: a. the New Zealand investment is 50 percent or more owned by non-residents; and b. those non-residents have the same proportional economic interest in the transaction to which the transfer pricing rules are sought to be applied to. 4.33 Clarification should also be provided as to whether this association would also make transactions by members of the investors’ groups with the New Zealand entity subject to the transfer pricing rules. 4.34 The Group notes that to the extent transactions are not priced correctly, there may be a transfer of value potentially giving rise to a deemed dividend. For example, if a New Zealand subsidiary were to pay greater than market value for goods purchased from a shareholder, the dividend rules would likely apply to this arrangement as there has been a transfer of value caused by a shareholding relationship.

Administrative measures Summary  There will need to be clear guidelines as to when a taxpayer may be deemed to be “non-cooperative” and ideally this should be defined in legislation. A taxpayer should not be considered non-cooperative if they are just exercising their rights.  A taxpayer should have the right to apply to the high Court to challenge any decision of Inland Revenue to deem the taxpayer non-cooperative.  The Group does not support the requirement to have tax collected earlier in disputes or to allow tax to be collected from associated parties. The Group does not believe that multinationals represent a real credit risk.  The Group does not support the restriction on the use of tax pooling for disputes involving transfer pricing.  The Group does not support implementing penalties of $100,000 for failing to provide information.  Any changes implemented need to be complemented by appropriate grandparenting provisions for existing arrangements. Taxpayers need to be allowed a reasonable amount of time to undertake any necessary restructuring. Non-cooperation 5.1 The Group submits that a determination that a taxpayer is non-cooperative will not only have particular adverse consequences for the taxpayer under the proposed reforms, but could also have significant reputational consequences for the taxpayer. A taxpayer subject to disclosure obligations in connection with listed securities might for example (depending on the circumstances) be obliged to make public disclosure of any determination by Inland Revenue that it is non-cooperative. Given those consequences, there should be a clear statutory definition of non-cooperation as well as procedural safeguards in respect of such determination. 5.2 The statutory definition should state that a taxpayer is not non-cooperative merely because the taxpayer exercises its rights to dispute Inland Revenue's position or contest any steps Inland Revenue may take in an investigation. If a taxpayer were effectively subjected to detrimental consequences (in the form of a determination that the taxpayer is non-cooperative) as a consequence of contesting the validity of Inland Revenue's actions, then on the face of it the measure could be inconsistent with section 27(3) of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 which provides that a person has the right to bring civil proceedings against, and to defend civil proceedings brought by, the Crown in the same way as civil proceedings between individuals. 5.3 In addition, there should be guidelines (in the form of a Standard Practice Statement) as to the process for determining that a taxpayer is non-cooperative. The power to make such a determination should rest with a relatively small number of senior officials within Inland Revenue, and any official making such a determination should CTG – BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance 28 April 2017 Page 26 of 32 CTGCTG be independent from the personnel auditing/investigating or otherwise engaged with the taxpayer. 5.4 The statutory definition of non-cooperation and/or the Standard Practice Statement guidelines should also require advance written warning to be given prior to Inland Revenue determining that a taxpayer is non-cooperative. The taxpayer should receive written notice specifying the acts or omissions that Inland Revenue considers make the taxpayer uncooperative and affording the taxpayer a reasonable opportunity to respond to the warning and/or to remedy the actions or inactions that Inland Revenue considers may result in the taxpayer being uncooperative. 5.5 Finally, a taxpayer should have the right to apply to court to challenge any decision of Inland Revenue to deem it non-cooperative. As noted above, there could be significant reputational damage from being deemed "non-cooperative" and it is important that taxpayers have a means of effectively challenging such a determination. Advance payment of tax in dispute 5.6 The Group considers that the proposal that taxpayers in certain cases be required to pay tax in dispute prior to determination of the dispute is unjustified. The proposal is unjustified for a number of reasons:  The proposed rule is arbitrary, covering only disputes in relation to transfer pricing, the application of the source rules and tax payable under a double tax agreement ("DTA"). There is nothing special about these types of disputes to warrant the proposed rule;  The general rule that disputed tax be payable only following final determination of any dispute should remain, except in cases where there is a risk of non- payment of tax found owing. In cases in which there is a risk of non-payment of tax ultimately found to be owing, Inland Revenue already has the power (see section 138I of the TAA) to require early payment;  Multinational corporate taxpayers are not currently incentivised to delay resolution of disputes (as suggested at paragraph 6.21 of the Discussion Document) given the imposition of use of money interest at rates materially higher than commercial rates. While the ability to use tax pooling mitigates to some extent the effect of use of money interest being imposed at uncommercial rates, it does not eliminate it since the use of pooling involves its own costs;  The Government has not provided evidence in the Discussion Document of any practice of multinational groups not paying the required tax found owing at the conclusion of a dispute. To the extent there is in a particular case a perceived risk of that occurring, Inland Revenue has the power to require advance payment as noted above; and  Officials have suggested this measure is necessary to incentivise taxpayers to progress the dispute and resolve the matter. The Group challenges this suggestion. It is not appropriate for the time bar to be extended but then have taxpayers pay disputed tax earlier. Forcing a taxpayer to pay tax earlier (even if repayable at a later date) merely speeds up taxpayer ‘burnout’. 5.7 The Group does not support the restriction on the use of tax pooling for disputes involving transfer pricing, the application of the source rules or tax payable under a CTG – BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance 28 April 2017 Page 27 of 32 CTGCTG DTA. There appears to be no justification for tax pooling not being available in those cases. The tax pooling rules help mitigate the penal effect of use of money interest on underpaid tax applying at non-commercial rates for many taxpayers. The Discussion Document offers no justification as to why tax pooling should not be available. In the Group’s view, tax pooling is a useful mechanism that allows some flexibility in situations where a taxpayer’s exact liability is uncertain. 5.8 If this proposal does proceed the Group submits that a court order should be required to compel the earlier payment of tax in dispute. This will ensure that Inland Revenue does not require tax to be paid in advance of a dispute being resolved unless there is good reason to depart from the general rule that disputed tax should not be payable until it has been determined (or the taxpayer has accepted) that the disputed tax is in fact payable. Collection of tax 5.9 The discussion document proposes allowing Inland Revenue to collect tax payable by a member of a large multinational group (as defined in the discussion document) from "any wholly owned subsidiary of the multinational in New Zealand". The proposed rule would also allow Inland Revenue to collect from a related New Zealand entity, tax on income attributed to a deemed PE of a non-resident. The discussion document states that such measures will "assist New Zealand in recovering tax payable by non-residents". 5.10 The Group is unaware of any existing difficulty arising from members of a multinational group not paying tax which is due and payable. The discussion document does not suggest there is (or provide any evidence of) any problem under existing law. The Group would be interested to understand the extent of any existing problem with multinational organisations not paying tax which is due and payable. The Group is sceptical that this is a real issue needing resolution, particularly when considering the relative size of these multinationals. The Group is also concerned that if other countries adopt a similar approach, New Zealand headquartered multinationals would be subject to punitive and unsubstantiated tax bills from the jurisdictions they operate in. 5.11 The Group is also concerned about the financial reporting and other commercial implications of a rule that would override the usual rule that members of a group are not jointly and severally liable for each other's liabilities. A rule imposing such liability could result in financial reporting implications for New Zealand members of multinational groups (e.g. the question could arise as to whether a contingent liability must be recognised). Such a rule would also complicate any assessment of risk by prospective lenders to or purchasers of the New Zealand business, since they would be required to inquire into not only the tax position of the particular New Zealand entities but the tax position of the wider group of which they form part. Significant compliance and other deadweight costs could result, in circumstances where no clear problem definition underlying the proposed rule is articulated in the discussion document. 5.12 Inland Revenue already has the power to request assistance from other jurisdictions in the collection of tax (see Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters). Given New Zealand's commitment to international cooperation in addressing BEPS, it is inappropriate for New Zealand to pursue a unilateral measure that cuts across an important internationally accepted norm of corporate law (that tax payable is payable by the particular company assessed, and is not subject to (in effect) a statutorily mandated guarantee by other members of the same group). CTG – BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance 28 April 2017 Page 28 of 32 CTGCTG 5.13 Finally, if the proposed rule does proceed, the Group submits that Inland Revenue should be required to obtain a court order to collect tax from an entity other than the entity against which it was assessed. The proposed rule is (for the reasons noted above) a significant departure from legal norms respecting the distinct and separate legal nature of individual entities, and as such should be subject to judicial oversight in its application. Collection of information The proposed power is unnecessary and has been rejected previously 5.14 The Group does not support the introduction of a power for Inland Revenue to make a New Zealand entity legally responsible for providing information that Inland Revenue may believe is held by another member of the multinational group. The TAA already provides that a person may be required to (and may commit an offence for omitting to) provide information held by foreign entities which that person controls. The discussion document proposes that the offence provisions in section 143 of the TAA be amended such that the New Zealand entity (a New Zealand resident or a New Zealand PE of a non-resident company) could be convicted of an offence for failing to provide information held by foreign associated persons of the New Zealand entity. 5.15 If the proposal proceeds, it would no longer be a defence under this offence provision that the New Zealand entity does not have possession or control of the information itself or over the entity that does hold the information. The New Zealand entity could therefore be convicted of an offence for acts or omissions of related entities which it does not control and in some cases cannot influence. 5.16 The Group notes that a similar provision was proposed in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Maori Organisations, Taxpayer Compliance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2002. In that Bill, it was proposed that the Commissioner would have the power to request information from any persons "associated with the New Zealand resident". 8 This proposal would have resulted in a New Zealand resident taxpayer being required to produce to Inland Revenue information held by non-resident entities related to the taxpayer, even if the taxpayer has no practical control over those entities, and in circumstances where the entities have no bearing on the taxpayer's New Zealand tax obligations (essentially the rule proposed in the discussion document). 5.17 After submissions were received on the Bill, Inland Revenue accepted that the application of the rule should be restricted to apply only to foreign entities controlled by a New Zealand resident. 9 This narrowed rule was subsequently enacted. The Australian and Canadian provisions referred to in the discussion document are not comparable to what the discussion document proposes 5.18 The discussion document (at paragraph 6.34) states that the proposed change would align New Zealand law with Australian and Canadian law and refers to section 264A of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) and section 231.6 of the Income Tax Act RS C 1985 c 1. The Australian and Canadian provisions have very different consequences from what the Discussion Document proposes for New Zealand however. 8 Clause 75. 9 See Inland Revenue Taxation (Annual Rates, Maori Organisations, Taxpayer Compliance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill: Officials' Report to the Finance and Expenditure Committee on Submissions on the Bill ((November 2002) at 110. CTG – BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance 28 April 2017 Page 29 of 32 CTGCTG 5.19 Failure to comply with section 264A of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) is not an offence. Section 264A(22) provides that: A refusal or failure to comply with a request set out in an offshore information notice is not an offence. 5.20 The Australian Master Tax Guide states that: 10 \[t\]he only sanction for failure to comply with a notice is evidentiary, ie the information or documents which the taxpayer fails to provide will not be admissible in subsequent proceedings disputing the taxpayer's assessment. 5.21 The consequence of not complying with the Australian rule reflects the purpose and nature of the rule. Fundamentally, it is an information gathering power to assist the Commissioner to assess the tax liability of the taxpayer, when that information is held offshore. 11 But unlike the general power to request information (such as in section 17 of the TAA in the New Zealand context) section 264A is obviously directed at the particular risk to the Commissioner of offshore information not being provided during an investigation and then selectively used in proceedings to dispute an assessment. The only consequence of not providing that information is that the taxpayer is not able to use that information to dispute any assessment. The Group also notes that the decision of the Australian Commissioner to issue an offshore information notice is amendable to judicial review (including as to the form and content of the notice itself). 12 5.22 The Canadian provisions in section 231.6 of the Income Tax Act RS C 1985 c 1 specifically set out the right for the taxpayer to apply to a Judge for a review of the request for foreign based information or documentation. 13 The Judge then has the power to: (a) confirm the requirement; (b) vary the requirement as the judge considers appropriate in the circumstances; or (c) set aside the requirement if the judge is satisfied that the requirement is unreasonable. 5.23 Section 231.6(6) then provides: 14 \[f\]or the purposes of paragraph 231.6(5)(c), the requirement to provide the information or document shall not be considered to be unreasonable because the information or document is under the control of or available to a non-resident person that is not controlled by the person served with the notice of the requirement under subsection 231.6(2) if that person is related to the non- resident person. 10 Michael Chow (ed) Australian Master Tax Guide (56 th ed, CCH Australia Limited, Sydney, 2015) at \[21- 220\]. 11 FH Faulding and Co Ltd v the Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia \[1994\] FCA 1492; (1994) 54 FCR 75 at \[30\]. 12 FH Faulding and Co Ltd v the Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia at \[34\]. 13 Income Tax Act RS C 1985 c 1, s 231.6(5). 14 Income Tax Act RS C 1985 c 1, s 231.6(6). CTG – BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance 28 April 2017 Page 30 of 32 CTGCTG 5.24 Case law has clarified that even if the person holding the information is related to the taxpayer, that will not in itself make the request a reasonable one. 15 That is, even if the information is held by a related party, there is a protection for the taxpayer in that the request must still be reasonable in the circumstances. 5.25 The penalty for not complying with the request is the prohibition, on the motion of the Minister, on introducing any foreign-based information or document covered by the request which was not complied with. 16 Only on conviction by the court is the taxpayer liable to a fine or term of imprisonment for not complying with the information request. The maximum penalty is a fine of $25,000 and a term of imprisonment of no more than 12 months. 17 Inland Revenue can and should use existing powers 5.26 The discussion document acknowledges that Inland Revenue can and does seek information held by foreign entities using its exchange of information rights, but suggests that this is inadequate (at paragraph 6.32): Recent improvements to the exchange of information between tax authorities are making it easier for Inland Revenue to request and exchange information that is held by offshore tax authorities. However, relying on an ability to request information indirectly from other tax authorities is not always adequate. In some cases, the relevant information is not held by the offshore tax authority and in other cases the foreign tax authority may be slow or unhelpful in responding to reasonable requests for information. 5.27 The first aspect of this justification (that the foreign tax authority may not hold the information) is not compelling. DTA partners can, and do, exercise their own information-gathering powers to obtain the information that Inland Revenue requests under the DTA, just as Inland Revenue exercises its powers to obtain information requested by our DTA partners. 5.28 It is difficult to evaluate the second aspect of the justification (that the foreign tax authority may be slow or unhelpful in responding) without knowing how common this is. It is to be hoped that this is not often the case given that the DTA or Tax Information Exchange Agreement (as applicable) imposes an obligation on the foreign Government to comply with a valid request, and that New Zealand (presumably) complies with its obligations under the DTA or TIEA. 5.29 But to the extent Inland Revenue might sometimes encounter difficulties or delays in obtaining information from a foreign revenue authority, New Zealand companies may be in no better position yet (under the proposed rule) would be at risk of criminal sanctions and / or a significant monetary penalty if the information is not provided. For the New Zealand company, it is not simply a matter of requesting the information from (or forwarding on Inland Revenue's information request to) the relevant foreign affiliates and expecting that the information will be provided. The practical difficulties include: 18 15 See Fidelity Investment Canada Ltd v Canada (Revenue Agency) 2006 FC 551 and Soft-Moc Inc v Canada (National Revenue) 2013 FC 291. 16 Income Tax Act RS C 1985 c 1, s 231.6(8). 17 Income Tax Act RS C 1985 c 1, s 238(1). 18 For these same reasons, the Group is concerned that a New Zealand company's inability to provide information held by an associated foreign entity may be grounds to deem a taxpayer "non-cooperative". In fact, the non-provision of the information may be due to these very real practical constraints, and not to any desire to be uncooperative. CTG – BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance 28 April 2017 Page 31 of 32 CTGCTG  Multinational groups may have hundreds or more legal entities operating in a large number of countries. If Inland Revenue were to have the power to issue an information request applicable to the whole group, it may be difficult or impossible for the New Zealand subsidiary to know even which legal entities may hold the information requested (and in which countries to make inquiries).  Inland Revenue information requests are often very broadly worded, and may call for the production of large numbers (not infrequently thousands) of emails and other documents, which in turn could necessitate the review of an even greater number of documents to determine which are within the scope of the request. For such requests to apply not only to the New Zealand group but also to foreign associated persons could make the requests so costly and burdensome to comply with that compliance is for all practical purposes impossible.  The New Zealand company will usually have no legal right to require a foreign associate to provide information to it. And even if the foreign associate is willing (in the interests of the group) to devote the time and resources necessary to assist the New Zealand company in locating and providing relevant documents, the foreign associate will need to consider whether it is appropriate to do so. For example, some of the information may be legally privileged. Local privacy and confidentiality laws will need to be considered. 19 Alternative submission: if the proposal proceeds, judicial oversight is necessary 5.30 If the proposed rule were to proceed, Inland Revenue should be required to obtain a court order to impose on the New Zealand entity or person liability for non-provision of such information. This would provide judicial oversight in respect of the breadth of the request and feasibility of complying with it, and as to whether the need for such an onerous power to be exercised is justified in the circumstances. 5.31 In addition, the Group submits that if Inland Revenue is empowered to collect more information, this information can only be requested if it meets a “necessary and relevant” test. In the Group’s view there needs to be a limit on the information that Inland Revenue can collect, especially where undue compliance costs are required to collect information that is not actually that important to the situation. In the Group’s view, at the time information is requested, Inland Revenue should provide context as to why it is collecting information and how it is relevant to the taxpayer’s New Zealand tax liability. Penalties for not providing information 5.32 The Group submits that it is not appropriate for Inland Revenue to have the power to impose a $100,000 penalty on taxpayers who fail to comply with section 17 or section 21. A power to impose such a penalty should be left to the courts. This is especially so when taxpayers could be subject to penalties when information is not provided by a member of the same multinational group but over which the taxpayer may have no control. 19 These considerations were behind the need for FATCA to be implemented through Intergovernmental Agreements, such as that concluded between New Zealand and the United States. Had New Zealand financial institutions agreed to provide information directly to the United States (pursuant to an agreement with the United States Government under section 1471 of the Internal Revenue Code) they may have been in breach of their implied contractual obligation of confidentiality and/or their obligations under the Privacy Act 1993. For them to disclose the information to another Government to avoid a financial detriment (FATCA withholding) may not have been recognised as falling within the disclosure under compulsion of law exceptions to their confidentiality and Privacy Act obligations. CTG – BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance 28 April 2017 Page 32 of 32 CTGCTG 5.33 In the alternative, if Inland Revenue is given the power to impose what is effectively a $100,000 instant fine (without first taking proceedings), taxpayers must have the right to apply to the court seeking that the penalty be reduced or set aside. This is necessary as a minimum in order to meet the requirements of section 27 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. Section 21 in any event should be rewritten or repealed 5.34 Section 21 of the TAA needs to be reviewed, and at a minimum rewritten (regardless of whether its scope is broadened to include situations of non-inclusion of income as suggested by the discussion document). Alternatively, section 21 should be repealed. Inland Revenue already has the power to request information under section 17 of the TAA and non-compliance with section 17 is an offence. Section 21 is arbitrary in its application (e.g. it is triggered by the non-response to an information request after 90 days without regard to whether that time-frame is reasonable in the circumstances) and is disproportionate in its consequences (in denying a taxpayer access to the courts to contest the correctness of Inland Revenue's assessment). 5.35 Denying a taxpayer access to the courts (and preventing a taxpayer from contesting the correctness of Inland Revenue's assessment) is an arbitrary and potentially disproportionate consequence of not responding to an information request. It is also inconsistent with section 27(3) of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. At a minimum, this aspect of the section 21 should therefore be repealed. If a taxpayer does not comply with a request for information, the consequences should be the same as for non-compliance with section 17 and/or that information that should have been furnished in response to the request and is not cannot subsequently be used in proceedings. The consequence should not be the denial of dispute rights in respect of the relevant assessment. Application dates for any Chapter 6 (administrative measures) proposals that do proceed 5.36 To the extent any of the Chapter 6 (administrative measures) proposals proceed, they should not apply from the date of enactment. The amendments would result in significant departures from legal norms and adversely affect the legal rights of taxpayers. Certain amendments could impose liability for tax, or, in respect of the obligation to provide information, on different legal entities solely because they are members of the same group. 5.37 The Group submits that there should be grandparenting of all existing arrangements at the time of enactment, with a five year sunset clause. A five year time period would provide a reasonable amount of time for multinationals to renegotiate agreements; noting that there will be many agreements within a single multinational which will need to be amended. 5.38 In the alternative, if a sunset clause as described above is not accepted, the proposals to the extent they proceed should apply only in respect of income years for which a tax position is taken after the date of enactment. In the Group’s view, there should be a lead time of at least one year after the date of enactment before the amendments take effect. 5.39 As taxpayers have experienced from the recent enactment of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2016-17, Closely Held Companies, and Remedial Matters) Act 2017 on 30 March 2017, having only 2 days lead in time before the next income year starts does not give taxpayers adequate lead in time.

General comments We agree that Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (“BEPS”) by multinational enterprises is a major concern, undermining tax authorities and stoking public feelings of unfairness. We appreciate that the Government is committed to taking decisive action to address BEPS issues to maintain the integrity of the New Zealand tax base. We note that BEPS is a global problem, which requires a global solution. We are concerned that some of the proposals included in the discussion document would move the New Zealand transfer pricing environment beyond the global standard. We are of the view that unilateral action that goes beyond that established by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) BEPS Action Plan is as likely to harm New Zealand’s position in the global tax landscape, as it is to enhance it. In the case of some of the proposals, the Government should be conscious of the potential for retaliatory action by treaty partners that may be detrimental to New Zealand based multinationals. While we recognise that some change is needed to ensure that the transfer pricing rules remain fit for purpose, we strongly recommend that the Government ensures that changes are clear and comprehensive, so as not to further stoke uncertainties in this complex area of our tax system. Summary of submission We have had opportunity to review and consider the submission prepared by the Corporate Taxpayers Group and largely concur with the submission points raised. In addition to these points, we would also like to submit the following points: •To ensure consistency in application of the new rules and expectations, a consistenc y c ommittee should be established within Inland Revenue . •The proposed changes to the permanent establishment (“PE”) rules should be consistent with the OECD Action 7 changes and a greater level of analysis and guidance provided to alleviat e unc ertainty in application. •I f the transfer pricing rules are to refer to arm’s length conditions, care should be taken in the drafting of the definition, noting limitations in data available to taxpayers in making such an assessment. #015 28 April 2017 Page 2 •The propo sed reconstruction provisions must be carefully drafted so as to only appl y in excepti onal circumstances (with clarity provided as to what exceptional circumstances are). Appropriate safe guards and administrative processes should be implemented within Inla nd R evenue to provide oversight of the application of these provisions . •T he relationship between contemporaneous documentation and penalties should be clarified in le gislation, as points made in the discussion document are inconsistent with what currently occurs in practi ce. •T he proposed changes should include an explicit de minimis threshold for the preparatio n of transfer pri cing documentation or safe harbour guidance for certai n transactions. •T he transfer pricing methods referred to in legislation should be aligned with those included in the OECD guidelines. The above submission points are detailed further in the attached Appendix. For any queries in relation to this submission, please contact Bart de Gouw on (+64 9 303 0889 or bdegouw@deloitte.co.nz). Yours sincerely Diana Maitland Partner | Deloitte Private for Deloitte Limited (as trustee for the Deloitte Trading Trust) 28 April 2017 Page 3 APPENDIX Consistency committee Recognising that the proposed changes to the transfer pricing rules amount to the biggest development since the inception of the New Zealand transfer pricing regime, we are conscious that there is potential for inconsistency in how the revised rules are applied by different investigators and principal advisors. In light of this, we submit that a consistency committee should be established within Inland Revenue such that interpretation and application of the new rules is consistent across cases and taxpayers. The committee should consist of Inland Revenue transfer pricing principal advisor(s) independent of the case being assessed as well as appropriate representatives from Legal Technical Services, the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel and the New Zealand Competent Authority as appropriate in the given situation or case. A committee of this nature is considered crucial to the consistent application of the proposed new transfer pricing regime, so as to improve voluntary compliance, foster cooperation by taxpayers and avoid unnecessary disputes instigated by the inconsistent application of the rules. In order to achieve these goals, we envisage the committee performing the following core functions: 1. Moderation 2. Escalation 3. Publication These functions would, in conjunction with the other comments made in this submission, be expected to greatly enhance the operation of the transfer pricing rules and alleviate current nervousness from taxpayers as to their expected application in practice. We expand on these functions below. 1. Moderation We see the current practices of the Inland Revenue’s transfer pricing being prone to a level of inconsistency, with taxpayer experiences varying based on the team composition examining a case. We appreciate this may arise from a lack of resourcing within the unit and from a lack of central control and oversight over the conduct of transfer pricing investigations and reviews. As a result, taxpayers are left with uncertainty as to whether their transfer pricing arrangements will be considered appropriate in the event of review and the core concept of the arm’s length principle is undermined. In order for taxpayers to have certainty of treatment during transfer pricing investigations and disputes, Inland Revenue’s transfer pricing unit needs to present a standardised and united front. This includes objective reviews with the same processes employed and expectations of taxpayers. We therefore would envisage the consistency committee performing an internal governance function within the international audit unit, with the benefit of representation outside of the core transfer pricing team. It would provide guidance to principal advisors and investigators about review procedures, risk assessments and the expectations to be placed on taxpayers. We would also suggest that a representative or representatives from the committee be present at transfer pricing dispute conferences involving potential adjustments of more than NZD1m (or some other appropriate threshold). 2. Escalation Outside the disputes process, Inland Revenue does not currently have a process in place by which a taxpayer under review is able to escalate issues to a third party within Inland Revenue to ensure that the actions of Inland Revenue personnel are consistent with established policies, procedures and historic approaches. 28 April 2017 Page 4 We are aware that the Australian Tax Office (“ATO”) enables taxpayers in the course of an investigation to escalate disagreements to more senior officers. We consider that the consistency committee could fulfil a similar function in New Zealand, offering an avenue through which a taxpayer under review may escalate a disagreement for consideration by a non-interested party. The implementation of this approach would strongly improve consistency for taxpayers, as any controversial action or request could be referred to the committee. This could include, for example, instances where the proposed reconstruction provisions are to be invoked, or where a taxpayer is to be deemed “uncooperative” under the proposed administrative changes. This process would ensure consistent application of the rules across taxpayers and may avoid some cases proceeding to audit or the disputes process. 3. Publication The sum total of Inland Revenue publication on transfer pricing matters since the 2000 transfer pricing guidelines can be found in some 20 pages forming part of Inland Revenue’s website. While this guidance is very helpful, few of these pages contain any reference to how the content is informed by, based in or interacts with the legislative provisions in practice that form the New Zealand transfer pricing rules. In contrast, the ATO has published more than 20 detailed rulings on wide array of transfer pricing issues, along with supporting statements via the ATO website. This lack of publication and development of standardised interpretation (to certain transactions or in certain situations) has contributed to the uncertainty that currently surrounds transfer pricing in New Zealand. Given the absence of judicial consideration of transfer pricing matters, the lack of more detailed guidance by Inland Revenue significantly increases the difficulty faced by taxpayers in determining an appropriate transfer pricing position and preparing high quality documentation in the current environment. Further clarity on Inland Revenue’s expectations would be helpful. We would therefore recommend that the committee be required to publish on a regular and confidential basis, the decisions in matters referred to it under the escalation function described above. This publication would foster a strong base of interpretive guidance for taxpayers, which while not binding, would be sufficiently grounded in the New Zealand law. Permanent establishment avoidance Consistency with OECD The discussion document proposes significant changes to the domestic PE rules. These changes seek to align New Zealand’s domestic PE rules with those found in the Australian Multilateral Anti-Avoidance Law (“MAAL”) 1 , and the UK diverted profits tax (“DPT”) 2 . Currently the PE rules as contained in New Zealand’s double tax agreement (“DTA”) network generally require that a person in New Zealand “has and habitually exercises an authority to substantially negotiate or conclude contracts on behalf of the non-resident” in order for a PE of the non-resident to arise. 3 The revised OECD requirement would require a person to “habitually concludes contracts, or habitually plays the principal role leading to the conclusion of contracts that are routinely concluded without material modification by the enterprise” before a PE of the non-resident arises. 4 1 Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, s 177DA 2 Finance Act 2015, part 3 3 Article 5, New Zealand – Australia DTA used as an example 4 OECD, Action 7: 2015 Final Report, Section A 28 April 2017 Page 5 In contrast, the proposals outlined in the discussion document indicate that a PE will be deemed to exist where a person in New Zealand performs any activity in connection with sales by the non- resident where that activity has the purpose of bringing it about. The only restriction on this is that the arrangement must “defeat the purpose” of the PE provisions of the relevant DTA. The proposed New Zealand rule as currently drafted is inherently broader than the revised OECD provision, despite the claim that this is not the intention. 5 We consider that based on the discussion document, a significantly larger number of business arrangements may be deemed to create a PE in New Zealand than would be the case under a strict application of the OECD rule. This creates inconsistency and uncertainty for taxpayers looking to determine the tax obligations arising from their legitimate commercial operations, and may lead to an increase in double taxation or retaliatory action by treaty partners. As such, we submit that the PE definition included in the proposals should be made consistent with that established by the OECD. Alternatively, specific and comprehensive examples should be provided as to when and how this new rule would apply. The discussion document further indicates that the proposals are intended to be an anti-avoidance rule, which may remove recourse of affected businesses for competent authority intervention under DTA mutual agreement procedures. Assuming this is the intention, this result is unacceptable for taxpayer certainty and fairness. In contrast to the Australian MAAL and UK DPT rules, which only apply where erosion of the tax base occurs 6 , the proposed New Zealand rule does not appear to consider the tax impact of any structure that would be deemed to create a PE. Attribution of income and expenditure Finally, the discussion document assumes that the application of the proposal would result in a “fairly significant amount of the sales income being attributable to the PE” with a “material amount of taxable profit to remain”. 7 These statements neglect to consider the application of the profit attribution rules, which broadly require the level of taxable profit or loss to align with the functions, assets and risks of the non-resident in New Zealand as if it were an independent entity. If therefore the New Zealand related party and the PE are the same functional entity, performing the same functions, utilising the same assets and incurring the same risks, there is no basis on which to expect a greater level of profit (or loss) to arise under the deemed PE proposal than already arises through the application of current legislation. However, the proposed rule would impose significant additional compliance costs for non-residents selling goods and services into New Zealand. In light of the above, we submit that the Government should more fully analyse the proposed PE anti- avoidance rule, including providing guidance on the expectations of how income and expenditure would be attributed to the PE and the anticipated gains for the New Zealand tax base. In our view, the rule is as likely as not to be detrimental to the New Zealand tax base, as multinationals may eliminate New Zealand based jobs to ensure no deemed PE arises in the absence of further guidance. Carve out for distributors The discussion document states at paragraph 3.31 that the proposed rule as it applies to third party channel providers is not intended to apply to a “standard distributor type arrangement”, however no indication is given as to how this exclusion would be achieved. We submit that in the event that the proposal is adopted, care must be taken to ensure that the legislation is sufficiently clear as to the situations that are captured and those that are not captured by the rule. 5 Paragraph 3.2 6 The MAAL requires a “tax benefit” to arise, while the DPT excludes situations where transfer pricing has resulted in the correct amount of tax being paid. 7 Paragraph 3.36 28 April 2017 Page 6 Arm’s lengths conditions The discussion document proposes to amend the legislation from “arm’s length consideration” to “arm’s lengths conditions” to allow for the consideration of all “relevant conditions” to determine whether transactions comply with the arm’s length principle. The discussion document does not elaborate on the criteria to be assessed by a taxpayer in order to satisfy the proposed burden of proof. Care should be taken when drafting the New Zealand definition of “arm’s length conditions” such that it recognises - The availability of comparable company data; - The fact that benchmarking does not necessarily allow for the identification and assessment of a number of the comparable circumstances listed in the Australian definition; and - That some legitimate associated party arrangements only exist because of the related nature of the parties and may not have identifiable analogues between independent parties. We note that it is already common practice for the broader conditions of a certain arrangement to be taken into account in determining whether an amount is an arm’s length amount for the purposes of the current transfer pricing rules. We submit that any proposed adjustment to a taxpayer’s transfer prices by Inland Revenue must be supported by more than an assertion as to different conditions, and should not be simply a disagreement with the point achieved or selected within an arm’s length range. An appropriate threshold might be that the actual conditions of an arrangement must be evidenced to be materially different to the arm’s length conditions before any adjustment can be made. Reconstruction of transactions The discussion document proposes to grant the ability for Inland Revenue to reconstruct or disregard certain transactions that it believes are not commercially rational. While we understand that economic substance is an important consideration in determining the appropriateness of transfer prices between associated parties, it is also important that the rules do not unnecessarily impede arrangements that are only possible due to the related nature of the parties. As noted in the discussion document, OECD transfer pricing guidelines provide that reconstruction type powers should only be applied in “exceptional circumstances”. However, the current proposal does not intend to include reference to this threshold, prima facie allowing Inland Revenue broader reconstruction powers. We consider that this is dangerous for taxpayer certainty. It is noted that the discussion document suggests that the New Zealand reconstruction provision will be drafted based on the Australian rules as included at subdivision 815-130 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. We submit that care should be taken to ensure that the drafting of the New Zealand provisions is sufficiently detailed such that it will only apply in “exceptional circumstances”. This should include a clear set of criteria against which taxpayers may assess their arrangements in the course of determining their income tax position. In the event that the reconstruction provisions are enacted, there must be appropriate checks and balances to ensure that the provisions are not invoked inconsistently (see above in regards to a consistency committee). Transfer pricing documentation requirements Contemporaneous documentation The discussion document notes that it is not currently proposed to require taxpayers to update and file transfer pricing documentation on an annual basis or impose specific penalties for a lack of documentation. However, it also notes that “Inland Revenue would already apply a “lack of reasonable 28 April 2017 Page 7 care” penalty to incorrect transfer pricing positions to be taxpayers who have failed to adequately document their transfer pricing positions at the time those tax positions were taken”. In essence, these statements are contradictory and inconsistent with our experience with Inland Revenue during transfer pricing reviews and disputes. In our view, the proposal amounts to an implicit contemporaneous transfer pricing documentation requirement. Whether stated explicitly or not, the imposition of penalties for “lack of reasonable care” where taxpayers have not documented their transfer pricing positions “at the time” the position was taken creates a requirement for contemporaneous transfer pricing documentation. We suggest that clarification is required on this point. If Inland Revenue’s position is as described above, then this should be explicitly prescribed in legislation. We submit that an approach consistent with that taken in Australia should be adopted to clarify the relationship between contemporaneous documentation and penalties. This should be accompanied by a prescribed de minimis threshold for smaller taxpayers or safe harbour guidance for certain types of transactions, as discussed below. De minimis threshold and safe harbour guidance A contemporaneous transfer pricing documentation requirement, as implied by the discussion document, would impose a significant burden on smaller taxpayers and those with only small or simple cross-border associated party transactions. While we acknowledge that it is expected for large multinationals to prepare transfer pricing documentation as part of their routine compliance practices, and for the most part they do so (though this may not currently be contemporaneous), small and medium enterprises (“SMEs”) 8 have little guidance from which to determine whether they should prepare documentation and how comprehensive this should be (other than current references to a “cost / risk” approach). We recommend that the proposed changes to the transfer pricing rules include a prescribed de minimis documentation threshold, with taxpayers falling below the threshold exempted from preparing transfer pricing documentation (assuming they self-assess against a relevant set of criteria), with routine business records used to establish reasonable care. The de minims threshold could be set based on New Zealand revenue or the quantum of cross-border associated party transactions. An alternative would be to follow the Australian approach by providing a number of safe harbour pricing guidelines (in Australia these are called “simplified record keeping options”), which if applied will not require the preparation of comprehensive transfer pricing documentation. Instead, the taxpayer must prepare sufficient documentation to evidence compliance with the safe harbour guidance (i.e. eligibility and application). This approach is considered to be pragmatic, providing certainty to taxpayers, while reducing the risk of erosion of the New Zealand tax base. Rather than continuing the “grey area” for transfer pricing compliance, we suggest that Inland Revenue effectively sets the cost/risk analysis threshold, drawing a distinct line in the sand by implementing something similar to the suggestions above. Transfer pricing methods We submit that this opportunity is taken to align the transfer pricing methods referred to in legislation with those detailed in the OECD transfer pricing guidelines. Specifically, current legislation refers to the “comparable profits method”, which in practice has been replaced by the OECD’s “transactional net margin method”. 8 Smaller SME companies make up the majority of New Zealand companies that would be impacted by an increase in transfer pricing documentation compliance requirements (approximately only 20 New Zealand headquartered companies qualify for Country-by-Country reporting out of 575,647 NZ Limited Companies as at 30 June 2016). 1 May 2017 Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue PO Box 2198 Wellington By email: policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz Base Erosion and Profit-Shifting (BEPS) – Transfer Pricing and Permanent Establishment Avoidance Introduction and general comments 1.The New Zealand Law Society (Law Society) welcomes the opportunity to comment on BEPS – Transfer Pricing and Permanent Establishment Avoidance: A Government discussion document (discussion document). 2.The Law Society is concerned about the proposed approach to amending the effect of New Zealand’s existing international treaties. We acknowledge that other countries have enacted similar rules to those proposed. Nevertheless, we consider that there is limited scope for New Zealand to enact changes in the name of ‘avoidance rules’ which have the effect of overruling the clear wording in our international treaties. 3.Under our treaties, foreign companies resident in countries with tax treaties that do not carry on business from a permanent establishment are afforded protection against New Zealand tax on their income from New Zealand. In return, that foreign country affords New Zealand companies the same protection. 4.It is generally accepted that the protections provided in the treaty must be subject to general rules that prevent their abuse. However, there is a line between such general rules and more specific provisions that are intended to simply undo the negotiated position reflected in the treaty. Legislation enacting this latter category is not appropriate. 5.On its own, a specific anti-avoidance rule of the type proposed may not contravene our treaty network, however the position is less clear when the entire package of proposed amendments is considered. Under the proposals, not only will foreign companies now be exposed to tax when, on the plain wording of the treaty this should not be the case, but it is also proposed that they will be subject to a different regime for the investigation and challenge of their taxes. 6.The Law Society submits that this is not in accordance with the spirit of our treaty network. It is also arguably not in accordance with the legal effect of our existing treaty network; particularly when one considers that the proposed multi-lateral instrument provides a mechanism for countries to amend their treaties to give effect to the substance of these changes. #016 2 7. Where countries choose not to amend their treaty, New Zealand should not be able to impose this change on them through our domestic rules. Chapter 3: Permanent Establishment (PE) avoidance 8. Chapter 3 proposes to adopt a rule very similar to the ones found in the UK Diverted Profits Tax (UK DPT) and the Australian multinational anti-avoidance law (MAAL). The rules would purport to deem a permanent establishment (PE) to exist where one exists in substance despite what is documented under legal arrangements. 9. At a conceptual level, a move to a substance based test would not necessarily result in a different outcome than that arising under an appropriate application of the transfer pricing rules. New Zealand tax payable under a deemed PE should in essence be materially the same as that payable by the relevant New Zealand entity earning an appropriate margin determined under the transfer pricing rules. On this basis, the Law Society submits that there should be no need for a specific PE avoidance rule, in addition to an introduction of more robust transfer pricing rules. 10. If, nevertheless, this rule is implemented then it will be important to ensure that it is drafted so that taxpayers have a high level of certainty as to how it applies to their affairs. This is particularly important as the effect of this rule will directly impact on how easy it is to do business with New Zealand, as a foreign multi-national; and a poorly implemented rule will see New Zealand worse off. 11. The Law Society recommends that any legislation should include a provision similar in effect to section CD 22(8), which would allow taxpayers to seek specific confirmation from Inland Revenue that the PE avoidance rules do not apply to their structure. We expect a number of multi-nationals could seek to use this mechanism to give themselves certainty as to how New Zealand will tax their arrangements. We do not consider that the binding rulings regime would give the same level of comfort, given that the proposed legislation is an anti-avoidance rule. Chapter 5: Strengthening the transfer pricing rules Extension of time bar from four to seven years 12. The Government proposes to increase New Zealand’s time bar for transfer pricing matters from four years to seven years. 13. The discussion document states in paragraph 5.69 that it can be difficult for tax authorities to adequately identify the risk, apply the arm’s length principle and amend the relevant tax return within four years. However, the Law Society submits that the need to extend the time bar period should be much less relevant if the burden of proof shifts to taxpayers as proposed in paragraphs 5.43 to 5.48 of the discussion document. 14. The Government will already have access to improved information flows through:  master file and local file transfer pricing documentation under OECD recommendations; and  automatic exchanges of information between Revenue Authorities. 15. The Law Society is not convinced that it is necessary to have a bespoke limitation period for transfer pricing, particularly given the proposal to move the burden of proof to the taxpayer. 3 16. Further, although paragraph 5.71 specifically refers to the Government’s proposal being limited to increasing New Zealand’s time bar for transfer pricing matters to seven years, there are complications associated with an adjustment for transfer pricing interacting with other types such as income tax, withholding tax, etc. The Government should therefore ensure that any flow-on effect to other tax types arising from transfer pricing adjustments is carefully managed in drafting proposed legislation. Shift of burden of proof to taxpayers 17. The Law Society submits that a longer transitional period is appropriate for any change to the burden of proof. The current proposal for the burden to shift from the first income year after enactment does not provide sufficient time for taxpayers to review their documentation in light of the changed rules. Chapter 6: Administrative measures Non-cooperation 18. It is proposed in Chapter 6 that non-cooperation from large multinationals could result in the proposed new administrative measures being applied (e.g. Inland Revenue issuing an assessment based on information held at the time, the imposition of fines of up to $100k for failure to comply with information requests, etc.) in order to prevent a subsidiary’s non- compliance from frustrating Inland Revenue’s transfer pricing investigation. 19. The Law Society submits that the factors that lead to a finding that a taxpayer is “non- cooperative” are too wide. For example, one of the factors put forward in the proposal in paragraph 6.16 of the discussion document includes “failure to respond to Inland Revenue correspondence”. 20. Information required by Revenue Authorities from large organisations can be onerous and take considerable time to obtain. In practice, the Law Society also expects that where large amounts of information are requested, taxpayers will often obtain and provide information to a standard akin to that of legal discovery to avoid repetition should the investigation progress to litigation. Feedback received by the Law Society indicates it is frequently difficult to obtain the level of material required by Inland Revenue within the timeframes set, owing to an apparent lack of appreciation by Inland Revenue of the practical realities of sourcing the information requested. 21. The Law Society considers that the difficultly described above would not be unique to large multinationals and expects that delays in obtaining information are generally not driven by an unwillingness to provide information, but rather result from the timeframes required to obtain information from within large organisations. 22. The Law Society does not consider that there is sufficient basis for a standalone rule applying to transfer pricing disputes, and that the existing rules provide adequate protection for Inland Revenue. Collection of information 23. It is proposed in paragraph 6.33 of the discussion document that the Commissioner be provided with a direct power to request information or documents that are held by or accessible to a group member that is located outside New Zealand. 4 24. The Law Society considers that Inland Revenue has sufficient ability to collect information from large multinationals under existing rules by virtue of country-by-country (CBC) reporting and automatic exchange of information with other Revenue Authorities. In practice, the Law Society expects that delays in obtaining information are generally a result of New Zealand being a smaller jurisdiction relative to the rest of the world. This can result in a lack of resource within multinational organisations being available to prioritise information requests relating to New Zealand. 25. The Law Society therefore considers that the introduction of specific provisions enabling Inland Revenue to directly request information or documents offshore would be unlikely to result in Inland Revenue receiving information in a timelier manner. As mentioned above, the Law Society anticipates that delays tend to be attributable to the difficulty within large organisations to obtain information requested (particularly in light of the size of New Zealand relative to other jurisdictions that multinationals operate in), rather than as a result of unwillingness by large multinationals to provide information. 26. The Law Society therefore submits that officials reconsider the proposal to increase the Commissioner’s ability to collect information from multinationals, given that:  it is unlikely that this proposal would increase Inland Revenue’s ability to collect information in a more timely manner; and  the introduction of CBC reporting rules and automatic exchanges of information. Penalties for not providing information 27. Paragraph 6.35 of the discussion document proposes that a person may be convicted of an offence for failing to provide information held by an associated offshore group member. This would presumably apply to officers of a New Zealand subsidiary. 28. As discussed above in the context of new administrative measures for non-cooperation and wider information collection powers, New Zealand tends to be a small subsidiary in the context of large multinationals’ operations. Officers and/or directors of New Zealand subsidiaries will often have little or no ability to compel offshore parent companies to provide information. The Law Society therefore considers that it would not be appropriate to impose penalties on New Zealand officers. Requirement to pay disputed taxes early 29. It is proposed in paragraph 6.22 of the discussion document that for large multinationals engaged in particular kinds of disputes, the time at which the tax must be paid should be brought forward. The proposal is said to intend to remove any incentive for a taxpayer to prolong a dispute with Inland Revenue. 30. The reason provided in paragraph 6.21 is not compelling, given that use of money interest (UOMI) would run from the time when the tax should have been paid and penalties would apply to late payments, as it does for any other dispute. The Law Society expects that taxpayers generally do not enter into a dispute with Inland Revenue to delay the payment of tax. Instead, it is likely to be because there is a genuine dispute over the amount of tax payable. 31. It is difficult to see the justification for large multinationals in dispute with Inland Revenue to be treated differently from any other New Zealand taxpayer in this respect. The Law Society 5 considers the UOMI regime to be a strong enough disincentive not to prolong a dispute and is further evidenced by taxpayers using tax pooling services to mitigate UOMI. 32. We also note that section 138I of the Tax Administration Act (TAA) previously required taxpayers to pay 50% of the amount of tax being disputed, which applied for all tax disputes. This requirement was removed on 1 April 2003 as the Government felt that UOMI provided the incentive to ensure that taxpayers do not dispute an amount payable merely to delay payment. To balance the removal of the requirement to pay 50% of the disputed tax, Inland Revenue was given the power under section 138I(2B) to require payment of all the tax in dispute in those rare cases where there is a significant risk that the amount in dispute might never be paid. The Law Society considers that this power (as it was then) should remain effective where there is a real concern from Inland Revenue in respect of their ability to collect tax. 33. The discussion document also proposes in paragraph 6.24 that purchases from a tax pooling service would not be accepted as the payment of tax for the purpose of satisfying payments of disputed taxes. No justification was provided in the discussion document and it is difficult to see any justification for this limitation. 34. Based on the above, the Law Society submits that:  there should be no need to require multinationals to pay disputed tax earlier than any other taxpayer in New Zealand; and  the ability to use tax pooling services should continue to be available to multinationals as it is for other taxpayers in New Zealand. Economic substance approach to transfer pricing 35. As stated in paragraph 5.2 of the discussion document, the proposed new rules would disregard legal form if it does not align with the actual economic substance of the transaction. It is foreseeable that Inland Revenue and taxpayers will continue to have different views on the relevant entities’ economic substance. As such, the Law Society expects that a move to an economic substance approach is still likely to ultimately lead to dispute that would not necessarily be any different to disputes under the current legal form approach. Application dates 36. The discussion document states that the proposed administrative rules would apply from the date of enactment of the legislation and the proposed rules for addressing the source, PE and transfer pricing issues would apply to income years beginning on or after the date of enactment. There was no comment in the discussion paper about transitional or grandfathering rules for existing structures. 37. The Law Society understands from paragraph 3.39 of the discussion document that the ultimate objective of the proposed PE avoidance rule is to discourage non-residents from entering into PE avoidance structures in the first place. However, if the proposed changes are genuinely intended to be a disincentive, officials would presumably expect a number of restructures to occur as a result of the proposed changes. Restructures, particularly in the context of large multinationals, generally take a reasonable amount of time and resources to implement. 6 38. The Law Society therefore submits that provisions for transitional periods should be implemented alongside the proposed new rules in order to allow for large multinationals to consider their structures and implement any changes as a result of the proposed new rules. 39. Paragraph 2.22 notes that nothing in the discussion document is intended to prejudice any of the disputes or investigations that are currently being undertaken by Inland Revenue. However, the Law Society recommends that officials clarify the impact of the proposed transfer pricing rules on existing transfer pricing investigations that Inland Revenue is currently undertaking.

Base erosion and profit shifting A summary of the key policy decisions August 2017 Prepared by Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue, and the Treasury First published in August 2017 by Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue, PO Box 2198, Wellington 6140. CONTENTS 1. Introduction 1 2. Strengthening our interest limitation rules 2 3. Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance 4 4. Addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements 7 1. Introduction 1.1 In September 2016 and March 2017 the Government released three discussion documents that proposed a comprehensive package of law changes to combat base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS): • BEPS – Strengthening our interest limitation rules; • BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance; and • Addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements. 1.2 On 3 August 2017, Ministers announced the Government’s policy decisions on the proposed package of BEPS measures. As part of this announcement the Government proactively released the relevant BEPS Cabinet papers, policy reports and public submissions. For more information see the media statement 1 and background documents. 2 1.3 This document summarises the Government’s key policy decisions. Note that this is a non-exhaustive list – for the details of all the policy decisions see the relevant Cabinet papers. 1 Govt announces BEPS decisions (3 August 2017), available at http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/news/2017-08-03-govt-announces-beps- decisions 2 BEPS – Policy reports, Cabinet papers and regulatory impact assessments (August 2017), available at http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2017-other-beps/overview 1 2. Strengthening our interest limitation rules The Cabinet paper with the details of all the policy decisions is available at http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2017-other-beps/15-cabinet-paper- interest Proposal Summary of submissions Final decision Interest rate cap To limit the interest rate charged by a foreign parent to its New Zealand subsidiary based on the foreign parent’s own credit rating plus a small margin. Almost all submitters did not support this proposal. Their key concerns were that it: • could affect the interest rates of companies with low amounts of debt who are not being aggressive; • could be difficult to apply if the foreign parent has no credit rating; and • is inconsistent with our Double Tax Agreements (DTA) and will result in double taxation. The Government has agreed to replace the interest rate cap proposal with a restricted transfer pricing rule. This approach will usually produce the same result, as it will require the interest rate to: • be in line with the parent’s cost of borrowing on the assumption that the borrower is supported by its foreign parent in the event of a default; and • be set on the basis that it is “vanilla” – disregarding any features or terms that could push up the interest rate. However, the restricted transfer pricing rule has more flexibility compared with the interest rate cap, so it produces more appropriate outcomes in exceptional cases. Thin capitalisation non-debt liability adjustment The amount of debt allowed under thin capitalisation rules is limited to 60 percent of the taxpayer’s “assets”. The proposal was to reduce the taxpayer’s “assets” by the amount of its non-debt liabilities (that is, its liabilities other than interest bearing debt). Many submitters accepted that the treatment of non-debt liabilities needs to change. However, nearly all submitters said deferred tax liabilities should not be counted as a non-debt liability under this new rule. Australia carves out deferred tax from this adjustment. Some submitters suggested that redeemable preference shares and certain classes of derivatives should also be carved out. The Government has agreed to this proposal in principle. Officials will consult further on whether certain types of deferred tax liabilities should be excluded under the new rule. 2 Proposal Summary of submissions Final decision Infrastructure projects To exempt certain infrastructure projects funded entirely with third-party limited recourse loans from interest limitation rules. This exemption recognises that such funding presents little risk of BEPS. Submitters strongly supported this proposal and wrote that it would make New Zealand a more attractive place for Public Private Partnership (PPP) investment. Submitters did make several technical submissions, primarily with a focus on ensuring the exemption works with the various commercial structures adopted by PPPs. The Government has agreed to this proposal in principle. Further consultation with submitters on technical detail is necessary. Removing the net current valuation method for thin capitalisation To remove the ability for a company to use a value for an asset for thin capitalisation purposes that is different from what is used for financial reporting purposes, provided the valuation would be allowable under GAAP. Submitters did not support this change, arguing it would result in high compliance costs. The Government has agreed to modify this proposal to allow taxpayers to retain the ability to use asset values for thin capitalisation that differ from those reported in their financial accounts, but will develop clearer legislative requirements for when this option is used. Removing the option to measure debt and assets at year-end for thin capitalisation To require debt and assets to be valued for thin capitalisation based on average values at the end of every quarter or day. Submitters did not support this change, arguing it would result in high compliance costs. This proposal will not proceed. The Government has instead agreed to develop an anti-avoidance rule that applies when a taxpayer substantially repays a loan just before the end of the year. 3 3. Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance The Cabinet paper with the details of all the policy decisions is available at http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2017-other-beps/17-cabinet-paper- transfer-pricing Proposal Summary of submissions Final decision Permanent establishment avoidance rule The discussion document consulted on a proposed PE avoidance rule to prevent non- residents from structuring their affairs to avoid having a taxable presence (a “permanent establishment” or “PE”) in New Zealand where one exists in substance. The majority of submitters considered that the PE avoidance rule should be more narrowly targeted. They said the rule’s proposed scope: • would widen the PE definition in substance rather than just prevent its abuse. This could breach our DTAs and result in double taxation. • would capture ordinary commercial arrangements and discourage foreign investment. The Government has agreed that the rule should be more narrowly targeted at avoidance arrangements. The Government will consult further with submitters on options to achieve this result. Anti-avoidance source rule To introduce a rule that would deem a non- resident’s income to have a source in New Zealand (and therefore give us a domestic law taxing right) if it had a New Zealand source, treating the non-resident’s multinational group as a single entity. Submitters considered that the proposed anti-avoidance source rule was hard to understand, too broad and should be more targeted at the perceived problem. The Government has agreed that the rule should be more narrowly targeted. The modified rule will broadly provide that, where another group member carries on a non-resident’s business in New Zealand, the non-resident will be deemed to carry on that business itself for the purpose of determining whether its income from New Zealand customers has a New Zealand source. 4 Proposal Summary of submissions Final decision Life insurance The discussion document proposed an amendment to the Income Tax Act 2007 to specifically provide that no deduction is available for the reinsurance of life policies if the premium income on that policy is not taxable in New Zealand (including under a DTA). An amendment to the definition of a FIF was also proposed to specifically provide that New Zealand residents are subject to the FIF rules for any policies that are not subject to New Zealand tax under the life insurance rules or any applicable DTA (currently life policies are not subject to the FIF rules if they are offered or entered into in New Zealand). Submitters considered that the life insurance proposals represented an unfair and unilateral reconstruction of the tax treatment of life insurance premiums and therefore should not proceed. The Government considers that the proposed reinsurance amendments are necessary to ensure that the rules apply as intended and to protect the tax base. However, as there is little revenue at risk for the FIF amendments and a significant likelihood of accidental non-compliance, the Government has decided that the FIF-related amendments should not proceed. Time bar for transfer pricing To extend the time bar limiting Inland Revenue’s ability to adjust a taxpayer’s transfer pricing position from four years to seven years. Submitters argued the time bar should remain at four years because: • A longer time bar increases uncertainty for taxpayers and could delay the timely resolution of disputes. • Other complex areas of tax have a four year time bar. • The taxpayer will be at risk of double tax in jurisdictions where the time bar has already passed. The Government decided that there would be no change to the original proposal. Having a longer time bar for transfer pricing cases is consistent with both Australia and Canada (who also have a special seven year time bar for transfer pricing) and reflects the information asymmetry that exists in transfer pricing cases (especially where taxpayers may hold relevant information offshore). Burden of proof To shift the burden of proof onto the taxpayer for transfer pricing matters. Submitters did not support this proposal and argued that the burden of proof should remain with Inland Revenue. The Government has decided that the burden of proof will be shifted onto the taxpayer for transfer pricing matters. This is consistent with both international practice and other taxation matters under New Zealand’s tax Acts. 5 Proposal Summary of submissions Final decision Power of reconstruction To introduce a rule giving Inland Revenue the power to reconstruct transfer pricing arrangements which are not commercially rational because they include unrealistic terms that would not be agreed to by unrelated parties. This rule was based on Australia’s reconstruction provision. Submitters argued that the test for reconstructing a transfer pricing arrangement should align with the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines. The Government has agreed that the test should be based on the corresponding test in the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines – rather than on the Australian reconstruction provision. Paying tax upfront To require large multinationals to pay disputed tax upfront. Submitters argued that the proposal was unnecessary and should not proceed. This proposal will not proceed. Inland Revenue already charges use-of-money interest on tax owing, which provides a sufficient disincentive for multinationals to prolong disputes. Tax collected from the New Zealand member of a multinational group To introduce a rule that would require a New Zealand member of a multinational group to pay tax owed by a related non- resident group. Submitters argued that the proposal should not proceed as it undermines the separate legal identity of corporate subsidiaries and could pose risk assessment and banking covenant issues for lenders. The Government has decided to proceed with the original proposal. However, it has agreed that the rule should only apply if the non-resident fails to pay the tax itself. Also, the rule should only if the New Zealand member and the non-resident are part of the same wholly owned group. Information collection The discussion document proposed extending Inland Revenue’s information collection powers to allow Inland Revenue to request information held offshore by a related group member. The discussion document also proposed imposing a civil penalty of up to $100,000 (replacing the current $12,000 maximum criminal penalty) on taxpayer that failed to provide requested information. Submitters argued that the information collection proposals should not proceed as the rules were unnecessary in light of enhanced international information sharing protocols (for example, country-by- country reporting), would be unworkable in practice, and would unfairly penalise the New Zealand resident who may not be able to get the information from their multinational group members. Submitters also raised concerns about the new civil penalty, arguing against the increase from $12,000 to $100,000 because the New Zealand subsidiary may not control the relevant information. The Government considers that the information collection powers are necessary to ensure that the multinational group is required to provide Inland Revenue with the information required to determine its tax obligations. There also needs to be appropriate incentives for the multinational to comply with these requests. Further, the consequences of non-compliance with the proposals will be economically borne by the multinational which controls the relevant information. However, the Government has agreed to allow taxpayers to appeal the penalty. 6 4. Addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements The Cabinet paper with the details of all the policy decisions is available at http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2017-other-beps/19-cabinet-paper- hybrids Proposal Summary of submissions Final decision Scope of rules New Zealand will introduce the full suite of OECD recommendations on hybrid and branch mismatches. Some submitters were supportive of New Zealand taking action in line with the OECD hybrids package, but many submitters were in favour of adopting a targeted or phased approach to the OECD hybrids package focused on countering hybrid arrangements that are of most concern to New Zealand. Submitters also argued that the proposals would be complex and would raise the cost of capital in some instances. Some submitters suggested that the rules should incorporate a de minimis to reduce compliance costs. The Government has decided that the best approach is a comprehensive adoption of the OECD recommendations with suitable modifications for the New Zealand context. The Government does not consider that a general de minimis is needed for the hybrid rules. (Although see below as to the specific de minimis for foreign trusts and limited partnerships.) Foreign trusts Foreign trusts will often be a “reverse hybrid” for the purposes of the hybrids rules and so should be subject to tax in New Zealand in certain circumstances. This would effectively eliminate the current non- taxation of foreign trusts (on foreign sourced income) in most cases. Submissions argued that foreign trusts are not actually reverse hybrids. It was also argued that the existing tax treatment of foreign trusts is conceptually appropriate and was confirmed to be so by the Shewan Inquiry (Government Inquiry into Foreign Trust Disclosure Rules). The Government has decided that foreign trusts will be included within the scope of the rules where their treatment outside of New Zealand means income of the trust is not taxed anywhere in the world. A specific de minimis will be provided such that foreign trusts and limited partnerships are not subject to the rules if their foreign-sourced income does not exceed a certain threshold. The application of this rule will be delayed until 1 April 2019 to allow parties affected by this rule more time to assess their options. 7 Proposal Summary of submissions Final decision Foreign branches of New Zealand companies New Zealand companies will not be able to claim deductions for foreign branch losses. Submissions were sought on an active income exemption for branches. In submissions and at subsequent consultation meetings, submitters were concerned about the proposal due to the relatively common structure of a New Zealand company with a simple foreign branch structure (and no ability to offset foreign losses). Submitters generally supported an active income exemption for branches. Submitters also thought a de minimis would be helpful to rule out SMEs with foreign branches. An active income exemption for branches was decided to be outside the scope of the project. This led to a consideration of alternative options in consultation with submitters. The Government has agreed to vary the OECD- recommended initial proposal so that taxpayers who have simple foreign branch structures that do not present a hybrid mismatch problem are not covered by the rules. Regulatory capital No exclusion from the hybrid rules should be made for bank regulatory capital. Submitters argued that bank regulatory capital should be excluded from the scope of the rules. Submitters also argued that if bank regulatory capital is not excluded from the rules, then there should be grandparented treatment for existing regulatory capital. The Government has decided that there will be no general exclusion for regulatory capital. The Government has agreed with submissions in favour of grandparented treatment, meaning that for regulatory capital issued before 6 September 2016 (the date of the discussion document release) current tax treatment will continue until the next call date of the issue. Imported mismatches To introduce an imported mismatch rule to preserve the integrity of the other hybrid mismatch rules, as recommended by the OECD. Submissions argued that the imported mismatch rule is complicated, impractical and is an overreach. The Government has agreed that the imported mismatch rule will be introduced in full, but its application will be deferred for non-structured imported mismatch arrangements until 1 January 2020. 8

The New Zealand tax system and how it compares internationally Prepared by Inland Revenue, October 2017 Contents An overview of tax revenue .................................................................................... 1 Personal income tax .............................................................................................. 3 GST ..................................................................................................................... 6 Company tax ........................................................................................................ 6 Progressivity of the personal tax system .................................................................. 8 Effective marginal tax rates .................................................................................. 10 Administration and compliance.............................................................................. 12 An overview of tax revenue The primary determinant of how much tax revenue is collected is the requirement to fund government expenditure. Figure 1 shows the trend for central government tax revenue. The ratio of revenue to GDP has been relatively stable, increasing slightly in recent years, reflecting the New Zealand economy’s recovery since the global financial crisis. New Zealand collects an amount of tax revenue, relative to GDP, that is close to the average of other OECD countries. Figure 2 shows all tax revenue collected within a country, whether at the level of central, state or local government, as this is the concept most meaningful for international comparisons. It therefore differs from Figure 1 which just shows central government revenue. For the 2015/16 year, central government taxes were 30.5% of GDP and local government taxes were 2.2% of GDP. 1 New Zealand collects a large share of revenue from its three major tax bases: personal income, company income and GST. As shown in Figure 3, more than 90% of our tax revenue is collected from these or similar taxes (including resident and non-resident withholding taxes and fringe benefit tax). New Zealand does not have taxes on transactions or turnover, such as stamp duty and cheque duty, which international tax reviews have identified as being particularly inefficient. Individual income tax, 40.4% Company income tax, 14.8% GST (including customs GST), 31.9% FBT, 0.6% Resident withholding tax, 2.9% Non-resident withholding tax, 0.9% Excise taxes & duties, 6.4% Other, 2.1% Figure 3: New Zealand source of taxation revenue 12 months to June 2016 Source: NZ Treasury 2 Figure 4 puts the composition of taxes in New Zealand in an international perspective. It shows that the three main tax types make up a larger share of total tax revenue than is the norm in other OECD countries. An important part of the reason for our relatively low percentage of “other” taxes is that New Zealand does not have social security taxes. Personal income tax New Zealand’s tax system is based on a broad-base, low-rate (BBLR) framework. Having broad bases means that taxes are applied with few exemptions and concessions. As a consequence, New Zealand raises substantial amounts of tax revenue relative to the tax rates when compared with other countries. Figure 5 shows that New Zealand has a relatively low top personal tax rate. However, another feature demonstrated by Figure 5 is that the New Zealand tax scale is relatively flat. The top tax rate begins to apply at the low level of 1.2 times the average wage. 3 Despite the relatively low top personal marginal tax rate, Figure 6 shows that New Zealand collects the fifth highest amount of personal income tax 1 as a percentage of GDP among OECD countries. The level of revenue raised from personal taxes in part reflects that New Zealand does not allow salary and wage earners to claim deductions for the many employment–related expenses, such as for a home office, equipment or clothing, which can be claimed in other countries. This reduces compliance costs. In addition, we do not provide the large tax incentives for retirement savings found in other countries. 1 In the 2017 Budget, the Government announced changes to the personal income tax thresholds to apply from 1 April 2018. These adjustments are not reflected in Figure 6. 4 A further perspective on New Zealand’s low rate system of taxation is the tax wedge — that is, the average amount of tax that people pay on their labour income, once tax- related transfers are taken into account. Figure 7 shows the average tax wedge in New Zealand and in other countries for a worker on the average wage (in that country). Two figures are shown for each country: a worker with no dependents and one with two dependent children. New Zealand, like almost all other countries, provides assistance through lower effective tax rates for workers with children. (In New Zealand, this is through the transfers received from the Working for Families scheme.) Figure 7 shows that New Zealand has the second-lowest average tax wedge for the average wage earner with no dependent children, and the lowest tax wedge for the worker with two dependent children. New Zealand’s personal tax system levies tax on the first dollar of income while many other countries have a tax free threshold. Our low average tax wedge reflects the absence of other taxes, such as payroll or social security taxes, that many other countries have. 5 GST Despite having the sixth lowest rate of GST 2 , Figure 8 shows that New Zealand’s GST collections amounted to 10% of GDP, the highest proportion in the OECD. The very high amount of tax raised, despite New Zealand’s relatively low rate of tax, mainly reflects the fact that New Zealand’s GST base is particularly broad. However, it also reflects a different tax treatment of government appropriations from other countries. Other OECD countries typically make government departments exempt from GST, whereas New Zealand levies GST on the Government’s appropriations to government departments, but allows departments to claim input credits on their purchases. If New Zealand adopted the more common treatment of making government departments exempt from GST, we estimate it would collect just under 8.5% of GDP in GST. This would mean that New Zealand would collect about the eighth highest amount of GST as a proportion of GDP for the 34 OECD countries shown in Figure 8. Company tax Company tax is New Zealand’s third main tax base. Despite cuts in 2008/09 and 2011/12 to New Zealand’s company tax rate, it is higher than the OECD average, reflecting the international trend to lower rates for company tax, as shown in Figure 9. The Australian rate in Figure 9 is the standard rate; small business entities (turnover less than AUS$10m) have a tax rate of 27.5%. 2 Figure 8 shows the statutory or headline rate for each country. This is the rate at which GST is levied, though in many countries other goods will be taxed at lower rates. 6 In 2015/16, New Zealand collected 4.4% of GDP in company tax, which is the fourth highest in the OECD (see Figure 10 below). This is despite New Zealand having only the tenth highest company tax rate in the OECD. Again, this is testimony to New Zealand’s relatively broad bases in relation to the taxes that it levies. 7 In the realm of company tax, the headline rate does not necessarily tell the full story in terms of the burden of the tax. For instance, New Zealand’s full imputation system means that profits are eventually taxed at shareholders’ marginal rates when dividends are paid. Shareholders can claim tax credits for company taxes that have been paid, which prevents company profits from being double taxed. This leads to a relatively low overall tax rate on corporate profits once they are distributed. Figure 11 shows that New Zealand has the sixth highest proportion across OECD countries where distributed profits are not further taxed in the hands of the shareholders. (The data in Figure 11 is based on shareholders being taxed at the top personal tax rate.) This makes New Zealand a relatively attractive place for entrepreneurs to live and base a business. Progressivity of the personal tax system A progressive tax system levies higher average tax rates on those with higher incomes. In combination with transfer payments such as Working for Families tax credits, working-age welfare benefits, New Zealand superannuation and the Accommodation Supplement, a progressive tax system reduces inequality. (The Government also has redistributive goals for much of its expenditure, for instance on health and education, but this is not considered here.) 8 The Ministry of Social Development 3 has analysed the impact of taxes and transfers by household income deciles. It finds that households in the highest deciles pay the bulk of the income tax – the highest decile pays 35% of all income tax and the lowest four deciles each pay less than 5% of the income tax. Transfers have an opposite pattern – the lowest three deciles receiving a larger share of transfers than the other deciles. The outcome is the lowest four deciles have a negative net tax liability, that is they receive more by way of government cash transfers than they pay in income tax. The net tax liability increases with each of deciles five to ten. A common measure of income equality is the Gini coefficient. With Gini coefficients, the higher the measure, the more unequal the distribution. Figure 12 shows Gini coefficients before and after taxes and transfers. As with other countries, New Zealand’s Gini coefficient after taxes and transfers is lower than its pre-tax Gini coefficient. The tax and transfer system reduces inequality. Figure 12 also shows that New Zealand’s Gini coefficient for disposable income for 2013 is very similar to Australia’s, and both are slightly above the OECD mean. 4 This is the most recent year for which the OECD has comparable international data. The Ministry of Social Development has published more recent data for New Zealand (see footnote 4). This indicates that the New Zealand Gini coefficients have been largely constant since the mid-1990s, following a rise in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Figure 13 shows the percentage reduction in the Gini coefficient across the OECD that arises as a result of taxes and transfer payments. New Zealand’s tax and transfer system provides a similar reduction in measured income inequality to Canada, but a slightly smaller reduction than Australia or the OECD average. 3 Household incomes in New Zealand: Trends in indicators of inequality and hardship 1982 to 2016 Prepared by Bryan Perry, Ministry of Social Development, Wellington, July 2017 4 A much more extensive discussion of Gini coefficients and other measures of inequality is included in the Ministry of Social Development’s 2016 Household Incomes Report Ministry of Social Development, Wellington August 2016. There are minor differences in the methodologies used by the Ministry of Social Development and the OECD . 9 There are a number of reasons why Gini coefficients are an imperfect measure of inequality, especially in international comparisons. For instance, the way that unemployment benefits or pensions are calculated, or the impact of the dividend imputation regime, will affect measures of how the tax and transfer system affects inequality, without necessarily providing a good reflection of progressivity. For example, New Zealand superannuation is provided at the same level for all eligible superannuitants, whereas in many other countries the level of superannuation benefits is tied to lifetime contributions. This means that from a lifetime perspective, New Zealand superannuation is highly progressive even though, because superannuitants tend to have low incomes, retirement income payments in other countries appear to be doing more to redistribute income. Another factor is how “income distributions” are calculated. In New Zealand, Ball and Creedy found that Gini coefficients based on consumption data do not display the increase in inequality from the 1980s to 2010s that is suggested by Gini coefficients based on incomes. 5 Effective marginal tax rates When additional income is earned, a household only gets to keep a fraction of it, because some part may go in tax and other parts may go in abating benefits. The effective marginal tax rate (EMTR) measures the total impact of taxes and loss of benefits when an additional dollar of income is earned. It adds together the extra tax paid and the loss of benefits. 5 Christopher Ball and John Creedy, “Inequality in New Zealand 1983/84 to 2013/14”, Working Paper 15/06 (Wellington: New Zealand Treasury, 2015) 10 High EMTRs can significantly reduce incentives to work more or save, because large increases in before-tax income will only result in small increases in disposable income. This can have an adverse impact on economic efficiency, because it deters people from doing what would be sensible in the absence of tax. Recent estimates of EMTRs for New Zealand are in Table 1. These EMTRs include personal income tax rates, ACC levies, and a wide range of benefits that affect the disposable income available to the individual. They do not, however, include all such benefits. The Accommodation Supplement is not included. Because it abates at 25%, not including it will have lowered the estimated EMTRs. Table 1: Effective marginal tax rates faced by individuals (Y ear ended 31 March 2018 modelled on 2016 incomes, includes tax, ACC earner premium, benefit abatement, Working for Families, child support, & student loans.) EMTR faced Percentage of taxpayers Number of taxpayers Median income (closest $1,000) Less than 30% 58.3% 2,127,950 $17,000 30-39% 34.8% 1,272,350 $68,000 40-49% 3.2% 115,350 $35,000 50-59% 2.4% 88,900 $60,000 More than 60% 1.3% 47,350 $22,000 Source: Inland Revenue Although some taxpayers do face high EMTRs, they are the minority. Only 7% of taxpayers face EMTRS of over 40%, and only 4% face EMTRs of over 50%. 6 Nonetheless, many of those who face very high EMTRs of over 60% have relatively low incomes. Although New Zealand has high EMTRs for some, compared with other OECD countries, New Zealand has low EMTRs overall. The OECD has modelled EMTRs for different household types at different income levels. Table 2 shows the New Zealand EMTRs compared with the OECD average.

Excluding student lo an repayments and chil d support fro m the model would lo wer the EMTRs from those in Table 1. 11 Administration and compliance How easy it is for taxpayers to comply with their obligations, and how the tax system is administered, are important in determining the overall effectiveness of the tax system. There are few international comparisons of compliance costs that include New Zealand. Evans and Tran-Nam (2014) 7 provide warnings about difficulties in making international comparisons, but conclude that compliance costs for New Zealand individuals and small- medium enterprises (SMEs) are likely to be low by international standards. They comment that New Zealand may be atypical in bucking the worldwide trend of increasing compliance costs for SMEs. They suggest that New Zealand’s key strengths are its very lean business environment and relatively simple tax legislation. Their conclusions are supported by Inland Revenue’s most recent survey of SME compliance cost. Conducted in 2016, this found that the median annual time SMEs spent meeting their business tax obligations was 27 hours, a 25% reduction from the 36 hours reported in the previous 2013 survey. The amount they spent on external tax professionals—tax agents, lawyers, and accountants—also declined between the two surveys, and was 10% lower in 2016 compared with 2013. Survey respondents attributed the decline in compliance costs to better customer service by Inland Revenue, less paperwork and more digital filing, and improved online services. The World Bank and PricewaterhouseCoopers regularly survey how easy it is for companies to pay taxes in countries around the world. The most recent survey was based on conditions that prevailed in 2015 and looked at how many hours it takes a representative company to file its taxes, and also how easy it is to undertake a series of post-filing tasks (such as claiming a GST refund or appealing a tax assessment). Table 3 shows New Zealand’s rank among OECD countries and across the 190 countries worldwide that were surveyed. The table also shows the overall result for ease of paying taxes—this factor includes the influence of the level of the corporate tax rate, which is not strictly a cost of compliance measure. Table 3: Ease of paying company taxes (2015) New Zealand’s ranking under various measures Ranking in the OECD Ranking in the World Hours to file taxes 15 th 50 th Ease of post-filing tasks 3 rd 12 th Overall 4 th 11 th Source: Price Waterhouse Coopers www.pwc.com/gx/en/paying-taxes/pdf/pwc-paying- taxes-2017.pdf Consistency and predictability of the tax system are rated by the private sector as being particularly important. New Zealand has had a BBLR tax framework and a reasonably stable set of tax policies since the mid-1980s. Deloitte released the Asia Pacific Tax Complexity Survey Report in early 2017 8 , in which 92% of survey respondents said that New Zealand’s tax system is consistent, and 87% that it is predictable. (Australia scores were 80% and 83%). These results contribute to New Zealand being perceived as a good place to invest. 7 Evan s, C. and Tran -N am, B., 20 14, Tax compli an ce costs in New Zealan d: An int ernatio nal comparat ive evaluatio n, Paper present ed to the Conference Tax Administr at io n in the 21 st Century, Welli ngto n, June 20 14, Available at http://nzpublicfinance.com/tax-administrat ion-conferen ce/. 8 https://www2.deloitte.com/nz/asia-pac-tax-survey 12 Figure 14 provides a perspective on the administrative costs of revenue collection. It illustrates the average cost of collecting revenue for OECD countries, and suggests New Zealand is neither high nor low cost. International comparisons regarding administrative costs are difficult because revenue authorities have different responsibilities , which makes like-with-like comparisons difficult (for example, Inland Revenue administers KiwiSaver but does not collect excise duties). Also, intuitively, one would expect larger countries or more highly taxed countries to achieve lower ratios, irrespective of the underlying efficiency of the revenue-collection processes. 13

(c) The Parties agree that IR may dispense with the notice requirement under section 96Q in order to immediately suspend payment to an individual of all or part of an interim instalment of a credit of tax under subparts MA to MF and MZ of the Income Tax Act 2007 when IR identifies a discrepancy between Information shared and information supplied to IR if, before or immediately after the decision to suspend, IR gives a written notice to the individual that: Page 7 of 16 (i) provides details of the discrepancy and the suspension of payment of the credit of tax and any other Adverse Action which IR proposes to take; and (ii) states that the individual has 5 Working Days from the receipt of the notice to show cause why payment of the credit of tax ought not to have been suspended or why the Adverse Action should not be taken, or both— and the other Adverse Action must not be taken until expiration of those 5 Working Days. (d) The Adverse Actions that the Parties may take under this Agreement are specified at Schedule 2. 7.

Making Tax Simpler: A Government Green Paper on the Future Direction of Tax Administration Portfolio Purpose Finance / Revenue This paper seeks agreement to release a government green paper on the future of the New Zealand tax administration system. Previous Consideration Summary On 2 March 2015, Cabinet agreed to the government’s revenue strategy, and noted that the tax policy work programme has been designed to implement that strategy \[CAB Min (15) 6/9\]. Policy work to support the modernising of the tax administration system is a significant aspect of the tax policy work programme. The attached government green paper, which builds on a draft working paper that was produced as part of a 2014 conference on “Tax Administration for the 21st Century”, is the start of this aspect of the programme. The government green paper describes some of the policy areas of tax administration that will need to be examined to ensure the tax system is fit for purpose. It seeks feedback on whether the policy direction for modernising and simplifying the tax administration system is heading in the right direction - it will therefore help to identify any errors or omissions of scope before more detailed policy work is undertaken. The government green paper makes the following assumptions: • key tax bases will remain substantially in place, based on the broad-base low-rate (BBLR) tax framework; • social policy and other non-tax functions currently administered by Inland Revenue (eg relating to Working for Families, child support, student loans and KiwiSaver) will continue to be a key part of Inland Revenue’s portfolio of work; • the use of technology and the implementation and delivery of digital services is a key enabler to ensure the policy direction is realised. The diagram on page 5 depicts the key elements upon which the policy direction described in the government green paper (and in the associated discussion document on Better Digital Services) is based. Regulatory Not required. Impact Analysis 245752v1IN CONFIDENCE1 IN CONFIDENCEEGI (15) 65 Baseline None. Implications Legislative None from this paper. Implications Timing Issues The government green paper will be released on or after 31 March 2015, for an eight week consultation period. Appendix 1 on page 12 details the specific topics and indicative timing for the release of future green papers. Announcement The Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue will announce the release of the government green paper at an appropriate event. The government green paper will be accompanied by an internet-based public consultation forum (extracts are attached), and it will be linked to the associate consultation on providing digital services. Consultation Paper prepared by Inland Revenue. MBIE, DIA, Education, ACC, SSC, Statistics, Customs and MSD were consulted. DPMC was informed. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s transformation reference group and the Taxpayers’ Simplification Panel were also consulted. The Minister of Revenue indicates that a number of Ministers were consulted, and that discussion is not required with the government caucus and has been undertaken with other parties represented in Parliament. The Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue recomm end that the Committee: 1 note the contents of the government green paper Making Tax Simpler: A Government Green Paper on Tax Administration (the government green paper), attached to the submission under EGI (15) 65; 2 note that the purpose of the government green paper is to seek feedback on whether the policy direction for modernising and simplifying the tax administration system is heading in the right direction, and to identify any errors or omissions of scope before more detailed work is undertaken; 3 agree to the release of the government green paper and associated material for public consultation, subject to any minor or editorial changes that may be authorised by the Minister of Revenue; 4 invite the Minister of Revenue to report back to the Cabinet Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee on feedback received from the consultation, and on whether there is general acceptance of the direction outlined in the government green paper to modernise the tax administration system.

We seek the agreement of the Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee to release a Government green paper on the future of the New Zealand tax administration system. Executive summary 2. The Government green paper describes some of the policy areas of tax administration that will need to be examined to ensure the tax system is fit for purpose as we progress through the 21st century. The document indicates the key areas where change may be required to frame and enable Inland Revenue’s business transformation programme in modernising and simplifying tax administration. 3. The document is the first in a series of documents that will be released over the next few years. This green paper seeks feedback on the overall direction of potential changes and aims to identify any errors or omissions in scope before more detailed policy analysis is undertaken. 4. In conjunction with the release of this document, the Minister of Revenue is also seeking Cabinet’s agreement to release a discussion document which considers whether the current policy and legislative framework facilitates the implementation and delivery of secure digital services (see Cabinet paper titled Making Tax Simpler - Better Digital Services discussion document). Objectives 5. The purpose of the business transformation programme is to design a tax system that makes it easier and simpler for New Zealanders to interact with Government, contributing to the goals of providing better public services. A modem tax system that is simple to comply with will mean less effort is required from New Zealanders and New Zealand businesses in managing their tax and social policy affairs, boosting overall compliance. Costs to the Government of administering the tax system should be kept to a minimum. 6. A flexible tax system that utilises existing business processes will mean lower compliance costs. This means that people can spend less time on tax and more time on 2 running their businesses, supporting our wider goal to build a competitive and productive economy as part of the Business Growth Agenda. 7. These objectives will be achieved by: • making it easier and less expensive for businesses and other customers to meet their tax and social policy obligations, boosting overall levels of compliance; • increasing certainty through easy access to information, earlier and simpler transactions, timely and effective resolution of issues, obligations being met through normal business processes, improved response times and tailored interactions; • providing value for money for the Government through reduced administration costs, and more efficient collection of debt; • re-using data across Government, where appropriate; • increased use of digital services by both Inland Revenue and its customers; • ensuring that the integrity of the tax and social policy system is maintained by identifying key policy concerns and audit risks easily; and • providing flexibility for future changes. 8. To begin the dialogue Inland Revenue, in conjunction with the Treasury and Victoria University, hosted a conference called, “Tax Administration for the 21st century” in July 2014. 9. As part of the conference officials produced a draft working paper that outlined, at a very high level, a vision of some specific policy changes that could frame and support Inland Revenue’s business transformation programme. The draft green paper attached to this Cabinet paper takes that draft working paper a step further in order to test its underlying assumptions. The future for business 10. The first building block is to streamline the collection of PAYE, GST and related information and integrate these obligations into business processes. This will reduce the compliance costs for businesses as “withholders” on behalf of others. The timely provision of data through the use of electronic and internet based technology is a key enabler to improve the tax system. Our understanding from industry sources is that over 50 per cent of small to medium enterprises (SMEs) use some form of accounting software. 11. Key benefits for business include: • reduced tax compliance costs in particular for small and medium enterprises; • greater speed and predictability in businesses’ tax affairs; • a two-way transfer of information between business’s own systems (e.g. payroll) and Inland Revenue, meaning that tax compliance obligations are being met as part of a business’s normal processes; and • errors being avoided in the first place or rectified in near real time. 12. Businesses not only withhold tax on behalf of others, but also pay tax on the income they earn. The green paper seeks feedback on how to simplify calculations for provisional tax, so that they are based on real-time information (for example when using approved accounting software), and the use of payment options that better reflect taxpayers’ cash flows. It also seeks feedback on other business tax related issues the Government should focus on from a tax administration perspective. 3 13. Another focus is on ensuring it is easy for small businesses to comply with their tax obligations improving overall levels of compliance. Tailoring interactions to ensure the right support is available at the right time and the use of improved technology and business systems should be encouraged, making it easy to comply right from the start and hard not to. The future for individuals 14. For individual taxpayers, it is envisaged that in the future: • taxpayers will be able to quickly and easily satisfy their tax obligations via digital channels; • Inland Revenue will pre-populate online income tax returns and, for the majority of individuals, any interaction will involve just confirming income sources and amounts; • those with income sources that by their nature do not make it possible to pre-populate returns, amounts from these income sources would be the only additional information required from those individuals; • refunds will be made quickly and, in most cases, automatically (based on better use of data and analytics); and • any outstanding tax debts will be recovered proactively through automatic withholding from existing income sources, where appropriate. The future for social policy 15. The intention is to design a social policy system that works for the customer and is fit for purpose. It should have many of the advantages that individual taxpayers will receive, such as pre-population of information Inland Revenue or government already holds. It should also match the timeliness of payments to the need to receive (or ability to pay) on a more real­ time basis, providing increased certainty for individuals and families. The policy and legislative framework 16. As part of business transformation, key administration and legal issues that frame and underpin much of New Zealand’s tax system need to be considered. Changes to the way that taxpayers interact with Inland Revenue through better use of technology provides an opportunity to consider fundamental aspects of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (the TAA) including the roles of the Commissioner, of taxpayers and third parties, and information sharing and secrecy. Background 17. Having a good overall tax system means having both good tax policies and a good administrative system; these two elements go hand in hand. In addition, the perception of fairness, together with the ease with which taxpayers can actually comply with their obligations, is also very important in assessing the overall effectiveness of a tax system. 4 18. New Zealand’s tax policies are held in high regard internationally.1 A number of independent domestic reviews have also been undertaken in recent years and have fundamentally supported the policy settings that frame New Zealand’s tax system. 19. Business transformation is a long-term programme to consider different ways of delivering the tax and social policy system. To frame and support the programme, a review of the current policy and legislative settings is required. Modernising the tax administration system includes re-shaping the way Inland Revenue works with taxpayers, and looking at possible changes to, amongst other pieces of legislation, the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). 20. Business transformation will enable Inland Revenue to become a modem revenue organisation that is recognised for service and excellence and: • is agile, effective and efficient; • enables customers to self-manage with speed and certainty, thereby reducing compliance costs; • enables the Government to make timely policy changes; and • works with other agencies to optimise interaction across government. 21. Business transformation will be delivered in four customer-focused stages over a period of approximately eight years. In April 2014 (CBC (14) 2 refers) we advised that the first stage of the programme would be delivered in three major work streams: • strategic; • tactical; and • foundational. 22. The strategic work stream includes policy work to identify legislative barriers to providing digital services, and streamlining the collection of PAYE and GST information. 23. The following diagram depicts the key elements upon which the policy direction described in this Government green paper and the digital services paper (being concurrently considered by this Cabinet committee), is based. 1 See, for example: Deloitte’s 2014 Asia Pacific Tax Complexity Survey Report ihtto://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/T ax/dttl-tax-ap-2014-tax- comnlexitv-survev.pdf) Washington DC Tax Foundation’s 2014 international tax competitiveness index (see http://taxfoundation.org/article/2014-intemational-tax-competitiveness-index) For example the M cLeod Review in 2001 and, more recently, the Tax Working Group in 2010 5 INDIVIDUALS1 TAX OBLIGATIONS e.g. More pre-population of the income resulting from improved collection of withholding tax information OTHER WITHHOLDING TAX REGIMES SUCH AS RESIDENT WITHHOLDING TAX e.g. Streamline the collection of other withholding tax information - integrating tax obligations into business processes PAYE e.g. Streamline the collection of PAYE, GST and related information - integrate tax obligations into business process DIGITAL SERVICES REVIEW BROADER TAX ADMINISTRATION LEGISLATIVE AND POLICY SETTINGS TO FRAME AND SUPPORT THE BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION PROGRAMME tiiViZ r Figure 1 24. The attached Government green paper is the first in a series of papers that will be released over the next two years. The series will build on aspects of the proposals contained in the attached green paper. Appendix A details the specific topics and indicative timing for the release of future green papers. The Government’s Tax Policy Work Programme 25. Cabinet recently approved the release of the Government’s tax policy work programme for the next 18 months (CAB Min (15) 6/9 refers). The policy work to support the modernisation of the tax administration system is a significant aspect of the work programme. The release of the attached Government green paper is the start of that aspect of the delivery of our tax policy work programme. Key assumptions 26. Some key assumptions have been made during the early consideration of the policy issues that are likely to underpin Inland Revenue’s business transformation. These include the following: • key tax bases will remain substantially in place based on the broad-base low-rate (BBLR) tax framework2; • social policy and other non-tax functions currently administered by Inland Revenue (for example, in relation to Working for Families, child support, student loans and KiwiSaver) will continue to be a key part of Inland Revenue’s portfolio of work; and TAX TYPE RATIONALISATION. WHERE APPROPRIATE BUSINESS TAX OBLIGATIONS e.g. Review and streamline the collection of business taxes such as provisional tax - integrating tax obligations into business processes SOCIAL POLICY eg. Review and streamline the delivery of social ossistanceproducts such as Working h r Families Tax Credits 2 BBLR ensures that as broad a range o f income and expenditure as practicable is taxed at rates that are as low as possible. A BBLR system helps keep administration and compliance costs low, and keeps economic distortions to a minimum. 6 • the use of technology and the implementation and delivery of digital services is a key enabler to ensure the policy direction is realised. The future for business Employment income (PA YE) 27. As highlighted in figure 1 streamlining the collection of PAYE information is a key strategic element to modernising the administration of the tax system. Doing so will lead to a reduction in compliance costs for businesses. 28. PAYE is a withholding regime for salary and wages. A business that employs staff has certain obligations imposed on it, including the deduction of tax and ACC levies for each employee each payday.3 PAYE information is received monthly from employers (or intermediaries) through the employer monthly schedule (EMS). 29. The Government green paper considers three main issues in relation to employment income: • the collection of PAYE information; • modernisation of the PAYE rules more generally; and • enhancing withholding taxes to cover ‘employment like’ income. 30. The collection of PAYE information is still largely paper based. The shift to digital channels as part of business transformation provides an opportunity to: • make better use of businesses natural systems to provide information; • improve the timeliness and accuracy of information received; • reduce the level of duplication, correction and other interventions required by employers, intermediaries or Inland Revenue before the information can be effectively used; • improve the use of available information from an all-of-govemment perspective; and • consider the types of information necessary to ensure the tax administration system operates effectively. 31. The same approach should be adopted for the collection of GST information. Expanding the withholding regime 32. Withholding regimes are an effective means to collect income tax and are generally considered to be the foundation of an efficient tax administration system. As business transformation envisages a future where taxpayers’ systems are able to interact with Inland Revenue’s system there is an opportunity to expand the withholding regime to cover a wider range of situations that are similar to employment - such as independent contractors and particular industries. 33. There could be some resistance from businesses on the idea of extending the withholding regime. However, for the reasons referred to in paragraph 32, we consider it is worth testing the likely reaction through the release of the attached green paper. 3 The ACC levy is incorporated into the amount o f PAYE the employer deducts. 7 Business tax 34. The tax system needs to focus on speed, accuracy, certainty, predictability and low business risk in business taxation matters. Businesses have also raised issues with the provisional tax rules. The green paper asks for specific feedback on the key administration issues we should be focusing on to meet business expectations. 35. The green paper also specifically seeks feedback on ways to improve the provisional tax rules. Businesses are required to pay income tax on their profits. The exact amount of tax that a business is required to pay for each year is only able to be determined after that year has finished. The provisional tax rules ensure that tax is paid throughout the year, rather than at the end of the year. 36. The Government green paper sets out some possible ways to achieve a more effective or more certain method for calculating and paying provisional tax, and in particular, it looks at how provisional tax could be better aligned to other business processes. 37. Any review of the provisional tax rules would have to consider changing the current rules excluding some taxpayers from use of money interest on provisional tax payments (referred to as “safe harbour taxpayers”) to reflect new payment calculations and re-consider how use of money interest would apply. 38. One idea explored in the document is that the calculation and payment of business income tax could be done more “on account” as income is earned during the year - much like PAYE for individuals. This has the potential to simplify the calculation of provisional tax and create more certainty for taxpayers. 39. Many small businesses have difficulty in meeting their tax obligations. Therefore, there is a real focus on how Inland Revenue can be more proactive and sophisticated in its approach to providing advice at the right time, and to encourage the use of improved business systems to ensure the first few years of a business’s lifecycle are successful. We are seeking feedback on what other business tax related issues the Government should focus on from a tax administration perspective. Withholding taxes on capital income 40. A review of the current resident withholding tax (RWT) rules should build on improvements arising from more effective and streamlined collection of PAYE information. The green paper considers ways to enhance the provision of information about RWT arising from interest and dividends by integration into existing business processes - similar to the process envisaged for an improved PAYE information gathering process as described in paragraph 10 above. 41. Inland Revenue currently receives RWT information from financial institutions on an annual basis. However, the annual system does not allow for the timely provision of data and is therefore not used to its full potential. Administration and compliance costs are correspondingly high. 8 42. The green paper therefore seeks feedback on how best to integrate RWT into business processes, so that upfront validation of information is the norm, ensuring accuracy as much as possible. The future for individuals 43. Streamlined PAYE and withholding tax mechanisms (as discussed above) are the building blocks on which an individual’s experience of the tax system will be based. 44. A policy decision was made in the 1990s to remove the requirement to file income tax returns for as many individuals as possible. However, this approach has created inconsistency in the tax administration system between taxpayers who are not required to file, those who are, and those who choose to file in favourable circumstances (for example, to claim a refund). Significant numbers of individuals are now either required to file or are choosing to file returns. The rules can now also appear arbitrary and complex, which leads to fairness concerns. 45. A key consideration is whether it is still desirable to keep as many individuals as possible from actively interacting with the tax system. The Government green paper explores the possibility of Inland Revenue providing more extensive pre-populated information on tax returns for individual taxpayers. The only action required from the majority of taxpayers would be to check and confirm their details and, where applicable, report other income such as overseas income for which there was no deduction at source. 46. A practical difficulty with this approach is getting effective withholding rates in place, and minimising the costs involved in squaring up liabilities and refunds. The trade-off when seeking more accuracy is the resulting increase in compliance costs for the withholder and administrative costs for Inland Revenue. 47. However, technology may help by making end of year square ups much less costly. The future for social policy 48. Social policies administered by Inland Revenue such as Working for Families and child support generally operate within the tax system which operates on a yearly basis. Some Working for Families and child support customers will go into debt, or are already in debt unnecessarily because Inland Revenue holds out-of-date information about them or their family. When circumstances change throughout the year, these customers are required to contact Inland Revenue. This means that customers may need to contact Inland Revenue multiple times or they may make no contact at all. Neither outcome is optimal. 49. The intent is to design a social policy system that works for the customer and is fit for purpose. The system needs to reflect the family’s circumstances and income (and therefore need) to ensure payments reflect that need. 50. Reviewing the administration of social policies includes consideration of the efficacy of the annual cycle and making greater use of information from other sources. More accurate timely and regular receipt of information is likely to be facilitated by advances in technology Debt prevention will be a key benefit arising from improvements in the administration of social policy. 9 The policy and legislative framework for tax administration 51. Finally, business transformation requires consideration of key tax administration and legal issues that frame and underpin much of New Zealand’s tax system. Changes to the way that taxpayers interact with Inland Revenue through digital services provide an opportunity to consider fundamental aspects of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). These issues are: • the roles of Parliament, the Commissioner, the taxpayer and third parties in tax administration; • whether the Commissioner’s current role is appropriately legislated for when considering the future tax administration environment; • principles underpinning information and secrecy; • the suitability of the penalty, disputes and binding rulings regimes in the future environment; • record keeping and time bars in the future environment; and • the legislative structure of the tax Acts. Impact on taxpayers, including Government agencies 52. Modernising the tax administration system will have implications for taxpayers, including Government agencies. There will be short term implementation costs to achieve the long term gains of reduced compliance and administration costs. 53. The cumulative impact of both legislative change and changes to business processes will need to be carefully managed to ensure that businesses are not faced with successive changes through each stage of business transformation. Proposed timeline 54. Subject to Cabinet approval, we propose to release the Government green paper for public consultation on or after 31 March 2015, with an eight week consultation period. Officials will analyse the submissions and the Minister of Revenue will report back to Cabinet on feedback received and whether there is general acceptance of the direction as outlined in the paper for modernising the tax administration system. Consultation 55. Officials have consulted with the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, the Department of Internal Affairs (DIA), the Ministry of Education, the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC), the State Services Commission, Statistics New Zealand, the New Zealand Customs Service and the Ministry of Social Development. The Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet were informed on the proposals in the Government green paper. Officials also discussed the scope of the discussion document with the Commissioner’s Transformation Reference Group and the Taxpayers’ Simplification Panel. 56. Feedback from agencies has been supportive of the policy direction contained in the document and all who responded have expressed a desire to be further consulted. Our officials will continue to work with them over the course of the policy development process. ACC and DIA provided the following specific references for inclusion in the Green Paper: 1 0 • treating information as an asset; • Result Areas 9 and 10; and • ACC’s dependence on Inland Revenue’s information. Financial implications 57. The release of the Government green paper does not give rise to any financial implications. Human rights 58. There are no human rights implications associated with the release of the Government green paper. Legislative implications 59. The draft Government green paper does not suggest any immediate legislative implications. However, legislative changes will be necessary if Cabinet subsequently decides to implement any of the potential changes identified. 60. The Minister of Revenue intends to introduce a bill titled Taxation (Business Transformation and Simplification) mid-year which will signal the start of modernising and simplifying the tax administration system. The bill will focus on reducing compliance costs for small to medium enterprises. Regulatory impact analysis 61. Officials advise that the substantive regulatory impact analysis elements have been included in the draft green paper at a level that is appropriate given the stage of the policy development process. Regulatory Impact Statements will be prepared, if required, when policy decisions are sought. Publicity 62. We intend to announce the release of the draft Government green paper at an appropriate event to be determined in due course. The Government green paper will be accompanied by an internet-based public consultation forum. It will set out a summary of the proposals and seek views on the same questions raised in the green paper. It will be linked to the internet-based public consultation on providing digital services. Extracts of the internet- based consultation are attached. Recommendations 63. We recommend that the Cabinet Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee: 1. Note the contents of the attached Government green paper Making Tax Simpler: A Government Green Paper on Tax Administration. 2.

Making Tax Simpler: Better Digital Services - A Government Discussion Document Portfolio Revenue Purpose This paper seeks agreement to release a government discussion document on how the tax system can be improved using digital services. Previous On 5 November 2014, the Cabinet Committee on State Sector Reform and Consideration Expenditure Control: • approved the commencement of the design of the future revenue system; • agreed to advance the implementation of early improvements in digital services for customers in support of digital interactions with the government. \[SEC Min (14) 15/2\] Summary Enabling digital services within the tax administration system is a key building block for Inland Revenue’s business transformation programme. The attached discussion document seeks feedback on a proposed set of principles and options to facilitate the implementation of better digital services. The suggested principles and options would: • provide reassurance and confidence to customers that the key focus of future digital services is to deliver better customer experiences; • encourage customers to move to better digital services over time, by providing specific assistance to some customers, while retaining non-digital alternatives for those who cannot adopt digital services; • in some circumstances, require some customers that deal with the tax information of others (eg tax intermediaries) to use digital services for some transactions where they are able to do so; • ensure tax legislation is technology-agnostic. The Minister of Revenue will report back to EGI following the consultation process, with a view to including the necessary legislation in the Tax (November) Bill. Regulatory Not required.

This paper seeks the agreement of the Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee to the release of a government discussion document (and the launch of accompanying internet-based consultation) on how the tax system can be improved using digital services. A better tax administration system needs to take full advantage of electronic and internet technology, and, more importantly, provide services designed with customers at the centre. Moving to better digital services in the tax administration system aligns with Government’s digital strategy to achieve better public services. The discussion document proposes a set of principles ensuring the better digital services will meet customers’ needs, and proposes options to facilitate customers move to better digital services. 2. This Cabinet paper is presented to the Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee alongside a Cabinet paper that seeks agreement for release of another discussion document. The discussion document attached to this present paper deals with a specific aspect of the transformation programme - the adoption of digital services by Inland Revenue’s customers. The other discussion document sets out the overall vision for Inland Revenue’s transformation programme. 3. Enabling digital services within the tax administration system is a key building block for Inland Revenue’s business transformation programme. The concepts for digital services set out in the attached paper provide the foundation for further detailed policy proposals that will be presented to Cabinet in the next two to three years. Executive summary 4. Most New Zealanders are already enjoying the benefits of digital services in personal and business interactions, and they expect public-sector agencies to meet the same standards as the private sector. 5. Government has agreed in principle to a long-term business transformation programme to look at different ways of delivering tax and social policy. Part of this programme’s vision is a future tax administration system that offers a wider range of secure digital services for greater customer convenience, and for tax interactions to be built into customers’ life events and business transactions. This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to modernise and simplify the tax administration system to meet 21st-century needs. 2 6. I propose to release a government discussion document that sets out a range of principles and options to deliver better customer experience using digital services, and makes suggestions to ensure tax legislation can facilitate the implementation of better digital services. The draft discussion document is attached. 7. The suggested principles and options would: • provide reassurance and confidence to customers that the key focus of future digital services is to deliver better customer experience; • encourage customers to move to better digital services over time, by providing specific assistance to some customers, while retaining non-digital alternatives for those who cannot adopt digital services; • in some circumstances, require some customers to use digital services for certain transactions where they are able to do so and where society as a whole would benefit from their move to digital services; and • ensure tax legislation is technology-agnostic. 8. I expect that some customers will raise concerns about the potential requirement to use digital services for some interactions with Inland Revenue. Background 9. In April 2013, Cabinet agreed the case for change for Inland Revenue’s business transformation programme \[SEC Min (13) 4/4 and CAB Min (13) 10/4 refer\]. Cabinet also approved in principle the overall investment objectives and agreed that modernising the revenue system through business process re-engineering, supported by new technology is the preferred way forward. The first stage of the business transformation programme includes enabling secure digital services. 10. In November 2014 \[CAB Min (14) 15/2\], Cabinet agreed to the commencement of the design of the future revenue system. Problem 11. Despite successful delivery of digital services in some areas, Inland Revenue faces significant limitations on its ability to deliver the services that customers want. Customers often: • have difficulty accessing and using Inland Revenue information they need; • find Inland Revenue’s transactional processes overly time-consuming, disconnected and confusing; • regularly use multiple service delivery channels to undertake one transaction; • are uncertain whether they have done the right thing; and • are frustrated that information is not shared and is inconsistent, across Inland Revenue’s different services and more widely across government. 12. The limitations described above are largely a consequence of Inland Revenue’s twenty- five year old core technology which was designed around processing paper returns. In addition, Inland Revenue’s role has been expanded from simply collecting tax to the delivery of social policies such as student loan repayments, Working for Families tax credits and KiwiSaver. Adding social policy services to technology that is twenty-five years old has resulted in an extremely complex inter-twined system, which is expensive, risky and time- consuming to modernise. 3 13. The delivery of tax administration and social policy services above through digital channels is complex. Inland Revenue’s customers are highly diversified; their needs, and their ability and desire to use digital services differ across types of customers and interactions. Some customers do not have sufficient knowledge or skill to use digital services or have no access to digital technology. Other customers will have the ability to use digital services but choose not to for a variety of reasons. 14. Current tax legislation, such as the Tax Administration Act 1994, was largely developed around a paper-based environment. For example, the phrases “by post” and “in writing” have been frequently used in current tax legislation. Comment Proposals in discussion document 15. The draft discussion document proposes a set of principles to ensure digital services can meet customers’ needs. I seek public views on these principles and whether others should be included. The principles include: • Services must be designed with the customer at the centre (an overriding principle). • No one size fits all; a wide range of digital services will be required, and digital services may not be appropriate for complex transactions. • Tax compliance and access to entitlements are critical. • Changes will be imposed only after costs and benefits have been considered. 16. The document further proposes a range of tailored approaches to encourage customers to adopt digital services. These are outlined in the following paragraphs. 17. Services will be digital by default for new taxpayers or existing customers taking on new products. 18. Inland Revenue will offer specific assistance for customers who do not have the knowledge or skills to use digital services, or the ability to access them. 19. Inland Revenue will continue to provide non-digital alternatives for customers who are unable to use digital services. 20. There will be some customers who could move to digital services for appropriate transactions but will choose not to. This group is expected to be small, as most customers are expected to choose to adopt new digital services in order to receive the benefits of convenience, speed and certainty that the digital services will deliver. Where the adverse impact of those customers not adopting digital services falls on the customers themselves and on Inland Revenue’s systems, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue is likely to use her existing powers to support, encourage, and in some instances require those customers to adopt digital services for certain transactions. 21. Some customers who could move to digital services for appropriate transactions but choose not to, are dealing with the tax information of others, and therefore the impact of their decision could fall on others. Examples could include tax intermediaries who provide tax information about their clients to Inland Revenue, or employers who are required to provide PAYE information about their employees to Inland Revenue. As Inland Revenue’s transformation programme progresses, the level of service offered to those clients or 4 employees is expected to significantly improve, but in some instances will be contingent on Inland Revenue receiving information about them through digital channels. Where digital channels are not being used, the Commissioner is likely to use her existing powers to support, encourage, and in some instances require those customers to adopt digital services for some transactions. Ensuring that these customers do adopt digital services is critical to ensuring that the benefits of the new tax administration system are received by all, and I propose that the Commissioner’s decisions for these kinds of customers have binding legal effect. 22. Requiring customers to use digital services should be a last resort. Relying on a framework under which most customers will move to digital services voluntarily means that agencies will need to develop digital services that customers want to use. 23. I seek public views on these approaches and associated criteria, and whether other approaches and criteria should be considered. 24. The discussion document also suggests that tax legislation be reviewed to ensure the language used in legislation is modernised to be technology-neutral. I am intending to introduce a tax bill (Taxation (Business Transformation and Simplification) Bill) mid-year which will signal the start of modernising and simplifying tax administration, with a particular focus on reducing compliance costs for small to medium sized enterprises. 25. I expect that some customers will raise concerns about the potential requirement to use digital services for some interactions with Inland Revenue. I also expect some customers will raise concerns about the assistance options for those customers who have difficulty using digital services. Digital services are the building block for Inland Revenue’s business transformation programme 26. Inland Revenue’s business transformation programme is a technology-enabled change programme to implement the capability that will enable delivery of a modem revenue system. The use of technology and the implementation and delivery of digital services is a key enabler to ensure a successful outcome for business transformation. That outcome is a modernised tax administration system with both reduced tax system administration costs and reduced costs for individuals and businesses to comply with their tax obligations and access their social policy entitlements. 27. A system with a greater level of automation delivered through digital channels should deliver increased levels of taxpayer compliance. Taxpayers will find it easier to meet their obligations, and automation will make it more difficult to omit or provide incorrect information. 5 Alignment with Government’s digital strategy 28. In 2014, the Government released the Key Result Area 10 Blueprint to guide all public agencies on redesigning existing digital services, increasing system capability and supporting New Zealanders through the digital transition. The government’s vision of future digital public services contains three dimensions: • digital by choice (meeting customers’ needs); • digital by design (optimising service efficacy); and • digital by default (achieving system efficiency). 29. The Government has also set up specific goals to improve New Zealand businesses’ interaction with government via Result 9: Better Public Services for Business, part of the Better Public Services programme. With the goal of increasing efficiency and reducing compliance costs for businesses, Result 9 aims to deliver a one-stop online shop for all the government advice and support that New Zealand businesses need to run and grow their businesses'. The introduction of the New Zealand Business Number is a key component of Result 9’s delivery of improved government services to business. 30. Both Result 9 and Result 10 are focused on improving interactions between customers and government by using digital technology to deliver joined-up customer services. A key enabler for both is the use of digital channels (because digitally-sourced information is much more easily shared). Greater use of digital services by Inland Revenue’s customers will therefore deliver benefits not only to those customers and to Inland Revenue but more widely across Government. 31. Information collected by Inland Revenue is already used by other government agencies, and improving the accuracy and timeliness of that information by collecting it through digital channels will also benefit those other government agencies. Further benefits may also arise to customers of those agencies if the better quality, more timely data leads to improved services. 32. A good example of an agency which uses Inland Revenue data is the Accident Compensation Corporation. It relies on Inland Revenue for information to allow the collection of work account levies from employers, work account and earner account levies from self- employed, and for collecting earners’ levies. This dependency also means that system changes will need to be coordinated between both agencies. Proposed timeline 33. Subject to Cabinet approval, I propose to release the discussion document for public consultation on or shortly after 31 March 2015, with a six week consultation period. I will report back to Cabinet on the policy proposals once public input has been taken into consideration, with the intention of including the necessary legislation in a tax bill scheduled for introduction in November 2015. 1 http://www.mbie.govt.nz/ahout-us/publications/cabinet-papers/bps-result-9-improving-business-interactions- with-govemment.pdf 6 Consultation 34. The discussion document will be released alongside a discussion document on the overall policy direction for Inland Revenue’s business transformation programme. 35. Officials have consulted with key external stakeholders being the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s Transformation Reference Group, the Taxpayers’ Simplification Panel, the Treasury, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, the Ministry of Social Development, the Accident Compensation Corporation, the State Services Commission, the Department of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Education on the suggested proposals in the discussion document. Officials will continue to work with government agencies over the course of the policy development process. 36. The Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet has been informed of the proposals. Financial implications 37. The suggested proposals in the discussion document are aimed at seeking the best solution for encouraging taxpayers to adopt digital services and removing legislative barriers to delivering digital services. We expect them to be broadly fiscally neutral. 38. Separate Cabinet papers will present business cases seeking funding for Inland Revenue’s business transformation programme. Administration and compliance implications 39. The proposals in the discussion document are aimed at solutions that support and enable the majority of taxpayers to use digital services. Consequently, we expect there to be an overall reduction in both compliance and administration costs as the benefits are realised. 40. There may be some additional administration and/or compliance costs if other government agencies are required to use digital services as the result of these proposals. This will need to be managed carefully. My officials will work closely with agencies in understanding these implications. Legislative implications 41. The release of the discussion document does not give rise to any immediate legislative implications. However, legislative changes will be necessary if Cabinet subsequently decides to implement the proposals. Regulatory impact analysis 42. I advise that the substantive regulatory impact analysis elements have been included in the draft discussion document at a level that is appropriate given the stage of policy development. A Regulatory Impact Statement will be prepared later in the policy process, once the policy proposals have been finalised. 7 Other implications 43. I have considered any likely human rights, gender, or disability implications associated with the release of the discussion document and consider that any implications have been addressed in the discussion document. For example, the document proposes that for customers who are unable to use digital services, assistance should be provided where necessary, or non­ digital services should be retained, as tax compliance and access to entitlements through the tax system are critical. Publicity 44. I will arrange the appropriate publicity for the release of the discussion document, and Inland Revenue will also publicise it through its channels. 45. The discussion document will be accompanied by the launch of an internet-based public consultation. It will set out a summary of the proposals and seek views on the same questions raised in the discussion document. It will be linked to the internet-based public consultation on the Green paper on Inland Revenue’s business transformation. Extracts of the internet- based consultation are attached. Recommendations 46. I recommend that the Cabinet Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee: 1. Note the contents of the attached draft Government discussion document, titled Better Digital Services. 2. Agree to the publication of the discussion document, and the launch of the internet-based consultation, which propose to: 2.1 provide reassurance and confidence to customers that the key focus of future digital services is to deliver better customer experiences; 2.2 encourage customers to move to better digital services over time, by providing specific assistance to some customers, while retaining non­ digital alternatives for those who cannot adopt digital services; 2.3 in some circumstances, require some customers that deal with the tax information of others to use digital services for some transactions where they are able to do so; 2.4 ensure tax legislation is technology-agnostic. 3. Agree to delegate to the Minister of Revenue the authority to release the discussion document and finalise the detail.

Making Tax Simpler: A Government Green Paper on Tax Administration and Better Digital Services: Feedback from Consultation PortfolioRevenue Purpose This paper notes the outcome of the submissions received on the first two Making Tax Simpler consultation documents. Previous Consideration On 18 March 2015, EGI agreed to the release of two discussion documents: Making Tax Simpler: A Government Green Paper on Tax Administration; Making Tax Simpler: Better Digital Services. \[EGI Min (15) 5/2-3\] Summary The above two discussion documents were released in March 2015 to support consultation on the government’s proposals for modernising and simplifying tax administration in New Zealand. In general, the feedback received on the two discussion documents supported the proposed direction and approach. The main themes from the responses were as follows: there was concern about the current provisional tax rules, and interest in the proposal for provisional tax to be calculated on a “pay as you earn” basis; submitters were equally divided on proposals for a greater level of interaction with Inland Revenue – some saw increased interaction with Inland Revenue as undesirable and difficult to achieve for those without internet access, while others saw significant value in the process being improved; large businesses have much less flexibility than smaller ones in changing their software to connect directly to Inland Revenue systems; 1 I N C O N F I D E N C E I N C O N F I D E N C E submitters generally saw the benefits of moving to greater use of digital channels, but thought that moving to digital should be optional, not a requirement; submitters were concerned that moving to digital should not result in an increase in costs; most submitters supported the key proposal of linking business accounting software directly to Inland Revenue’s system, although some submitters were concerned about security, privacy and cost. The attached Appendices 1 and 2 set out a summary of the comments received on the two discussion documents. Also attached is an anonymised report entitled Making Tax Simpler: Green Paper and Better Digital Services: Summary of Feedback. The Minister of Revenue intends to publicly release this report. The proposals identified in the consultation processes will be developed further, and the submissions received will be used to shape the detailed discussion documents proposed for release in the future. Treasury’s comments are on page 4. Regulatory Impact Analysis Not required. Baseline Implications None. Legislative Implications None.

It also asks Cabinet to note that I intend to publicly release an anonymised summary of submissions based on the information in the attached appendices. 2.This paper further notes that the proposals identified in the consultations will be developed and the submissions received used to shape the detailed discussion documents proposed to be released as part of future Making Tax Simpler consultations. Executive summary 3.Cabinet agreed to the release of two Government discussion documents, Making Tax Simpler – A Government Green Paper on tax administration and Making Tax Simpler – Better digital services, earlier this year (EGI Min 15 5/2 and 5/3, CAB Min (15) 9/5 refer). 4.This present Cabinet paper asks Ministers to note the results of this consultation and that I intend to release a summary of these results shortly. In general, the feedback supported the direction and approach we are proposing for simplifying and modernising tax administration and supporting Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme. The subsequent discussion documents to be released in the coming years will set out in more detail the proposed changes to tax administration we are considering and allow people to provide more informed views. 5.This Cabinet paper further notes that the proposals identified in the consultations to date will be developed and the submissions used to shape the detailed discussion documents proposed to be released in the future as part of the Making Tax Simpler consultations. I intend to release, in November 2015, the following suite of discussions documents: Making Tax Simpler: towards a new Tax Administration Act; Making Tax Simpler: better administration of PAYE and GST; and 6.I recently introduced the Taxation (Transformation: First Phase Simplification and Other Measures) Bill, which shows that the Government is committed to simplifying and modernising tax administration. This bill includes legislation to remove the current legislative barriers that may prevent the use of digital channels, as proposed in the Better digital services discussion document. Appendix 2 - Page | 1 Out of scope Background 7.On 31 March 2015, the Government released the first two in a series of discussion documents to support consultation on the Government’s proposals for modernising and simplifying tax administration in New Zealand. 8.The first document, Making Tax Simpler – A Government Green Paper on tax administration (the Green Paper), aimed to introduce New Zealand to the overall direction of the tax administration modernisation programme and seek feedback on that direction. The second, Making Tax Simpler – Better digital services (Better digital services), outlined proposals for moving Inland Revenue and its customers toward much greater use of sophisticated digital technology. These two documents set the foundation for the Government’s approach to modernising and simplifying tax administration. 9.For both papers, an online forum, makingtaxsimpler.ird.govt.nz, gave people the opportunity to submit comments online and answer a series of questions linked to those in the hard copies of the discussion documents. Written submissions were also received through the normal policy submission process. Comment 10.A large number of comments were received on the online forum, with more than 900 comments and more than 2,300 “tick the box” responses to the proposals in the two discussions documents. Ninety written submissions were also received, and officials met directly with key stakeholders and focus groups. 11.The overall response to the proposals was generally supportive. Both the general public and stakeholders welcome the opportunity to improve the tax administration system. This view was also generally taken by media commentators. Chartered Accountants of Australia and New Zealand expressed support for the overall project, noting that a “ground up” review of the tax administration system is “long overdue” and “the current system has been built in an ad hoc way over many decades and has not kept up with changes in technology and business practice”. 12.The main themes from responses to the Green Paper consultation were as follows: Concern about the current provisional tax rules was the strongest theme to come through from the consultation. Many submitters were interested in the proposal in the Green Paper for provisional tax to be calculated on a “pay as you earn” basis. A minority said that they were comfortable with the current provisional tax rules. Submitters were about equally divided on proposals for a greater level of interaction with Inland Revenue for individuals, using new processes with a much greater level of pre-population of tax information. Some saw increased interaction with Inland Revenue as undesirable and difficult to achieve for those without internet access. Others, particularly those already filing, saw significant value in the process being improved. Large businesses have much less flexibility than smaller ones in changing their software to connect directly to Inland Revenue systems. 13.The main themes from responses to the Better digital services consultation were: Submitters generally saw the benefits of moving to greater use of digital channels but thought that moving to digital should be optional, not a requirement. Respondents said the quality of the digital offering should be good enough to make them want to move, and they believed that paper channels needed to remain available for some customers. Appendix 2 - Page | 2 However, there was some support for mandating use of digital channels by specific groups of taxpayers who would otherwise impose costs on others, such as employers and tax agents. Submitters were concerned that moving to digital should not result in an increase in costs, either on an ongoing basis or as a result of the need to acquire new accounting software. Some submitters were sceptical and saw moving to digital as a cost-saving exercise for government that will increase their costs. The key proposal of linking business accounting software directly to Inland Revenue’s system was supported by most, although some expressed concerns about security, privacy and cost. 14.The attached appendices summarise the feedback received on the Green Paper (Appendix 1) and Better digital services (Appendix 2) consultations. These appendices incorporate the overall results of the online polls, together with more detailed summaries of all the comments received on the submissions and representative examples of the comments. I intend to publicly release an anonymised summary of the submissions received, based on these appendices. 15.Given the general support for the direction set out in the Green Paper, I have directed officials to continue to develop the proposals outlined in that paper and to use the submissions received as appropriate to shape the detailed discussion documents proposed to be released in the future: 1 16.The subsequent discussion documents to be released in the coming years, which will set out in more detailed the proposed changes to tax administration, will help people to better understand the likely impacts and benefits, allowing them to provide more informed views. As part of the suite of papers I am submitting to this Cabinet Committee for consideration today, I have included the following companion Cabinet papers Release of discussion document – Making Tax Simpler: towards a new Tax Administration Act; Release of discussion document – Making Tax Simpler: better administration of PAYE and GST; and 17.These proposals were all flagged in the Green Paper. My intention, subject to Cabinet’s agreement, is to release these three discussion documents in early November 2015. 18.The Better digital services paper’s proposals for greater use of digital technology were generally supported, with some reservations, particularly about the requirement to use digital channels. One proposal in that paper was removal of current legislative barriers that prevent use of digital channels. This change has already been included in the Taxation (Transformation: First Phase Simplification and Other Measures) Bill, which was introduced on 30 June 2015. 19.The Better digital services paper also proposed that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue should have the ability to require customers to use digital channels when those channels are available and not using them has a wider impact. The discussion document proposed that the Commissioner’s ability to require customers to adopt digital should have the full force of law. 1 This diagram sets out the proposed suite of discussion documents to be released over the coming years to modernise and simplify tax administration. Appendix 2 - Page | 3 Out of scope Officials are still considering this issue in the context of the design of the rules to support the Better administration of PAYE and GST discussion document and will report back to Minsters in due course. 20.We will need to ensure that the implementation of any policy proposals to simplify and modernise tax administration are integrated and aligned with the implementation of Inland Revenue’s business transformation programme. Furthermore, as the business transformation programme and any policy proposals will be implemented over a number of years, officials need to ensure that design and delivery decisions taken in the earlier phases of the programme do not constrain design and delivery opportunities in the later phases of implementation. This is particularly important in relation to our ability to simplify the delivery of our social policy programmes. 21.Ministers will be asked to consider the implementation approach later this year, as part of the detailed business case for stage 1 of business transformation and the updated roadmap for the programme. Consultation 22.A copy of this paper was been provided to the Ministry of Social Development; the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment; the Ministry of Education; the New Zealand Customs Service; Statistics New Zealand; the Department of Internal Affairs; and ACC. The Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet was informed about this paper. Treasury comment 23.The Treasury notes that there was broad acceptance for digital services, but respondents were concerned about the potential compliance costs associated with comprehensively mandating the use of these services. However, this may be because the discussion document did not consider in detail whether mandating could be appropriate for some taxpayer groups (for example, employers over a certain size). 24.The Treasury notes that the trade-offs associated with the decision whether to mandate digital services should be considered as part of the next business case in November 2015.

Making Tax Simpler: Towards a New Tax Administration Act: Release of Discussion Document PortfolioRevenue Purpose This paper seeks agreement to release the attached discussion document on Making Tax Simpler: Towards a New Tax Administration Act (the discussion document). Previous Consideration On 18 March 2015, EGI agreed to the release of a government green paper and a discussion document relating to Better Digital Services \[EGI Min (15) 5/2-3\]. The feedback received on those two documents has informed the proposals for this paper. Summary The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (Commissioner) has statutory independence to ensure Inland Revenue is able to collect tax and carry out its duties, but the Commissioner is also a State sector chief executive with responsibilities to work closely with other government agencies to deliver more efficient public services. The discussion document examines how the Commissioner’s “care and management” responsibility can best coexist with the newly enhanced chief executive responsibilities in the State Sector Act 1988. In particular, the discussion document seeks feedback on the following proposals: to clarify the Commissioner’s care and management responsibilities to provide for greater administrative flexibility in limited circumstances, and to ensure the responsibility applies to the Commissioner’s non-tax functions (eg administering Working for Families tax credits, student loan repayments, child support, KiwiSaver and paid parental leave); to clarify Inland Revenue’s powers to access bulk third-party information and remotely stored information (eg by aligning the rules in the Search and Surveillance Act 2012 to clarify how Inland Revenue can use the remote access regime, recognising that many Inland Revenue searches are carried out without a requirement for a warrant); 1 I N C O N F I D E N C E I N C O N F I D E N C E to narrow the secrecy rule from referring to “all information” to information that identifies, or could identify, a taxpayer (eg to allow for greater cross- government information sharing); how Inland Revenue could support improved information flows between government agencies, and whether a taxpayer should be able to consent to the release of their information; to impose an obligation on taxpayers who receive a pre-populated tax return to respond to that return within a prescribed period, and to treat that response as the taxpayer’s self-assessment for tax administration purposes. The discussion document notes that further consideration will be given to the advice and disputes regime, the time bar, record keeping and the future compliance and penalties approaches. Regulatory Impact Analysis A Regulatory Impact Statement will be submitted when final policy approval is sought. Baseline Implications Any fiscal implications will be included in the final policy proposals. Legislative Implications None from this paper. The Minister of Revenue intends to seek approval to include two tax bills on the 2016 Legislation Programme. The proposals in this paper will be included in the second of these bills, for introduction in late -2016. Timing Issues The release of the discussion document will be announced at a Trans-Tasman Business Circle briefing on 11 November 2015. Announcement The relevant documents will be posted on Inland Revenue’s Making Tax Simpler website. Proactive Release None. Consultation Paper prepared by Inland Revenue. ACC, Crown Law, Customs, MBIE, Education, Treasury, DIA, Justice, Police, MSD and SSC were consulted. CAANZ and the NZ Law Society were also consulted. The Minister of Revenue indicates that the Minister of Finance, the Minister for Economic Development and the Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment were consulted, and that discussion is not required with the government caucus, or with other parties represented in Parliament. 2 I N C O N F I D E N C E I N C O N F I D E N C E The Minister of Revenue recommends that the Committee: 1note the contents of the government discussion document, Making Tax Simpler: Towards a New Tax Administration Act (the discussion document), attached to the submission under EGI-15-SUB-0110, which will consult on proposals to: 1.1clarify the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s care and management responsibilities; 1.2clarify Inland Revenue’s powers to access bulk third-party information and remotely stored information; 1.3narrow the secrecy rule; 1.4impose an obligation to respond to a pre-populated return within a prescribed period for taxpayers receiving a pre-populated tax return, and to treat the response as the self-assessment; 2agree to the release of the discussion document, and to the launch of accompanying online consultation on its contents; 3authorise the Minister of Revenue to approve any editorial, presentational and other minor changes to the discussion document before its release; 4invite the Minister of Revenue to report back to the Cabinet Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee on the outcome of consultation and with final policy recommendations.

Executive summary 4.In short, the discussion document Making Tax Simpler: Towards a new Tax Administration Act (Towards a new Tax Administration Act): concludes that the role of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, as prescribed by legislation, is reasonably clear and adequately expressed, notwithstanding the fact that the recent State Sector Act changes affect the Commissioner’s relationships with other organisations; proposes to clarify the Commissioner’s care and management responsibilities to provide for greater administrative flexibility in limited circumstances and to ensure the responsibility applies to the non-tax functions; proposes to clarify Inland Revenue’s powers to access bulk third-party information and remotely stored information; proposes to narrow the secrecy rule from referring to “all information” to information that identifies, or could identify, a taxpayer; consults on whether a taxpayer should be able to consent to the release of their information, in certain circumstances; Out of scope 2 consults on how Inland Revenue could support improved information flows between government agencies; proposes, for taxpayers receiving a pre-populated tax return, to impose an obligation to respond to the prepopulated return within a prescribed period; proposes to treat the taxpayers confirmation of the prepopulated return as their self- assessment for tax administration purposes; and notes that further consideration will be given to the advice and disputes regimes, the time bar, record keeping and the future compliance and penalties approaches, in the light of the modernised tax administration once features have been decided and implemented as Inland Revenue’s business transformation programme progresses. 5.Submissions on this discussion document will close on 12 February 2016. Following consultation I will report back to the Cabinet Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee on the outcome of consultation and final policy recommendations. Background 6.Towards a new Tax Administration Act is one in a series of consultation documents setting out the Government’s proposals for the transformation of tax administration. The components of the business transformation consultation timeline are set out below: 7.This discussion document builds on the concepts set out in the Making Tax Simpler: A Government Green Paper on tax administration (the Green Paper) which outlined the likely scope of the review of the Tax Administration Act. Most but not all of the issues raised in the Green Paper are addressed in this discussion document, some are still under consideration and others will be included in subsequent Making Tax Simpler documents. 8.Submissions received on the Green Paper and the Making Tax Simpler: Better Digital Services discussion document have informed the discussion and proposals in Towards a new Tax Administration Act. 9.Further background is included in the companion Cabinet paper, Making Tax Simpler – Release of discussion documents and feedback on completed consultations. Comment 10.Tax administration refers to the rules and processes for collecting and disbursing the revenue and payments administered by Inland Revenue. The efficiency and effectiveness of these rules and processes is just as important for maintaining fairness in the tax system as the rules defining how much tax is due. In Towards a new Tax Administration Act the proposed framework for tax administration is discussed with an emphasis on the key roles of the Commissioner, taxpayers and tax agents as the three primary actors, as well as the rules around information collection and tax secrecy which underpin their interactions. 3 Role of the Commissioner 11.Tax can only be levied according to laws enacted by Parliament. Inland Revenue’s role is to administer the Inland Revenue Acts and to collect tax to the best of its ability. In doing so, the integrity of the tax system and the confidentiality of people’s tax affairs must be maintained. The Commissioner has statutory independence to ensure Inland Revenue is able to collect tax and carry out its duties. The Towards a new Tax Administration Act discussion document examines the Commissioner’s role in three areas. 12.The first area examined is how the Commissioner’s “care and management” responsibility can best coexist with the newly enhanced chief executive responsibilities in the State Sector Act. As well as accountability for Inland Revenue, the Commissioner has a role in ensuring Inland Revenue works more closely with other government agencies to deliver more efficient public services. Requiring the Commissioner, as a state sector chief executive, to be responsive to the collective interests of government needs to be considered alongside the Commissioner’s statutory independence. The discussion document sets out how, in the transformed administration, the Commissioner’s role will continue to be complementary to her chief executive functions. 13.Secondly, the discussion document proposes a clarification to the care and management provision, so that in some limited cases the Commissioner can apply the legislation in a way that does not tie up Commissioner and taxpayer resources in outcomes that are inconsistent with the practice and policy intent. The proposal is that the Commissioner would be able to: Apply a policy-based approach to small gaps in the tax legislation; Deal pragmatically with legislative anomalies that are minor or transitory; Address cases of hardship (inequity) at the margins; or Deal with cases in which a statutory rule is difficult to formulate (meaning that the relevant legislation has failed to adequately deal with the particular situation). 14.Thirdly, the document also considers whether the Commissioner’s “care and management” responsibility in the non-tax functions is adequately expressed in legislation. The non-tax functions include administering Working for Families tax credits, student loan repayment, child support, KiwiSaver and paid parental leave. These functions have been added over time to Inland Revenue’s functions for collecting tax. Clarification that the “care and management” responsibility applies broadly, reflecting the objectives of these functions, would better support the Commissioner’s ability to use resources as effectively as possible to deliver more efficient services. Information collection 15.Information flows are critical to Inland Revenue’s interaction with taxpayers and third parties. Inland Revenue deals with large numbers of documents, forms, letters and returns that contain information about taxpayers’ income or assets. Outside of the tax return process, Inland Revenue can require a person to provide any information considered “necessary or relevant” to Inland Revenue’s functions. It is important to emphasise the “necessary or relevant” standard, or something similar, in the transformed administration. Retaining such a standard will provide people with continued confidence that Inland Revenue will not use its information-gathering powers to obtain information that is not needed. 4 16.The availability and usability of large datasets has greatly improved with the aid of technology. To efficiently administer the tax system, Inland Revenue needs to continue to be able to collect one-off taxpayer-specific and bulk data, and obtain some third-party information on a repeating basis. Therefore, more robust rules for repeating access to large third-party datasets are recommended. 17.More taxpayers are storing information in the cloud and utilising cloud-based software. While Inland Revenue is able to use its search powers to access information remotely in some situations, these powers will require review to ensure access to such information in all relevant circumstances. 18.In order to ensure Inland Revenue’s ability to obtain necessary or relevant information, no matter how it is stored, it is proposed to clarify the rules for remote-access searches for Inland Revenue. The rules in the Search and Surveillance Act 2012 are currently crafted in relation to remote access searches authorised under search warrants. The preferred approach is to align the rules in the Search and Surveillance Act 2012 with a clarification of how Inland Revenue uses the remote access regime. This is intended to ensure Inland Revenue can use the remote access regime while recognising that many Inland Revenue searches are carried out without requirement for a warrant. Tax secrecy 19.Tax secrecy, or taxpayer confidentiality laws, exist in most jurisdictions. Traditionally, tax secrecy is viewed as a means of improving compliance by reassuring taxpayers that it is safe to provide their information to Inland Revenue. The reasons for taxpayer confidentiality are: to increase voluntary compliance by assuring taxpayers their information will go no further; as a balance for the broad information-collection powers granted to Inland Revenue; and to protect the privacy of taxpayers. 20.There is increasing movement towards sharing information, in particular to participate in more cross-government initiatives, including the Data Futures work and the Government ICT strategy. Therefore, it is an appropriate time to consider whether Inland Revenue’s current secrecy rules remain fit for purpose in a transformed tax administration. It is necessary to consider how a general framework of confidentiality with clear exceptions can be maintained, while at the same time modernising and allowing for greater cross-government information-sharing. 21.I propose in the first instance to narrow the coverage of the secrecy rule to information that identifies, or could identify, a taxpayer or taxpayers. The confidentiality of an individual’s or business’s affairs would, as a starting point, remain protected. This would not mean that taxpayer-specific information would never be disclosed; rather, as is the case now, a specific legislative exception to the general rule of confidentiality would be required. Rules would also remain to ensure that sensitive information about Inland Revenue processes continues to be protected. 22.Inland Revenue has an ability to enter into cross-agency information-sharing agreements in certain circumstances set out in the Tax Administration Act. Consideration could be given to greater use of this provision, or to amending the criteria to better enable its use in a wider range of circumstances. 5 Feedback is also sought on whether taxpayers might be permitted to consent to the release of their information in certain circumstances, especially within the cross-agency contest where other sharing options are not available. The role of taxpayers and tax agents 23.The transformed tax administration envisages providing improved delivery of digital services, greater use of withholding payments, enhanced prepopulated income tax returns and better use of business’s existing systems to automate interactions with Inland Revenue. These features have implications for the obligations and responsibilities of taxpayers and tax agents. The discussion document sets out the steps that would be involved in prepopulating returns and also the obligations of taxpayers that would underpin these steps. Self-assessment as a concept would be retained, as it recognises that taxpayers are in the best position to determine their final tax liability. 24.Including more information on prepopulated returns should reduce compliance costs by offering a more personalised tax return process. Tax returns should also be more accurate, as the opportunity for taxpayer error will be minimised. This reduces the resources required to correct return errors, for both taxpayers and Inland Revenue. To enable effective prepopulated returns, the discussion document considers: the obligations of a taxpayer with a prepopulated return in the context of self- assessment; what responses will be required from a taxpayer receiving a prepopulated return, and the consequence of failure to respond to a prepopulated return; and the ability for the taxpayer to amend the information contained in the prepopulated return. 25.Better use of technology and information will enable Inland Revenue to add more than just PAYE information or taxes withheld at source to a prepopulated return. However, the specific nature of the information that could be prepopulated is likely to be considered in a discussion document on improving the tax system for individuals that is due for release in 2016. The role of tax agents 26.About 5,300 tax agents are registered with Inland Revenue, and they manage the tax affairs of nearly two million clients. The advice and assistance tax agents give their clients contributes to the smooth running of the tax system. The discussion document recognises that features of the modernised tax administration will change the nature of the support agents provide; however, tax agents will continue to significantly influence compliance. Future issues 27.Finally the discussion document considers the advice and disputes regimes, the time bar and record-keeping requirements. Feedback is sought on the effectiveness of the current options for taxpayers to seek Inland Revenue’s view on specific issues. A more individualised approach to the time bar is also discussed, as this would be compatible with Inland Revenue’s future direction. 6 28.Modernising the tax system provides an opportunity to recognise that taxpayer behaviour is about more than attitude. A combination of capability, opportunity and motivation make up compliance behaviour. The new approach to compliance could mean a different approach to penalties. The Better tax for small businesses discussion document considers possible changes to late filing and late payment penalties for businesses. 29.These areas will require further analysis once key features of the modernised tax administration have been decided on and implemented. Consultation 30.Officials have consulted with the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, the Department of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Education, the Accident Compensation Corporation, the State Services Commission, Statistics New Zealand, the New Zealand Customs Service, the Ministry of Social Development, the Crown Law Office, the Ministry of Justice, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner, The Treasury, and New Zealand Police. The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet were informed of the proposals in the discussion document. Financial implications 31.Approving the release of the Government discussion document will not have any fiscal implications. Any fiscal implications resulting from the proposals will be included in final policy advice to Cabinet following consultation. Administrative implications 32.The administrative impacts of the proposed changes are being assessed in the context of the updated Business Transformation Business Case which is timetabled for submission before the end of 2015. The impacts will be reported on in the final policy advice to Cabinet. Human rights 33.I consider that the proposals contained in the discussion document are not inconsistent with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993. Legislative implications 34.The release of the discussion document will not give rise to any immediate legislative implications. However, legislative changes will be necessary if Cabinet subsequently decides to implement the proposals. Therefore, I intend to propose a bill be included on next year’s Cabinet Legislation Programme for introduction in late-2016. Regulatory impact analysis 7 35.The regulatory impact analysis requirements apply to some of the proposals in the discussion document. The substantive regulatory impact analysis elements have been included in the discussion document at a level that is appropriate given the stage of policy development. Regulatory Impact Statements will be prepared as part of reporting back on final policy proposals. Publicity 36.I intend to announce the release of the discussion document at a Trans-Tasman Business Circle briefing on 11 November 2015. I will announce, at the same time, the release of two other discussion documents in the Making Tax Simpler series, one on better administration of PAYE and GST, and the other on better tax for small business. 37.The release of the discussion documents will be accompanied by the launch of online public consultation. This will contain a summary of the proposals and seek views on questions raised in the discussion documents. The online consultation will be on the same website that was used for the consultation on the previous documents in the Making Tax Simpler series. Recommendations 38.I recommend that the Cabinet Economic Growth and Infrastructure: 1.Note the contents of the Government discussion document Making Tax Simpler: Towards a new Tax Administration Act, which will consult on: 1.1the proposal to clarify the Commissioner’s care and management responsibilities; 1.2the proposal to clarify Inland Revenue’s powers to access bulk third-party information and remotely stored information; 1.3the proposal to narrow the secrecy rule; 1.4the proposal to impose an obligation to respond to a prepopulated return within a prescribed period for taxpayers receiving a pre-populated tax return and to treat the response as the self-assessment. 2.Agree to the release of the Government discussion document Making Tax Simpler: Towards a new Tax Administration Act and the launch of accompanying online consultation on its contents. 3.Authorise the Minister of Revenue to approve editorial, presentational and other minor changes to the discussion document before its release. 8 4.Invite the Minister of Revenue to report back to the Cabinet Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee on the outcome of consultation and final policy recommendations.

The feedback received on those two documents has informed the proposals for this paper. Summary The discussion document seeks feedback on: how new digital services could be used to minimise the compliance and administrative costs of providing PAYE and GST information to Inland Revenue (eg information about employees’ earnings and PAYE deductions could be provided to Inland Revenue as part of an employer running their payroll). The proposals for consultation are discussed on pages 2-5 of this paper; a proposal that PAYE deductions be paid to Inland Revenue at the time employees are paid (employers currently enjoy delayed payment arrangements); the proposed thresholds above which customers would be required to submit their GST information digitally; the proposal that GST refunds should generally be made by direct credit; potential changes to modernise the PAYE rules in order to improve their overall workability. 1 I N C O N F I D E N C E I N C O N F I D E N C E Many of the options set out in the discussion document involve making trade- offs in relation to compliance costs (eg deciding what method should be used to determine the amount of tax to be deducted from an extra pay involves making a trade-off between simplicity for employers and withholding accuracy). Feedback from the consultation will help inform the final policy proposals. Regulatory Impact Analysis A Regulatory Impact Statement will be submitted when final policy approval is sought. Baseline Implications Any fiscal implications will be included in the final policy proposals. Legislative Implications None from this paper. The Minister of Revenue intends to seek approval to include two tax bills on the 2016 Legislation Programme. The proposals in this paper will be included in the second of these bills, for introduction in late-2016. Timing Issues The release of the discussion document will be announced at a Trans-Tasman Business Circle briefing on 11 November 2015. The consultation period will close on 12 February 2016. Announcement The relevant documents will be posted on Inland Revenue’s Making Tax Simpler website. Proactive Release None. Consultation Paper prepared by Inland Revenue.

The discussion document consults on how the administration of PAYE and GST could be improved, as well as on some potential changes to the PAYE rules, as part of Inland Revenue’s business transformation programme. 2.In conjunction with the release of this document, I am also seeking the Committee’s agreement to release two further Making Tax Simpler discussion documents, one on modernising the Tax Administration Act 199 3.Copies of the discussion documents are available, electronically or in print, from my office. Executive summary 4.In short, the discussion document Making Tax Simpler: better administration of PAYE and GST (Better administration of PAYE and GST): Proposes how new digital services could be used to minimise the compliance and administrative costs of providing PAYE and GST information to Inland Revenue. This would be achieved by integrating these processes with the business processes the customer would be undertaking for their own purposes (for example, information about employees’ earnings and PAYE deductions would be provided to Inland Revenue as part of an employer running the payroll). In the case of PAYE, the proposals would create opportunities to improve the delivery of social policy. Because of these wider benefits, a number of options for requiring the more frequent provision of PAYE information are consulted on. Raises the possibility that PAYE deductions should be paid to Inland Revenue at the time employees are paid. Employers currently enjoy delayed payment arrangements. Consults on proposed thresholds above which customers would be required to file digitally, and on a proposal that GST refunds should generally be made by direct credit. Consults on some potential changes to modernise the PAYE rules, in order to improve their overall workability. The issues canvassed are technical issues that have been raised by employers as suggestions as to where the rules could be improved. Out of scope 2 5.Submissions on this discussion document will close on 12 February 2016. Following consultation I will report back to the Cabinet Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee on the outcome of the consultation and final policy recommendations. Background 6.Better administration of PAYE and GST is one in a series of consultation documents setting out the Government’s proposals for the transformation of tax administration. The components of the business transformation consultation timeline are set out below: 7.This discussion document builds on the concepts set out in Making Tax Simpler: A Government green paper on tax administration (the Green Paper) which outlined the likely scope of the review of PAYE and GST processes and the PAYE rules. Most, but not all, of the issues raised in the Green Paper are addressed in the discussion document, some are still under consideration and others will be included in subsequent Making Tax Simpler discussion documents. 8.Submissions received on the Green Paper and the Making Tax Simpler: better digital services (Better digital services) discussion document have informed the discussion and proposals in Better administration of PAYE and GST. Comment PAYE information and payments 10.Pay as you earn (PAYE) is a withholding tax where employers deduct income tax from employees’ salary and wages and pay it to Inland Revenue. The PAYE system is also used to collect payments and information for many income-related social policies. 11.Currently, employers are required to provide an employer monthly schedule to Inland Revenue every month that details information about the gross earnings of, and PAYE, child support, student loan and KiwiSaver deductions made from, each of their employees during the previous month. The employer monthly schedule for a given month is due to be filed by: the 5 th of the following month for employers with $500,000 or more of combined PAYE tax and employer’s superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) deductions in the preceding tax year; and the 20 th of the following month for employers with less than $500,000 of combined PAYE tax and ESCT deductions in the preceding tax year. Out of scope 3 12.Employers must pay PAYE deductions to Inland Revenue and provide an employer deductions form to Inland Revenue: by the 20 th of the month following the month in which they withheld the tax; or twice 1 monthly for employers with $500,000 or more of combined PAYE tax and ESCT deductions in the preceding tax year. 13.Employers with $100,000 or more of combined PAYE tax and ESCT deductions in the preceding tax year must submit their employer monthly schedule and employer deductions form by electronic means in a format prescribed by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. 14.The current process for providing PAYE information to Inland Revenue was largely designed for a paper world. Completing the employer monthly schedule is an additional step removed from employers’ normal business process of running their payroll and must be completed for tax compliance purposes. Even when an employer monthly schedule must be provided digitally, it is essentially just an electronic version of the paper form. 15.In addition to the compliance costs that providing PAYE information to Inland Revenue imposes on employers: There is a greater risk of calculation errors when employers calculate their PAYE and related deductions manually, as well as the potential for transcription errors when employers transcribe information from their payroll records into the employer monthly schedule. There are significant administrative costs involved in processing paper employer monthly schedules and contacting employers and employees to correct inaccurate information. Inland Revenue’s ability to effectively use PAYE information is constrained by the fact that it is not received until the following month. For example, if Inland Revenue received more timely PAYE information, it could make earlier interventions to correct incorrect tax codes or suggest the use of a special tax code, thus reducing existing pressure points around secondary tax. The fact that PAYE information is aggregated into a monthly return is a key limitation, as it is not possible for government agencies that use the information to accurately calculate pay period income, such as weekly or fortnightly. More detailed information would create opportunities for future changes to social policy, for example, the period of assessment for Working for Families could be reduced from an annual basis to several times a year, which might better match assistance with need. Problems with the timeliness and accuracy of PAYE-related information limit the extent to which social policy recipients can be confident of receiving their correct social policy entitlements during the year and of avoiding social policy debt. Proposals for consultation 16.The discussion document consults on how new digital services could be used to integrate the process of providing PAYE information to Inland Revenue with the business processes that the employer undertakes for their own purposes (such as adding an employee to the payroll or running the payroll). This should minimise the effort businesses face in meeting their tax obligations, meaning more time for them to focus on their operations. This is consistent with the objectives of 1 By the 20 th of the same month for deductions made between the 1 st and the 15 th of the month, and by the 5 th of the following month for deductions made between the 16 th and the end of the month. 4 the Government’s Business Growth Agenda. Legislative amendments will be necessary to enable an employer to meet their PAYE obligations in this way. 17.Employers submitting PAYE information to Inland Revenue at the time their business process occurs could reduce compliance costs for employers and improve the timeliness and accuracy of the information received by Inland Revenue. The discussion document seeks feedback on the changes which would be possible if PAYE information was provided to Inland Revenue at the time of the business process. Possible changes include simplifying the KiwiSaver enrolment process, modernising how employers are informed of required employee deductions, simplifying procedures for supplying and amending PAYE information, and changes that could eliminate the need to file nil returns of PAYE information. 18.The discussion document proposes that the threshold above which employers are required to use electronic means to file their employer monthly schedule is halved to $50,000 of PAYE tax and ESCT in the preceding tax year. The options for electronic filing include using a web portal into which an employer could type, or attach, the PAYE information; alternatively, employers could file electronically using payroll software. The proposed reduction in the threshold reflects the fact that many more employers now make use of digital technology than when the $100,000 threshold was set in 1999. 19.To fully benefit from the new digital PAYE services, employers will have to purchase payroll software or, for those already using software, they will have to adopt an upgraded version. 20.Timely, accurate PAYE information is important to the correct delivery of many current social policy entitlements and may be a prerequisite for future changes to social policy delivery. Feedback on an earlier proposal, in the Better digital services discussion document, that would enable the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to use her powers to require employers who are able, but choose not to, to use digital services to provide PAYE information, was mixed. Many submitters proposed that paper filing should remain an option for those who cannot use digital services, or who prefer not to. I consider the proposal to reduce the threshold for digital filing to $50,000, of PAYE and ESCT, to be reasonable in light of the increased use of digital technology since 1999. However, because of the earlier feedback, the discussion document does not propose that employers should be required to use payroll software that supports the new digital services. 21.Instead, the discussion document proposes changes which are focused on when PAYE information is provided, rather than on how it is provided. This leaves the decision about whether or not to use upgraded payroll software to the employer. Employers without upgraded software would be catered for with a modernised web-based portal, and employers below the digital filing threshold would retain the option of paper-based filing, for the foreseeable future. 22.The discussion document outlines several options for implementing the proposed change: Under a voluntary-first approach, employers would choose whether to provide PAYE- related information to Inland Revenue at the time the business process occurs (for example, providing information about PAYE and other deductions when the payroll is run, rather than in the following month). After an undefined period, a review would be conducted, as in the review approach described below. Under a review approach, there would be a defined period for voluntary provision of PAYE information at the time of the business process. This would be followed by a required review, where the costs, benefits and experience would be revisited. Depending on the outcome, employers may then be given a lead-in period, by the end of which they would have to provide PAYE-related information at the time the business process occurs. If it became a requirement to provide PAYE information when the business process 5 occurs, it is proposed that there would be an exemption process for those who could not use digital services to meet the new requirements. Under a legislated approach, legislation permitting the provision of PAYE-related information on the new basis would also identify a lead-in period, at the end of which employers would be required to provide PAYE information on that basis. Different periods might be provided for different classes of employer and, as outlined above, it is proposed that there would be an exemption process for those who could not use digital services to meet the new requirements. 23.The discussion document also raises the possibility of requiring PAYE and other deductions withheld from employees’ salary or wages to be paid to Inland Revenue at the time employees are paid. This has the potential to reduce employers’ compliance costs, improve compliance and provide prompter payments to the Crown and third parties (such as recipients of child support). However, there is a trade-off between these benefits and the benefit (time value of money) the delayed payment of PAYE currently provides to employers. 24.I expect that some customers will raise concerns about paying PAYE earlier, and about the potential requirement to change the way in which they provide PAYE information. Some employers may find it difficult to envisage how integrating the provision of PAYE information into their business processes will reduce compliance costs and may regard the possible requirement to file PAYE information on a pay-day basis as increasing rather than reducing their compliance costs. Adopting or upgrading PAYE software would impose costs on many employers and, while the discussion document does not propose that customers be required to use upgraded software, the use of upgraded software or payroll intermediaries using such software is the only way that employers could fully benefit from the new services. 25.The discussion document reminds readers of the payroll subsidy, which is a government subsidy to assist small employers in engaging a payroll intermediary. The document seeks feedback on whether the Government should consider any additional form of financial assistance to assist employers to take advantage of the new digital services. The PAYE rules 26.At the same time as considering changes to administrative processes relating to the provision of PAYE information, there is an opportunity to consider modernising the PAYE rules to improve their overall workability. Proposals for consultation 27.The discussion document consults on: Whether the method for determining the amount of tax to be deducted from an extra pay should be changed. Whether the tax treatment of holiday pay should be clarified legislatively or administratively by Inland Revenue publication. Whether a mechanism should be introduced to improve withholding accuracy in years in which an extra pay day will occur. Whether legislated rate changes should be applied in the same way across PAYE-related tax types/products. 6 Provision of GST information 28.When a person is registered for GST, they must file a GST return for each taxable period. A person’s taxable period is one, two or six months, depending on the amount of taxable supplies made in a 12-month period or, in some cases, on the election of the GST-registered person. Generally, GST returns must be filed along with any payment by the 28 th of the month following the end of the taxable period. GST returns can be filed electronically, through Inland Revenue’s myIR service, from a mobile application and E-File from tax agents, as well as by paper. 29.Creating and filing a GST return and paying GST involve time and effort for many registered businesses and persons. The majority of registered persons have to transcribe GST information from their accounts (paper-based or digital) to their preferred GST filing channels. Information cannot be transferred automatically and must be re-entered manually. 30.The calculation of GST can also add to compliance costs. Manual calculations can result in errors, leaving registered persons exposed to the risk of penalties. It also affects efficiency and results in additional costs to registered persons, as well as Inland Revenue, in fixing these errors. 31.Furthermore, the time and effort involved in communicating with Inland Revenue imposes costs on registered persons. Some seek confirmation from Inland Revenue that their return has been received and others seek advice or progress reporting on the payment of refunds. Proposals for consultation 32.The discussion document proposes allowing GST registered persons to provide GST information to Inland Revenue directly from their integrated accounting software used as part of their business processes, rather than producing and filing a GST return as a separate manual process. This should minimise the effort businesses face in meeting their tax obligations, meaning more time for them to focus on their operations. This is consistent with the objectives of the Government’s Business Growth Agenda. 33.Although the adoption by GST registered persons of the new digital GST services would reduce administrative costs for Inland Revenue, there are not wider system benefits like those expected from the adoption of the new PAYE services. The discussion document therefore proposes that the decision to adopt the new integrated GST services for providing GST information should be, for the foreseeable future at least, voluntary. 34.The discussion document also proposes that GST refunds are generally made by direct credit into the bank accounts of GST registered persons, rather than having the option of receiving them by cheque. 35.The discussion document also seeks feedback on whether there should be a threshold, above which, GST registered persons should be required to submit their GST returns electronically (through existing electronic channels or the new digital service). Consultation 36.The Treasury, the State Services Commission, the Ministry of Social Development, the Ministry of Justice, the Accident Compensation Corporation, Statistics New Zealand, the New Zealand Customs Service, the New Zealand Defence Force, New Zealand Police, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Department of Corrections, the Department of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Health, 7 the Ministry for Primary Industries and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment have been consulted. None of the government agencies consulted wished to include specific comment. 37.The Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s Transformation Reference Group, the Corporate Taxpayers Group, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, and a range of private sector employers have been consulted. The discussion document reflects some of the issues they raised with officials. Financial implications 38.Approving the release of the Better administration of PAYE and GST discussion document will not have any fiscal implications. Any fiscal implications will be included in the final policy advice to Ministers. Administrative implications Inland Revenue 39.The administrative impacts of the proposed changes are being assessed in the context of the updated Business Transformation Business Case which is timetabled for submission to the Cabinet Committee on State Sector Reform and Expenditure Control before the end of 2015. The impacts will be reported on in the final policy advice to Ministers. Implications for government agencies 40.The proposed changes to the PAYE system will have implications for government agencies as employers. If employers are required to provide PAYE information at the time of the business process, they will have to upgrade their payroll systems to allow for the provision of PAYE information on this basis. 41.Student allowances, most benefits and pensions, and ACC compensation payments are subject to PAYE. However, the systems MSD and ACC use for these clients are designed to administer the welfare and accident compensation programmes respectively. As such, these systems are not designed as “payrolls”. Work is not yet far enough advanced to understand all the implications of upgrading these systems to be consistent with the proposed changes to the PAYE system, but MSD advises that the costs are likely to be significant. 42.Other government agencies, such as the New Zealand Defence Force and Schools’ Payroll Service (previously known as Novopay), are also known to have concerns with aspects of the proposals in their current form. 43.Inland Revenue will continue discussions with these agencies over the next few months, so that the reporting to Ministers on policy recommendations will include options for these agencies. 44.Issues around tax secrecy and collecting information on behalf of other agencies are discussed in the companion discussion document, Making Tax Simpler: towards a new Tax Administration Act. Once these issues are worked through, there is potential for greater use of PAYE and GST information across government. 8 Compliance implications 45.The proposals in the discussion document are aimed at solutions that support and enable many customers to use the new digital services for PAYE and GST. Consequently, although there will be one off costs as customers adopt or upgrade their software, we expect there to be an overall reduction in both compliance and administration costs as the benefits are realised. 46.In addition, the proposed changes to the provision of PAYE information will enable government agencies to intervene more quickly to ensure individuals receive their social policy entitlements. More timely income information will also help detect fraud earlier. 47.The proposal that employers should pay PAYE and other deductions to Inland Revenue at the same time staff are paid should improve compliance by reducing the risk that employers use the amounts they hold in trust to cover these payments for other purposes. 48.Much of the consultation on potential changes to the PAYE rules is in response to issues raised by employers. Many of the options involve making trade-offs in relation to compliance costs. For example, deciding what method should be used to determine the amount of tax to be deducted from an extra pay involves making a trade-off between simplicity for employers and withholding accuracy. Consultation feedback will help inform final policy decisions, where trade- offs have to be made. Human rights 49.I consider that the proposals contained in the discussion document are not inconsistent with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993. The discussion document consults on a proposal that employees should provide their date of birth to Inland Revenue, via their employer, after they have taken up a new job. Date of birth information would be used to help confirm identity to ensure that deductions, such as for KiwiSaver and to repay a student loan, are correctly credited and that obligations, such as child support, are correctly assigned. 50.It is possible that some people may be uncomfortable with this information being provided to their employer because of the possibility of subsequent age discrimination. My officials will develop final policy recommendations based on submissions. Legislative implications 51.The release of the discussion document will not give rise to any immediate legislative implications. However, legislative changes will be necessary if Cabinet subsequently decides to implement the proposals. Therefore, I intend to propose that a bill be included on next year’s Cabinet Legislation Programme for introduction in late 2016, for this purpose. Regulatory impact analysis 52.The Regulatory Impact Analysis requirements apply to some of the proposals in the discussion document. The substantive regulatory impact analysis elements have been included in the discussion document at a level that is appropriate, given the stage of policy development. Regulatory Impact Statements will be prepared as part of reporting back on final policy proposals. 9 Publicity 53.I intend to announce the release of the discussion document, at a Trans-Tasman Business Circle briefing on 11 November 2015. I will announce, at the same time, the release of two other discussion documents in the Making Tax Simpler series, one on modernising the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the other on better tax for small businesses. 54.The release of the discussion documents will be accompanied by the launch of online public consultation. This will contain a summary of the proposals and seek views on questions raised in the discussion documents. The online consultation will be on the same website used for the previous consultations in the Making Tax Simpler series. The consultation period will close on 12 February 2016. Recommendations 55.I recommend that the Committee: 1.Note that currently the provision of PAYE and GST information to Inland Revenue is a separate manual process for employers and businesses, which has adverse impacts on: 1.1Customers’ compliance costs. 1.2The timeliness and accuracy of the information, and its usefulness to Inland Revenue and wider government. 1.3The way in which social policy is currently administered and could be delivered in future. 2.Note the Government discussion document, Maxing Tax Simpler: better administration of PAYE and GST, will consult on: 2.1Allowing employers and businesses to submit PAYE and GST information to Inland Revenue directly from their payroll and accounting software at the time they run the business process they would be undertaking for their own purposes. 2.2Options for requiring employers to provide PAYE information on a pay day basis. 2.3Lowering the threshold for mandatory digital filing of PAYE information by employers. 2.4The possibility that PAYE and other deductions withheld from employees’ salary or wages are paid to Inland Revenue at the time employees are paid. 2.5Modernising the PAYE rules to improve their overall workability. 2.6Generally requiring GST refunds to be made by direct credit. 2.7Whether there should be a threshold, above which, GST registered persons would be required to file their returns electronically. 10 3.Agree to the release of the Government discussion document, Making Tax Simpler: better administration of PAYE and GST, and the launch of accompanying online consultation on its contents. 4.Authorise the Minister of Revenue to approve editorial, presentational and other minor changes to the discussion document before its release. 5.Invite the Minister of Revenue to report back to the Cabinet Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee on the outcome of consultation and final policy recommendations.

Making Tax Simpler: Better Administration of PAYE and GST Portfolio Revenue Purpose This paper seeks agreement to a number of reforms to PAYE and GST that will reduce compliance and administrative costs and create opportunities for better service delivery to individuals. Previous Consideration On 21 October 2015, EGI agreed to the release of a discussion document on proposals to improve the administration of PAYE and GST, and invited the Minister of Revenue to report back on the outcome of the consultation and with final policy recommendations \[EGI-15-MIN-0109\]. Summary Following a consultation process, a number of changes are proposed, grouped under the following themes: using digital services to integrate tax requirements into normal business processes (eg facilitating the provision of PAYE information through payroll software, encouraging the take-up of digital PAYE services, lowering the electronic filing threshold for PAYE returns, and introducing a framework for setting an electronic filing threshold for GST returns); getting it right from the start (eg requiring employers to provide Inland Revenue with date of birth and contact details of all new employees); making the PAYE rules work better (eg changes relating to the tax treatment of holiday pay paid in advance, and the tax treatment of retrospective increases in salary or wages). Agency comments (ACC, MSD, Education Payroll Limited and Treasury) are in paragraphs 69-77. A summary of the submissions received on the consultation document are in Appendix A. Regulatory Impact Analysis A Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) is attached. The Regulatory Impact Analysis Team considers that the RIS meets the quality assurance criteria. 1 I N C O N F I D E N C E I N C O N F I D E N C E EGI-16-SUB-0136 Baseline Implications There will be upfront costs to upgrade software, and those who choose not to go digital may incur increased compliance costs. The Ministry of Social Development and Education Payroll Limited (Novopay) have identified additional costs. The proposed cessation of the current payroll subsidy ($2 per employee per pay-run for up to a maximum of five employees) is expected to generate fiscal savings of $17.1 million over four years. Legislative Implications Amendments will be required to the Income Tax Act 2007, the KiwiSaver Act 2006 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. The proposed amendments will be included in a tax Bill that is expected to be introduced in late 2016, for enactment in 2017. Timing Issues The proposed changes will take effect from either 1 April 2018 or 1 April 2019, as noted in recommendations 14-16 below. Announcement The Minister of Revenue will announce the proposed changes and will release an anonymised version of the summary of submissions when the Bill is introduced.

The proposals are part of the Government’s plans to modernise the revenue system through business process and technology change. The measures will: reduce compliance costs by enabling employers to meet their tax obligations as part of their normal business processes – for example, meeting PAYE obligations at the time they pay wages or salaries; enable Inland Revenue to use PAYE information more effectively to improve the accuracy of withholding and help prevent individuals getting into debt; create an opportunity for Government to subsequently redesign social policies – for example, by introducing shorter periods of assessment to better match assistance to periods of need; improve the workability of some PAYE rules; introduce a framework for setting an electronic filing threshold for GST returns. 2.These proposals could be included in a bill to be introduced in the last quarter of 2016 and passed before Parliament is dissolved for the 2017 general election. Executive summary 3.PAYE and GST are major components of the tax system, raising 37% and 36% (24% Inland Revenue and 12% Customs) of total tax revenue respectively. Both PAYE and GST impose obligations on businesses and other organisations, including many very small entities. 4.The proposals take advantage of modern digital technology to reduce compliance and administrative costs. By reducing errors and improving timeliness, digital systems allow government agencies to make better use of income information – for example, to ensure that benefits and other assistance are not overpaid. Better quality and more timely PAYE information enables future improvements to social policy, such as better targeting tax credit assistance to periods of need. 5.The proposals for the reform of PAYE and GST are made up of the following measures that will take effect from either 1 April 2018 or 1 April 2019 as noted: Employers will be able to meet their PAYE information obligations by providing PAYE information on payday from 1 April 2018. 2 Employers will be required to provide PAYE information on payday from 1 April 2019, but there will be no change to when employers have to pay their PAYE and related deductions. The threshold for electronic filing of PAYE information will be reduced from $100,000 a year of PAYE and employer’s superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) to $50,000 a year from 1 April 2019; those above the threshold who are unable to access digital services will be able to apply for an exemption from the requirement to file PAYE information electronically. From 1 April 2019 payroll software will be required to offer services which employers can use to notify Inland Revenue of new and departing staff when they are added to or removed from the payroll. This will help ensure that new employees are set up correctly from the beginning of their employment. To help ensure that identity is correctly assigned, employers will be required to obtain date of birth information from new employees and pass it on to Inland Revenue from 1 April 2019. Employers will be required to pass on contact details for all new employees from 1 April 2019. The existing payroll subsidy provides $2 per employee per pay-run, up to a maximum of five employees, for employers who outsource their PAYE responsibilities to a listed payroll intermediary. The subsidy incentivises only one model of payroll provision and will end with effect from 1 April 2018. To strike a balance between the desire for more accurate withholding of PAYE and the impact on compliance costs, employers will be given the option to tax holiday pay paid in advance as if the lump sum payment was paid over the pay periods to which the leave relates, or under the existing extra pay method, from 1 April 2018. To reduce complexity and confusion for employers, the rules about how legislated rate or threshold changes are applied will be aligned across the different types of PAYE income payments and PAYE-related social policy products, such that the rates and thresholds to be applied are those in force on the date the payment is made. A framework will be introduced allowing for the setting of an electronic filing threshold for GST returns. 6.The above measures will contribute to the achievement of Government’s Better Public Service Results 9 and 10. They will make PAYE income and deduction information available on a timely basis for 3.7 million New Zealanders. 1 As well as the compliance and administrative cost reductions and changes to social policy identified in this paper the information will create opportunities for future improvements in services as information is shared more effectively across government. 1 The population subject to PAYE includes employees and recipients of taxable benefits and entitlements; this includes most benefits, New Zealand superannuation, student allowance, and accident compensation. 3 7.There will however be upfront costs to upgrade software and those who choose not to go digital may incur increased compliance costs. Therefore, I expect that there will be some resistance to the recommended changes. However, the continuation of the status quo is not sustainable. It limits the opportunities for those who want to benefit from more modern ways of interacting with Inland Revenue and it limits what we can do to provide better services to individuals, including changes to social policy. 8.Most government agencies will have the core costs of upgrading their payroll software covered by their contracts with the software vendors. The Ministry of Social Development (MSD) and Education Payroll Limited (Novopay) have identified additional costs. 9.There will be additional administrative costs for Inland Revenue associated with the transition but these will be accommodated within Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme. The package I am recommending will give rise to total fiscal savings of $17.1 million over the four years commencing 2016/17. 10.I propose to include these measures in a bill to be introduced in late 2016 to enable passage before Parliament is dissolved for the 2017 general election. This timetable aligns with the plans for Inland Revenue’s new computer system (Business Transformation) and should allow sufficient time for payroll software providers and employers to make the necessary changes to their systems. Background 11.The Government’s objective for the tax system is that it should be simple to comply with, making it easy for customers to get things right and difficult to get wrong. It should serve the needs of all New Zealanders, put customers at the centre and help them from the start, rather than when things go wrong. 12.Inland Revenue’s business transformation is a long-term programme to modernise New Zealand’s revenue system. Transformation will simplify how services are delivered by changing how customers interact with a digitally-based revenue system, simplifying policies and making better use of data and intelligence to better understand taxpayers. Inland Revenue will facilitate compliance by providing assistance at the beginning so customers get it right from the start. 13.Business Transformation is far more than just a new computer system. It is re-shaping the way Inland Revenue works with customers, including improvements to policy and legislative settings and enabling more timely policy changes. 14.In March 2015 the Government released two documents, Making Tax Simpler: A Government green paper on tax administration (Green Paper) and Making Tax Simpler: Better digital services – a Government discussion document. Feedback on those documents informed Making Tax Simpler: Better administration of PAYE and GST – A Government discussion document (the discussion document) which was released in November 2015. This set out the Government’s proposals for improving the administration of PAYE and GST and creating opportunities for better delivery of social policy in future. 15.An employer’s PAYE obligations 2 can broadly be described as deducting PAYE from an employee’s salary or wages each payday, providing information on the employee’s gross wages and deductions to Inland Revenue once a month, and paying the withheld PAYE and related deductions to Inland Revenue once or twice monthly. 3 Employers with over $100,000 per year of PAYE and ESCT deductions are required to send PAYE information to Inland Revenue electronically, while 2 Payroll intermediaries and government agencies such as MSD, ACC and Inland Revenue which pay benefits or entitlements subject to PAYE have the same obligations as employers and references to employers in this paper should be read as including these groups. 4 employers below this threshold have the option of sending a paper employer monthly schedule. Not all employers are businesses; not for profit organisations, government agencies and individuals can also have obligations as employers. Comment 16.Feedback on the Green Paper and discussion documents confirmed many of the known pain points and indicated broad support, particularly from large organisations, representative bodies and existing users of business software, for greater integration of tax requirements into business processes. 17.Benefit modelling indicates that significant compliance cost savings are available to small businesses from the adoption of business software that integrates tax requirements into normal business processes. For example, for PAYE, compliance cost savings for small employers are estimated at between 15% and 40% of time spent on PAYE. Feedback nevertheless indicates that some businesses and other organisations are opposed to the prospect of using business software. While this package of measures will require employers to file PAYE information more frequently, it does not require them to use payroll software. 18.I am not recommending that employers be required to pay (remit) PAYE and other deductions to Inland Revenue any more often. Combining the process of making payments to Inland Revenue with the process of paying staff would maximise compliance and administrative cost savings. However, feedback from the discussion document indicated that most employers value the benefits from delayed payments, particularly the cash flow benefits, more than the compliance cost savings that could arise from a fully integrated process. The option of paying Inland Revenue at the same time as employees are paid will be available on a voluntary basis for those who would like to take advantage of it. The existing threshold of $500,000 a year of PAYE and ESCT will remain in place for twice monthly payment of PAYE and associated deductions. All other employers are required to pay PAYE by the 20 th of the month following. 19.The measures I am recommending enable compliance and administrative cost savings and improvements to service delivery, including of social policy. While the compliance cost savings will be achieved through the greater use of digital services in general and business software in particular, the proposals allow small organisations to choose whether or not to take advantage of digital services. Some measures to improve the fairness and workability of the PAYE rules are also included. 20.Further information on each measure is provided below. The proposals have been grouped under the following themes: Using digital services to integrate tax requirements into business processes Requiring PAYE information at the time of the business process Facilitating provision of PAYE information through payroll software Encouraging the take-up of digital PAYE services and targeting support Thresholds for PAYE obligations GST – Introducing a framework for setting an electronic filing threshold for GST returns 3 The 5,400 largest employers with over $500,000 a year of PAYE and employer’s superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) and all payroll intermediaries are required to pay PAYE and related deductions twice monthly and to provide PAYE information by the 5 th of the following month. All other employers are required to provide PAYE information and pay by the 20 th of the following month. 5 Getting it right from the start Provision of all new employees’ date of birth and contact detail information from employers Making the PAYE rules work better Tax treatment of holiday pay paid in advance Application of legislated rate changes Tax treatment of retrospective increase in salary or wages – de minimis provision Using digital services to integrate tax requirements into business processes 21.These measures take advantage of digital services to reduce compliance and administrative costs and to create opportunities for the improved delivery of social policy and other government services. Requiring PAYE information at the time of the business process 22.Legislation currently requires employers and payroll intermediaries to provide PAYE information about new and departing employees and about each employee’s income and deductions on a monthly cycle, regardless of the employer’s pay cycle. Although employers provide information for each employee, the information must be aggregated across pay periods to provide monthly totals. 23.The aggregated and delayed nature of PAYE information enables errors to perpetuate which creates rework and drives up compliance and administrative costs. If the provision of PAYE information was integrated with the process of paying staff, Inland Revenue would have disaggregated (pay period) information provided on, or just after, payday. Pay period information received sooner would enable better administration of the PAYE system and improved delivery of social policies, such as Working for Families tax credits. It would also create opportunities to improve the design of social policy – for example, by reducing the ‘square up’ period for Working for Families to allow periods of assistance to better match periods of need. The previously released Green Paper set out the Government’s early thinking in this area. A consultation document on social policy which will set out how these changes might work is scheduled for release in 2017. 24.A number of approaches to allow employers to provide information at the time of the business process were canvassed in consultation. Many of those who provided feedback preferred a voluntary approach to providing PAYE information on payday. However, even where change is associated with better service, inertia can slow the uptake of new approaches and a voluntary approach would delay the realisation of benefits. Without a legislative requirement it will also be difficult to ensure that software providers upgrade their payroll systems. This is particularly true for large overseas based providers of payroll software. As disaggregated, more timely PAYE information is a prerequisite for subsequent improvements to social policy I recommend that the legislation allows an initial voluntary phase but specifies a date by which all employers are required to provide PAYE information on payday. 25.Some employers pay employees on a daily basis but the legislation will have a minimum pay period of a week. An employer which pays on a daily basis, including a government agency such as MSD or ACC in respect of benefits or entitlements, would report weekly and a special pay run during a pay period, will be included with the next pay period return. 26.Just over 64,000 employers (or 33%) currently file their PAYE information on paper. This number is declining at a rate of approximately 9% a year. While employers already calculate PAYE 6 and deductions for each pay period, a requirement for payday filing is likely to increase compliance costs for those who continue to provide the information on paper forms sent by post. Consideration was given to whether a threshold should be used to exempt small employers from the requirement to submit information on payday and allow them to provide pay period information at month end. However, I consider that the benefits of payday filing to the wider system justify imposing the payday filing requirement on all employers. 27.I recommend that the legislation is amended so that employers can, on a voluntary basis, provide PAYE information on payday from 1 April 2018. 28.To ensure that pay period information is available on a much timelier basis for all employees I further recommend that the legislation should require all employers to submit PAYE information on payday from 1 April 2019. 29.Information will be received more quickly from employers filing electronically than will be possible from employers using paper and posting their return. Taking this into account, the due date for information provided from payroll software will be the day following payday and the due date for employers below the electronic filing threshold not using payroll software, will be the 7 th working day following payday. 30.Currently, certain types of employees (known as “IR 56 taxpayers” 4 ) are responsible for remitting their own PAYE and related deductions instead of their employer. There are approximately 1,600 active IR 56 taxpayers. Additionally, some other employees are required to remit PAYE. This occurs when an employer does not deduct PAYE and pays the employee a gross salary or wage. Under current rules, both these categories of employees are required to pay the tax and provide an employer monthly schedule by the 20 th of the month following payment. I recommend that the due date for provision of PAYE information from these employees be brought forward to the 7 th working day after the end of the month in which they receive the payment(s). This will align the due date with the proposed due date for an employer below the electronic filing threshold, not using payroll software, who pays its employees on the last day of a month. I consider that requiring PAYE information more frequently from these employees would impose an unduly onerous compliance burden on them. 31.Employers who supported reporting PAYE information on a payday basis asked for a simple error correction process. It is intended that genuine PAYE errors will be able to be self-corrected in a subsequent period. It was also suggested that the provisions around penalties and interest might need re-consideration. The penalty regime is currently being reviewed and, if substantive legislative change is required to support the PAYE changes, officials will report to me. Information sharing 32.The above changes to improve the quality and timeliness of information about income and deductions for over 3.7 million New Zealanders will increase its usefulness to other government agencies. While no specific legislative changes are proposed at this point, improved sharing of the information is intended. It is expected that a second Tax Administration Act discussion document will include greater detail on how the legislative framework could be changed to accommodate this. Facilitating provision of PAYE information through software 4 IR56 taxpayers include private domestic workers, embassy staff, New Zealand-based representatives of overseas companies, and United States Antarctic Program personnel. 7 33.The requirements for payroll software will include the ability for employers to provide details of new and departing employees to Inland Revenue at the time they are added to or removed from the payroll. Because businesses vary in the way they manage this process, it is not possible to legislate that this information should be provided when these business processes occur, but early receipt of such information would bring benefits. It will enable new employees to be set up correctly from the beginning of their employment, reducing subsequent re-work and employee debt. It would also sever the link in Inland Revenue’s systems between the employers and employees in a timely way which would stop Inland Revenue contacting employers about departed employees. 34.There was considerable support for this feature in consultation, so, although the requirement imposed on employers will be to include information about new and departing employers no later than the next payday return of PAYE information, payroll software providers will be required to offer a feature to provide earlier notice which employers will use to the extent that it brings them benefits. 35.Because the detailed specifications for PAYE changes are not yet available, some software providers and large employers who have heavily customised or ‘bespoke’ systems may be concerned that a date of 1 April 2019 provides insufficient time to amend their systems. The proposed timetable will allow almost 2½ years from the time a bill is introduced to schedule the changes, and approximately 18 months from the time legislation is passed to develop and implement them. This is broadly consistent with feedback requesting 2 to 3 years notice of required changes. Encouraging the uptake of digital PAYE services 36.A significant number of those who responded to consultation suggested that, in order to encourage digital uptake, Inland Revenue should make payroll software freely available. Others suggested that some form of subsidy should be provided to offset the cost of switching or updating software, while others commented favourably on the existing payroll subsidy. 37.Approximately one third of employers (64,000) currently file their PAYE information by typing into an online form and then submitting the information from the secure part of Inland Revenue’s website. Inland Revenue proposes to significantly upgrade its ‘e-services’ and PAYE- related calculators so that the experience of submitting information via the website on payday is more akin to online banking. User-friendly, intuitively designed e-services should also encourage a significant number of those currently using paper (another 64,000) to switch to digital services, even if they consider themselves ‘just too small’ to invest in payroll software. 38.Payroll software is inherently complex and does much more than calculate tax obligations. Although Inland Revenue proposes to upgrade its calculators and e-services, it does not propose to offer free payroll software as this would be a distraction from its core business and may disincentivise the private sector from innovations in this area. 39.The government has offered a payroll subsidy of $2 per employee per pay-run, for up to a maximum of five employees, since 2006. The subsidy was introduced to offset small employers’ compliance costs by incentivising them to outsource their PAYE responsibilities to listed payroll intermediaries. The subsidy is used by some payroll intermediaries to make free payroll services available, including to non-profit bodies. The payroll subsidy is currently available to almost 98% of employers and is paid to 20 listed payroll intermediaries on behalf of approximately 23,000 employers. 5 40.Officials considered that tighter targeting of the subsidy would return it to its original intent of supporting small employers who may lack payroll or digital skills. I nevertheless recommend 5 To minimise administrative costs, the subsidy is paid to the payroll intermediary, rather than to the employer. 8 that the subsidy cease with effect from 1 April 2018, generating fiscal savings of $17.1 million over four years. 41.While I expect that the loss of the payroll subsidy could result in an increase in the price of services from listed payroll intermediaries the subsidy reflects an old fashioned approach to reducing barriers for small employers. The experience for employers filing through the Inland Revenue’s website will be significantly improved and a range of payroll software products and services already exist in the market at a variety of price points. In this context because only services provided by listed payroll intermediaries are subsidised, the payroll subsidy potentially distorts employers’ choices between different types of payroll products and services. Thresholds for PAYE 42.The existing electronic filing threshold of $100,000 a year of PAYE and ESCT was introduced in 1999. Since that time, the use of electronic channels has become much more widespread, not just in business, but across society in general 63% of those below the current threshold file PAYE information electronically, despite not being required to do so. 43.There was considerable opposition in consultation to lowering the electronic filing threshold, often on the grounds that small employers should still be able to use paper systems. Because a lower threshold of $50,000 a year of PAYE and ESCT will still allow 77% of employers to choose to file on paper, I recommend lowering the electronic filing threshold from $100,000 a year of PAYE and ESCT to $50,000 a year of PAYE and ESCT from 1 April 2019. Based on 2015 figures, this change would require approximately 6,000 employers to begin to file electronically. 44.It is further proposed that, in future, the level at which the threshold is set should be subject to change by Order-in-Council following consultation with affected parties. There will be a limited exception for those employers above the electronic filing threshold who are unable to access digital services. GST – Introduction of a framework for an electronic filing threshold for GST returns 45.Fast, effective and accurate information provision can best be achieved through electronic transfer of information. GST-registered persons and businesses can currently file their GST returns on paper or in electronic form. For the year to June 2015, taxpayers chose to file 65% of GST returns (1.8 million of the 2.9 million total GST returns filed) electronically. 46.It is anticipated that electronic filing of GST returns will increase as a result of Business Transformation. I recommend that a legislative empowering provision be introduced that allows me to introduce an electronic filing threshold by Order-in-Council if uptake needs to be encouraged. 47.While there may be transitional costs for some taxpayers, once a threshold is set and implemented, electronic transfer of GST returns will have the long-term benefit of reducing compliance and administrative costs. There will also be the benefit of reduced transcription errors. 48.The vast majority of businesses and persons in New Zealand have access to the internet and electronic transfer. However, a limited exemption will be available for taxpayers for which electronic filing would cause undue compliance costs. 49.To encourage taxpayers to file electronically and to recover the additional costs of administering paper returns there will be a penalty of $250 for those taxpayers who are, in the future, required to file in an electronic format and fail to do so. The level of the penalty is consistent with the existing minimum non-electronic filing penalty for PAYE and the minimum late filing penalty for GST returns for larger businesses. 9 Getting it right from the start Provision of all new employees’ date of birth and contact detail information from employers 50.The overwhelming majority of new employees have to fill in two Inland Revenue forms when they start a new job. 6 There is significant duplication of information collected through the forms, which both ask for the employee’s name and IRD number. However, Inland Revenue does not ask for the employee’s date of birth. There are thousands of cases where employees have provided an incorrect IRD number or used a variant of their name. In the absence of further information to help confirm identity, most of these instances trigger contact with the employer and employee. Employers report that they can spend considerable time helping employees to sort out instances of identity confusion. If improved service delivery is going to be based on and informed by better information appropriately shared across government agencies, we need to be confident that individuals are correctly identified. 7 51.Many employers currently obtain date of birth information from new employees. I recommend that date of birth be added to the information required for Inland Revenue. Its provision will not be a condition of employment and its absence would not automatically trigger the use of the ‘no declaration’ tax rate of 45c in the dollar, 8 however if identity cannot be confirmed that is the appropriate deduction rate. The provision of date of birth information will help confirm identity and should reduce recourse to the penalty rate. The majority of submitters supported the addition of date of birth information to the information already provided to Inland Revenue at the time an employee starts a new job. 52.Contact information is currently provided, for Inland Revenue purposes, by the vast majority new employees. 9 To assist Inland Revenue in staying in touch with individual customers, I recommend requiring the provision of this information for all new employees. Most employers already collect this information for their own purposes and the legislation will enable them to send the information directly to Inland Revenue from their payroll systems. It is intended that a single form will remain for those who wish to continue using paper. Making the PAYE rules work better Tax treatment of holiday pay paid in advance 53.The tax treatment of holiday pay depends on whether the holiday pay is a lump sum payment (in which case it should be treated as an extra pay), or is included in an employee’s regular pay or paid in substitution for an employee’s ordinary salary or wages when annual paid holidays are taken (in these cases it should be treated as salary or wages). 54.In the case of holiday pay paid in advance (for example, where an employee takes four weeks’ annual leave and receives a lump sum payment of holiday pay covering the four weeks in advance), extra pay tax treatment has a tendency to result in over-withholding of PAYE. 55.More accurate withholding outcomes could be achieved if PAYE was deducted as if the lump sum payment was paid over the pay periods to which the leave relates. Consultation feedback suggested it was common practice to apply this alternative approach for end of (calendar) year holiday pay paid as a lump sum. Moreover, prior to Inland Revenue clarifying its operational 6 The IR330 which requires the employee to select a tax code and the KS2 KiwiSaver form. 7 Inland Revenue will recognise RealMe from June 2017. 8 The no declaration rate is automatically used if an IRD number is not provided and/or if a tax code is not selected. 9 Contact information (postal address, phone numbers and email) is required on the KiwiSaver deduction form which must be completed by new employees between the ages of 18 and 65 who are New Zealand citizens or entitled to live in New Zealand indefinitely and are not employed for 28 days or less or as casual employees. 10 position on the correct tax treatment of holiday pay in November 2015, some payroll software applied this alternative approach to holiday pay paid in advance. 56.This alternative treatment would, however, be more complicated for employers to apply than treating the payment as an extra pay. This is due to the need, when future payments are made for pay periods to which the leave relates, for employers to calculate PAYE based on all earnings for the pay period, less PAYE already collected for the pay period. This will occur for pay periods that are not taken entirely on leave, but partially taken on leave and partially worked in. 57.Although it is a more precise method of withholding, I consider that the alternative method is too complicated to compel employers who do their payroll manually to use. I therefore recommend that employers be given the option to tax holiday pay paid in advance under the existing extra pay method, or as if the lump sum payment was paid over the pay periods to which the leave relates. For consistency, I also recommend that similar treatment be extended to the analogous situation of salary or wages paid in advance. Application of legislated rate changes 58.Different types of PAYE income payments and PAYE-related social policy products 10 have different rules on what is to be done when there is a legislated rate (or threshold) change during a pay period, or if there is rate (or threshold) change between the date the payment is made and the pay period to which the payment relates. The rates (or thresholds) that apply are sometimes based on the pay date, pay period end-date or pay period start-date, while sometimes apportionment applies. This creates complexity and confusion for employers which adds to compliance costs. 59.I recommend that the rules in the Inland Revenue Acts about how legislated rate or threshold changes are applied be aligned across the different types of PAYE income payments and PAYE- related social policy products, such that the rates and thresholds to be applied are those in force on the date the payment is made. Aligning the rules would simplify the transitional process for employers when a legislated rate (or threshold) change occurs, thus reducing compliance costs. There was strong support for this in consultation feedback. Tax treatment of retrospective increase in salary or wages – de minimis provision 60.Under the PAYE rules, a retrospective increase in salary or wages is treated as an extra pay. This is subject to a longstanding de minimis provision, so only applies where the total salary or wages a person earns in a week (including the increase) is more than $4. If a person earned less than $4 for the week, the payment would be treated as salary or wages but, due to the effects of inflation over the last half century, this is now extremely unlikely to occur. 61.I recommend that the de minimis rule in relation to the tax treatment of retrospective increases in salary or wages be repealed, as it is effectively redundant and the mischief it was presumably intended to address is no longer an issue. Consultation 62.In June 2014, Inland Revenue, the Treasury and Victoria University of Wellington hosted a conference entitled Tax Administration for the 21st Century. The conference explored options for making tax easier. Following this conference, the Government issued Making Tax Simpler: A Government Green Paper on Tax Administration, which set out the broad direction of proposed improvements to administration of the tax system, and Better Digital Services: A Government 10 PAYE-related social policy products include the ACC earners’ levy, student loan deductions, the minimum employee KiwiSaver contribution and the compulsory employer KiwiSaver contribution. 11 Discussion Document, which outlined how digital technology could be used to improve service, reduce compliance costs and improve compliance. To encourage feedback from a wide audience, the release of these documents was accompanied by the launch of online public consultation on a dedicated Making Tax Simpler website. 63.On 11 November 2015, the Government released Making Tax Simpler – Better administration of PAYE and GST: a Government discussion document (the discussion document), which outlined how digital technology could be used to streamline PAYE and GST processes. Once again, to encourage feedback from a wide audience, the discussion document was accompanied by the launch of online public consultation on the Making Tax Simpler website. A summary of the feedback provided is at Appendix A and agreement is sought to the public release of an anonymised version of this material at the time the bill is introduced. 64.Officials also consulted directly with a number of large private and public sector employers with complex payrolls and with the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) and Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) which pay taxable benefits and compensation payments that are subject to the deduction of PAYE. The implications for government agencies are discussed in the subsequent section on administrative implications. Feedback from consultation has informed the development of the measures included in this paper. 65.The Treasury, the State Services Commission, the Ministry of Social Development, the Ministry of Justice, the Accident Compensation Corporation, Statistics New Zealand, the New Zealand Customs Service, the New Zealand Defence Force, New Zealand Police, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Department of Corrections, the Department of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment have been consulted. Financial implications 66.The table below provides a summary of the fiscal impact of the measures I am recommending in this package. The payroll subsidy is an annual appropriation established under permanent legislative authority. The proposed repeal, with effect from 1 April 2018 will reduce expenditure from the baseline and increase the operating balance. $m – increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2015/162016/172017/182018/192019/20 & outyears Non-departmental Benefits and Other Related Expenses Payroll Subsidy PLA- -(1.700)(7.300)(8.100) Administrative implications Inland Revenue 67.The changes proposed in this report would be implemented in Inland Revenue’s new computer system, START, during stage 2 of the Business Transformation programme. 68.It is anticipated that there will be additional administrative costs associated with implementing the recommended changes to PAYE but these are expected to be largely transitional. 12 It is expected that the administrative costs of the proposed changes will be accommodated within the programme funding. Other government agencies 69. Most government agencies will have the core costs of upgrading their payroll software covered by their contracts with the software vendors, although there will be costs associated with installing and testing the upgrade and training staff and changing processes. Small government agencies using ‘off the shelf’ packages or cloud-based services may face additional costs for upgrades but these are not expected to be material. 70. Student allowances, most benefits and pensions, and accident compensation payments are subject to PAYE. The systems MSD and ACC use for these clients are complex and are primarily designed to administer the welfare and accident compensation programmes respectively. The costs of change will fall on the agencies. 71. ACC has indicated general support for the provision of details of accident compensation payments on payday but has identified possible concern around its capacity to always share date of birth and contact information by the time of the first compensation payment. ACC has also identified a number of related opportunities for improving the accuracy of compensation payments and the calculation of levies. Inland Revenue and ACC will work closely to ensure that these benefits can, where possible, be realised through better information flows between agencies. 72. ACC does face some system constraints but their own transformation project includes the development of new systems which, provided the timeframes can be aligned, provides the opportunity for ACC to build in the necessary functionality at marginal cost. ACC has identified the importance of working closely with Inland Revenue through detailed design and subsequent phases to ensure that the programme requirements, implementation timeframes and delivery risks are effectively co-ordinated and managed. 73.Education Payroll Limited (EPL), through the Ministry of Education, commented that the schools’ existing payroll platform (Alesco, through supplier Ascender) could provide existing pay period information to Inland Revenue at the time staff is paid without major changes. Their response to the wider Inland Revenue transformation was caveated to the effect that, until the interface to be used between Inland Revenue and EPL is known, the capability to comply, lead time and costs cannot be confirmed and/or estimated. Ministry of Social Development comment 74. MSD is generally supportive of the proposals in the paper for the reforms to PAYE and GST, including those to improve the timeliness of these payments. However, MSD considers that the costs of implementing these changes require additional funding as these costs are not able to be absorbed within a baseline. The Ministry’s baseline is already facing significant cost pressures and a constrained financial outlook. 75. MSD will meet its costs as an employer adjusting its payroll systems. However, as noted in the paper, MSD’s systems are complex and primarily designed to administer the social welfare system. The systems currently provide information on a monthly schedule basis to Inland Revenue on payments made and tax adjustments for debt for clients receiving most main benefits, pensions and student allowances. Withheld under section 9(2)(f)(iv) of the Official Information Act 1982 13 Treasury comment 77. Treasury supports the proposed changes as they will enable improvements in government services through more timely and useful information. In addition to public consultation, Inland Revenue has consulted with many government agencies and note that most will have any costs covered by their contracts with software vendors. We recognise the changes may present cost pressures on some agencies, but these should be funded from agency baselines. Additional funding could be considered for a few agencies on an exceptional basis. Agencies will have until 1 April 2019 to implement most changes, and it would be inequitable to provide funding to government agencies while the payroll subsidy for small and medium businesses is being removed. Compliance implications 78. The proposals in this paper will enable customers to use the new digital services for PAYE and GST. Consequently, there will be one off costs as customers adopt or upgrade their software. However, it is expected that there will be an overall reduction in both compliance and administration costs as the benefits are realised. 79. Inland Revenue will deliver targeted support and education to ensure that all employers understand the PAYE changes and, in particular, that those employers who are not taking advantage of digital services understand the available benefits. 80. The proposed changes to the provision of PAYE information will enable government agencies to intervene more quickly to ensure individuals are subject to accurate rates of withholding and are supported to avoid debt. More timely income information will also help detect fraud and overpayment earlier. Human rights 81. There are no human rights implications. While the provision of date of birth information to Inland Revenue at the time an employee takes up a new job may cause concern to some people, many employers routinely collect this information already. The proposal that date of birth information be provided to Inland Revenue to help confirm identity was supported by a majority of those who provided feedback on the subject. Legislative implications 82. The proposals contained in this package of measures would require legislative amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007, KiwiSaver Act 2006 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. I also recommend that drafters be instructed to modernise the way the PAYE rules are expressed in legislation. 83. It is proposed to include the amendments in a tax bill that would be introduced in late 2016 and enacted before the Parliament is dissolved for the 2017 general election. This timeline is necessary to provide sufficient time for payroll providers and large employers with customised payrolls to plan and implement the change. Withheld under section 9(2)(f)(iv) of the Official Information Act 1982 14 Regulatory impact analysis 84.The Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) requirements apply to most of the proposals in this paper and a Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) has been prepared and is attached. 85.The Regulatory Impact Analysis Team at the Treasury (RIAT) has reviewed the RIS prepared by Inland Revenue. RIAT considers that the information and analysis summarised in the RIS meets the quality assurance criteria. Publicity 86.I propose to announce these measures and release an anonymised version of the summary of submissions when the bill is introduced. I also propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper.

First 2017 Omnibus Tax Bill: Miscellaneous Items Portfolio Revenue Purpose This paper seeks agreement to several miscellaneous amendments to tax legislation for inclusion in the next omnibus tax Bill. Previous Consideration On 15 June 2016, EGI made a number of decisions relating to pay period reporting and the due date for filing PAYE information \[EGI-16-MIN-0136\]. Summary Amendments to tax legislation are proposed to: Following further consultation with stakeholders, agreement is also sought to rescind earlier decisions relating to pay period reporting and the due date for filing PAYE information. Specifically, it is proposed that: rather than being required to file on a pay period basis, employers should be required to provide PAYE information on a payday basis; the due date for PAYE information above the electronic filing threshold for payroll intermediaries and for employers using payroll software should be the second working day, rather than the first day, after payday. 1 I N C O N F I D E N C E Out of scope Out of scope I N C O N F I D E N C E EGI-16-SUB-0297 Regulatory Impact Analysis Two Regulatory Impact Statements (RIS) are attached.

Executive summary 6Following further consultation by Inland Revenue with stakeholders on its Business Transformation programme (Better administration of PAYE and GST), I am also recommending that earlier decisions by Cabinet \[CAB-16-MIN-0283 refers\] in June relating to pay period reporting and the due date for filing PAYE information be rescinded and replaced: Rather than being required to file on a pay period basis, employers should be required to provide PAYE information on a payday basis. Out of scope 2 The due date for PAYE information employers above the electronic filing threshold, for payroll intermediaries and for employers using payroll software should be the second working day, rather than the first day, after payday. 7These changes to the PAYE rules should allow for better integration with payroll software and should improve the accuracy of the information sent to Inland Revenue. Amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994 are necessary to implement this change. 8I recommend these miscellaneous changes to tax legislation be included in an omnibus taxation bill, scheduled for introduction in early 2017.

Large employers frequently do ‘ad-hoc pays’ and the proposed change would require information from these payments to be provided at the time the payment was made rather than being held over and included with the next regular payroll. The recommended change would eliminate a minimum reporting period, allow for better integration with payroll software, and simplify the process of reconciling PAYE information and payments. It may be necessary to make special arrangements for some taxpayers who pay on a daily basis such as the Ministry of Social Development; such variation is permissible under current law. I further recommended that the due date for PAYE information, from payroll intermediaries, employers at or above the electronic filing threshold and employers using payroll software, should be changed from one day following payday to the second working day following payday. This change would better allow employers and payroll intermediaries with complex payrolls to update their payroll systems for errors and adjustments arising from the pay and as a consequence would improve the accuracy of the information sent to Inland Revenue. It is not considered necessary to change the filing due date for employers below the electronic filing threshold and not using payroll software as these employers are unlikely to deal with complex payrolls. 65The effect of these changes to the PAYE rules should reduce compliance costs on employers and PAYE intermediaries as the timing of the requirement better integrates with payroll software and should improve the accuracy of the information sent to Inland Revenue. Consultation 66The Treasury was consulted on the proposed changes recommended in this paper. Out of scope 11 Financial implications Compliance cost implications Out of scope Out of scope Out of scope 12 Administrative cost implications 71No material administration impacts arise from the measures I am recommending in this paper. Apart from my recommendation to change the timing when PAYE information is provided to Inland Revenue by employers and PAYE intermediaries, the measures for inclusion in the first taxation bill for 2017 do not impact on Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme. Economic impacts 72The measures I am recommending in this paper are intended to improve the efficiency of tax legislation by reducing compliance and administration costs. No other economic impacts, apart from those already mentioned in this paper, have been identified. Human rights 73The changes I am recommending in this paper are not inconsistent with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 or the Human Rights Act 1993. Legislative implications 74Implementing the changes in this paper requires changes to the Income Tax Act 2007, the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. I recommend that the necessary amendments be included in the next omnibus taxation bill, which is scheduled for introduction in early 2017. Regulatory impact analysis 78The remaining policy items recommended in this paper do not require a RIS. The changes are either machinery in nature or do not have material impacts. Out of scope Out of scope 13 Publicity 79I propose to mention the changes to the administration of PAYE at the New Zealand Payroll Practitioners Association in early November 2016. 80I will make an announcement on the contents of the proposed omnibus taxation bill for early 2017 when it is introduced in the House. A Commentary on the bill explaining the changes recommended in this paper will be released at the same time. Inland Revenue will publish details of the new legislation in its Tax Information Bulletin series once the bill is enacted.

Making Tax Simpler: Investment Income Information: Release of Discussion Document Portfolio Revenue Purpose This paper seeks agreement to the release of the attached discussion document Making Tax Simpler: Investment Income Information (the discussion document) and to the launch of accompanying online consultation. Previous Consideration On 21 October 2015, EGI noted that the submissions received on two earlier consultation documents relating to A Government Green Paper on Tax Administration (the Green Paper) and Better Digital Services will be used to shape the detailed discussion documents proposed for release in the future \[EGI-15-MIN-0108\]. Summary A number of discussion documents in the Making Tax Simpler series have previously been released. The attached discussion document builds on the concepts set out the Green Paper and on the submissions received in the earlier discussion documents. This discussion document includes proposals to improve the collection of information about investment income. Investment income includes interest, dividends, portfolio investment entity (PIE) income, and royalties. In addition, income distributed by Maori Authorities to their members, while not investment income, is subject to Resident Withholding Tax (RWT) and has been included in the scope of the discussion document. No changes are proposed for royalties. The proposals would give Inland Revenue a more accurate picture of an individual’s income during a year, allowing tax returns to be pre-populated with more information. This in turn should increase voluntary compliance by making it easier for people to get their tax right. The proposals include: requiring payers of investment income to provide Inland Revenue with taxpayer specific withholding information on a monthly basis (or in line with the business process of paying the income if that occurs less often than monthly); removing the need for payers of withholding tax to provide end of year tax certificates to their customers who have provided their IRD number; 1 I N C O N F I D E N C E I N C O N F I D E N C E EGI-16-SUB-0105 increasing the “non-declaration rate” for RWT on interest, and for tax on PIEs to 45 percent; creating a database of taxpayers holding certificates of exemption from withholding tax; requiring all taxpayers seeking to receive their investment income not subject to withholding tax to obtain a certificate of exemption. The discussion document does not include the possibility of withholding systems being used to more efficiently to collect underpayments of tax, eg through variable withholding rates – it is considered that the compliance costs required to implement this proposal would far outweigh any gains. Agency and sector comments are in paragraphs 37-45. Regulatory Impact Analysis Not required. Baseline Implications None from this paper. Legislative Implications None from this paper. Timing Issues The discussion document will be released in early June 2016 for a six-week consultation period. Announcement The Minister of Revenue will issue a media release. The release of the discussion document will be accompanied by the launch of online public consultation. The material will be published on the Making Tax Simpler website and on the standard Tax Policy website. Proactive Release None. Consultation Paper prepared by Inland Revenue. Treasury, the Privacy Commissioner, DIA and TPK were consulted. DPMC, MBIE, Justice and SSC were informed. Corporate taxpayers group, large banks, share registries, some investment companies, Te Tumu Paeroa (a Maori Authority service provider), a custodian business, and some accountants servicing SMEs were also consulted. The Minister of Revenue indicates that the Minister of Finance was consulted, and that discussion is not required with the government caucus, or with other parties represented in Parliament. 2 I N C O N F I D E N C E I N C O N F I D E N C E EGI-16-SUB-0105 The Minister of Revenue recommends that the Committee: 1note the contents of the government discussion document, Making Tax Simpler: Investment Income Information (the discussion document), attached to the submission under EGI-16-SUB-0105, which will consult on proposals to: 1.1require payers of investment income to provide Inland Revenue with taxpayer specific withholding information on a monthly basis (or in line with the business process of paying the income if that occurs less often than monthly); 1.2require payers of investment income to provide Inland Revenue with information on each owner of joint investments; 1.3require payers of investment income to provide information about customers who are subject to approved issuer levy; 1.4require payers of investment income to provide information about customers who receive income that is exempt from withholding tax; 1.5remove the need for payers of withholding tax to provide end of year tax certificates to their customers who have provided their IRD number; 1.6increase the “non-declaration rate” for resident withholding tax on interest, and for tax on portfolio investment entities to 45 percent; 1.7create a database of taxpayers holding certificates of exemption from withholding tax; 1.8require all taxpayers seeking to receive their investment income not subject to withholding tax to obtain a certificate of exemption; 2agree to the release of the discussion document and to the launch of accompanying online consultation on its contents; 3authorise the Minister of Revenue to approve any editorial, presentational and other minor changes to the discussion document before its release; 4invite the Minister of Revenue to report back to the Cabinet Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee on the outcome of consultation and with final policy recommendations. Janine Harvey Committee Secretary Hard-copy distribution: Cabinet Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee Office of the Prime Minister Deputy Chief Executive, Policy, DPMC Melleny Black, PAG, DPMC 3 I N C O N F I D E N C E In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair Cabinet Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee Release of discussion document – Making Tax Simpler: Investment Income Information Proposal 1.This paper seeks the agreement of the Cabinet Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee to the release of the Government discussion document, Making Tax Simpler: Investment Income Information, and the launch of accompanying online consultation. These discuss potential changes to the timing and quantum of information that payers of investment income (such as interest and dividends) are required to provide to Inland Revenue and are part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme. Executive summary 2.Ultimately the Making Tax Simpler proposals are about making it easier for people to get their tax right, and harder to get things wrong. To achieve that the Making Tax Simpler series of consultation papers make a number of proposals, with these main underlying principles: Improve information flows to Inland Revenue and use the information received to prepopulate information for taxpayers to simplify the requirements for those taxpayers that have to, or choose to, file a tax return; Increase the use of digital services to bring that information together; Use the information to help ensure that people are on an appropriate tax rate and therefore that the tax deducted during the year does not result in large end of year debts or refunds. 3.The discussion document Making Tax Simpler: Investment Income Information proposes: requiring payers of investment income to provide Inland Revenue with taxpayer specific withholding information on a monthly basis (or in line with the business process of paying the income if that occurs less often than monthly); otaxpayer specific information would include: the amount of income paid to the customer; the amount of tax withheld (if any), or imputation credits attached; the customer’s IRD number (if held); the customer’s name; the customer’s address; the customer’s date of birth (if held); if the investment is a joint investment, information on each owner of the investment; if the payer is paying approved issuer levy, details of the relevant customers; if the payer is paying interest that is exempt from withholding tax, details of the relevant customers; removing the need for payers of withholding tax to provide end of year tax certificates to their customers who have provided their IRD number; increasing the “non-declaration rate” 1 for resident withholding tax (RWT) on interest, and for tax on portfolio investment entities (PIEs) to 45%; creating a database of taxpayers holding certificates of exemption from withholding tax; and requiring all taxpayers seeking to receive their investment income not subject to withholding tax to obtain a certificate of exemption. 4.The proposals in this document will affect a wide range of payers of investment income including banks, all companies that pay dividends, PIEs, Māori Authorities and individuals paying withholding income such as interest. 5.The key trade-off underlying the proposals is the benefits to customers in being able to access pre-populated information about their income from investments, to Inland Revenue in receiving better information sooner, and to the Government in being able to redesign social policy programmes to take advantage of more detailed and frequent information about investment income, versus the increased compliance costs on payers (albeit partly offset by benefits to those payers). 6.A copy of the discussion document is attached. Background 7.Making Tax Simpler: Investment Income Information is one in a series of consultation documents setting out the Government’s proposals for the transformation of tax administration in New Zealand. The components of the Business Transformation consultation timeline are set out below: 8.This discussion document builds on the concepts set out in the Making Tax Simpler: A Government Green Paper on tax administration (the Green Paper) which outlined the likely scope of the review of tax and social policy administration. Most but not all of the issues relating to investment income information raised in the Green Paper are addressed in this discussion document. The one item mentioned in the Green Paper which is not included in this discussion document is the possibility of withholding systems being used to more efficiently collect underpayments of tax, for example through variable withholding rates. This is not included in the discussion document as officials think the compliance costs to implement such a proposal would far outweigh any gains. Inland Revenue already has the ability to issue deduction notices to banks and others to collect tax debts. 9.Submissions received on the Green Paper and the Making Tax Simpler: Better Digital Services discussion document have informed the discussion and proposals in Making Tax Simpler: Investment Income Information. Comment 1 The “non-declaration rate” is applied when a customer does not provide the payer with their IRD number. 10.New Zealand has an aging population and as people move further into their working lives and on into retirement they typically earn a greater proportion of their income from the investment of capital that they have built up. Income from the investment of capital such as interest and dividends is therefore expected to form a greater proportion of the income that the average person earns in the future and means that having efficient and effective withholding tax systems for these types of income is vital to the integrity of the tax system. 11.Investment income can take a number of different forms, for example: interest; dividends; royalties; and income derived by PIEs. In addition, income distributed by Māori Authorities to their members, while not investment income, is subject to RWT and has been included in the scope of the discussion document. No changes are proposed for royalties. 12.The discussion document proposes that payers of investment income provide more information more often on income from the investment of capital so that Inland Revenue can use that information to provide better services to people, and can ensure taxpayers are complying with the law. To reduce the compliance cost impact of this approach, the document contains options for providing information more easily and removing some types of payer obligations. 13.It is necessary for Inland Revenue to obtain withholding information on a timelier basis to enable the pre-population of that information onto tax statements, which will mean that taxpayers will be able to access their PAYE (currently pre-populated) and withholding tax information from one source. This will make it easier for people to get an accurate understanding of their tax position. 14.Payers of RWT are currently required to provide end of year tax certificates to the recipients of the income. These certificates set out the amounts and types of income and the amounts of RWT deducted. Taxpayers currently need to gather various pieces of correspondence about interest, dividends, Māori Authority distributions and any other income and add the relevant amounts to their PAYE income that is shown on their Summary of Earnings (“SOE”), Personal Tax Summary (“PTS”) or online IR3 tax return. Unless taxpayers are relatively well organised this process can be seen as being too hard or alternatively relevant information can be missed and an incorrect return can be filed. By increasing the amount of information that is pre-populated Inland Revenue will be saving taxpayers’ time and reducing the risk that they will file incorrect returns. Incorrect filing can expose a taxpayer to risk of penalties. 15.If this information was able to be pre-populated into tax returns by Inland Revenue it would be appropriate to remove the requirement for the payers to send out the end of year certificates. This would only be appropriate for recipients who had provided their IRD numbers to the payer of the income (as Inland Revenue would not be able to prepopulate information that could not be matched to an individual). 16.Obtaining withholding information during the tax year would also make it possible for Inland Revenue to advise payers of errors in the information they are providing or the rate choices that have been made by their customers. There would then be an opportunity for the payers to remediate these errors during the tax year and avoid creating taxpayer debt. 17.Better withholding information would enable Inland Revenue to construct a more complete picture of an individual’s income and the time at which it is earned. This would allow for a more accurate determination of the social assistance a taxpayer is entitled to during the income year and create options for more timely government assistance. It is considered that this would in turn reduce issues relating to end-of-year square-ups and debt, as Inland Revenue would be able to adjust an individual’s entitlements during the year rather than undertaking one square-up at year-end. 18.The proposals in this discussion document will increase the amount of information that Inland Revenue will be able to pre-populate for taxpayers and for large numbers of taxpayers will mean that all of their taxable income information is available in one place. Taxpayers that receive income from a number of other sources that will not be able to be pre-populated such as foreign sourced income and rental income will still need to provide information on that income to Inland Revenue. To the extent that income is not able to be allocated to individual taxpayers due to limitations in the information reported (such as where people have not provided their IRD numbers to the interest payers) there will also be gaps in what Inland Revenue can pre-populate. 19.A later policy project in the Making Tax Simpler series will look at social policy entitlements and obligations. Making changes to how Inland Revenue could administer the social policy programmes, in a way that has a real beneficial impact on people, will require Inland Revenue obtaining more information during the year. 20.The discussion document includes a section on payment dates and the possibility of linking these to the dates on which payments of withholding income are made in some circumstances. This is most likely to be useful in situations where the payments are infrequent such as annual or six monthly distributions. Changes to the monthly RWT payment obligations for regular interest payers are not proposed. 21.The discussion document includes a proposal for Inland Revenue to provide a live certificate of exemption list or a searchable database to enable payers of withholding income to confirm on a regular basis that recipients have a valid certificate of exemption. Recipients of withholding income who are exempt from income tax under Acts other than tax Acts are also able to receive their investment income without tax being deducted, but are not required to obtain a certificate of exemption. The discussion document contains a proposal which would require all taxpayers seeking to receive their investment income that is not subject to withholding tax to obtain a certificate of exemption. This would mean that all exempt taxpayers would be included on the certificate of exemption list or database, which would enable payers of investment income to use this to confirm all exemptions in their systems are valid. 22.The proposals in this discussion document will potentially have an impact on all companies (big and small), PIEs, Māori Authorities and any other individuals and entities that pay withholding income such as interest. While banks are the largest withholding tax payers, a wide range of organisations have withholding obligations. The range of organisations involved means a one size fits all approach will not be appropriate. Instead, a range of return requirements and possible information transfer methods will need to be provided to suit the capability of the different types of withholding tax payers 2 . 23.Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation computer system upgrade will include changes to how information can be received. This will make it easier for payers of investment income to file information with Inland Revenue electronically. A key change for RWT, Non Resident Withholding Tax (“NRWT”) and Approved Issuer Levy (“AIL”) will be a gateway to upload information (similar to that used by PIEs to file returns). 24.In addition to the electronic gateway, there will be an option of an online form. Inland Revenue’s new computer system will be able to accept attachments filed with the online forms. This option may be particularly useful for smaller withholding taxpayers as it would 2 97% of the 16,601 interest payers in 2015 who filed interest withholding tax certificates filed detailed information for 10 or less recipients, while 10 filed more than 50,000 certificates. Similarly, more than 99% of companies have 10 or less shareholders whereas some listed companies will have more than more than 50,000 shareholders. enable them to attach calculations that are done in a format that does not meet the electronic gateway criteria. 25.Investment income payers of different types and sizes will have different levels of ability to file information electronically (whether by data transfer through a gateway or via online forms). The administrative impact for Inland Revenue will vary by how much information is provided to it electronically. The key risk of allowing all information to be provided by paper channels would be the significant disruption to the pre-population of investment income information if Inland Revenue received significant numbers of records in paper form and had to manually enter them into its computer system. 26.The document sets out a range of options relating to potentially requiring some or all payers to file information electronically. These include: Continuing to allow all payers the option of filing electronically or on paper: osubject to a review after a period of time; or ountil a given future date. Requiring some payers to file electronically straight away based on the number of recipients they pay investment income; Require most payers to file electronically straight away, with some exceptions (e.g. for those with no internet access). 27.Requiring some investment income payers to file electronically based on the number of recipients they pay investment income to would ensure that large and reasonably large payers would be required to file electronically while most payers of investment income would still be able to choose their option. Over 80% of interest certificates are filed by interest payers who file more than 10 certificates. 28.Companies do not currently provide detailed information about their shareholders to Inland Revenue. The information that companies would be required to provide to Inland Revenue is information it must already hold in order to pay dividends and send shareholder dividend statements to its shareholders. Potential challenges Challenges relating to the recipients of the income Joint accounts 29.Currently Inland Revenue only gets one IRD number in relation to each joint investment. To pre-populate return information for individuals Inland Revenue needs to allocate income earned on jointly owned investments to the individual owners. Allocating the income could potentially be done on a pro-rata basis provided there was a mechanism to allow the individual owners to re-allocate the income if the investment ownership was not equally distributed among the owners. Challenges relating to the payers of withholding income Non-filing payers 30.To the extent that payers of withholding income fail to file returns and pay tax Inland Revenue will be unable to pre-populate that income. As a result there will inevitably be some gaps in the information for some taxpayers and they will be likely to still need to provide that information themselves. Payers who file returns on paper 31.Some payers of withholding income will not have the technological capability to file electronically or may be unwilling to do so. For payers that continue to file paper returns it will not be possible to make efficiency gains to offset potentially increased compliance costs. Increasing the non-declaration rate 32.The document proposes to increase the non-declaration tax rate for RWT and PIE investments to 45% (from 33 and 28% respectively), aligning it with the non-declaration rate for PAYE. The non-declaration rate is the tax rate used when a taxpayer does not provide their IRD number to the payer of investment income. Associating income information with the right taxpayers is vital for pre-population of tax statements, and ensuring that taxpayers are receiving or paying the correct amount of social policy entitlements or obligations. Impact on compliance costs 33.Requiring payers to provide more information, more often, is likely to result in an increase in compliance costs for payers (with a potential reduction in compliance costs for recipients of withholding income). This increase for payers could, however, be offset by making the interaction between payers and Inland Revenue more efficient. With the exception of the PIE tax regime, the processes currently in place for the transfer of information between withholding tax payers and Inland Revenue are very manual, requiring physical transmissions of information and a number of interactions between RWT payers and Inland Revenue. It is envisaged that improved technology and greater digitalisation will enable payers to transfer information and make payments to Inland Revenue more easily. 34.To the extent that payers use the electronic gateway, there will be some initial set up cost to ensure that their system is producing the appropriate reports to feed into the Inland Revenue system but officials do not expect the ongoing costs to be significant. If, however, payers do not use the electronic gateway, and file either electronically (by completing an online form), or by paper then officials expect that the initial set up costs would be smaller but there would be an ongoing increase in the cost to comply. 35.If, after consultation, Cabinet agrees to proceed with these proposals it will be important to ensure that timeframes for changes to reporting requirements are realistic, as payers of withholding income will not be confident to make system changes until the requirements have been enacted. The discussion document seeks feedback on timeframes that would be sufficient to make any system changes. 36.A number of other regulatory changes will also require system development, including the international Automatic Exchange of Information which is expected to require financial institutions to begin conducting due diligence and meeting reporting requirements on all new accounts from 1 July 2017. Consultation 37.Officials have consulted with the Treasury, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, the Department of Internal Affairs, the State Services Commission, the Ministry of Justice, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner and Te Puni Kōkiri. 38.Te Puni Kōkiri raised concerns regarding the impact of the changes on Māori Authorities, particularly smaller Māori Authorities, and their potential lack of capacity and systems to provide the detailed information. They have also raised concerns regarding the ability to provide beneficiary information where the ownership is held through whānau trusts. Officials are continuing to work with Te Puni Kōkiri to resolve these concerns. 39.The New Zealand Debt Management Office (“DMO”) has provided initial feedback regarding the potential impact of the possible changes on their operations. It was noted that it uses Computershare as its registry and that Computershare will have some system change costs. It also raised the potential for the additional disclosure requirements to affect investor demand where investors are investing through nominee companies. Officials will work through these points as they develop the proposals further. 40.In preparing the discussion document officials have held meetings with the five largest banks: Westpac, KiwiBank, ANZ, ASB and BNZ. All of the banks mentioned that they would need time to make technology changes if reporting requirements changed but they were largely accepting of suggestions that more detailed information could be provided more often (perhaps monthly) provided that there was an ability to correct errors in future periods. One bank suggested that more detailed information could be provided 6 monthly rather than monthly and was quite resistant to monthly detailed reporting. 41.Officials also met with AMP Financial Services and Appello Services to understand the position of organisations operating in the PIE sector. Their responses were quite different and reflected their different technology platforms and their ability to attribute income to investors and calculate their tax liability on a regular basis. Further consultation will be needed in this sector to understand the technological challenges that some of the proposals could impose. 42.Officials have also met with the two largest share registries: Computershare and Link Market Services. These organisations look after dividend distributions for most large New Zealand companies and also deal with the interest payments on a number of corporate bonds. They were accepting of the suggestions and could see benefit in some of the proposed changes although both noted that they would need to do some system development work, and one of the registries asked whether the Government would be contributing to the cost of any changes required. 43.Officials consulted with the Corporate Taxpayers Group. The Group did not think that receiving information on a monthly basis was necessary for pre-populating income tax returns, nor for all forms of social policy (as they are currently designed). The discussion document notes that in order to allow social policy to be redesigned, Inland Revenue requires more information on sources of income, such as income from investment during the year. 44.To understand the current position in the small to medium sized entity (“SME”) sector, officials have had discussions with accountants from two accounting practices active in the SME market. 45.In order to get some understanding of the potential effect of changes for Māori Authorities, officials met with other Inland Revenue staff members who deal with Māori Authorities on a day to day basis and also had discussions with Te Tumu Paeroa (formerly known as the Māori Trustee) and Te Awanui Huka Pak Limited (an administration service provider to a number of Māori Authorities). Māori Authorities range from very sophisticated businesses to small trusts holding small parcels of Māori land. Their administration models are also quite varied with some administering their own affairs while others use an intermediary such as Te Tumu Paeroa or Te Awanui Huka Pak Limited to provide their administrative services. Te Tumu Paeroa and Te Awanui Huka Pak Limited have relatively sophisticated systems in order to deal with the large number of distributions they make; however, officials understand that one of the key issues in respect of a number of Māori Authorities will be their capability to provide the information (along with some reluctance in some cases). Financial implications 46.Approving the release of the Government discussion document will not have any fiscal implications. Any fiscal implications resulting from the proposals will be included in final policy advice to Cabinet following consultation. Human rights 47.I consider that the proposals contained in the discussion document are not inconsistent with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993. Legislative implications 48.The release of the discussion document will not give rise to any immediate legislative implications. Legislative changes will, however, be necessary if Cabinet subsequently decides to implement the proposals. Therefore, I propose to include any resulting legislative changes in an omnibus taxation bill. Regulatory impact analysis 49.The regulatory impact analysis requirements apply to some of the proposals in the discussion document. The substantive regulatory impact analysis elements have been included in the discussion document at a level that is appropriate given the stage of policy development. A Regulatory Impact Statement will be prepared as part of reporting back on final policy proposals. Publicity 50.I propose to issue a media release when the discussion document is released. If approved, officials will release the issues paper in early June with submissions closing six weeks later. 51.The release of the discussion document will be accompanied by the launch of online public consultation. This will contain a summary of the proposals and seek views on questions raised in the discussion documents. The online consultation will be on the same website that was used for the consultation on the previous documents in the Making Tax Simpler series. The discussion document will be available from this website, as well as the standard Tax Policy website. Recommendations 52.I recommend that the Cabinet Economic Growth and Infrastructure: 1.Note the contents of the Government discussion document Making Tax Simpler: Investment Income Information, which will consult on proposals to: 1.1require payers of investment income to provide Inland Revenue with taxpayer specific withholding information on a monthly basis (or in line with the business process of paying the income if that occurs less often than monthly); 1.2require payers of investment income to provide Inland Revenue information on each owner of joint investments; 1.3require payers of investment income to provide information about customers who are subject to approved issuer levy; 1.4require payers of investment income to provide information about customers who receive income that is exempt from withholding tax; 1.5remove the need for payers of withholding tax to provide end of year tax certificates to their customers who have provided their IRD number; 1.6increase the “non-declaration rate” for resident withholding tax on interest, and for tax on portfolio investment entities to 45%; 1.7create a database of taxpayers holding certificates of exemption from withholding tax; 1.8require all taxpayers seeking to receive their investment income not subject to withholding tax to obtain a certificate of exemption. 2.Agree to the release of the Government discussion document Making Tax Simpler: Investment Income Information and the launch of accompanying online consultation on its contents. 3.Authorise the Minister of Revenue to approve editorial, presentational and other minor changes to the discussion document before its release. 4.Invite the Minister of Revenue to report back to the Cabinet Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee on the outcome of consultation and final policy recommendations.

Making Tax Simpler: Investment Income Information Portfolio Revenue Purpose This paper seeks agreement to the introduction of a number of reforms to the collection of investment income information to make it easier for people to comply with their tax and social policy obligations. Previous Consideration On 25 May 2016, EGI agreed to the release of a government discussion document on Making Tax Simpler: Investment Income Information, and invited the Minister of Revenue to report back on the outcome of the consultation and with final policy recommendations \[EGI-16-MIN-0105\]. Summary “Investment income information” is information collected about resident withholding tax (RWT), non-resident withholding tax (NRWT), approved issuer levy (AIL), and portfolio investment entity (PIE) tax. These taxes are withheld from interest, dividends, PIE income and taxable Maori authority distributions. There are a large number of payers of investment income (eg banks, PIEs, other financial institutions, companies and Maori authorities), that make payments to a large proportion of the New Zealand population. Following a consultation process, are number of changes are proposed, which will: reduce compliance costs for taxpayers by enabling Inland Revenue to pre-populate their investment income information in their tax records; enable Inland Revenue to use the investment income information more effectively to improve the accuracy of withholding, and help prevent individuals getting into debt; create an opportunity for the government to improve the delivery of social policies, eg by introducing shorter periods of assessment to improve the accuracy and timeliness of payments; link the provision of the investment income information with the payment of withholding taxes to Inland Revenue; improve the workability of a number of aspects of the withholding tax regimes for payers of investment income. 1 I N C O N F I D E N C E I N C O N F I D E N C E EGI-16-SUB-0307 The proposals are summarised in paragraph 5. A summary of the submissions received is in Appendix A on pages 20-39. To date, limited feedback has been received from Maori authorities. Officials will continue to seek feedback from Maori authorities on the proposals. Regulatory Impact Analysis A Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) is attached. The Regulatory Impact Analysis Team considers that the RIS meets the quality assurance criteria. Baseline Implications There will be some upfront costs for the payers of investment income, eg to upgrade their software. Administrative costs incurred by Inland Revenue will be met from within the Business Transformation budget. The pre-population of interest income is estimated to result in between $21 million - $27 million in additional income tax being paid per annum, commencing in 2018/19. Legislative Implications Changes will be required to the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. The proposals will be included in the tax Bill that is expected to be introduced in early 2017 and enacted in early 2018. Timing Issues The proposed changes will be implemented in Inland Revenue’s new computer system (START) during stage 2 of the Business Transformation programme. The proposed application dates (see recommendation 19 below) should provide sufficient time for investment income payers to plan and implement the required changes. Announcement The Minister of Revenue will make an announcement when the Bill is introduced. Proactive Release The relevant Cabinet papers will be proactively released at that time. Consultation Paper prepared by Inland Revenue. Treasury, Justice and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner were informed. DPMC, MBIE, DIA, TPK and SSC were informed. A number of interested groups made submissions as part of the consultation process. The Minister of Revenue indicates that discussion is not required with the government caucus, or with other parties represented in Parliament. 2 I N C O N F I D E N C E I N C O N F I D E N C E EGI-16-SUB-0307 The Minister of Revenue recommends that the Committee: Background 1note that an 25 May 2016, the Cabinet Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee agreed to the release of a government discussion document on Making Tax Simpler: Investment Income Information, and invited the Minister of Revenue to report back on the outcome of the consultation and with final policy recommendations \[EGI-16-MIN-0105\]; 2agree to the introduction of a number of reforms to the rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 regarding investment income information that will, in conjunction with Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme: 2.1reduce compliance and administrative costs; 2.2create opportunities for better service delivery to individuals; Detailed recipient information 3agree to require investment income payers (payers of interest, dividends and taxable Māori authority distributions) to provide detailed recipient information to Inland Revenue on a monthly basis, or for the months in which payments are made if the payment frequency is less than monthly; 4agree to require payers of portfolio investment entity (PIE) income to provide investors’ prescribed investor rate (PIR) details six months into the income year; 5agree that payers of PIE income be required to specify whether the investor is in a “locked in” fund in the year-end detailed information they provide to Inland Revenue; 6agree to require investment income payers to provide the recipient’s date of birth to Inland Revenue as part of the monthly reporting, if it is held; 7agree to require investment income payers to provide detailed recipient information regarding each of the owners of jointly owned investments, if it is held; 8agree that detailed recipient information in respect of interest income subject to approved issuer levy (AIL) be required to be provided to Inland Revenue monthly for domestically issued debt, at the same time as the Resident Withholding Tax (RWT) and Non-Resident Withholding Tax (NRWT) reporting; 9agree that detailed recipient information about interest income that is exempt from RWT because the investor has a certificate of exemption be required to be provided to Inland Revenue annually, but will be allowed to be provided monthly if preferred by the interest payer; 10agree that the reporting due date for interest and PIE income (excluding “locked in” schemes) year-end information be brought forward to 15 May (for the tax year ended 31 March) from the current due date of 31 May; 3 I N C O N F I D E N C E I N C O N F I D E N C E EGI-16-SUB-0307 Non-declaration 11agree to increase the non-declaration rate for interest subject to RWT to 45 percent; 12agree that investors opening new investments in PIEs be required to provide their IRD number (or a declaration that they are non-resident and do not have an IRD number) within six weeks of making the initial investment if they are to remain a member of the PIE; Electronic filing 13agree that investment income payers be required to file their withholding tax returns, including the detailed recipient information, electronically unless they receive an exemption from Inland Revenue; Certificates of exemption 14agree the Inland Revenue make a source of information available to investment income payers to enable them to confirm whether or not recipients are exempt; 15agree that recipients that are tax exempt under Acts other than the Income Tax Act 2007 be required to have a certificate of exemption from withholding tax to be treated as exempt by investment income payers. This will ensure that they are included in the information source referred to in paragraph 14 above, and will enable investment income payers to rely on that source of information; End of year interest certificates 16agree that the requirement to provide end of year withholding tax certificates to recipients of interest income who have provided their IRD number to the interest payer be removed; Error correction 17agree that investment income payers be allowed to correct errors in previous withholding tax returns in their next return, subject to the following restrictions for errors being corrected in the following income year: 17.1the amount of the error must be lower than the greater of $2,000 and 5 percent of the investment income payer’s total withholding tax liability for the year; and 17.2the investment income payer must provide detailed recipient information in respect of the error, including the amount of the error for each recipient and the tax period or periods that the error relates to; Application date 18agree that the implementation of the changes for investment income information follow a legislated approach, where the submission of investment income information on a monthly basis is initially voluntary but the legislation specifies the timeframe by the end of which employers will be required to provide investment income information on the new basis; 19agree that the legislation includes the following implementation timetable: 19.11 April 2018: the date at which PIEs will be required to obtain the IRD number of new investors, or alternatively a self-certification that they are non-resident and do not have an IRD number; 4 I N C O N F I D E N C E I N C O N F I D E N C E EGI-16-SUB-0307 19.21 April 2019: the date from which it becomes permissible for investment income payers to submit investment income information on a monthly basis (paragraph 3 above); 19.315 May immediately following the end of the tax year : the due date for filing the current detailed interest and PIE income information (excluding “locked in” schemes) for tax years beginning on or after 1 April 2018; 19.41 April 2020: the date from which the following will be required: 19.4.1investment income payers (other than PIEs) to provide detailed recipient information on a monthly basis, or for the month in which the payments are made where the payments are made less often than monthly.

Janine Harvey Committee Secretary Hard-copy distribution: Cabinet Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee Deputy Chief Executive, Policy, DPMC Melleny Black, PAG, DPMC 6 I N C O N F I D E N C E In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair Cabinet Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee MAKING TAX SIMPLER: Investment Income Information Proposal 1.This paper seeks the Cabinet Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee’s agreement to the introduction of a number of reforms to the collection of investment income information that will make it easier for people to comply with their tax and social policy obligations. The proposals are part of the Government’s plans to modernise the revenue system through business process and technology change being implemented by Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme. The measures will: reduce compliance costs for taxpayers by enabling Inland Revenue to pre-populate their investment income information in their tax records; enable Inland Revenue to use the investment income information more effectively to improve the accuracy of withholding and help prevent individuals getting into debt; create an opportunity for Government to improve the delivery of social policies – for example, by introducing shorter periods of assessment to improve the accuracy and timeliness of payments; link the provision of the investment income information with the payment of withholding taxes to Inland Revenue; improve the workability of a number of aspects of the withholding tax regimes for payers of investment income. 2.These proposals would be included in the next omnibus taxation b ill, likely to be introduced in the first quarter of 2017. Executive summary 3.Investment income information is the information collected about resident withholding tax (RWT), non-resident withholding tax (NRWT), approved issuer levy (AIL) and portfolio investment entity (PIE) tax. These taxes are withheld from interest, dividends, PIE income and taxable Māori authority distributions. There are a large number of payers of investment income (including banks, PIEs, other financial institutions, companies (large and small), Māori authorities and some individuals) making payments to a large proportion of the New Zealand population. 4.The proposals take advantage of modern digital technology to reduce compliance and administrative costs. By reducing errors and improving timeliness, digital systems allow government agencies to make better use of income information – for example, to ensure that benefits and other assistance are not overpaid or underpaid. Better quality and more timely investment income information supports future improvements to social policy, such as better determining entitlements and obligations. 2 5.The proposals for the reform of investment income information are made up of the following measures that will take effect from 1 April 2020 unless otherwise noted: Payers of interest, dividends and taxable Māori authority distributions will be required to provide detailed recipient information to Inland Revenue on a monthly basis or for the months in which payments are made if the payment frequency is less than monthly. Payers may elect to file monthly from 1 April 2019 but will be required to file monthly from 1 April 2020. Payers of PIE income will be required to provide investors’ prescribed investor rate (PIR) details to Inland Revenue six months into the income year and will be required to specify whether the investor is in a “locked in” fund such as a KiwiSaver fund in the year-end detailed information they provide to Inland Revenue. To help ensure that identity is correctly assigned, investment income payers will be required to provide the recipient’s date of birth to Inland Revenue as part of the detailed recipient information reporting if it is held. This information is typically collected from new investors under anti money laundering rules. To enable jointly earned income to be split between the joint owners, investment income payers will be required to provide detailed recipient information regarding each of the owners of jointly owned investments if it is held. This will be provided either in the investment income payer’s main return files or alternatively in a separate report to the main withholding tax returns. Detailed recipient information in respect of interest income subject to AIL will be required to be provided to Inland Revenue monthly for domestically issued debt (at the same time as RWT and NRWT information is reported). Detailed recipient information about interest income that is exempt from RWT (because the investor has a certificate of exemption) will be required to be provided to Inland Revenue annually but will be allowed to be provided monthly if preferred by the interest payer. From the tax year beginning 1 April 2018, the reporting due date for interest and PIE income (excluding “locked in” schemes) year-end information will be brought forward to 15 May (for the tax year ended 31 March) from the current due date of 31 May. The non-declaration rate for interest subject to RWT will be increased to 45% to encourage non-declared interest recipients to provide their IRD number to their interest payer. Investors opening new investments in PIEs will be required to provide their IRD number (or a declaration that they are non-resident, do not have an IRD number and providing their foreign tax identification number) within six weeks of making the initial investment if they are to remain a member of the PIE. Investment income payers will be required to file their withholding tax returns including the detailed recipient information electronically unless they receive an exemption from Inland Revenue. 3 Inland Revenue will make a source of information available to investment income payers that enable them to confirm whether or not recipients have certificates of exemption. To ensure that all exempt recipients are included in the information source discussed above (which will enable investment income payers to rely on that source of information), recipients that are tax exempt under Acts other than the Income Tax Act 2007 will be required to have a certificate of exemption from withholding tax to be treated as exempt by investment income payers. To reduce compliance costs for interest payers, the requirement to provide end of year withholding tax certificates to recipients of interest income who have provided their IRD number to the interest payer will be removed. To reduce compliance and administration costs, investment income payers will be allowed to correct errors in previous withholding tax returns in their next return subject to restrictions for errors being corrected in the following income year. 6.The above measures will contribute to the achievement of Government’s Better Public Service Results 9 and 10. They will make investment income and withholding tax deduction information available on a timely basis for New Zealanders receiving investment income. As well as the compliance and administrative cost reductions and changes to social policy identified in this paper the information will create opportunities for future improvements in services as information is shared more effectively across government. 7.There will however be upfront costs to upgrade software, particularly for payers of investment income making payments to large numbers of recipients, and there will be some on-going compliance costs for payers that don’t automate reconciliation processes. Therefore, I expect that there will be some resistance to the recommended changes. However, the continuation of the status quo limits the opportunities for those who want to benefit from more modern ways of interacting with Inland Revenue and it limits what we can do to provide better services to individuals, including changes to social policy. 8.Most Government agencies will be relatively unaffected by these proposals. The Debt Management Office pays large amounts of interest; however, it outsources the registry processes for debt issues to a registry services provider that will have to make any changes required. The registry services provider could increase its charges to the Debt Management Office to recover the costs of the changes but any such increase would be expected to be spread across all of the provider’s customers. 9.There will be additional administrative costs for Inland Revenue associated with the transition but these will be accommodated within Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme. The package I am recommending will give rise to additional revenue of $21-27 million per annum in respect of interest income and further fiscal savings relating to social policy abatement (the fiscal savings are currently unable to be quantified due to the lack of investment information provided under current settings). This revenue and the savings form part of the Business Transformation programme business case which has already been included in Government revenue forecasts. 10.I propose to include these measures in a bill to be introduced in early 2017. This bill is not expected to be passed until early 2018. The application dates proposed should allow sufficient time for investment income payers to design and make the necessary changes to their systems. 4 Background 11.The Government’s objective for the tax system is that it should be simple to comply with, making it easy for customers to get things right and difficult to get wrong. It should serve the needs of all New Zealanders, put customers at the centre and help them from the start, rather than waiting until things go wrong. 12.Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation is a long-term programme to modernise New Zealand’s revenue system. It will simplify how services are delivered by changing how customers interact with a digitally-based revenue system, simplifying policies and making better use of data and intelligence to better understand taxpayers. Inland Revenue will facilitate compliance by providing assistance at the beginning so customers get it right from the start. 13.Business Transformation is far more than just a new computer system. It is re-shaping the way Inland Revenue works with customers, including improvements to policy and legislative settings and enabling more timely policy changes. 14.In March 2015 the Government released two documents, Making Tax Simpler: A Government green paper on tax administration (Green Paper) and Making Tax Simpler: Better digital services – a Government discussion document (CAB Min (15) 915). Feedback on those documents informed Making Tax Simpler: Investment Income Information – A Government discussion document (the discussion document) which was released in July 2016 (CAB-16-MIN-0236). This set out the Government’s proposals for improving the administration of investment income information and creating opportunities for better delivery of social policy in future. 15.Submissions from a range of parties expressed support for changes to improve the flow of information on investment income between payers and Inland Revenue and the better use of technology by Inland Revenue to match and pre-populate investment income data. However, all of the submissions expressed concerns over compliance costs and doubts over whether the benefits would justify the costs. These concerns were raised mainly about monthly reporting and joint account information provision. 16.Limited feedback has been received from Māori authorities and their advisors to date. I have instructed officials to continue to seek feedback from Māori authorities. 17.As expected, the submissions received were largely from investment income payers, advisory firms and industry organisations. The major benefits of this project are expected to flow to the recipients of investment income. As such, the tenor of the submissions may not reflect the wider reaction to the proposals. 18.The payers of investment income are required to deduct tax from the payments of investment income that they make (unless they pay less than a threshold amount or the recipient is eligible to be treated as exempt). The amount of the deductions is determined by the choices and circumstances of the recipients. For example, a non-resident earning interest can elect AIL or will be subject to NRWT at the rate applying for the country they are resident of, while a resident can select from a range of RWT rates if they have provided their IRD number to the payer. The payer then pays (remits) the deductions and submits a summary return (usually a paper form showing the total income paid and the total tax deducted) to Inland Revenue, usually in the following month. In the case of interest and PIE income the payer also provides detailed recipient information to Inland Revenue after the end of the tax year. 19.Payers of investment income also have obligations to report payment information to the recipients of the investment income. Companies have to provide shareholder dividend statements and Māori authorities have to provide Māori authority distribution statements when payments are 5 made. PIEs provide PIE investor statements and interest payers provide interest certificates after the end of the tax year. Comment 20.The measures I am recommending enable compliance and administrative cost savings and improvements to service delivery, including for social policy. The compliance cost savings will be achieved through the greater use of digital services and the pre-population of investment income to allow recipients to see as much of their tax information as possible in one place and to use it to meet their tax and social policy income calculation obligations. The use of digital forms will allow payers of investment income to a few recipients to save time and money by filing online rather than having to file paper returns. Some measures to improve the fairness and workability of the rules regarding investment income information are also included. 21.I am not recommending that payers of investment income be required to remit RWT, NRWT, PIE Tax and AIL to Inland Revenue any more often or any earlier. Rather, I am recommending that the payers of investment income align the process of providing detailed investment income information to Inland Revenue with their business processes for paying investment income and withholding the relevant tax. 22.Payers of investment income that make payments to large numbers of recipients have developed systems to calculate and deduct withholding taxes. These systems will need to be altered or redesigned to meet the proposed requirements and there will be upfront costs to achieve these changes. These payers are also likely to have some on-going costs to reconcile the information that they will be required to provide each month although they may be able to minimise these costs by automating their reconciliation processes. 23.Further information on each measure is provided below. The proposals have been grouped under the following themes: Getting it right from the start Requiring detailed recipient information to be provided on a monthly basis for most interest, dividends and Māori authority distributions. Increasing reporting on interest to include AIL (where the instrument has been issued from New Zealand) and interest income that has been treated as exempt. Increasing the non-declaration rate for RWT on interest income to 45%. Requiring new PIE investors to provide their IRD number to the PIE. PIEs to provide the PIR of their investors six months into the income year and to include locked in status in the detailed reporting at the end of the year. Date of birth information to be provided if held by the investment income payer. Joint owners’ identity details to be provided by investment income payers. Making the investment income rules work better Mandating digital filing. Bringing the due date for end of year returns forward to 15 May (from 31 May) for interest and PIE income (excluding locked-in PIE funds). Bringing forward the date for interest income is an interim measure until monthly reporting is in place. 6 Making an information source of valid certificates of exemption available to investment income payers. Requiring recipients of investment income to have a certificate of exemption in order to be treated as exempt. Removing the requirement for interest payers to provide end of year interest certificates to recipients who have provided their IRD number. Allowing error correction within the same income year and also in the following year subject to thresholds. Getting it right from the start 24.These measures will enable Inland Revenue to proactively intervene during the year where recipients are on inappropriate tax rates and will create opportunities for the improved delivery of social policy and other government services. Requiring detailed recipient information to be provided monthly 25.Legislation currently requires payers of interest subject to RWT or NRWT and payers of PIE income to provide detailed recipient information to Inland Revenue after the end of the tax year. No detailed recipient information is required to be provided for dividends, Māori authority distributions and interest subject to AIL or that is treated as exempt. 26.The receipt of the detailed recipient information well after the year end and t he lack of information for some types of investment income means that investment income is unable to be easily associated with the recipient’s other tax records (as personal tax summaries have been prepared before the investment income information that Inland Revenue does receive has been able to be processed). It also means that Inland Revenue is unable to proactively adjust tax rates during the tax year to reduce debts or refunds due at the end of the year. 27.Receiving more complete information and receiving it sooner and more frequently would enable better administration of investment income information and improved delivery of social policies, such as Working for Families tax credits. In addition, Inland Revenue is often the source of income information for other Government agencies and these proposals could therefore enable reforms to the delivery of other services provided by Government. 28.It would also create opportunities to improve the design of social policy – for example, by reducing the annual period for Working for Families to allow periods to better match times of need. The previously released Green Paper set out the Government’s early thinking in this area. A consultation document on social policy, which will set out how these changes might work, is scheduled for release in 2017. 29.A number of frequency options for the provision of investment income information were canvassed in consultation. Feedback provided by the payers of investment income who make payments to large numbers of recipients showed that they preferred annual provision of information or if more frequent information was required quarterly provision of information. Some submitters did, however, note that if more frequent provision of information was required it would make little difference if it was required monthly or quarterly as the same systems changes would be required. 30.A group of interest payers pay withholding tax to Inland Revenue less often than monthly. These are interest payers that make interest payments of more than $5,000 per annum and withhold less than $500 per month. They are required to pay the tax they have withheld every two months if they withhold more than $500 every two months, but only every six months if they withhold less 7 than $500. There are approximately 23,500 payers who filed 6 or less RWT returns in the year ended 31 March 2015. Under the monthly reporting proposal these payers would have to file investment income information each month but will remain on the same payment basis. 31.Monthly information has been proposed as the preferred option as it allows the best matching of information for possible future changes to social policy calculation periods. For example, if the social policy period was changed to quarterly and the investment income was reported quarterly there would be a 3 month lag. This is because income calculations for social policy are completed before the beginning of the period and investment income reporting is done after the end of the period. This means that for the quarter beginning 1 July the social policy inco me calculation will be completed by 30 June while the investment income information for the quarter ended 30 June will not be provided until 20 July so the information for the quarter ended 31 March would have to be used. If the investment income information was provided on a monthly basis the information for the month ended 31 May would be available for inclusion in the social policy income calculation to be completed by 30 June. Reducing the delay allows assistance to be better targeted to periods of need. 32.While there may be some additional compliance costs with monthly provision of detailed investment income information, I consider that the benefits of monthly provision of detailed investment income information to the wider system justify the proposal. 33.A small group of submitters (made up of some very large payers of investment income) requested a period of three years from the enactment of the legislation to make and implement systems changes. This would suggest an application date for the proposed changes of 1 April 2021. This was endorsed by the New Zealand Bankers Association when I met with them. Inland Revenue have discussed possible application dates with these submitters and on the basis of those discussions recommended an application date of 1 April 2020 to me. While I am recommending a 1 April 2020 application date, I am willing to consider this further based on submissions made during the select committee process. 34.I also note that a number of financial institutions have just undertaken systems changes in relation to FATCA (recently completed or at remedial system development stage), are making systems changes for AEOI (now until second reporting date June 2019) and will also need to make changes for PAYE (by 1 April 2019). They are, therefore, expending considerable resources on overlapping tax related regulatory changes as shown by the following diagram: Late 2016 2017 2018 2019 Early 2020 FATCA Remedial AEOI System Development PAYE Design System Development Inv Income Design System Development 35.Some types of investment income are only likely to be paid sporadically such as dividends and Māori authority distributions. Where this income is paid less often than monthly I recommend that detailed investment income information is only required for the months in which investment income is paid. 36.During consultation some investment income payers have expressed interest in piloting the new requirements. I recommend that the legislation is amended so that investment income payers 8 can, on a voluntary basis, provide detailed investment income information on a monthly basis from 1 April 2019. 37.To ensure that detailed investment income information is available on a much timelier basis for all recipients I further recommend that the legislation should require all payers of investment income consisting of interest, dividends and Māori authority distributions to provide detailed investment income information on a monthly basis from 1 April 2020 . Interest income subject to AIL and investment income that is treated as exempt 38.Investment income payers have submitted that they may be unable to provide detailed reporting in respect of debt subject to the AIL regime that has been issued offshore. This is because these debt issues are often managed by paying agents in foreign jurisdictions who may be prevented from providing detailed recipient information by the laws in the other jurisdiction. I, therefore, recommend that the detailed reporting requirement does not apply to debt instruments issued outside of New Zealand where the interest payments are subject to AIL. 39.The reporting of detailed information in respect of interest paid to recipients that have been treated as exempt from income tax is a compliance measure. In order to reduce compliance costs I recommend that this information is only required on an annual basis but that investment income payers are allowed to provide it on a monthly basis if they choose to do so. Increasing the non-declaration rate on interest income to 45% 40.Non-declaration of a person’s IRD number makes it much more difficult for Inland Revenue to associate income with the recipient’s tax records. The current non-declaration rate for RWT on interest income is 33% and is equal to the top marginal tax rate; however, people can have higher effective marginal tax rates. If a person was on the 33% tax rate and had a student loan their effective marginal tax rate on their investment income could actually be 45%. The 33% non- declaration rate provides no incentive for people on the 33% tax rate or for people who also have social policy entitlements or obligations and may therefore have an effective marginal tax rate of more than 33% to provide their IRD numbers to their interest payer. 41.Submissions on the proposed 45% non-declaration rate for interest were mixed, however, around 20% of the end of year interest certificates relate to interest recipients who are non-declared. This equates to around 1 million non-declared interest certificates each year. Inland Revenue will work with banks to try to reduce the number of non-declared accounts. However, in order to encourage the remaining non-declared recipients of interest income to provide their IRD numbers to their investment providers, I recommend that the non-declaration rate for RWT on interest is increased from 33% to 45%. 42.Increasing the non-declaration rate will not be effective on its own. It is important that people who are non-declared are aware that they are non-declared. Inland Revenue will work with interest payers to try to obtain IRD numbers from non-declared recipients and to make them aware that they will be taxed at a higher rate unless they provide their IRD number to their interest payer before the proposal comes into effect. Requiring new PIE investors to provide their IRD numbers to the PIE 43.The level of non-declaration is relatively low for PIE investments (about 2%) and PIEs have indicated during consultation that they would prefer to require all new PIE investors to provide their 9 IRD numbers when they sign up than to have a higher non-declaration rate. In addition, providers and Inland Revenue would try to obtain IRD numbers for the currently non-declared investors. 44.I recommend that PIEs are required to obtain IRD numbers from new investors with an exception for investors that certify they are non-resident, don’t have an IRD number and provide their tax identification number from the country in which they are resident (this exception would require the collection of details that are consistent with Automatic Exchange of Information requirements). PIEs to provide the PIR of their investors six months into the income year and to report locked in status as part of detailed year end information 45.Currently PIEs only provide detailed recipient information after the end of the tax year and do not indicate in that information whether the PIE invested in is a locked in PIE or not. PIE income in a locked in PIE (such as a KiwiSaver fund or a retirement savings scheme with complying withdrawal restrictions) is not counted for social policy income calculation purposes. 46.As PIEs do not provide detailed recipient information until the end of the year Inland Revenue is unable to proactively check the PIR selected by the investors. Also, because PIEs do not have to declare whether the PIE is a locked in PIE or not on the detailed investor information, Inland Revenue is unable to easily determine whether the PIE income should be counted in the investor’s social policy income calculation. 47.I recommend that payers of PIE income are required to provide investors’ prescribed investor rates (PIRs) six months into the year, and in the end of year return include information on whether the fund the recipient has invested in is locked in. These changes will allow Inland Revenue to proactively adjust PIRs within the tax year and will allow Inland Revenue to appropriately allocate relevant PIE income to social policy income calculations. Date of birth information to be provided if held by the investment income payer 48.Date of birth information is often used to confirm identity and the discussion document proposed that investment income payers provide date of birth as part of their detailed recipient information where it is held. This would apply for all types of investment income including interest income, dividends, PIE income and Māori authority distributions. 49.The date of birth information would be used as a further identification data point to help to ensure that income information was pre-populated to the correct person’s tax records. It would be particularly helpful where a person’s investment is non-declared, the person has provided an incorrect IRD number or where a person uses multiple names. It could also be used to help with data matching when information is shared between Government agencies. 50.Some submitters expressed concerns that it would be difficult to obtain this informatio n from recipients, although limiting the requirement to provide date of birth information to information held by the investment income payer as suggested in the discussion document would resolve this problem. I note that date of birth information is typically required to be collected from new customers as part of anti-money laundering legislation. 51.I recommend that payers of investment income are required to include date of birth information in the detailed investment income that they provide to Inland Revenue if they hold that information. 10 Payers of investment income to provide joint owners identity details 52.Currently interest and PIE income payers provide one IRD number for jointly owned investments. This means that Inland Revenue can only associate the income with this IRD number and is unable to associate the income with the other owners of the joint investment. 53.The discussion document considered the issue of jointly owned investments and ways in which the joint income could be pre-populated to the known owners’ tax records. Submitters were very clear that they are not well-placed to separate the income between the owners and some submitters were very strongly of the view that the only solution that is workable without unreasonable compliance costs is the provision of a separate report giving the known details of joint owners for jointly owned investments. Inland Revenue would then use this information to split the income evenly between the investors. 54.I therefore recommend that joint ownership information is provided by investment income payers and that they are given the option of providing it in their main withholding tax report or in a separate report. Inland Revenue officials have noted that there are some specific technical issues that were raised by submitters regarding share registry rules around trusts which will need to be taken into account when drafting legislation in respect of this proposal. Making the investment income rules work better Mandating digital filing 55.Using upgraded digital services which provide information in near real-time is key to maximising the benefits available from Inland Revenue’s transformation processes and submitters generally supported using improved digital services. The nature and number of investment income payers and the numbers of recipients each payer makes payments to mean that mandating digital is a logical option. There will also be a range of digital filing options from an online form designed to suit payers with only a small number of recipients to a data file transfer process designed to suit payers with hundreds of thousands of recipients. 56.Inland Revenue receives almost five million interest certificates annually and with a shift to monthly reporting this could increase to 60 million. The changes in respect of AIL reporting and reporting in respect of exempt income would also increase these figures for interest income. There would also be additional reporting from dividend payers and Māori authorities. This level of reporting strongly indicates the need to make digital reporting mandatory. In addition, these payers currently have to file paper forms when they pay investment income. Completing and submitting an online form rather than completing and posting in a paper form is likely to reduce their compliance costs. 57.The number of recipients per investment income payer is also a factor in recommending mandatory digital filing. Almost 94% of the interest payers pay 5 or less recipients. Similarly, 570,000 of the 573,000 companies registered as at 21 April 2016 had 10 or less shareholders. Because so many of the investment income payers make payments to a very small number of recipients, having a digital filing threshold based on the number of recipients would be likely to mean the vast majority of investment income payers would not be required to file digitally. If they chose to continue to file paper returns it would cause very significant administration costs. 58.When information is submitted digitally the format of the information being submitted can be validated before it is accepted so by mandating digital reporting the number of incorrect or incomplete returns may be able to be reduced. 11 59.I therefore recommend that investment income payers are required to file their detailed investment income information digitally. 60.I also recommend having a process for allowing an exemption to the mandated digital filing for investment income payers who would experience unreasonable compliance costs or other hardship as a result of the requirement to file digitally. An example of investment income payers that this might apply to could be people without a computer or internet connection. The investment income payer would need to apply to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue for an exemption from the digital filing requirement. Bringing the due date for end of year returns forward to 15 May (from 31 May) for interest and PIE income (excluding “locked -in” PIE schemes) 61.As the main changes proposed may not take effect until April 2020, I recommend that the due date for the annual detailed file that is currently provided by interest payers is brought forward from 31 May to 15 May (for the year ended 31 March). This will allow Inland Revenue to include the interest information in the personal tax summaries prepared from the beginning of June each year (although joint income will not be able to be split between owners at this stage and there is likely to still be a significant number of non-declared certificates). This change would apply from the tax year beginning 1 April 2018 with the first affected returns due by 15 May 2019. 62.I also recommend that the due date for the annual return of detailed PIE income information is brought forward from 31 May to 15 May for PIEs that are not “locked in” funds. This will allow the information to be associated with the recipient where they receive social policy entitlements or have social policy obligations. 63.These changes will enable Inland Revenue to pre-populate some information for taxpayers and enhance compliance. They will also allow some of the revenue benefits that will accrue from these proposals to be accessed earlier. Making an information source of valid certificates of exemption available to investment income payers 64.The discussion document considered whether Inland Revenue should provide a database (or other source of information) that allowed payers of investment income to check whether their customers had a valid certificate of exemption. Submitters were strongly in favour of this proposal as long as the information was kept up to date and was easily accessible and usable. 65.Issues and cancellations of certificates of exemption are published in the New Zealand Gazette on a quarterly basis. When a certificate of exemption expires at the end of one quarter and is renewed on the first day of the next quarter, the renewal will not appear in the New Zealand Gazette until after the next quarter has finished. Providing a database would allow payers to confirm exemption validity on a close to real time basis. 66.I recommend that Inland Revenue provide a certificate of exemption database (or other source of information) that enables investment income payers to confirm certificate of exemption validity on a real time or near real time basis. 12 Requiring recipients of investment income to have a certificate of exemption in order to be treated as exempt 67.Recipients of investment income can be exempt from income tax under Acts other than the tax Acts. They are then able to request their investment income payer to pay their income to them without withholding any tax. They are able to apply for a certificate of exemption from Inland Revenue , but they don’t have to in order to be treated as exempt. Where the exempt recipient does not choose to apply for a certificate of exemption but instead asks the investment income payer not to withhold on the basis of their exempt status, this can cause compliance cost for the payer as they need to check the claim of exemption is reasonable. 68.I propose requiring any recipient that is eligible to be treated as exempt from withholding tax to obtain a certificate of exemption from Inland Revenue if they wish to continue to be treated as exempt. This will ensure that they are included in the database of valid certificates of exemption discussed above and reduce compliance costs for investment income payers. It will also enhance compliance as any recipients that are incorrectly being treated as exempt recipients will be able to be checked against the database and have their exempt status removed. 69.Investment income payers and Inland Revenue will work together to contact exempt recipients that do not have certificates of exemption to encourage them to apply for a certificate of exemption prior to the application of this requirement. The application process will be a one-off process for the affected parties and is a relatively straight forward process. Removing the requirement for interest payers to provide end of year interest certificates to recipients who have provided their IRD number 70.The discussion document proposed removing the requirement for interest payers to send end of year interest certificates to recipients that have provided their IRD numbers to their interest payer. Submissions on this proposal were mixed with some submitters seeing this as a worthwhile cost reduction measure, some suggesting it would make little difference, and others suggesting that the end of year certificates would still be needed for interest recipients to be able to check that the interest information shown by Inland Revenue was accurate. 71.The proposal to use the current year end information to pre-populate recipients’ tax records for tax years from 1 April 2018 will enable recipients of interest income to compare their year end certificate information with the information pre-populated by Inland Revenue for two years before the requirement to provide year end certificates was removed. Some interest payers have indicated that they will continue to voluntarily provide interest certificates at the end of the year to their customers even if the requirement is removed but that they would like more flexibility aro und those end of year certificates. By removing the requirement, interest payers that choose to continue to provide end of year certificates will be able to adapt the way that they do this (for example they could send them all out electronically therefore saving on postage and printing costs). 72.I recommend removing the requirement to provide end of year interest certificates to recipients that have provided their IRD numbers from the time that interest payers are required to provide detailed recipient information monthly. This will allow recipients some time to become comfortable with the information being pre-populated and gives Inland Revenue time to ensure that the pre-population process is operating as expected. 13 Allowing error correction within the same income year and also in the following year subject to thresholds 73.Some submitters noted that, if detailed recipient information is sent to Inland Revenue more quickly, there will be more errors in the information allocated to the recipients’ tax records. As such there needs to be a simple means for the correction of errors. The investment income payers consulted with have expressed a definite preference for correcting errors in the period following the discovery of the error. This is currently allowed for errors found within the same income year but is not allowed if the errors related to a previous income year. 74.I propose that errors found within the same income year are allowed to be corrected in the next return. For an error to be corrected in a period in a subsequent income year to the year in which the error occurred, the amount of the error should be lower than the greater of $2,000 and 5% of the investment income payer’s total withholding tax liability (for the tax type and the tax year in which the error was made). In addition, the investment income payer would be required to provide information in respect of the error and the recipients affected. 75.The proposed thresholds are intended to ensure that minor errors do not require previous periods returns to be re-filed and also to allow for error correction by major investment income payers who can have very minor calculation errors across thousands of customers that add up to more significant sums very quickly. Consultation 76.In June 2014, Inland Revenue, the Treasury and Victoria University of Wellington hosted a conference entitled Tax Administration for the 21st Century. The conference explored options for making tax easier. Following this conference, the Government issued Making Tax Simpler: A Government Green Paper on Tax Administration, which set out the broad direction of proposed improvements to administration of the tax system, and Better Digital Services: A Government Discussion Document, which outlined how digital technology could be used to improve service, reduce compliance costs and improve compliance. To encourage feedback from a wide audience, the release of these documents was accompanied by the launch of online public consultation on a dedicated Making Tax Simpler website. 77.On 7 July 2016, the Government released Making Tax Simpler – Investment Income Information: a Government discussion document (the discussion document), which outlined how changes to the rules and processes around investment income information could be used to make it easier for recipients to get their tax right and for Inland Revenue to proactively intervene to help people avoid having large tax or social policy debts or refunds at the end of the year. Once again, to encourage feedback from a wide audience, the discussion document was accompanied by the launch of online public consultation on the Making Tax Simpler website. A summary of the feedback provided is at Appendix A and agreement is sought to the public release of an anonymised version of this material at the time the bill is introduced or the proposals are announced. 78.Officials also consulted directly with large investment income payers, registry services providers, industry organisations, accountants specialising in the large and the small business sectors, Te Tumu Paeroa and a Māori authority service provider. Feedback from consultation has informed the development of the measures included in this paper. 79.Limited feedback has been received from Māori authorities and their advisors to date. Officials have directly consulted with Te Puni Kokiri, Te Tumu Paeroa (formerly the Māori Trustee) and a Māori authority service provider. Officials who liaise with Māori authorities have 14 also emailed targeted information to them. I have instructed officials to continue to seek feedback from Māori authorities. 80.The Treasury, Te Puni Kokiri, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, the Ministry of Justice, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the State Services Commission have been consulted during the development of these proposals. Financial implications 81.All additional revenue and reduced expenditure that accrues under these proposals forms part of the Inland Revenue Business Transformation programme business case benefit and have already been accounted for by Government. 82.Inland Revenue has advised me that it is estimating that pre -population of interest income will result in between $21-27 million additional income tax being paid per annum beginning 2018-19. It is difficult to accurately estimate other benefits arising from the proposed changes due to the limitations in the information that is currently collected. Administrative implications Inland Revenue 83. The changes proposed in this report would be implemented in Inland Revenue’s new computer system, START, during stage 2 of the Business Transformation programme. It is anticipated that there will be additional administrative costs associated with implementing the recommended changes for investment income information but these are expected to be largely transitional. The administrative costs of the proposed changes will be accommodated within the programme funding. Other government agencies 84.In addition to public consultation, Inland Revenue has consulted with a number of government agencies and note that most will not have any additional costs as a result of these changes. The Debt Management Office does issue interest bearing debt and pays interest income to recipients, however, the management of the interest payments is outsourced to a registry service provider who will be making the systems changes as part of their wider registry business. Treasury comment 85.The Treasury supports the proposed changes as they will enable improved delivery of government services through more timely and useful income information. Withheld under section 9(2)(i) of the Official Information Act 1982 15 Compliance implications 86.The proposals in this paper will enable recipients of investment income to meet their tax and social policy information requirements more easily and will reduce the risk that they will miss income out of their calculations. While the information and digital filing requirements may well reduce compliance costs for investment income payers making payments to a small number of recipients, it is expected that investment income payers making payments to large numbers of recipients will need to upgrade their systems and processes and there will be upfront costs. The proposed implementation dates with monthly reporting not being required until April 2020 are intended to give investment income payers enough time to make these changes as efficiently as possible. 87.There may also be some additional on-going costs for payers depending on their ability to automatically reconcile the payment they will be making with the information they will be providing. However, it is expected that there will be an overall reduction in both compliance and administration costs as the benefits are realised. 88.Inland Revenue will publicise the changes and will work with investment income payers to reduce the number of non-declared recipients and to identify recipients currently relying on exemptions under other Acts to reduce the number of recipients that will be negatively impacted by the proposed changes. 89.The proposed changes to the provision of investment income information will enable government agencies to intervene more quickly to ensure individuals are subject to accurate rates of withholding and are supported to avoid debt. More timely income information will also help detect fraud and overpayment earlier. Human rights 90.There are no human rights implications. While the provision of date of birth information to Inland Revenue (where it is held by the investment income payer) as part of the detailed recipient information may cause concern to some people, a number of investment income payers routinely collect this information already in order to meet anti money laundering requirements. The proposal that date of birth information be provided to Inland Revenue to help confirm identity was accepted or supported by a majority of those who provided feedback on the subject provided that it was limited to the information already held by the investment income payer. Legislative implications 91.The proposals contained in this package of measures would require legislative amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. I also recommend that drafters be instructed to modernise the way the rules relating to investment income information are expressed in legislation. 92.It is proposed to include the amendments in a tax bill that would be introduced in early 2017. The application dates proposed take this timeline into account and should provide sufficient time for investment income payers to plan and implement the changes required. 16 Regulatory impact analysis 93.The Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) requirements apply to the proposals in this paper and a Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) has been prepared and is attached. 94.Treasury’s Regulatory Quality Team has reviewed the RIS prepared by Inland Revenue and associated supporting material, and considers that the information and analysis summarised in the RIS meets the quality assurance criteria. Publicity 95.I propose to announce these measures and release an anonymised version of the summary of submissions when the bill is introduced. I also propose to proactively release the Cabinet papers relating to this matter at that time. Recommendations 96.I recommend that the Cabinet Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee: 1.Note that the proposals in Making Tax Simpler: Investment Income Information – A Government discussion document were previously considered by the Committee at the Committee’s meeting on 25 May 2016 (CAB-16 -MIN-0236). 2.Agree to the introduction of a number of reforms to the rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 regarding investment income information that will, in conjunction with Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme, reduce compliance and administrative costs and create opportunities for better service delivery to individuals. Detailed recipient information 3.Agree to require investment income payers (payers of interest, dividends and taxable Māori authority distributions) to provide detailed recipient information to Inland Revenue on a monthly basis or for the months in which payments are made if the payment frequency is less than monthly. 4.Agree to require payers of PIE income to provide investors’ PIR details six months into the income year 5.Agree that payers of PIE income will be required to specify whether the investor is in a “locked in” fund in the year-end detailed information they provide to Inland Revenue. 6.Agree to require investment income payers to provide the recipient’s date of birth to Inland Revenue as part of the monthly reporting if it is held. 17 7.Agree to require investment income payers to provide detailed recipient information regarding each of the owners of jointly owned investments if it is held. 8.Agree that detailed recipient information in respect of interest income subject to AIL will be required to be provided to Inland Revenue monthly for domestically issued debt (at the same time as the RWT and NRWT reporting). 9.Agree that detailed recipient information about interest income that is exempt from RWT because the investor has a certificate of exemption will be required to be provided to Inland Revenue annually but will be allowed to be provided monthly if preferred by the interest payer. 10.Agree that the reporting due date for interest and PIE income (excluding “locked in” schemes) year-end information be brought forward to 15 May (for the tax year ended 31 March) from the current due date of 31 May. Non -declaration 11.Agree to increase the non-declaration rate for interest subject to RWT to 45%. 12.Agree that investors opening new investments in PIEs will be required to provide their IRD number (or a declaration that they are non-resident and do not have an IRD number) within six weeks of making the initial investment if they are to remain a member of the PIE. Electronic filing 13.Agree that investment income payers will be required to file their withholding tax returns including the detailed recipient information electronically unless they receive an exemption from Inland Revenue. Certificates of exemption 14.Agree the Inland Revenue will make a source of information available to investment income payers to enable them to confirm whether or not recipients are exempt. 15.Agree that recipients that are tax exempt under Acts other than the Income Tax Act 2007 will be required to have a certificate of exemption from withholding tax to be treated as exempt by investment income payers. This will ensure that they are included in the information source discussed in recommendation 13 above and will enable investment income payers to rely on that source of information. 18 End of year interest certificates 16.Agree that the requirement to provide end of year withholding tax certificates to recipients of interest income who have provided their IRD number to the interest payer will be removed.
