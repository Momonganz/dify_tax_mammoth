1 Ref: 23OIA2395 N OE XR N OE XR N OE XR \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 20 July 2023 Dear Thank you for your request made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA), received on 12 June 2023. Y ou requested: 1) Why does the Inland Revenue department deliberately lie, mislead kiwis by informing and notifying sole parents that their child support payments have been paid direct to Work & Income? 2) Is it acceptable that kiwis believe their child support entitlements is has was paid direct to MSD when in fact it actually hasn’t and instead it has been retained by the crown in full. Do you accept this deliberately misleads NZers? 3) Do you intend to update the MYIR system to reflect updated accurate info all the time so kiwis are not misled? 4) Does the IRD know or have any knowledge of how many customers, IRD staff engaged with since April 1 2022 re child support and their entitlements having been paid direct to MSD. 5) Can you please provide me with a copy of all data and any supporting documents, notes, meta data related to child support payments in general. On 21 June 2023, you amended question 5 of your OIA request to: ( ... ) Please provide all data related to: 6) Collection of child support payments from one parent to IRD. (total amount paid by one parent and collected by the crown to support kids.. all info for the last 5-6 financial years since labour have been in government). 7) The total distribution/payout of those funds collected being paid direct to the child via their primary parent/caregiver/guardian. a) So basically how much of child support funds actually went to support the development or early childhood for which the payment was collected and paid for in the first place? 8) Policy & decision making records, dates and file notes including internal communications, minutes, emails to or from executive management, commissioner, minister/government related to child support. 9) Records of complaints received, investigated, resolved in the last 5-6 years related to child support. 10) I want to know how many New Zealand citizens reached out and enquired about their child support and who were deliberately misled and told to contact MSD because it was paid to MSD. a) I want to know if IRD accept that they wasted kiwis time and cause significant distress and frustration by referring individuals to MSD. 2 Ref: 23OIA2395 N OE XR N OE XR N OE XR \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Provide all information related to this. If you cannot I suggest you do the hard mahi and investigate then get back to me with an answer. b) How many people called to discuss child support every day, week, month and year? Please answer each. c) Then tell me how frequently IRD refer these individuals to MSD — keeping in mind IRD have notified the customer that their child support payment was paid directly to MSD. 11) How much child support money is transfer moved between MSD & IRD accounts on the daily, weekly, monthly and per annum? 12) Also be sure to include all decision making process data/information notes especially related to child support payment collections and disbursements I want to see all the notes and advice given from senior executives including ministers or the government so I can determine or understand whether or not the laws were applied correctly. I want everything related to child support. Questions 1, 2, and 10a Questions which require an agency to form an opinion or provide an explanation are not considered a request for official information, and are therefore not subject to the provisions of the OIA. All government departments are part of the Crown. Money is not transferred from Inland Revenue’s bank account to the Ministry of Social Development’s (MSD) account. Question 3 Inland Revenue has noted your comments and will amend the wording in myIR. Inland Revenue is continuously working to improve its services to its customers. For receiving carers, myIR shows up-to-date information about their child support entitlement and any payments that have been made to them. For receiving carers who are beneficiaries, myIR sets out their entitlement, the amount that has been retained by the Crown to offset their benefit, and the amount of child support in excess of their benefit that has been paid to them. For liable parents, myIR does not show a breakdown of payment distribution. This is because to do so would breach the receiving carer’s privacy. Question 4 Inland Revenue is unable to provide this information as we do not record customer contacts to the level of detail requested. This part of your request is therefore refused under section 18(g) of the OIA, as the information requested is not held by Inland Revenue and I do not believe that the information is held by or more closely connected with the functions of another agency. However, Inland Revenue can advise that, from 1 April 2022 to 31 May 2023, it received 79,751 web messages about child support and answered 158,957 calls about child support. Questions 6 and 7 The following table shows child support payments collected from liable parents, the amounts retained by the Crown, and the amounts paid to receiving carers f or the last six financial years. The table shows child support payments to all carers (not just payments where the carer may be receiving a benefit). 4 Ref: 23OIA2395 N OE XR N OE XR N OE XR \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Question 9 The number of complaints received about child support from 1 January 2018 to 6 July 2023 is 5,405. The number of complaints includes calls that were escalated when customers have called the contact centre, and formal complaints managed by Inland Revenue’s Complaints Management Service. Complaints about child support can include many topics, such as child support liability, child support deductions, child support payments not received, collection processes, assessments, objections, applications for administrative reviews (a departure from the formula assessment), changes in care circumstances, debt, and refunds offset to arrears. The details of complaints received, investigated and resolved cannot be made available without substantial manual collation and research. In addition, records of child support complaints contain sensitive personal details that are considered sensitive revenue information as they are reasonably capable of being used to indirectly identify taxpayers. Sensitive revenue information can only be released in certain circumstances, as set out in section 18D to 18J and schedule 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). In this case, there are no grounds that permit me to release this information to you. Therefore, this part of your request is refused under section 18(c)(i) of the OIA as releasing this information would be contrary to section 18 of the TAA, and under section 18(f) of the OIA, as the information cannot be made available without substantial collation and research. Question 10 Inland Revenue deals with customers in good faith and provides as much information as possible to assist people on a case-by -case basis. The help it gives is based on the information the customer provides and the issue being discussed. This part of your request is therefore refused under section 18(g) of the OIA, as the information is not held by Inland Revenue, and I do not believe that the information is held by or more closely connected with the functions of another agency. Question 10b There has been a substantial downward trend on the number of phone calls received regarding child support matters over the past 6 years. Changes to Inland Revenue’s c hild support system were introduced in 2021 as part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation. These changes have provided more efficient digital and other services for customers which have had a positive effect on how often customers need to communicate with Inland Revenue over the phone. I am releasing, attached as Appendix A, the number of calls that customers made to Inland Revenue’s c hild support phone numbers per month from October 2017 to June 2023. The daily number of calls cannot be made available without substantial manual collation. Therefore, this part of your request is refused under section 18(f) of the OIA, as the information cannot be made available without substantial collation. Question 10c Inland Revenue regularly suggests that customers contact MSD. This can be for a variety of reasons. Inland Revenue is unable to determine how many times it has referred customers to MSD, as it do es not record customer contacts to the level of detail requested. Therefore, this part of your request is refused under section 18(g) of the OIA, as the information requested is not held by Inland Revenue and I do not believe that the information is held by or more closely connected with the functions of another agency. 5 Ref: 23OIA2395 N OE XR N OE XR N OE XR \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Question 11 All government departments are part of the Crown. Money is not transferred from Inland Revenue’s bank account to MSD’s account. Therefore, this part of your request is refused under section 18(g) of the OIA, as the information requested is not held by Inland Revenue and I do not believe that the information is held by or more closely connected with the functions of another agency. Rights of review If you disagree with my decision on your OIA request, you can ask an Inland Revenue review officer to review my decision. To ask for an internal review, please email: CommissionersCorrespondence@ird.govt.nz. Alternatively, under section 28(3) of the OIA, you have the right to ask the Ombudsman to investigate and review my decision.

You requested the following (numbered for responding): I’d like to request the following information relating to issues concerning accredited employers and alleged abuse of the accredited employer work visa, for the period Dec 2022 to July 19 1.Any documents, memos, briefings, meeting minutes, investigations, reports 2.Any internal correspondence on the matter 3.Any correspondence on the matter with INZ 4.Any correspondence on the matter with the former minister of immigration Michael Wood and the current minister of immigration Andrew Little Item 1 Inland Revenue has not produced any documents, memos, briefings, meeting minutes, investigations, or reports relating to alleged abuse of the accredited employer work visa for the period December 2022 through July 2023. This request is therefore refused under section 18(e) of the OIA, the documents alleged to contain the information requested do not exist. Item 2 One email in scope of your request is attached. Where some information in the documents is withheld, the relevant withholding ground of the OIA is specified in the document. An explanation of the withholding grounds follows: •Section 9(2)(a) – to protect the privacy of natural persons. •Section 18(c)(i) – making the requested information available would be contrary to the provisions of section 18(1) and section 18(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). Disclosure of this information does not fall within any of the exceptions to the confidentiality obligation listed in sections 18D to 18J of the TAA. Item 3 & 4 Inland Revenue has not communicated with Immigration New Zealand regarding the alleged abuse of the accredited employer work visa between December 2022 and July 2023. Your request for correspondence on this subject is therefore refused under section 18(e) of the OIA, the documents alleged to contain the information requested do not exist. Inland Revenue has not communicated with the former Minister of Immigration, Michael Wood, nor the current Minister of Immigration, Andrew Little, regarding the alleged abuse of the accredited employer work visa between December 2022 and July 2023. Your request for correspondence on this subject is therefore refused under section 18(e) of the OIA, the documents alleged to contain the information requested do not exist. Page 2 of 2 Ref: 24OIA1082 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] As is required by section 9(1) of the OIA, I have considered whether the grounds for withholding the information required are outweighed by other public interest considerations which would make it desirable to make this information available. In this instance, I do not consider that to be the case. Right of Review If you disagree with my decisions on your OIA request, you can ask an Inland Revenue review officer to review my decisions. To ask for an internal review, please email the Commissioner of Inland Revenue via: CommissionersCorrespondence@ird.govt.nz.

www.ird.govt.nz Page 1 of 2 Ref: 24OIA1159 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 21 August20 23 Dear Thank you for your request made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA), received on 7 August 2023. You requested the following: This is a request under the OIA as the guidance provided either on the IRD website or call centre is inconsistent and incomplete. The simple question is how should an individual working through a company apply scheduler payments. Scenario: Individual X works for a company that they a Director and Shareholder. The company gets a contract with an intermediary which insists on applying schedular payment rules to the fees paid. Question 1) Should the schedular payments tax rate be attributable to the individual or company. Question 2) As the contract is with the company, how should expenses handled and attributed between the individual and the company. Question 3) Please provide a complete guide to paying taxes when a) there is a mix of schedular payments and non-schedular payments b) when all payments to the company are subject to schedular payments. It should be a priority for the IRD to help individuals and companies by providing clear and guidance in regard to completing the tax returns accurately. unfortunately there rules around schedular payments are opaque, and depending who you speak to at the IRD conflicting information is provided. Your first two questions do not constitute a request for official information under the OIA, rather they are requests fo r tax advice. Official information is any information held by an agency subject to the OIA. This includes: •documents, reports, memoranda, letters, emails and drafts •non-written information, such as video or tape recordings •the reasons for any decisions that have been made about you •manuals that set out internal rules, principles, policies or guidelines for decision- making •agendas and minutes of meetings, including those not open to the public The OIA does not require agencies such as Inland Revenue to provide advice 1 . I recommend you get in touch with a tax agent for assistance. Question 3 Inland Revenue does not have a ‘complete’ guide in relation to tax treatment of schedular payments as part of a company’s income. This part of your request is therefore refused under section 18(e) of the OIA, the document alleged to contain the information requested does not exist. The treatment of tax varies between companies and individuals and is dependent on factors such as their remuneration structure, shareholder-employee relationships, and income sources. 1 Your ability to request official information | Ombudsman New Zealand Page 2 of 2 Ref: 24OIA1159 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] If a company receives scheduler and non-scheduler income, tax is deducted from the schedular income (commonly referred to as tax credits), while the non-scheduler income may not have tax deducted. Tax credits are used to offset the total tax liability for an entity or individual at the end of the tax year after expenses are deducted from their income. If the tax credits are not sufficient to cover the total tax liability, the entity or individual would need to make payment to clear the remaining balance. Depending on the remaining tax liability, a provisional tax liability may also be applicable. In some circumstances, tax credits from schedular income made to a company may be attributed to shareholder-employees. Further information on this can be found on Inland Revenue’s website: Transferring tax credits to shareholder-employees (ird.govt.nz). If you wish to stop tax being deducted from schedular payments, then you may want to apply to Inland Revenue for a certificate of exemption or a 0% tailored tax rate. Further information on this can be found on Inland Revenue’s website: Which tailored tax option is right for me? (ird.govt.nz). Filing the applicable tax returns under the entity or individual is dependent on the chosen legal tax treatment and how the income and tax credits were distributed. If you are unsure about how to best apply the applicable tax legislation, please seek advice from a tax agent. The following guides may be helpful to you, which are available on Inland Revenue’s website: •Understanding schedular payments for contractors: ir1029-2017.pdf (ird.govt.nz) •How income is declared on a company’s IR4: File a Companies income tax return - IR4 (ird.govt.nz) •How to declare shareholder-employee salary on an individual’s IR3: Complete my individual income tax return - IR3 (ird.govt.nz) •How to pay tax debt: Ways of paying (ird.govt.nz) Right of Review If you disagree with my decision on your OIA request, you can ask an Inland Revenue review officer to review my decision. To ask for an internal review, please email the Commissioner of Inland Revenue via: CommissionersCorrespondence@ird.govt.nz. Alternatively, under section 28(3) of the OIA, you have the right to ask the Ombudsman to investigate and review my decision.

Page 1 of 3 Ref: 24 OIA1133 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 29 August 2023 Dear T hank you for your request made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA), received on 1 August 2023. You requested the following: For the 2021/22 tax year The number of taxpayers who used: • The Accounting Income Method • The Standard Option • The Estimation Option • The Ratio Option. The total value of Residual Income Tax for taxpayers using each method listed above. In terms of tax collected, I’m interested in the total value of tax payable (provisional tax + terminal tax) – excluding any taxpayers who were in a loss or were not above the provisional tax threshold. Therefore, I think the best indicator would be the combined Residual Income Tax figure for the provisional taxpayers under this method. Safeharbour taxpayers The number of provisional taxpayers that RIT of less than $60k. The related “safe harbour concept” is an important distinction under the standard option. For the 2022/23 tax year The number of taxpayers currently using each method: • The Accounting Income Method • The Standard Option • The Estimation Option • The Ratio Option. The value of the provisional tax obligations of taxpayers using each method listed above. Extent of the use of new discretion for tax pooling We’d also interested in the extent of the use of the Commissioner’s new tax pooling discretion under the Income Tax Act 2007 RP17B(12)-(13). https://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2007/0097/latest/DLM2630341.html We’re particularly interested in: • the number of applications have been made, • the type of taxes involved (e.g. FBT, GST, DWT, NRWT etc.) and • whether applications are generally being successful or not. Can you please advise in aggregate and by tax type: • The number of taxpayers how have applied, www.ird.govt.nz Page 2 of 3 Ref: 24 OIA1133 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] • The value of the tax they have applied for, • In the number of taxpayers who have been approved • In the number of taxpayers who have been declined. Where applications have been declined, please advise the main reasons for applications being denied, for example: • The voluntary disclosure was not made “within reasonable time” • Commissioner is not satisfied the taxpayer met the criteria under Subsection 13: e.g. failure to take reasonable steps to comply. The information you have requested is enclosed as Appe ndix A. An application for the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to exercise discretion under section RP 17B(12)-(13) of the Income Tax Act 2007 can be made through various channels (e.g., phone or web message via myIR), rather than through a specific form, and is not recorded in a way that is easily retrievable. We have, however, identified some applications which are outlined in Appendix A . Please note, this does not provide a full picture of all applications. We estimate this to be approximately 95% of all applications received since April 2022. Some of the main reasons applications are declined are: • The Commissioner is not satisfied that the taxpayer has taken reasonable care to comply with their obligations. • The return is treated as a late filed return and not a voluntary disclosure. The total value of all applications made is not easily retrievable as this is not able to be queried by our internal systems, and the value of each application is not necessarily specified in the request. Obtaining this information would require a manual search, review, and calculation of all correspondence within scope, across multiple tax types and years. Your request for this information is therefore refused under section 18(f) of the OIA, as the information cannot be made without substantial collation or research. Right of review If you disagree with my decision on your OIA request, you can ask an Inland Revenue review officer to review my decision. To ask for an internal review, please email the Commissioner of Inland Revenue at: commissionerscorrespondence@ird.govt.nz . Alternatively, under section 28(3) of the OIA, you have the right to ask the Ombudsman to investigate and review my decision.

www.ird.govt.nz Ref: 24 OIA1186 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 8 September 2023 Dear Th ank you for your request made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA), received on 13 August 2023. You requested the following: ...all of IRD'S policies/documents etc that speak on the topic of ACC backdated weekly compensation and how each step is set out, including how taxes are paid, what benefits are paid back to Work and Income and how it is backdated to specific years. Inland Revenue does not administer Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) backdated payments. There are no Inland Revenue policies/documents that specify how each step is set out, including how taxes are paid and what benefits are paid back to Work and Income and how it is backdated to specific years. I am therefore refusing your request under section 18(e) of the OIA, as the documents alleged to contain the information requested do not exist. Information, including policies related to backdated weekly compensation, is available on ACC’s website (acc.co.nz) by searching for “backdated weekly compensation”. However, you may find the following information from Inland Revenue’s internal knowledge base for staff on guidelines on the taxation of ACC lump sum payments useful. Internal guidelines on the taxation of ACC lump sum payments If the taxpayer is entitled to a backdated payment, ACC will provide them with an information sheet explaining when a backdated compensation applies and how the amount is calculated. Taxpayers who were entitled to ACC weekly compensation but did not receive it, may be entitled to a backdated payment. Any backdated payment received from ACC is considered to be taxable income in the year in which the customer receives it. This can increase the taxpayer’s tax liability for the year and also impact their Working for Families entitlement, Child Support obligations, or student loan repayments. The lump sum is taxed by ACC as normal under PAYE rules (being a current year receipt and taxable in the year of receipt as an extra pay). This amount is reflected in the employment information provided to Inland Revenue by ACC. Lump sum payments Lump sum payments (also called extra pays) include: • annual or special bonuses (regular bonuses aren't included and should be taxed as per normal) • cashed up holiday pay • retiring or redundancy payments Ref: 24 OIA1186 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] • payments for accepting restrictive covenants • exit inducement payments • gratuities • remedial payments • lump sum holiday pay • employee share scheme benefits If a customer believes they will be overtaxed on their lump sum payment (usually if they have more than one job) they can apply for a tailored tax code. The employee can also elect to have their lump sum/bonus/allowance taxed at a higher rate, for example if they have another job or other untaxed income. The employee needs to advise the employer if they want a higher rate to apply and this rate is used in the calculation. Details required for calculation • Tax code • Payment frequency • Date of calculation • Lump sum figure (gross or net) • Last four weeks income from this employer More information on this can be found on Inland Revenue’s website (ird.govt.nz) by searching for “Calculate PAYE for a lump sum payment.” As indicated in the above guidelines, tax law currently treats backdated multi-year lump sum payments, from ACC and other payers, as income in the year that the payment is received. Generally, any reimbursement required to Work and Income for benefits paid and taxed in previous tax years will be deducted before ACC complete their tax calculation. If you are applying for backdated weekly compensation, you can consider applying for a tax code, tailored to your circumstances, once you are made aware of the likely taxable amount you will receive. You can do this through the myIR secure online service. Any deduction will be an interim amount, it will not be until after the end of the tax year that your income tax assessment is finalised. Proposed Government change to tax treatment of ACC lump sum payments The Government is currently proposing a change to the current tax treatment of ACC lump sum payments which, if passed, would apply to payments made after 1 April 2024. The proposed change would tax those payments at the recipient’s average tax rate calculated over the four years prior to the year of receipt of the payment. This proposal is contained in a Bill which is currently being reviewed by the Finance and Expenditure Committee. Details of the proposed change can be found within the Bill commentary (page 95) on Inland Revenue’s tax policy website at: www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/-/media/project/ir/tp/publications/2023/2023-revised- commentary-multinatonal-tax-bill/2023-revised-commentary-multinatonal-tax-bill- pdf.pdf?modified=20230531042748&modified=20230531042748 If you have any enquiries about your specific case, I encourage you to send a web message via your myIR account.
www.ird.govt.nz Page 1 of5 Ref: 24OIA1237 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE XTERNAL\] \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 13 September2023 Dear Thank you for your request made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA), received on 28 August 2023. On 18 August 2023, you clarified your understanding of the Working for Families and Best Start Tax Credits (BSTC) with further requests under the OIA. The request has been numbered for convenience, with items 1,2 and 4 included from your correspondence of 18 August: 1.Parent can apply for Best Start Payments as soon as their baby is born. They can apply through the following ways: •Via MyIR online account (Is this data-free?) •0800 phone number •Submitting a form online (data-free?) •Completing the Smart Start form which generates an IRD number and messages IRD to access eligibility of family for payments (not data free form). 2.Families may be eligible for other working for families tax credit which is calculated based on family income and number of children (is this correct?). 3.(...) we would like to request IRD data for Best Start Payments for babies born in NZ from 01 July 2021 to 30 June 2022, the same birth cohort as was reviewed by DIA. Data on days from date of birth to sustained Best Start Payment (I understand that Best Start payments have a grace period of 8 weeks, after which payments will be suspended if a Birth registration is incomplete). Data categories: 0-30 days from date of birth, 31-42 days, 43-90 days, 91-120 days, 121-365 days, >365 days, by prioritised ethnicity group and socioeconomic deprivation quintile. 4.Our discussion today has led me to believe that 4% of NZ Māori infants families are remaining ineligible to receive Best Start Payments due to having incomplete birth registration. Is this correct? Question 1 Inland Revenue does not provide data-free access to Inland Revenue’s website or myIR. Inland Revenue understands that SmartStart registration, although free, also requires internet access. When registering for BSTC through SmartStart, a client does not need to provide a birth certificate as they are registering their baby at the same time as getting an IRD number. If instead choosing to register online directly with Inland Revenue, the required evidence (birth certificate or passport proof of identity) is required to get an IRD number for the infant. The latter is required for payments to continue beyond the 8-week grace period. Question 2 Families who receive the BSTC may also be eligible for other Working for Families tax credits (Family Tax Credit, Minimum Family Tax Credit or In-Work Tax Credit). A family’s Page 2 of 5 Ref: 24OIA1237 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE XTERNAL\] \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] entitlement to Working for Families tax credits is based on the number of children the family has, the family income and other eligibility criteria. To be eligible for Working for Families tax credits, the parent applying must be a New Zealand resident for a continuous period of 12 months and tax resident in New Zealand at the time of applying for Working for Families tax credits, or their child they are claiming for must be a New Zealand resident and present in New Zealand for the entitlement period. Eligibility for some credits also varies based on whether the family is in work or not receiving a welfare benefit. Information on eligibility for each credit can be found on Inland Revenue’s website: https://www.ird.govt.nz/working-for-families/payment-types. Entitlements also abate as income rises. The Minimum Family tax credit provides a guaranteed minimum after tax income and so disappears at the same rate that after-tax income grows. The other two credits are combined and then abate at a rate of 27 cents in the dollar for each dollar earned above a family income threshold of $42,700. Question 3 Inland Revenue does not collect information on ethnicity 1 or the socioeconomic deprivation of our Working for Families customers. I am therefore refusing this part of your request under section 18(g), as the information requested is not held by Inland Revenue, and I do not believe it is held in entirety by another agency. Regarding the remainder of this question, which is focused on lags, it may be useful to outline the complexities of Working for Families administration, which will mean that the information held by Inland Revenue may not suit your needs. Administration split between agencies People in receipt of welfare benefits primarily receive their Working for Families entitlements from Work and Income NZ (WINZ). A subset (but not all) will later interact with Inland Revenue at year end. Other recipients receive their entitlements from Inland Revenue, and they have a choice of whether to receive regular up-front payments squared up at year end, or a lump sum at year end only. Due to dual agency administration, no one agency has a complete picture of all recipients of BSTC customers. There is some information passed between agencies for a subset of clients although this is inevitably with a lag. Therefore, Inland Revenue is unable to comprehensively identify all BSTC families interacting with WINZ and the payments they receive. Lagged Entitlement and Claims There are multiple areas where the administration of BSTC, and Working for Families credits more generally create lags. This either reflects that eligibility is lagged, information flows are lagged, or that some people may prefer lump sum claims and defer their applications accordingly. Some examples are: •BSTC eligibility commences only once entitlement to Paid Parental Leave (PPL), if any, expires. Customers are not able to receive both PPL and BSTC at the same time. For these customers, BSTC will be paid after the end of the PPL payments, generally up to 5 or 6 months after the birth of their baby. •Instead of weekly or fortnightly payments, people can opt for a lump sum (year- end only) entitlement. •Eligibility for most Working for Families credits requires family income information to determine entitlement. This is established on March-year income tax returns, which in turn can take up to an additional year to be filed if either parent is using a tax agent with extension of time filing. For example, customers with tax agents have until March 2024 before their 2023 income tax return is due. 1 Ethnicity of the infant is collected with SmartStart registration, but the ethnicity information is not passed to or held by Inland Revenue Page 3 of 5 Ref: 24OIA1237 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE XTERNAL\] \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] • People may prefer that their entire Working for Families credits, which includes BSTC, are administered all together. • As noted above, he two-agency administration can create lags where clients are moving from one agency to the other, or where Inland Revenue is calculating square-ups for WINZ customers. As a result of these lags, you may find that information based on the administrative timing of BSTC registrations may not suit the purpose of your request. As Inland Revenue does not hold comprehensive information on the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) registration and payments of BSTC, this part of your request is refused under section 18(g) of the OIA, as the information requested is not held by Inland Revenue, and I do not believe it is held in entirety by another agency. Question 4 Inland Revenue does not hold information on ethnicity of clients and does not hold information which would allow us to verify or reject your statement. This part of your request is refused under section 18(g) of the OIA, as the requested information is not held by Inland Revenue. Related information Inland Revenue does hold information that may assist in a broader context, described below. This is limited to the subset of BSTC and Working for Families clients held on Inland Revenue’s systems. It will exclude WINZ-only clients unless there was some reason for them to register with Inland Revenue. To date, Inland Revenue has received 55,335 registrations of children with a birth date between 1 July 2021 and 30 June 2022. Of these registrations: • 6,413 children are to parents receiving Working for Families payments by WINZ. • 40,950 children are to parents that are not in the first group and who have elected to receive upfront BSTC payments from Inland Revenue. • 4,391 children are to parents that have instead received their BSTC via a lump sum payment from Inland Revenue when filing their tax return. • 3,601 children are to parents that have not received a BSTC payment. Some examples of reasons why not (not exhaustive) include: - Either the child or parents are not eligible to receive Working for Families tax credits, or the child does not yet have an IRD number. - a tax return has not yet been filed, - in the case of a family receiving Working for Families tax credits from WINZ, the person registering the child with Inland Revenue is not the person receiving the Working for Families payments from WINZ and therefore no link can be identified. The table attached as Appendix A provides the timeframe between the date of birth of the child and the registration 2 date with Inland Revenue and counts of WINZ clients known to Inland Revenue and Inland Revenue clients receiving BSTC. The table is intended to provide an indication about how different administrative treatments can cause different lags. An ordering rule (left to right) was used to keep the columns of the table mutually exclusive.

Page 1 of 2 Re f: 24 OIA1210 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 15 S eptember 2023 De ar Thank you for your request made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA), received on 18 August 2023. You requested the following: 1.Can you forward the legislation that states that I must remain registered for GST once the 60k threshold has been reached and that as a business you must remain registered for GST in the following financial year without any exceptions please. 2.If there are exceptions within the legislation then I am requesting all documentation in regards to this. 3.What protocols are in place if misinformation I have received from an IRD representative has resulted in a bill that I would have otherwise paid please. Question 1 The GST registration and registration cessation requirements are contained in sections 51 to 54 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act). Section 51 specifies when a person must register and section 52 covers when a person may cease their GST registration. Sections 53 and 54 set out other notification and liability requirements. In accordance with section 51(1)(a) and (b) of the GST Act, if you are carrying on a taxable activity you must be registered for GST if your turnover was over $60,000 in the last 12 months and/or there are reasonable grounds for believing the turnover will exceed $60,000 for the next 12 months. Upon request, section 52 allows an existing registration to be cancelled where the Commissioner of Inland Revenue is satisfied taxable supplies won’t exceed $60,000 in the next 12 months. Where the registered person ceases to carry on a taxable activity, they must notify the Commissioner to cancel the registration within 21 days. The 12 month timeframes referred to in sections 51 and 52 relate to any 12 consecutive months and are not linked to a financial year. The information you have requested can be found on www.legislation.govt.nz by searching for “Goods and Services Tax Act 1985” or ”GST Act”. As such, this part of your request is refused under section 18(d) of the OIA, the information requested is publicly available. Question 2 As referred to in the legislative references above, a person will not be liable to be registered if the Commissioner is satisfied their supplies for the next 12-months will not exceed the $60,000 threshold. At this time a person meeting the requirements may request to have an existing GST registration cancelled. In respect of not being liable to be registered, or ceasing an existing registration, sufficient supporting information should be provided to satisfy the Commissioner of the reasonable grounds relied upon to expect that turnover will not exceed $60,000 in the next 12 months. Information to be provided is not prescribed but is determined on a case-by-case basis specific to the given circumstances. www.ird.govt.nz Page 2 of 2 Ref: 24 OIA1210 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] As such, this part of your request is refused under section 18(e) of the OIA, the document alleged to contain the information requested does not exist. Question 3 If a person believes they have received incorrect information from Inland Revenue, it is recommended they contact Inland Revenue and provide details of the situation including the information that was provided by the person to Inland Revenue, the information believed to be incorrect received from Inland Revenue, and how this has had an adverse effect on their tax position. From there, an appropriate course of action can be determined. Inland Revenue does not have a set protocol, but instead determines what steps to take after a customer has advised us of the issue. As such, this part of your request is refused under section 18(e), the document alleged to contain the information requested does not exist. Further information outlining the different circumstances where the Commissioner’s advice may be incorrect, and the relevant outcomes, can be found on Inland Revenue’s tax technical website www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz by searching for “Status of Commissioner’s advice”. Right of Review If you disagree with my decisions on your OIA request, you can ask an Inland Revenue review officer to review my decisions. To ask for an internal review, please email the Commissioner of Inland Revenue via: CommissionersCorrespondence@ird.govt.nz. Alternatively, under section 28(3) of the OIA, you have the right to ask the Ombudsman to investigate and review my decision. You can contact the office of the Ombudsman via email at: info@ombudsman.parliament.nz. If you choose to have an internal review, you can still ask the Ombudsman for a review. Publishing of OIA response Please note that Inland Revenue regularly publishes responses to requests that may be of interest to the wider public on its website. We consider this response is of public interest so will publish this response in due course. Your personal details or any information that would identify you will be removed prior to it being published. Thank you for your request.

www.ird.govt.nz Page 1 of 2 Ref: 24 OIA1283 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 19 Septem ber2023 Dear Th ank you for your request made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA), received on 11 September 2023. You requested the following (numbered for ease of response): (...) Please supply the following information under the Official Information Act (OIA): 1.Policies guidelines and/or general information provided to IRD employees regarding working from home or other flexible/remote/hybrid working arrangements that were in effect before 21 March 2020. 2.Policies, guidelines, and/or general information provided to IRD employees regarding working from home or other flexible/remote/hybrid working arrangements that have been put in place or changed on or after 21 March 2020. 3.Policies, guidelines, and/or general information regarding reasonable accommodations for disabled employees at IRD that were in effect before 21 March 2020. 4.Policies, guidelines, and/or general information regarding reasonable accommodations for disabled employees at IRD that have been put in place or changed on or after 21 March 2020. Flexible working at Inland Revenue Most working arrangements at Inland Revenue are informal. The balance of home and office-based hours depends on the employee’s type of work, individual situation, and the needs of the business. Inland Revenue employees are generally expected to work in the office more than they would from home. However, there are no set rules to Inland Revenue’s approach to flexible working and there are currently no plans to change this. You can find more information on Inland Revenue’s flexible working approach on our website at ird.govt.nz. Items 1 to 3 The information you have requested is enclosed. The table on the following page provides a description of each document being released. Some information contained in the documents has not been considered for release and has been withheld as it is not in scope of your request. 1 Topic 5 – Flexible Working PEOPLE POLICIES AND GUIDELINES Working from Home Guidelines These guidelines provide information and expectations in relation to working away from an IR office (particularly from home) and outline the process for establishing working from home arrangements. Note: These guidelines apply to working from home in the context of normal business operations. In the event of any crisis or emergency or forced building closure etc. the response and what that might mean in relation to viable work locations and arrangements will be determined as part of specific business continuity planning for the event. IR’s Adverse Event Guidelines provide information on attendance and leave when an adverse event impacts the ability to attend the office (immediate or short-term response). It’s important that our people feel connected, included, and have a sense of belonging no matter where they work. Any arrangements need to balance individual, team, and business needs. Flexible location (as described in our policy) is only one type of the broader options that fall under the banner of flexible working. It relates to the options that might be available in relation to where work is performed. As far as ‘work location’ Inland Revenue is primarily an office-based organisation, with most people working most of the time in an IR office. Working all your working hours from home is unlikely to meet IR business needs. This is consistent with government expectations and we know that being in the office and connecting face-to-face has lots of benefits to the way we work and learn, as well as supporting important social interaction. An office presence is part of how we best service the needs of our internal and external customers/stakeholders and deliver on business priorities. Working from home doesn’t automatically change your existing arrangements regarding your working window and hours of work. Requests for flexibility in work location, just like other types of flexibility will be considered on a case by case basis and can be formal and informal, as covered in the policy, and the formal and informal guidelines. If having reviewed the relevant policy and guidelines you have any questions around working from home, you should talk with your leader. You can also seek advice from your union both generally and in relation to a particular request etc. Leaders can seek advice from People & Workplace Services: Appendix B Not in scope 6 Your workstation: In your home it’s expected that your work area is set up to ensure you can work safely. Your workstation should be arranged so that it is comfortable and ergonomically sound, and the space should be kept clear and free from obstacles or tripping hazards. You need to assess your intended workspace and confirm whether it is acceptable (the Working from Home Checklist supports this and includes workstation set up guidance). A virtual assessment may be a requirement if you’re working predominately at home. If you move around your home during your workday you must ensure each workspace is hazard free and ergonomically sound. If you have any concerns around your home workstation, please discuss them with your leader. Work/non-work injury: If you have an accident whilst working at home, this may be considered a work-related incident, however this depends on the circumstances of the incident and activity being undertaken (work vs non work activities). For any incidents, you should seek medical treatment if required and report the incident. Your wellbeing: You need to ensure you are managing your workload and fatigue/ taking appropriate breaks/ keeping connected / staying safe and are generally taking care of yourself. Keeping in touch with your leader can help ensure they are aware of any wellbeing concerns and if the arrangement isn’t working for you for any reason. You can check out our Hauora Hub for general wellbeing information and EAP contact information etc. Online H&S reporting: The H&S reporting requirements remain the same from home. You must report any incidents/accidents or discomfort using the Online H&S Reporting tool. Required Working from Home Checklist: (Quick link on the Flexible Working hub: Working from Home page). Everyone working from home in any regular way (formally or informally) must complete the checklist as part of the approval process. If working from home continues to be your practice, this checklist will need to be revisited at least annually and/or to reflect any change in ‘home’ location/s etc. If your working environment is not safe, or you don’t have the required equipment then this would prohibit your ability to utilise this flexible working option. INFORMATION SECURITY AND PRIVACY It’s important you are always vigilant about the personal or customer information you are working with and the risks associated with that information. We are all required to keep IR information confidential (Section 18, Tax Administration Act). That is a constant, irrespective of where you are working. When working away from the office the risk of inadvertently disclosing personal and customer information to others needs to be carefully managed. This includes ensuring screens aren’t visible/ household members don’t have access to your device/ conversations involving sensitive information can’t be overheard/ and IR material is appropriately stored. The normal expectations around business tools, clear desk practices, passwords etc. and conduct expectations continue to apply and any data or privacy breaches must be reported through normal channels. You need to take care when transporting documents between office and home, ensuring the documents are secured in a closed bag and that you dispose of IR documents and information appropriately. 7 ABLE TO MEANINGFULLY PERFORM WORK In any working from home arrangements ‘working’ is the key purpose of the arrangement. As such the ability for you to meaningfully perform work, in a focused way, free of distraction is a key consideration. It’s important both for work quality and productivity and your own health, safety, and wellbeing that you are not distracted or taking on too much and are taking the breaks and time for rest and relaxation you need. For that reason, the most appropriate option in these ‘juggling’ scenarios needs to be carefully considered and may involve a mixed approach to try to get the balance right. Caring for dependants It’s important not to treat working from home as a substitute for childcare or dependant care. When working from home you will structure any personal/childcare arrangements so you can complete your work as you would normally. Trying to manage your normal IR duties and the important but distinctively separate role of caring for children or dependants at the same time, can compromise both tasks. Leaders need to consider on a case by case basis the degree to which meaningful work is possible. It’s recognised that from time to time there may be some overlaps, particularly in relation to school holidays or before or after school care. The level of care and attention required by the dependant (e.g. child’s age) and the duration of the overlap period may influence the decision. It may be that other flexibility can make these arrangements more feasible. For school holidays for example, a variation in start and finish times so some work can be done before children are awake or after they are in bed/ mix of leave and working from home/ mix of childcare or school holiday programmes and working from home around the edges/ using flexi- credits for some shorter days etc. Other flexible options may better support caring for dependants, for example: part-time hours or using salary trade to purchase additional annual leave to support having some more leave to help cover the school holidays etc. Dependant sick leave: It may make sense to work from home when a dependant is unwell depending on the nature of illness/injury and the extent to which you are actively required to take on the caring role. You may feel you can work your usual day/hours or only part of them. You may be able to agree with your leader regarding a mix of sick leave and working time, based on how much time you were able to work uninterrupted. There is a specific entitlement to sick leave (which includes care for a dependant) and if active care is required this would be the most appropriate option. While you are sick or injured Generally, if you are unwell then you should take sick leave as intended and focus on your rest and recovery. Irrespective of working from home or not you have the same requirement to notify your leader as soon as possible. In some cases, you may feel well enough to work, but want to avoid going into the office to prevent passing on your illness (e.g. a light cold) or disrupting others (noisy cough etc). Likewise, you may have an injury that you feel able to work with, but it makes travelling and getting to the office more challenging so working from home might be more appropriate. 8 You may be able to agree with your leader to work from home in these types of situations, or the ability to reflect a mix of sick leave and working time, based on how much time you were actually able to work. An arrangement to work from home if you are recovering from an operation, or illness or injury (with medical certificate clearance that allows you to work from home) may be agreed on a case by case basis, or form part of a return to work plan. You should not be working where a medical certificate indicates you are unable to work. While you are on holiday/ annual leave/ not working Technology and working from home arrangements mean our work can come with us, and we can access it outside of a traditional working window. That doesn’t mean you should. If you’re on annual leave you should not be working. Make sure you take the time for rest and relaxation. SECURITY AND ACCESS TO YOUR HOME You must not meet with customers or external business contacts or have them visit you in your home. IR has robust security arrangements and fit for purpose facilities in the office for meeting with customers, non-IR business contacts and your colleagues. On rare occasions, when you are working from home there may be the need for IR/ your leader/ union representatives etc. to visit you. They would only come into your home with your permission. COSTS AND EXPENSES As noted in the Flexible Working Policy, there will be no additional compensation or allowance for expenses arising from a request to work from home, as part of flexible working. If you elect to work from home and access the wider benefits that flexible working offers, you won’t be reimbursed for general household expenses. Any increases in general household costs are potentially counterbalanced by related expenditure decreases, e.g. parking, travel. Leaders may continue to approve reimbursement for legitimate claims of actual and reasonable business expenses that arise in the course of your work, e.g. the cost of specific toll calls made to customers, on the production of receipts. Your leader needs to consider the tax status of any claim, and can seek advice from Finance or refer to the Tax Manual. Any travel between the home and office is in your own time and your own cost. Exceptions to this can be considered on a case by case basis (for example if it’s pre-agreed that you are working from home and are then requested by IR to come into the office at short notice, part way through your working day, then payment of the travel time (T1) would likely be appropriate). 9 EQUIPMENT AND TOOLS IR generally only provides one full set of IT/office equipment. As we are primarily office based then usually that equipment needs to be in the office. The equipment and tools required and whether they are provisioned by IR or personally should be discussed with your leader and considered as part of any request to work from home. Suitable and reliable network connectivity (with necessary bandwidth for work efficiency) is a prerequisite for working from home and is at your own cost. It may be achieved via home Wi- Fi or hotspotting from a personal mobile phone. IR data SIMS are not intended to support working from home as they are for brief and occasional use only, where no Wi-Fi networks are available. Some unique set up requirements e.g. a sit/stand desk can only be provided for in the office and may prevent you from working from home. Employees may make requests for reasonable accommodation(s) to assist in managing disabilities in line with the Guidelines. The Use of Business Tools policy and guidelines continue to apply when working from home. You must take reasonable steps to keep IR’s technology, equipment and information safe and in working order. Any IR owned equipment (laptop etc.) that you are using to support working from home is IR property and normal process should be followed if this equipment is lost, stolen or damaged. It is insured by IR and does not need to be covered in your personal/home insurance. If unforeseen circumstances (e.g. power outage, Wi-Fi interruption, equipment failure) mean you can’t perform your IR duties from home, you may need to work from the office (if not also affected) for the period of the disruption. CONDUCT/ MONITORING When working at home you remain bound by our Code of Conduct – Tikanga Whanonga and our policies and guidelines. The “Making the Right Decision Checklist” in the Code is a great tool to make sure you are doing the right thing and acting with integrity no matter where you are working. When working from home your system access and use (e.g. START) remains as per the Code, and your system activity remains monitored at all times. Accurate time reporting and ensuring you work the hours you are scheduled and paid to work each day is essential if you are working from home. 10 Leading teams in a split office/home working model can require leading a little differently. Some tips for leading flexible teams are available on the Flexible Working hub: Tools and Resources Please see IR’s Flexible Working hub for the Flexible Working Policy and other related guidelines and various supporting resources (including those mentioned in this document) Document control v1.

The operational requirements of Inland Revenue and the services we provide for our customers are a priority when we think about how flexibility can work. Where requests are declined the reason will be provided. The focus should be on the business reason for any refusal. There may be scope for further discussion and consideration of alternative options if not already considered before the final decision is made. People should talk to their leader or one up leader if they are unhappy with the decision. Performance or conduct issues, or health and safety concerns could potentially impact on flexible working arrangements. The specific issue or the support interventions may result in restrictions or removal of flexible working (or specific types or flexible working). If requests are made under 6AA ERA, then specific ‘options for refusal’ are detailed in the legislation and our formal flexible working guidelines. The ERA gives a right to a process for a fair and timely consideration of a request. It does not guarantee the approval of the request. If Inland Revenue does not deal with the request in accordance with the specified process (ERA 69AAE), the Act sets out the process for raising disputes in relation to flexible working arrangements. (ERA 69AAG to 69AAK). HEALTH, SAFETY & WELLBEING Access to flexible working can provide great opportunities to support better work-life balance and positively impact engagement and personal wellbeing. Everyone working at Inland Revenue has a responsibility to ensure a safe workplace as per our commitment to safe and healthy work. Inland Revenue has a duty of care to ensure that wherever a person is working is safe and healthy. Any work arrangement should be designed to be healthy, including ensuring fatigue and workload pressures are managed. For example, variations to hours, days or place of work need to consider any workload impacts for the individual and the team, manage fatigue and mitigate other risks to health, safety and wellbeing. Ongoing communications are important to ensure that the arrangement continues to work. CONDUCT Employees remain bound by our Code of Conduct – Tikanga Whanonga and our policies and guidelines irrespective of any flexible working arrangements or a change in hours, days or place of work. This includes health and safety considerations in relation to hours or patterns of work and ensuring a safe workplace/s as mentioned above. When working in different locations such as your own home or in public places the expectations around confidentiality of information, device security, and use of business tools etc. hold true and need to be carefully considered in the context of the working environment. 8 As such Inland Revenue may require assurance around the adequacy of any measures in place or agreed to, in relation to these expectations and reserves the right to with-hold or withdraw permission to work away from an Inland Revenue Office if that assurance cannot be provided. HR DELEGATION: Level 4 (Formal) and Level 5 (Informal) authority is required for hours of work and flexible arrangement related decisions. See the Delegation policy for the specific HR Matrix details. Document control v1, March 2021 (previously Flexible and Remote Working Policy) Review dates Date reviewed: Dec 2021 Next review: Dec 2025 (review may occur sooner if required) Policy owner Domain Lead, People Operations & Policy, People & Workplace Services Policy contact Email the ERP&R team Topic 5 – Flexible Working PEOPLE POLICIES AND GUIDELINES Informal Flexible Working Guidelines These guidelines describe which flexible working arrangements are considered informal and set out the process for requesting and considering various informal arrangements. INFORMAL INCLUDES THINGS LIKE: Flexitime/ ad-hoc or some short-term flexible needs/ some types of working from home (where you remain in the office more than not and days are not set). See the Informal/Formal split table if you are unsure of the type of flexibility you are seeking, and which guidelines and process applies. Where flexible working arrangements alter your terms and conditions around hours, days or place of work and establish a new regular pattern or impact pay or leave, then this is considered a ’formal’ change and you will need to follow the process set out in the Formal Flexible Working Guidelines. Inland Revenue supports and encourages flexible working. Where the changes are relatively simple then the process can generally be simple too. The process and documentation can be scaled up or down depending on the nature of the request. This kind of informal flexibility is intended to provide ’flexibility in a flexible way’ and is expected to be the most common approach to flexible working at IR. It can help you balance things that pop up in your personal life as a one-off or short-term need but can also support some more regular arrangements with fluid practices around when and where you work. Lots of this informal flexibility is already business as usual and established in our employment agreements and/or current flexible working practices. Informal arrangements don’t change your base terms and conditions of employment related to flexibility (e.g. the core arrangements around hours, days or place of work in your employment agreement, offer of appointment, any variation letters etc.) but rather allow flexibility around that base. If having reviewed the relevant policy and guidelines you have any questions around flexible working, you should talk with your leader. Union members may seek advice from their union delegates/ representatives both generally and in relation to a particular request etc. Appendix C2 Leaders can seek advice from People & Workplace Services: if there is any doubt about whether a working arrangement needs to be formalised or not, or for any support needed around flexible working. When is the arrangement ‘informal’? Informal flexible working usually occurs when leaders agree that employees have flexibility over when and where they carry out their work, subject to meeting role responsibilities and deliverables. This can mean that the exact arrangements can vary and are agreed between leaders and employees as and when needed. While these arrangements can be ad-hoc or in response to an event, they can also include more regular arrangements such as changes around start and finish times, or some working from home arrangements (within specific parameters). The change is considered informal if it doesn’t change terms and conditions of employment or impact pay or leave calculations. Often informal arrangements arise from a specific request but can also be part of proactive discussion with your leader or part of parameters in wider team agreements. INFORMAL EXAMPLES Flexible hours/ Flexitime (See the Flexitime Guidelines for more details) Flexitime specifically covers non-standard work hours allowing some flexibility around start, finish, and break times. The aim of flexitime is to enable you to balance your time credits over a period of time. Certain types of Working from Home (See the Working from Home Guidelines – Informal Working from Home section for more details and a full example table) Working from home arrangements span both formal and informal categories. The working from home arrangement is considered ‘informal’ in situations such as: •Ad-hoc/casual arrangements (where things pop up that prompt a one-off request) •Short term or temporary arrangements (generally a few weeks – 12 weeks max) •‘Fluid’ where you work from home less often than in the office, but still with some regularity and flexibility (e.g. generally a day or two at home each week). Other ad-hoc/or short-term location changes Your home is not the only alternate working location that can be sought (e.g. you seek to work at a different IR office or house in a different city for a short period etc.) These changes are only ‘informal’ if they are ad-hoc or short term as above. Using sick or annual leave flexibly Not in scope Flexible leave options such as anticipating annual or sick leave or working from home if you or a dependant are sick etc. might be options that can help with that work-life balance. ALONGSIDE OTHER FLEXIBLE WORKING ARRANGEMENTS Anyone can request informal flexibility including those who already have established formal flexible working arrangements or other informal arrangements in place. It may be possible for them to occur alongside and complement each other e.g. using flexitime while working from home or doing part-time hours/ working some of your part time hours at home etc. Process for establishing informal working arrangements The process for informal arrangements is conversational by design – but with outcomes still recorded/documented. Given the range of informal requests then the process needs to be fit for purpose and able to recognise individual circumstances. Lots of this is just part of everyday management and practical day to day operational decisions and good communication between you and your leader. There are generally two categories that informal requests might fall under: Pre-established parameters. Upfront conversations around flexible working support having sensible pre-agreed parameters in place. For example, flexitime parameters or common understandings of working from home parameters set in discussion with your leader. These support you being clear on the degree to which approval is required in each case or general comfort with the practice from time to time as needed or within agreed parameters, and the expectations around communication with your leader. Flexitime: As this is within the scope of employment agreement commitments no additional process is required for the day-to-day application of flexitime within your agreed working window and flexitime parameters. See the flexitime guidelines for more details around establishing work patterns and parameters etc. Requests requiring pre-approval. Specific conversations, as the need arises, are an important part of supporting flexible working. This includes those things that life throws at you with little notice or that might require a bit more of a material change for a short period, or looking to change your established parameters or set up some new ones etc. MAKING A REQUEST (WHERE NOT ALREADY WITHIN PRE-AGREED PARAMETERS) You can make the request for any reason and at any time, verbally or in writing. Any request should consider any impact on customers, business and team needs and deliverables. For those ad-hoc, small scale changes the request process should be relatively simple, with the focus on a quick chat or email/Teams exchange with your leader, and a timely decision. Where the request has more business impact (longer duration etc.) or seeks to establish a working from home arrangement for ‘fluid’ days, then a conversation is still the starter but it might take a bit more time for the decision and require more consideration of how any wider team or business impacts could be managed or mitigated or exploring alternative options. The outcome and details will need to be documented (including the required Working from Home checklist in the case of working from home). Informal requests can be event triggered, so they don’t always come with lots of notice, but if possible, don’t leave it until the last moment. Where it’s something you can plan for, you should make the request as soon as you can. You might raise your request with your leader in one of your regular and ongoing conversations etc. There is no documentation required for making an informal request (ideally just have a chat) IR’s Formal Flexible Working email template is NOT needed for an informal request. CONSIDERING YOUR REQUEST AND MAKING A DECISION Your leader will consider your request and make a decision as soon as possible. Often an instant or time sensitive decision is needed and can be made. If the request is a bit more complex, more time might be needed, but leaders will aim to make decisions in a timely manner (no later than a month after the request and generally much sooner). As your core terms and conditions remain unchanged then no formal variation is required. It still makes sense to document what’s agreed to support a common understanding and shared expectations. This might be as simple as your leader confirming their response to your email requesting to work from home on Tuesday morning/all next week for your normal working hours/or to use your flexi-credits to take Friday afternoon off. In other situations where the change is more enduring such as changing your agreed flexitime window/working from a different IR office for the next six weeks/establishing a ‘fluid’ working from home arrangement, then this should be documented and retained on your personnel file. Being open to considering flexible working options doesn’t mean all requests will be able to be accommodated. Where you request is declined the reason why will be provided. The Flexible Working Policy has information on review options if you are unhappy with the decision. There are basic email response template examples to support leaders in documenting the outcome and details of some of the more significant informal arrangements e.g. a materially changed short term arrangement or a longer-term fluid working from home arrangement. Where the arrangement involves working from home the Working from Home Checklist is also needed. People leader considerations •Some of these simpler informal changes are just part of BAU leadership and helping your people access flexible options to help balance their personal and work life. For that reason, we don’t want to add any unnecessary process or administration in the mix. •For any working from home arrangement beyond the one off or occasional occurrences the Working from Home Checklist is an important prerequisite and will need to be completed and revisited at least annually or should circumstances or your home location change. •While you should look at each request with a view to seeing if you can make it happen, that doesn’t mean in all occasions you will be able to accommodate the request. It will depend on what is being sought and if there are legitimate business reasons for refusal or for other alternative arrangements to be explored. You should apply a business reason lens for refusal. This may include things like any detrimental impact on quality or performance, or meeting customer demand, or the inability to reorganise the work amongst others. The ability for IR to accommodate the request is very much dependent on what is being requested and the wider context (type of work/wider team/business requirements etc.). •If the request is made informally but is more correctly addressed via the formal process, ensure the correct process is followed or discuss the difference so your team member is clear what best meets their needs. For more considerations please see the Consideration for Leaders resource on the Flexible Working hub: Tools and Resources page HR delegations: Level 5 authority is required to negotiate and make decisions on informal flexible working arrangements Please see IR’s Flexible Working hub for the Flexible Working Policy and other related guidelines and various supporting resources (including those mentioned in this document) Document control v1 March 2021 Review dates Date reviewed: Dec 2021 Guideline owner Domain Lead – People Operations and Policy, People and Workplace Services Guideline contact Email the ERP&R team Topic 5 – Flexible Working PEOPLE POLICIES AND GUIDELINES Formal Flexible Working Guidelines These guidelines describe what flexible working arrangements are considered formal and set out the process for requesting and considering various formal arrangements. FORMAL INCLUDES THINGS LIKE: A regular change to working hours/days (e.g. part-time) or some types of working from home (where the majority of working hours are from home or the days worked at home are set). See the Informal/Formal split table if you are unsure of the type of flexibility you are seeking, and which guidelines and process applies. If the flexibility you’re seeking is relatively simple and doesn’t change your terms and conditions or impact your pay or leave calculations in any reoccurring way, then see the Informal Flexible Working Guidelines for more details and to see if the flexibility you are after is better managed that way. Note: For those affected by Domestic Violence seeking to make a request in relation to short term flexible working arrangements please see our specific guidelines which relate to part 6AB of the Employment Relations Act (ERA) 2000. Requests relating to exchanging leave are covered separately in the Exchanging Leave Policy and relevant supporting guidelines. The current request and approval process should be used - outside of the formal flexible working form. These documents are available in our People Policies and Guidelines. Inland Revenue supports and encourages flexible working and is open to hearing if workplace flexibility could work for you, and to seeing if it can be accommodated. If you think a formal flexible working arrangement could help you better balance your personal and working life, then HAVE A THINK ... TALK TO YOUR LEADER... MAKE A REQUEST. If having reviewed the relevant policy and guidelines you have any questions around flexible working, you should talk with your leader. Union members may seek advice from their union delegates/representatives both generally and in relation to a particular request. Leaders can seek advice from People & Workplace Services: if there is any doubt about whether a working arrangement needs to be formalised or not, or for any support needed around flexible working. Appendix C3 Not in scope When is the arrangement ‘formal’? The request is ’formal’ where the arrangement involves: •changes to an employee’s terms and conditions of employment as they relate to flexibility (e.g. the core arrangements around hours, days, or place of work in your employment agreement, offer letter, any variation letters etc.) •when a reoccurring work arrangement impacts on pay and/or leave. It may take place for an agreed period or on an ongoing basis with regular review or in some cases be a permanent change. Formal flexibility is more structured and often has a bigger impact so requires more consideration, process and documentation and can be more challenging for the business to accommodate. In relation to working from home, the arrangement is considered to impact your terms and conditions and be formal when the days are ‘set’, or the majority of your time is worked at home. All formal arrangements need to be documented with a formal variation letter. FORMAL EXAMPLES Changing your working hours (number and/or pattern of hours) Looking to change or reduce/increase your working hours or days is a formal change which alters the terms around hours or days of work. The change sought might be to the number of hours worked e.g. part-time hours. Part- time hours might involve working shorter days across the week or working a reduced number of days each week. The change may also involve retaining the same number of working hours but working different length working days in a formally scheduled way. The change to working hours and/or days of work has implications for pay and leave entitlements (e.g. for part-time - reduced annual leave and sick leave, implications for resigning/retiring leave etc., for different working days or different length working days, there are leave and public holidays implications etc.). Those in a scheduled/rostered environment sometimes wish to lock in particular set hours or a tighter window within the wider working window, and this variation would also need to be agreed and documented formally. Certain types of working from home (see Working from Home Guidelines – Formal Working from Home section for more details and examples) Working from home is considered formal where it involves: •The majority of the time working from home rather than the office (for ‘set’ days or otherwise) of the expectations and responsibilities, and that you are willing and able to meet those. Talk to your leader Discussions about working arrangements are encouraged as part of your regular and ongoing Whanake conversations and more generally. This helps to ensure a common understanding of what flexibility you would like (now or potentially in the future) and what might be able to be accommodated, and to check in on how any current arrangements are working. You should talk to your leader before making any formal request. This helps ensure you understand the practicalities and if there are any barriers that create challenges in what you’re seeking. Discussion will also help you understand if it could be managed more informally. If possible, don’t leave it until the last moment to make a request as depending on what is sought it can take some time to consider and work through. For example, if you want changes to start on your return from parental leave, make your request as soon as possible before returning or even discuss it with your leader before taking parental leave. Where current flexible arrangements are already in place keep talking about how they are working. Even with longer term or ongoing arrangements, these should be discussed at least annually to check in on how the arrangement is working for all parties. Make your formal request If following initial thinking and discussion with your leader you decide to make a formal request, you have different options available to you. The principles for flexible working will apply across all requests and IR will ensure a response within a month of receipt of any request irrespective of the request approach you choose. IR Policy/employment agreements allow you to seek flexible working options It is within the scope of IR Policy/employment agreement provisions for you to request a temporary or permanent variation to your working hours, days, or place of work. For this option: Use the IR formal flexible working email request template You and your leader may want to complete email request together following your conversation, especially where you’re in agreement and want to move to formalise the request. If you and your leader are not in agreement you can still choose to put through your formal request for consideration. If you are dissatisfied with your leader’s decision see the Flexible Working Policy for more details. This includes specific information relating to ERA requests. People Leaders considerations in dealing with requests and making decisions •It’s expected that you will have discussed and understood your team members desire for flexibility and have explored the various implications before a formal request is submitted. •You need to consider the parameters in IR’s policy and guidelines and those things which are more challenging for IR to accommodate. While you should look at each request with a view to seeing if you can make it happen, that doesn’t mean in all occasions you will be able to accommodate the request. It will depend on what is being sought and if there are legitimate business reasons for refusal or for other alternatives to be explored. You should apply a business reason lens for refusal. This may include things like any detrimental impact on quality or performance, or meeting customer demand, or the inability to reorganise the work amongst others. The ability for IR to accommodate the request is very much dependent on what is being requested and the wider context (type of work/wider team/ business requirements etc). •You should ensure you don’t discriminate or are negatively influenced by the purpose or reason for the request. The exception to this is should the arrangement create an actual, potential, or perceived conflict of interest (e.g. seeking to reduce hours to take on secondary employment) then this needs to be well understood and mitigated accordingly. •It can be useful to discuss requests with your fellow leaders to assess the impact across different work areas and to support consistency (while considering the privacy of the individual). The higher level 4 delegation for formal flexible working decisions also support this wider lens and consistency considerations. Please see the Consideration for Leaders resource on the Flexible Working hub: Tools and Resources page for more individual, team and business considerations. In relation to receiving the specific request •Make sure the request includes all the key information you need •Further discuss the request with your team member as necessary •Acknowledge receipt of the request •Make sure you deal with the request as soon as possible and within a month of receiving it •Use the appropriate template to document the outcome •If approved, ensure the relevant variation letter (and any supporting documentation –Working from Home checklist etc) are filed on the personnel file and undertake any necessary follow up action. Documenting the outcome Formal arrangements require formal documentation to be developed and agreed to reflect the altered terms and conditions/arrangements. The documentation should be retained on your personnel file. Relevant outcome templates are available on the Leaders Templates and Resources page. See HR Advice for any support in completing these.

www.ird.govt.nz Page 1 of 7 Ref: 24 OIA1309 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 5 October 2023 De ar Thank you for your request made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA), received on 20 September 2023. You requested the following: 1.I’m curious to better understand all tax rates in New Zealand, please. I can see the following on your website: a.Individuals and Unincorporated organisations are easy with 10.5%, 17.5%, 30%, 33%, 39% b.Companies and Incorporated Societies are a flat 28% although it does say “Most companies” so what is excluded? c.Māori authorities are a flat 17.5%. What criteria does a company or trust need to fulfil to become approved as a Māori authority d.Trusts are a flat 33% e.Charities pay 0% income tax, but it seems to get very complicated with Donees. Can you please help me understand the types and rates? f.Have I missed any entity types from my list? 2.We are hearing media reports that the total tax rate has rapidly decreased. But I haven’t seen any detailed figures or data sources in those articles, so can you please direct me to the data for total tax take for The Crown by month, broken down by tax type, e.g. GST, income tax, provisional tax. As many years as available, please. 3.Unpaid tax owing to the IRD by month. As many years as are available, please. This is obviously a great indicator of how the economy, and businesses especially, are going. 1 b) Companies and Incorporated Societies There can be a number of exclusions or variations to the flat rate of 28%. For example, if a company or incorporated society are: •Eligible to be a Māori authority, or •Elect to become a look-through company, or •A registered charity and exempt from income tax, or •Exempt from income tax or receives income that is fully/partly exempt under subpart CW of the Income Tax Act 2007. You may also find the company income tax return guide for 2023 useful: ir4gu-2023.pdf (ird.govt.nz) 1 c) Māori Authorities The eligibility criteria for a company or trust to become approved as a Māori authority is available on Inland Revenue’s website: Māori authority eligibility (ird.govt.nz) This part of your request is therefore refused under section 18(d) of the OIA, as this information is publicly available. Page 2 of 7 Ref: 24 OIA1309 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 1 d) Trust tax rates You have referred to trusts as having a tax rate of 33%. There was a Bill introduced to the House, the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023–24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill, which proposed an increase to the trustee rate to 39% from 1 April 2024. Please also note that there are different types of trusts and in some cases, they may allocate income to beneficiaries to be tax at the beneficiary’s own tax rate(s). 1 e) Charities and Donee Organisations Tax Charities are exempt from income tax on non-business income under Section CW 41 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Tax charities are also exempt from income tax on business income that has been applied to charitable purposes within New Zealand under section CW 42 of the Income Tax Act 2007. If a charity applies business income overseas, then that income is taxable in New Zealand. That tax rate will depend on what sort of entity they are (for example, trusts 33%, companies or incorporated societies 28%). Donee organisations are not a separate category for income tax rate purposes. Being a donee organisation qualifies a donor to be able to claim: •A donation tax credit for an individual person who donates money to the organisation or •An income tax deduction for companies or Māori authorities who donate to it. Donee organisations include registered charities, school boards of trustees, tertiary education institutions and other funds or organisations listed in section LD 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007. More information can be found in Inland Revenue’s tax guide for charities, donee organisations and other groups on Inland Revenue’s website: ir255-2023.pdf (ird.govt.nz) 1 f) Tax rates for Entities The basic tax rates for various types of entities are outlined in Schedule 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. These can be found on the New Zealand Legislation website here: Income Tax Act 2007 No 97 (as at 24 August 2023), Public Act Schedule 1 Basic tax rates: income tax, ESCT, RSCT, RWT, and attributed fringe benefits – New Zealand Legislation 2)Tax take for the Crown Crown Tax Revenue collected by tax type is published on the Treasury’s website here: Tax Outturn Data - May 2023 | The Treasury New Zealand This information is released with a lag, and the lags are longer at year-end which is why the June 2023 year end has not been published. The lag is to allow reporting agencies time to deal with June year-end audits. The tax outturns for July, August and September 2023 will be released together in late October 2023. This part of your request is therefore refused under section 18(d) of the OIA, as the information requested is or will soon be publicly available. 3)U npaid tax owed to Inland Revenue The table in the attached Appendix A provides the total tax debt owed to Inland Revenue by month for the period from 30 June 2010 to 31 August 2023. Income tax and other tax categories have been grouped together for information sensitivity reasons, however income tax, on average, covers 95% of the tax debt in the grouped category. Page 3 of 7 Ref: 24 OIA1309 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] The remaining 5% from other tax includes debt from smaller tax products including approved issuer levy, dividend withholding tax, fringe benefit tax, gaming machine duty, non-resident withholding tax, portfolio investment entity, resident withholding tax, residential land withholding tax and resident withholding tax on interest. In 2020, as part of Inland Revenue’s technology upgrade, we changed the way we report on debt. From April 2020, PAYE and KiwiSaver debt was incorporated into debt related to employer activities. This includes PAYE, KiwiSaver employer and employee contributions, employer superannuation contributions tax, student loan employer deductions and child support employer deductions. These combined amounts were moved into the employer activities product grouping. The debt information for April 2013 was not able to be located. The data for this month has therefore been excluded and is refused under section 18(g) of the OIA, as the information is not held by Inland Revenue and we do not believe it is held by another agency. Right of Review If you disagree with my decision on your OIA request, you can ask an Inland Revenue review officer to review my decision. To ask for an internal review, please email the Commissioner of Inland Revenue via: CommissionersCorrespondence@ird.govt.nz . Alternatively, under section 28(3) of the OIA, you have the right to ask the Ombudsman to investigate and review my decision. You can contact the office of the Ombudsman via email at: info@ombudsman.parliament.nz . If you choose to have an internal review, you can still ask the Ombudsman for a review. Publishing of OIA response Please note that Inland Revenue regularly publishes responses to requests that may be of interest to the wider public on its website. We consider this response is of public interest so will publish this response in due course. Your personal details or any information that would identify you will be removed prior to it being published. Thank you for your request.

www.ird.govt.nz \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 6 October 2023 D ear T hank you for your request made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA), received on 7 September 2023, requesting an update on the data for Early Childhood Education (ECE) providers Inland Revenue provided to you in response to your 16 December 2022 request, as follows: Please can you provide an update to this official information for the data you hold for 2022 / 2023. Please use the most updated methods – as discussed with Nicola Hutcheon on 24 January, with the updated data received by ECC on 8 March. It is important that we are comparing data sets extracted by the same methods, to ensure consistency and accuracy. On 18 September 2023, you clarified your request to exclude data for the 2022-23 tax year as Inland Revenue does not yet hold comprehensive income tax information from taxpayers for this year and to instead include data for the 2021 -22 tax year. The debt data is point-in time and does not have the same coverage issues. Information Consistency The first reply to your December request was based on Business Industry Classification (BIC) codes but did not provide sufficient coverage on ECE providers. Our second reply of 8 March 2023 used an expanded range of BIC codes. As mentioned, Inland Revenue does not yet hold comprehensive income tax information from taxpayers for the 2022-23 tax year because entities represented by tax agents have up to a year to file their income tax returns, and for these entities the 2022-23 returns are not due until 31 March 2024. Taxpayers can file their returns earlier, and there is a particular incentive to do so for taxpayers who feel they may have overpaid their 2022-23 provisional tax and who are seeking a refund or perhaps a smaller provisional tax calculation for the 2023-24 year. Taxpayers without tax agents were required to file by 7 July 2023. A consequence of the settings is that early (incomplete) data from income tax returns is biased towards either smaller parties (e.g., those not using an agent) and/or towards taxpayers with a downwards trend in taxable activity. Biased data will not meet your needs for consistency and accuracy. Information being released Income tax Tables 1 and 2 in the Appendix include data for the 2021-22 tax year and provide updates to data previously provided for 2019-20 and 2020-21 tax years due to updated taxpayer filing activity. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] The tables are again based on business customers filing IR4 - company tax returns, IR9 - club/society returns or IR6 - Trust returns where the customer has used any of the following business industry codes (BIC): • Q871020 - child minding centre, excluding home-based, • P801010 - kindergartens or accredited pre-primary school education, or • P801020 - pre-schools providing accredited pre-primary education. The information provided in Tables 1 and 2 is filtered by taxpayers using these BIC codes, and by those who have filed any of these three types of income tax returns. Again, I have not provided data for partnerships as IR7 – partnership returns do not contain a tax figure because the income tax liability is passed through to the individual partners. As you have previously confirmed that individuals will not likely be the demographic that you are seeking, I have also excluded unincorporated individuals and partners of partnerships, as there are likely to be many additional variables such as salary/wage income that could distort their individual tax liability. I have again taken the approach to apply the trust tax rate of 33% to calculate tax for trust IR6 returns regardless of any attribution through to underlying beneficiaries. Table 1 includes nil returns, and Table 2 excludes them. Table 2 may be more useful for your previously stated intent if you want to focus only on those entities with non-zero tax obligations. The income variable provided is taxable income. This is calculated after any brought forward losses have been claimed which may have reduced taxable income to nil. Any current-year net loss is also treated as nil taxable income in these tables. The tax variable is residual income tax. This is tax payable by the entity directly and is net of any withholding tax credits from any income streams on which the tax has already been paid. Debt Aligning with the data I am providing for tax, I am releasing debt information for companies, trusts and clubs/societies that have used with BIC Codes Q871020 (child minding centre, excluding home-based), P801010 (kindergartens or accredited pre- primary school education), and P801020 (pre-schools providing accredited pre-primary school education). To align with Inland Revenue’s standard debt reporting methodology, the debt information provided is the total value of debt as at the last day of each respective tax year, rather than the debt attributed to that tax year. The debt information has been separated by tax product including Income Tax, Employer (PAYE), and GST. The remainder of smaller tax products have been grouped into the “Other” category. The average, median and quartile information provided applies to the total debt value. Table 3 in the Appendix provides the ECE providers debt figures for tax years between 2014 and 2023. While preparing the updated information for 2021-2022 and 2022-2023, an issue was identified with the information that was previously sent to you. Apologies for this error. Debt was incorrectly counted in items instead of customers, so if a customer had a debt in more than one period, they would be counted more than once.

Introduction from the Deputy Commissioner The recent years have been among the most important not just for Inland Revenue but also in the New Zealand Government’s history as we have worked very hard to modernise our country’s entire tax and social policy system. Designing and delivering services and systems that facilitate compliance in a customer- centric manner remains a priority for Inland Revenue. New Zealanders have already experienced the benefits of our new system since 2020, as Inland Revenue designed and deployed several COVID-19 relief initiatives in exceptionally short timeframes. Most individuals and businesses comply voluntarily, and we try and make it as easy as possible for them. At the same time, we need to identify and address those who do not comply. Increasingly, we are using intelligence-led, evidence-based techniques, and a broad range of internal and external datasets to make decisions on how to best facilitate compliance domestically and globally. We continue to work hard to ensure all businesses and individuals conducting cross-border transactions and investing overseas pay their fair share of tax. To this end we are working actively with other jurisdictions bilaterally and multilaterally to promote tax transparency through greater exchange of information. We have already seen this through initiatives such as the exchange of financial account data under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) and the Common Reporting Standard (CRS). With the increasing complexities of globalisation, we will continue to actively participate in international solutions to facilitate compliance. | 3 Offshore Tax Transparency What Your Taxes Pay For All New Zealanders benefit from tax Ka whai hua ngā tāngata katoa o Aotearoa i ngā tāke The money Inland Revenue collects helps pay for the public services that all New Zealanders benefit from, such as education and healthcare. One of our responsibilities is to ensure government has funding for these essential services. For full details see: https://www.treasury.govt.nz/publications/efu/budget-economic-and-fiscal-update-2022 In 2020–21, Government spend was as follows: $5.8b | Core government services $5.7b | Transport and communications $5.2b | Law and order $4.5b | Economic and industrial services $2.7b | Defence $1.9b | Environmental protection $1.8b | Housing and community development $1.4b | Heritage, culture and recreation $1.0b | Primary Services $0.1b | Government Superannuation Fund $0.3b | Other $36.8b Social security and welfare $22.8b Health $16b Education 4 | New Zealand context According to Statistics New Zealand census data, there are over 5 million New Zealand residents. Several thousand New Zealanders have also been coming back to New Zealand since March 2020, as the seriousness of the COVID-19 pandemic became apparent. New Zealand individuals and businesses have become increasingly involved in international trade and investment. New Zealanders also have strong ties to other countries, including overseas family members, properties located offshore, overseas investment income and even overseas employment relations. Although the vast majority of taxpayers voluntarily fulfill their tax obligations, some look for ways to evade or avoid paying their fair share. In doing so, they place an unfair burden on others and erode Government programmes from which all New Zealanders benefit. The New Zealand Government wants a productive and inclusive economy, and needs a sustainable revenue base to fund improvements to the wellbeing of New Zealanders and their families. This means it is important for everyone to pay their fair share of tax in New Zealand. New Zealand tax residents are generally required to pay tax on their worldwide income, even if they do not bring it into New Zealand and/or the other country or territory has deducted tax at source. New Zealand taxes individuals on their worldwide income. This includes rental income from a property overseas; interest from an offshore bank account; and, dividends or deemed foreign investment income from a portfolio of overseas shares. New Zealand has a self-assessment tax system, which is based on people voluntarily complying with their tax obligations. Taxpayers are best placed to assess their tax liabilities, and specific obligations are set out in law. The integrity of the system is maintained because the majority of New Zealanders pay taxes and claim social support payments appropriately. They are confident in Inland Revenue’s ability to take appropriate action against those who do not. A significant portion of individual taxpayers (predominately salary and wage earners) are not required to submit an annual return and rely on the accuracy of pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) deductions made by their employer in respect of New Zealand-sourced income. Income derived across an international border can potentially be subject to double taxation as a result of two countries taxing the same income. New Zealand relieves double taxation by unilaterally granting its residents credits for foreign tax paid on income that is also subject to New Zealand tax up to the amount of New Zealand tax liability on that income. New Zealand has a network of 40 double tax agreements (DTAs) with its main trading and investment partners which refine and supplement the unilateral tax credit relief mechanism. The focus of DTAs is wider than the elimination of double taxation. They also reduce tax impediments to cross-border trade and investment and assist tax administration. New Zealand has Tax Information Exchange Agreements (TIEAs) in force with 19 jurisdictions. These TIEAs allow the exchange of information for tax purposes between two jurisdictions. New Zealand (along with over 140 jurisdictions) is also a signatory to the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (Multilateral Convention). The Multilateral Convention facilitates tax information exchange between jurisdictions. It is the most comprehensive multilateral instrument available for all forms of tax co-operation to tackle tax evasion and avoidance - a top priority for all jurisdictions. | 5 OThshore Tax Transparency We advise the Government on tax policy and the social policies we administer, together with other agencies where appropriate. This includes advising the Government on international tax issues and developing New Zealand’s international tax legislation. We have responsibility for, or a major role in: Collecting revenue (most of the revenue we collect comes from income tax and GST) Administering Working for Families Tax Credits, child support, KiwiSaver, student loans, paid parental leave, and unclaimed money Sharing information with other agencies Administering COVID-19 response packages - including the small business cashflow (loan) scheme and the resurgence support payment. We also support the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) to administer the wage subsidy scheme Together with other government agencies we have a role to play in delivering inter-generational wellbeing and positive outcomes over time for all New Zealanders. This includes meeting our obligations under Te Tiriti o Waitangi and delivering on our role as part of the Māori Crown relationship. Inland Revenue’s role Inland Revenue aims to be a world-class revenue organisation recognised for service and excellence. Inland Revenue’s role is to contribute to the economic and social wellbeing of New Zealand by collecting and distributing money. Inland Revenue works with customers and other organisations to make compliance easy and to give New Zealanders confidence that everyone pays and receives the right amount. Inland Revenue has been on a long Business Transformation journey to deliver a tax system fit for the future. The characteristics of that system are: Greater speed and certainty through efficient self- management options for customers Broader approach to compliance based on smarter use of information A range of working relationships with other organisations Excellence in technical work. Over the last five years we have made huge leaps and bounds in terms of adopting a Right from the Start (RftS) approach. Our Business Transformation programme is based on the RftS principles, especially focusing on tax compliance by design. Inland Revenue now has a modern, digital tax system that is serving the needs of New Zealanders and fits seamlessly into their lives. Inland Revenue has been able to play a key role since 2020 to support all New Zealanders through the COVID-19 pandemic. Inland Revenue has designed and deployed several tax and non-tax initiatives at speed. Our new systems enabled Inland Revenue to design initiatives based on a high-trust model whilst having appropriate system checks in place to protect the integrity of each initiative and the overall tax base. 6 | Inland Revenue’s international tax strategy Inland Revenue’s international tax strategy aligns well with Inland Revenue’s Compliance Model which outlines the principles of how we interact with our customers. New Zealand’s taxation of cross-border flows of income New Zealand’s international obligations Taxing New Zealanders w ho invest offshore Often driven by broader economic and foreign policy objectives – not just tax Engagement with international tax agencies, organisations a nd developing countries Taxing foreign investors on income earned in New Zealand E D U C A T E D E S I G N L E G IS L A T E C O L L A B O R A T E A N A L Y S E S E R V I C E E N F O R C E Make it easy to comply and difficult not to C A P A B I L I T Y M O T I V A T I O N O P P O R T U N I T Y Understand and involve the customer and stakeholders CUSTOMER Build compliance right from the start Influence norms Provide certainty SEE INLAND REVENUE’S FULL COMPLIANCE MODEL ON PAGE 10 Through the integration of this strategy, we expect to achieve a future state with the following characteristics: A New Zealand economy made more competitive and productive by ensuring there is a level playing field for all tax- compliant customers, fewer competitive distortions and the lowest possible compliance costs I ncreased assurance to the community that Inland Revenue is tackling abuse of our tax system, especially through our targeting of offshore arrangements involving low or no tax jurisdictions C ontinued active collaboration across the globe with the aim to deliver the best outcomes right from the start for New Zealand. International taxation matters can generally be divided into the following two categories: The taxation of cross-border flows of income International co-operation on both a multilateral and bilateral basis | 7 OThshore Tax Transparency Our international obligations/ standards New Zealand is a member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The OECD has over many years promoted international co-operation in tax matters through exchange of information and has established the standard for what is effective exchange of information. This standard encourages transparency and information sharing in the global marketplace while facilitating tax compliance. New Zealand fully endorses the OECD standard. In taxing residents generally on their worldwide incomes, transparency and information sharing are essential to facilitating compliance in New Zealand. Exchange of information in New Zealand is governed by the relevant Exchange of Information Article of our DTAs or by TIEAs or through our far-reaching network enabled by the Multilateral Convention. Through the DTAs, TIEAs and the Multilateral Convention New Zealand agrees with other countries to the following types of exchanges of information: Automatic or routine exchanges of datasets Specific exchanges on request Spontaneous exchanges. In recent years New Zealand has also expanded its exchange of information programme as it has implemented key transparency initiatives such as FATCA with the United States, the Common Reporting Standard and the minimum standards resulting from Actions 5 (exchanges of summaries of tax rulings) and 13 (country-by-country reporting) of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Action Plan. Inland Revenue regularly collaborates with other tax authorities in exchanging intelligence and matching data. Liaising closely with these jurisdictions provides greater transparency of cross-border transactions. As a consequence, Inland Revenue has been able to take compliance action against New Zealand residents who are not returning their worldwide income or are involved in aggressive tax planning arrangements. The Competent Authority The role of the Competent Authority (CA) is defined in our tax treaties and generally involves serving as the primary point of contact for both domestic taxpayers with offshore links and competent authorities in other jurisdictions. The CA function facilitates the exchange of information and intelligence with tax treaty partners, both individual requests for information and automatic exchanges of information (such as FATCA and CRS). Mutual agreement procedure cases to eliminate double taxation or resolve double taxation disputes are also handled by the CA function. New Zealand’s CA function sits within Inland Revenue’s International Revenue Strategy (IRS) team. As New Zealand’s competent authority office, IRS administers New Zealand’s international tax agreements. The relevant contact details for the CA are listed on page 23 and our website - Who we are (ird.govt.nz). 8 | New Zealand’s exchange of information programme New Zealand has an extensive exchange of information programme and encourages international collaboration to the widest possible extent. New Zealand has signed up to several types of bilateral and multilateral exchanges. Exchange of Information on Request These are exchanges where information is requested from or by a treaty partner in respect of specific taxpayers or transactions. As one of their duties, the competent authorities must satisfy themselves that the information in question can appropriately pass between the two jurisdictions under the terms of the relevant tax treaty, including satisfying the limitations placed on such exchanges on the grounds of trade secrecy, public policy, or inconsistency with domestic laws or practices. Exchange of Land Data We annually exchange land data with many of our treaty partners. The data we exchange is a combination of information obtained from the land transfer tax statements received by Land Information New Zealand and our own internal tax data. We also receive similar information from some of our treaty partners which serves as good initial intelligence with an option to follow-up with further exchange of information requests during the course of more in-depth compliance work. Spontaneous Exchange of Information These are exchanges where information is proactively provided from or by a treaty partner in respect of specific taxpayers or transactions. We endeavour to be as proactive as possible in initiating spontaneous exchanges of information where we consider our treaty partners may be adversely impacted by arrangements that we have come across through our local compliance work. Information of this kind may relate to situations in which there is some reasonable suspicion that items shown in a New Zealand tax return may not be dealt with in a symmetrical fashion in a corresponding overseas return or may not have been disclosed abroad at all. More generally, there may be an indication that taxes are being avoided or evaded on transactions with an international dimension. The actual exchanges to treaty partners must still be made by the Competent Authority. | 9 OThshore Tax Transparency Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) New Zealand signed an Intergovernmental Agreement with the United States which resulted in changes to New Zealand’s domestic legislation, and require financial institutions to send their annual FATCA disclosures directly to Inland Revenue to exchange subsequently with the US Internal Revenue Service. New Zealand has been successfully exchanging this financial account information with the United States since September 2015, with US financial account data being provided in return. Automatic Exchange of Information – Common Reporting Standard (CRS) The CRS requires jurisdictions to obtain information from their financial institutions and automatically exchange that information with other jurisdictions on an annual basis. It sets out the financial account information to be exchanged, the financial institutions required to report, the types of accounts covered, as well as the due diligence procedures to be followed by financial institutions. Currently there are well over 100 jurisdictions who have committed to this initiative on international tax transparency. New Zealand has been successfully exchanging CRS information around the world since September 2018 including with over 70 jurisdictions in 2021. The increased transparency is a major step change which has altered the international tax landscape. This increased sharing of information on a regular basis creates the platform to deter, detect, and address tax evasion at an international level like never before. Access to this increased financial account information has further helped Inland Revenue realise its goal to be customer- centric and intelligence-led. We have been able to use this extensive information to further facilitate tax compliance in New Zealand. Collection Assistance Arrangements under DTAs/ Multilateral Convention We have a robust infrastructure in place to support efforts to collect tax debt internationally. We continue to work on extending and enhancing international mechanisms for collecting tax debt from defaulters who have left our jurisdiction. Such mechanisms enable us to request our treaty partners to collect tax debt on our behalf and vice versa. In this regard, we have five Competent Authority Arrangements with countries where we have considerable traffic – Australia, Canada, Japan, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. New Zealand Foreign Trusts (NZFTs) A foreign trust is a trust set up in New Zealand with a New Zealand resident trustee, which has never had a New Zealand resident settlor. NZFTs are required to register with Inland Revenue and submit annual returns within six months of their balance date. NZFTs do not pay tax in New Zealand on their foreign-sourced income. All the information collected during the registration and annual return process of an NZFT is shared with the Department of Internal Affairs (DIA) as the supervisor of trust and company service providers and the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of the New Zealand Police. Both the DIA and FIU analyse and use the information provided as intelligence to feed into their inquiries and respective compliance programmes addressing money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Where the trustee of an NZFT does not cooperate and the income tax exemption is revoked, we send the details of the settlor to the relevant tax treaty partner. This proactive exchange allows the other tax authority to also commence further inquiries into the settlor and the trust. You can find more information on how to comply with the NZFT regime on our website - Foreign trusts with New Zealand resident trustees (ird.govt.nz). 10 | Our compliance approach E D U C A T E D E S I G N L E G I S L A T E C O L L A B O R A T E A N A L Y S E S E R V I C E E N F O R C E Make it easy to comply and difficult not to C A P A B I L I T Y M O T I V A T I O N O P P O R T U N I T Y Understand and involve the cu stomer and stakeholders CUSTOMER Build compliance right from the start Influence norms Provide certainty Our compliance approach is based on the ‘Right from the Start’ approach that supports compliant behaviour, drives out error and at the same time reduces the possibilities of non-compliant behaviour. The intent is not just to reduce unintentional mistakes but also to reduce the opportunities and occurrences of intentional evasion and to strengthen overall willingness to comply. We make proportionate responses to the risks identified and the behaviours exhibited. Our compliance model underpins our customer-centric compliance approach. | 11 Offshore Tax Transparency Our compliance framework The framework illustrated in the diagram below demonstrates what we have been able to truly achieve through the success of our multi-year multi-stage transformation programme. Through our programme we have been able to design our systems and introduce new policies that enable us to assure a larger part of our tax base which means we collect more revenue with reduced effort. We have designed and enhanced our systems and processes to automate and make it easier for our customers. Through effective policy and smart system design buttressed by the appropriate guidance we are now able to ensure that most New Zealanders get the right tax treatment at the right time through the right channels with minimal effort on their part. Through our transformation programme we have also gained a wide suite of sophisticated analytical capabilities which enable us to be more real-time and truly intelligence-led. These new capabilities coupled with human intelligence serve us well to design and deploy effective compliance campaigns, with a suite of multi-faceted tailored interventions. This ability to target our interventions to the right customers means we are only in the lives of those customers who are deserving of further inquiries and interventions.

Individuals and businesses are now working and investing across borders more than ever, especially as technological opportunities have arisen to work remotely, and the expectation is that this will continue as the new norm post the pandemic. This changing landscape coupled with the need for governments to collect more tax to fund the COVID-19 relief initiatives has meant the area of international tax has become even more of a focus around the globe. The aim of our international tax work is to collect ‘the right amount of tax at the right time through the right channels’ and to ensure we are compliant with all the international standards, retaining New Zealand’s very good international reputation. While New Zealand has a relatively compliant culture, we still need to be vigilant and reduce any opportunities for tax evasion and tax avoidance. This is especially the case where low or no tax jurisdictions can be used to evade or avoid tax obligations - for instance, where promoters may offer to set up and manage offshore trusts or companies that seek to conceal taxpayers’ beneficial ownership of assets. We are aware of the ease with which New Zealand companies, limited partnerships and foreign trusts can be formed and potentially used to exploit our legislation from abroad. We work with our treaty partners on joint compliance approaches and the increased transparency through the various exchanges of information to combat such threats. To this effect we focus on the following four key compliance themes: 1 Meeting our international obligations, through a comprehensive exchange of information programme 2 Effective use of the information and intelligence we receive from all our treaty partners, with a specific focus on New Zealanders with offshore investments and their tax residency status 3 Efficient administration of the New Zealand foreign trust regime 4 Supporting customers through any compliance issues arising as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic | 13 OThshore Tax Transparency Our compliance approach in practice We successfully meet all our international obligations every year, with strong support from all reporting New Zealand financial institutions in respect of FATCA and CRS requirements. New Zealand’s financial institutions are required to collect relevant financial account information on their customers and submit it to Inland Revenue to exchange with our treaty partners. Inland Revenue has reviewed the top 40 reporting financial institutions in the last two years to ensure they have the right systems and processes in place to be able to successfully deliver the quality of information required under the CRS. These 40 financial institutions cover over 95% of the reportable accounts in New Zealand. Overall, we are pleased with the efforts made across the great majority of the financial institutions within New Zealand. We are closely working with those financial institutions whose systems were identified as needing improvements. New Zealand is now fortunate to receive considerable financial intelligence to which we had only limited access in the past. Through FATCA and CRS we receive information on individuals and related entities that includes tax identification numbers and financial account information (with details of the financial institution in which they have invested and the account balances). We match all the information we receive to what we hold in our systems and take a risk-based approach to verify and address any variances, ranging from clarification of residency status through to assessment of undeclared offshore income. Based on our analysis of this information, we have developed a number of compliance campaigns targeting in particular: Tax residence of highly mobile individuals Misuse of low or no tax jurisdictions. These campaigns create greater awareness and facilitate compliance. Since 2019, we have worked with almost 7,000 taxpayers and their agents to confirm they are meeting their international tax obligations in New Zealand and helped regularise tax affairs for those needing assistance. The campaigns have brought in a number of other individuals and their associated tax obligations into our tax system. We have received more than 900 voluntary disclosures, and we expect to collect additional revenue annually from these customers without any further intervention. In nearly all other cases, satisfactory explanations and supporting information has been provided to enable verification. We are also pleased to note that a number of New Zealanders heard about our campaigns third hand and have proactively made voluntary disclosures in respect of offshore income not previously returned, which highlights the benefits of this major transparency initiative and its wider deterrence effects. We have seen many errors arising from a lack of awareness of obligations and the need to return overseas income in New Zealand, especially where the customers have had withholding tax deducted in other jurisdictions. Overall, we have found the majority of New Zealanders want to comply, the very few who are reluctant to cooperate are referred for more intensive audit examination. 14 | Your tax residency STATUS in New Zealand is different from your immigration status. % In general, New Zealand tax residents pay income tax on their WORLDWIDE income while non-residents pay on income from New Zealand. Your worldwide income can include FOREIGN income even if you have not repatriated it to New Zealand or you have paid tax on it in the other country or the income is exempt in the other country. Some rules in New Zealand may tax CAPITAL GAINS and may do so even though the gain has not been realised. Examples include the foreign investment fund rules and financial arrangements rules. New tax residents and former tax residents returning after 10 YEARS may qualify for a temporary tax exemption on most, but not all, forms of foreign income. New Zealand will usually give a CREDIT for tax paid to another country, capped at the amount of tax payable here on the foreign income. We advise you to consult a tax AGENT knowledgeable in international tax if you’re not sure how the law applies to your situation as some of the rules can be complex. If New Zealand has a DOUBLE tax agreement with another country, it may affect how your income is taxed. Inland Revenue exchanges financial INFORMATION about taxpayers annually with many other countries and matches it to tax returns. There are shortfall penalties for not declaring income but they can be reduced by up to 100% if you make a VOLUNTARY disclosure. Top 10 facts ABOUT INTERNATIONAL TAX | 15 OThshore Tax Transparency We have provided assistance to taxpayers and their agents in relation to foreign income, covering a number of issues: Transitional residence There is a 48-month period for transitional residents. If this time is exceeded, transitional residents become subject to New Zealand tax on their worldwide income. The period of transitional residence begins on the first day of residence in New Zealand. It ends on the earlier of: • w hen the person stops being a New Zealand tax resident • o n the last day of the 48th month after the month in which they first satisfied the tax residence tests. You can also lose your transitional residence status if you or your partner apply for Working for Families Tax Credits or if you opt out. Helping you get it right from the start... Transitional residency flowchart for individual New Zealand tax residents IR1249 This flowchart will help you determine whether you qualify as a transitional resident for income tax purposes. If you do, you may be eligible for a temporary exemption on most, but not all, types of foreign income for at least 4 years. Foreign employment income and income from the supply of services are not exempt. You’ll generally pay tax on income with a source in New Zealand. If you’re a New Zealand tax resident who is not a transitional resident, you’ll generally pay tax on your worldwide income. Ye s Are you a natural person? The temporary tax exemption is only available to individuals. No Ye s Are you a New Zealand tax resident? You become a New Zealand tax resident by being present for more than 183 days in a rolling 12-month period or by acquiring a permanent place of abode. No No Ye s Have you been a non-resident for 10 years or more? You must not have been a tax resident of New Zealand at any time in the 10 years before you qualify as one, ignoring the 183-day backdating rule. Ye s No Have you previously been a transitional resident? You can only be a transitional resident once. Ye s No You can choose not to be a transitional resident at any time by giving notice to Inland Revenue. The notice to stop being a transitional resident must be given within the period for filing a tax return. Have you chosen not to be a transitional resident? Ye s No Have you or your partner applied for Working for Families Tax Credits? If you or your partner apply for Working for Families Tax Credits, you cease to be a transitional resident and must return your foreign income. You cannot change your decision.

Some transitional residents may have planned to leave the country before the 48-month transitional residence period ended but because of COVID-19, they have been unable to easily leave the country. A person should not be regarded as no longer a transitional resident just because they are stranded in New Zealand because of COVID-19. If a person leaves New Zealand within a reasonable time after they are no longer practically restricted in travelling, then extra days (i.e. when the person was unable to depart) will be disregarded.

You need to calculate FIF income from a shareholding in a foreign company when: t he total cost of all your FIF interests is over $50,000 the shareholding is not exempt from the rules. If you or your shareholding is exempt from the FIF rules, other rules apply. You’ll usually need to include any dividends you receive in your IR3 return and may have to pay tax on any gains from trading or buying with the purpose of sale. Foreign dividend income and the controlled foreign company (CFC) rules If you are a New Zealand tax resident who is not a transitional resident and have an income interest of 10% or more in a CFC, you may have to pay tax on income attributed from that company. “Control” for CFCs usually means total ownership of the non- resident company by a New Zealand resident. However, control can exist where: • 5 or fewer New Zealand residents have a control interest of more than 50% • 5 o r fewer New Zealand residents control the shareholder decision rights • a sin gle New Zealand resident has a control interest of 40% or more, and no non-associated non-resident owns a larger control interest. Foreign interest income and the financial arrangements rules If you are a New Zealand tax resident and party to a financial arrangement, you may have income under the financial arrangements rules. Financial arrangements involve a deferral between when money is provided and when it’s returned. Common examples are bank accounts and term deposits held in foreign currencies. Foreign pension income and the foreign investment fund rules If you are a New Zealand tax resident who is not a transitional resident and are a beneficiary or member of a foreign superannuation scheme, you may have to calculate FIF income and include it in your IR3 return. If this is the case, you do not have to include the pension payments. If the FIF rules do not apply, the pension payments received from a foreign superannuation scheme are taxable and need to be included in your IR3 return. Foreign superannuation scheme withdrawals and the foreign investment fund rules If you are a New Zealand tax resident who is not a transitional resident and have an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme, you might have to pay tax on lump sum withdrawals or transfers. | 17 OThshore Tax Transparency Foreign rental income If you are a New Zealand tax resident who is not a transitional resident and own rental property overseas, you would generally need to pay tax on any rental income. The rules for calculating income in the other country may differ from New Zealand and require you to make adjustments. Foreign property gains If you are a New Zealand tax resident who is not a transitional resident and purchased a property overseas with the intention of selling it, any gains may be taxable even if the property was your main home and even if you also paid tax overseas. Foreign social security pensions If you are a New Zealand tax resident who is not a transitional resident and receive a social security pension from another country, you will usually have to pay tax on it here. If the other country also deducts tax, you may be able to claim a foreign tax credit in your tax return. Foreign beneficiary income and taxable distributions from trusts If you are a New Zealand tax resident who is not a transitional resident and a beneficiary of a trust, you are generally taxable on your worldwide income. This can include beneficiary income and taxable distributions from any trust or estate overseas. Taxpayers working remotely in New Zealand for overseas employers With the emergence of COVID-19 there have been a large number of New Zealanders returning to New Zealand and continuing to work remotely for non-resident employers, who have no other presence here. In addition, there have been visitors deciding to stay in New Zealand or come to New Zealand due to the COVID-19 pandemic, who are working remotely for their overseas employer while in New Zealand. Both of these scenarios pose different tax issues that need to be considered. An exemption is provided for certain income that a non-resident derives from performing personal or professional services in New Zealand during a short-term visit of less than 92 days. If the visit is for more than 92 days, all income derived from the time of arrival is subject to tax in New Zealand. However, it is worth noting that this can be extended to 183 days, if there is a DTA between New Zealand and the other jurisdiction of residence, in terms of the employment/income for dependent services article. New Zealand-based overseas employees should register as IR56 taxpayers, to ensure PAYE is still deducted in the scenarios outlined above. This means filing monthly PAYE returns declaring your salary and wages; and, paying PAYE to Inland Revenue. In addition, if New Zealand has sole taxing rights in terms of a DTA you will be unable to claim a foreign tax credit. This relates to the tax that your employer may still be deducting for the salary and wages they are paying you from overseas. So that you are not double taxed, you will need to approach your overseas-based employer and request that they not deduct tax from your salary and wages. You will need to liaise with your employer and approach the overseas tax authority to request a refund of tax incorrectly deducted from your salary and wages while you have been working in New Zealand. 18 | Offshore is no longer off limits OFFSHORE investments have become far more transparent with the automatic exchange of financial account data under New Zealand’s extensive network of international tax treaties. All G20 countries, OECD members and offshore finance centres have COMMITTED to the exchange of information standards set through the OECD. Inland Revenue has close working relationships with major tax treaty PARTNERS and is an active participant in both bilateral and multilateral projects dealing with data leaks such as the Panama Papers and the Pandora Papers. Taxpayers should be wary of any offshore arrangement involving secrecy or concealment – arrangements that involve disguised ownership or hidden income should be treated with great CAUTION. Make no mistake – increased international co-operation, improved technology and risk assessment capabilities, as well as the intelligence we continue to obtain, all mean it’s very unwise to not declare offshore INCOME. If you have not declared offshore income, then you should think seriously about taking professional advice to REGULARISE your taxation affairs through filing proactively a voluntary disclosure with Inland Revenue.

Stronger collaboration and international partnerships provide earlier insights into schemes that are developed abroad and subsequently marketed in New Zealand. The various exchanges of information provide considerable intelligence. OECD standards Our commitments to internationally agreed standards account for the vast bulk of our resource committed to meeting our international obligations. All of the international exchange of information standards are set by consensus at the OECD and have a direct impact on Inland Revenue’s international tax strategy and policy settings. Joint International Taskforce on Shared Intelligence and Collaboration (JITSIC) Inland Revenue actively participates in the JITSIC Network which brings together over 35 of the world’s national tax administrations that have committed to more effective and efficient ways to deal with tax avoidance. The network provides tax administrations with an agile mechanism for information exchange and collaboration, while ensuring that all exchanges of information are in accordance with the provisions of an effective bilateral or multilateral tax convention or a tax information exchange agreement. Inland Revenue has benefited through the sharing of intelligence and strategies dealing with emerging international tax risks as well as advances in analytical techniques and best practice compliance approaches. We also benefit from collective evaluation of major international data leaks via JITSIC, such as the Panama Papers and more recently the Pandora Papers. Study Group on Asia-Pacific Tax Administration and Research (SGATAR) Inland Revenue is a member of SGATAR and actively participates in all SGATAR-related activities, which facilitate greater understanding between all Asia-Pacific nations, their context and what drives their respective compliance approaches. New Zealand to meet its international obligations The enhancement of our reputation internationally Capacity building through international learning opportunities and sharing best practices There are several key international networks in which Inland Revenue actively participates. Increasing level of globalisation has made international collaboration more of a necessity than an option. This collaboration provides assurance that Inland Revenue is aligned to international best practice. Specifically, this enables: | 21 OThshore Tax Transparency International disputes – Mutual Agreement Procedure Inland Revenue plays an active role on the global stage, assisting other countries’ tax organisations to build their capabilities. We provide experts on an ongoing basis to train other tax administrations in all aspects of international exchange of information. Outreach to Asia-Pacific region Working with international partners, we have been especially focused on supporting the implementation of international tax standards in Asia and the Pacific. We work closely with New Zealand has 40 DTAs, each with an article establishing a mutual agreement procedure (MAP) for resolving difficulties arising out of the application of the particular DTA. New Zealand has 11 TIEAs in force which also contain a MAP article, as well as 6 supplementary agreements to these TIEAs which include a MAP article. Under the MAP article, the competent authorities of the contracting states engage with each other and endeavour to resolve disputes that arise from the way one or both contracting states are interpreting or applying the particular DTA. This process effectively equips the tax administrations with the practical means to ensure that cross-border income earning activity is taxed correctly in accordance with DTAs. Our overall aim is to complete MAP cases within 12 months of receiving a request for assistance. The time taken to resolve MAP cases will vary depending largely on the complexity of the matter in dispute. We have experienced a moderate case load in recent years with good turnaround times. New Zealand is a member of the Forum on Tax Administration’s MAP Forum and has committed to resolving treaty-related disputes within an average timeframe of 24 months. We have also been subject to a rigorous peer review by the MAP Forum, the main recommendation being that we update a number of our older DTAs to the latest wording of the OECD Model Tax Convention, which we are progressing. For further details on how to apply for a MAP request you can go to our website - Mutual agreement procedure (MAP) (ird.govt.nz). OECD (Global Relations), SGATAR, and the Pacific Islands Tax Administrators Association (PITAA) to provide one-to-many outreach tax technical assistance. Inland Revenue is a significant partner in the Pacific Initiative, a joint effort launched in 2020 involving the Australian Taxation Office, the Asian Development Bank, the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes, the OECD, PITAA and the World Bank Group. This initiative has been established to support the efforts of 16 Pacific jurisdictions in the phased implementation of tax transparency standards to prevent tax evasion and avoidance, while strengthening domestic resource mobilisation, taking into account the circumstances and specific needs of the Pacific Islands. International capacity building 22 | What’s on the horizon? Inland Revenue will continue to run compliance campaigns to verify and facilitate compliance by New Zealand tax residents in returning their offshore income. We have an ongoing monitoring programme: ensuring customers continue to return their overseas income as agreed during recent reviews carried out v erifying customer records against additional information received from treaty partners for later years. Inland Revenue has been working hard to assist customers regularise their tax affairs, and in most cases a voluntary disclosure has been accepted and penalties reduced. However, if the position is not maintained in future years (without a valid reason, i.e. a change in circumstances) or we receive additional information as to previously undisclosed sources of offshore income, then the review of these customers will be escalated to more in-depth examination. In the spirit of increasing tax transparency to facilitate international tax compliance, the OECD has been working on two major new initiatives to address information gaps, leveraging off concepts and principles established in formulating the CRS. Gig and Sharing Economy Over the last decade, the ability for buyers and sellers to connect through electronic marketplaces and digital platforms has created a new kind of economic activity which is becoming increasingly popular. This rapid growth of the gig and sharing economy has resulted in governments across the world evaluating their tax systems to ensure that tax settings do not create barriers to sensible economic activities, and also to ensure that tax is collected in respect of these activities. The gig and sharing economy has the potential to generate economic benefits, providing innovative services for consumers and opportunities for employment that are flexible and accessible. However, the gig and sharing economy business model does not fit neatly within existing tax rules and administration. There are various options to address this issue, including opportunities to improve compliance of sellers with their tax obligations, and increase fairness between traditional sellers and sellers operating in the gig and sharing economy. The new OECD initiative establishes a best practice for jurisdictions to collect and exchange information, creating further transparency in relation to the operations of these platforms and in particular the income derived by sellers. Crypto Assets The rise of crypto assets which are frequently offered, traded and serviced by non-regulated or lightly-regulated intermediaries has picked up considerable speed in the last few years. The OECD is developing a framework for crypto-asset reporting by brokers, dealers and exchanges. It is proposed that these intermediaries report information about crypto-asset holdings and transactions, ensuring a level playing field with traditional financial products. Under this initiative, jurisdictions would then share this information with each other to give tax administrations visibility and enable effective risk assessments to be carried out. | 23 OThshore Tax Transparency Contacts Purpose Contact Principal Competent Authorities John Nash (Strategic Advisor, International) Anu Anand (Service Leader, International) Carmel Peters (Strategic Policy Advisor) Competent.Authority@ird.govt.nz Mutual Agreement Procedure John Nash Strategic Advisor, International International Revenue Strategy Inland Revenue PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 Competent.Authority@ird.govt.nz Exchange of Information Anu Anand Service Leader, International International Revenue Strategy Inland Revenue PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 Competent.Authority@ird.govt.nz Dual Residence Competent.Authority@ird.govt.nz 24 | Glossary CA Competent Authority CFC Controlled Foreign Company CRS Common Reporting Standard DIA Department of Internal Affairs DTA Double Tax Agreement FATC A Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act FIF Foreign Investment Fund FIU Financial Intelligence Unit G20 Group of 20 Highly Developed Countries GST Goods and S e r v i c e s Ta x IRS International Revenue Strategy JITSIC Joint International Taskforce on Shared Intelligence and Collaboration MAP Mutual Agreement Procedure NZFT New Zealand Foreign Trust OECD Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development PAY E Pay As You Earn P I TA A Pacific Islands Tax Administrators Association RftS Right from the Start S G ATA R Study Group on Asia- Pacific Tax Administration and Research TIEA Tax Information Exchange Agreement For more information please refer to: www.ird.govt.nz/international-tax/exchange-of- information/crs www.ird.govt.nz/international-tax/exchange-of- information/fatca www.ird.govt.nz/international-tax/double-tax-agreements www.ird.govt.nz/international-tax/foreign-trusts-nz- resident-trustees www.ird.govt.nz/international-tax/business/transfer- pricing/practice-issues/controlled-foreign-companies www.ird.govt.nz/income-tax/income-tax-for-businesses- and-organisations/types-of-business-income/foreign- investment-funds-fifs www.ird.govt.nz/income-tax-for-businesses-and- organisations/types-of-business-income/interest-and- dividends/financial-arrangements-rules www.ird.govt.nz In Confidence MBIEMAKO 2937888 OFFICE OF THE MINISTER OF COMMERCE The Chair Cabinet Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee Misuse of New Zealand Companies and Limited Partnerships Proposal That Cabinet agree to a number of measures aimed at reducing the misuse of New Zealand companies, to be implemented through the Companies and Limited Partnerships Amendment Bill, currently before the Commerce Committee. Executive Summary There is evidence that individuals and groups (particularly offshore interests) are misusing the New Zealand company incorporation regime and consequently threatening the international reputation of New Zealand. Cabinet has agreed to some measures to address such misuse, which have been included in the Companies and Limited Partnerships Amendment Bill (the Bill) \[EGI Min (10) 17/5 refers\]. The Bill is currently before the Commerce Committee. Since 2010, 248 New Zealand companies have been identified as being allegedly involved in facilitating crimes. This averages at more than eight companies a month, a significant increase from a rate of less than three companies a month between 2006 and 2010. The removal of New Zealand from the European Union banking and corporate “white list” in February 2011 further highlighted the misuse of New Zealand companies. The activities of New Zealand registered shell companies have been linked to this removal, although the European Union’s requirements relate primarily to anti-money laundering and terrorism financing controls. These will be addressed through the commencement of the Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism Act 2009 next year. The proposals in this paper relate to company and limited partnership incorporation and enforcement processes. In light of the adverse impact of these issues on New Zealand’s reputation as a well regulated jurisdiction, I recommend that Cabinet consider a number of further changes to the Companies Act 1993. The objective of these proposals remains to maintain and enhance the current high reputation of New Zealand as a place to do business. The proposals have been considered against the following requirements: a. An efficient company registration regime should remain a competitive ad vantage for New Zealand; b.Any measures should be effective in reducing misuse of the company registration regime; c.The costs of legitimate businesses should be minimal unless the benefits can be clearly demonstrated to outweigh those costs; and d. That, where possible, there are benefits of aligning with the Australian r egime. Appendix A: Cabinet Paper- Misuse of Companies and Limited Partnership y In Confidence MBIEMAKO 2937888 2 I consider the amendments detailed below to meet these requirements. I have also been advised that they would not impact on New Zealand’s World Bank ranking for either starting a business of for ease of doing business. These measures, which are outlined in a table in Annex 1, can be grouped into three categories: Accountability – Requiring companies to have a director who is either a resident of New Zealand or a resident director in a prescribed enforcement country (initially Australia). Having a director who is resident in New Zealand or Australia will ensure that someone accessible to enforcement agencies is legally liable for the actions of the company. This measure will impact approximately 4,200 out of the 550,000 companies on the Register (0.77 per cent). Note however, around 1,200 of the 4,200 companies affected have been categorised as “high risk” by the Companies Office. It is therefore estimated that fewer than 3,000 legitimate companies will be affected by this change. These companies will need to hire a New Zealand resident director, at a cost ranging from a few thousand dollars to around $50,000. This will only be an additional cost for these companies if they choose to hire an additional director rather than replacing an existing overseas based director. Transparency – Requiring disclosure of the date and place of birth of directors. This measure will better enable the identification of directors and will have negligible costs on business. Requiring companies to disclose their ultimate holding company, if they have one. This measure will provide public transparency so that persons dealing with a company can know where “control” ultimately lies. The costs on companies impacted by this measure will be low. Enforcement – Expanding the Registrar’s power to seek information on the ultimate ownership and control of a company. I recommend that these changes are applied to the Limited Partnerships Act 2008, to the extent that they are applicable. I further propose that Cabinet delegate responsibility to the Minister of Commerce, the Minister of Economic Development and the Minister of Finance to determine the extent to which these measures are applied to limited partnerships and the appropriate transitional provisions required to implement these measures. The Bill would provide the appropriate legislative vehicle for progressing the recommended measures. If agreed, these proposals will be included as recommendations in the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment’s departmental report to the Commerce Committee. In Confidence MBIEMAKO 2937888 3 Background 1 Criminals use multiple layers of corporate structures to hide a variety of serious crimes including money laundering, trafficking arms and illegal substances, and fraud, often with the assistance of lawyers, accountants, financial service providers and company formation agents. Corporate structures can be used by criminals to mask the source of funds used to buy property, conceal true ownership of property, maintain control of criminal proceeds and assets and obscure the link between illegal activity and assets. These layers make it exceptionally difficult for law enforcement agencies to identify individuals and hold them to account. 2 There is evidence that individuals and groups (particularly offshore interests) are misusing the New Zealand company incorporation regime and consequently threatening the international reputation of New Zealand. High profile or repeated instances of foreign- controlled New Zealand companies engaging in criminal activities overseas are likely to seriously impact New Zealand’s international standing. 3 The primary causes of this increase in misuse of New Zealand’s company registration system are: a. The unprecedented promotion of New Zealand incorporated companies to wholly overseas interests by trust and company service providers (TCSPs); b. The lack of information required about the beneficial ownership and control of New Zealand companies in comparison to similar well regulated jurisdictions such as Australia; and c. The ability of persons based overseas to register a company in New Zealand via the internet or a TCSP, with no substantive link to, or apparent intention of operating in, New Zealand. 4 The Government has introduced a number of reforms to strengthen New Zealand’s company registration system, while at the same time maintaining its reputation as a good and easy place in which to conduct business. The Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism Act 2009 (the AML-CFT Act), which comes into force on 30 June 2013, will impose a number of due diligence requirements on New Zealand based TCSPs. These providers will be reporting entities under this Act, requiring them to undertake identity verification and risk assessments and to report any suspicious matters to the NZ Police Financial Intelligence Unit. Overseas-based TCSPs will not be subject to this requirement. 5 In addition, the Companies and Limited Partnerships Amendment Bill (the Bill) includes a number of measures intended to reduce the misuse of New Zealand’s companies regime and to give the Registrar of Companies (the Registrar) enhanced powers to respond to risks relating to the integrity of information recorded on the companies register (agreed by Cabinet in 2010 \[EGI Min (10) 17/5 refers\]). 6 The Bill passed its first reading in the House on 24 July 2012 and was referred to the Commerce Committee for consideration. The Committee has received 13 submissions on the Bill, a number of which propose that further measures to reduce the potential for misuse of New Zealand companies should be included in the Bill. In Confidence MBIEMAKO 2937888 4 Developments 7 Since Cabinet’s decision in 2010, a number of further incidents of the misuse of New Zealand entities for money laundering, fraud and tax evasion in overseas jurisdictions have come to light. Since 2010, the New Zealand Police Financial Intelligence Unit and Interpol have received 171 requests for assistance regarding 248 companies allegedly facilitating crimes. This averages at more than eight companies a month, a significant increase from the rate of less than three companies a month between 2006 and 2010. In almost all cases, limited information is able to be provided concerning the activities of the companies concerned, or who ultimately controls them. 8 A number of these cases have received considerable media attention and may have already damaged New Zealand’s reputation as a well regulated jurisdiction. While the Companies Office is undertaking increased risk assessment of companies, there are limits to the effectiveness of this work under the current legislation. There has been specific criticism of the measures included in the Bill as not going far enough to prevent pervasive misuse of New Zealand-registered companies. 9 The misuse of New Zealand companies was further highlighted after New Zealand was removed from the European Union banking and corporate “white list” in February 2011. The activities of New Zealand registered shell companies have been linked to this removal, although the European Union’s requirements relate primarily to anti-money laundering and terrorism financing controls. The commencement of the AML-CFT Act will put in place the measures required by the European Union in this area. 10 I am also aware of reputational issues involving the misuse of building societies and the Financial Service Providers Register. Officials are examining whether further measures are required to address these issues and will provide me with advice on these matters by the end of the year. 11 It is my view that in light of this information a number of further amendments to the Companies Act 1993 and the Limited Partnerships Act 2008 should be considered in order to improve the accountability, transparency and enforcement of these regimes. These proposals have developed out of Cabinet’s request for further measures to improve ‘legal person transparency’ and assist the investigation and prosecution of serious crime \[DES (11) 2/3 refers\]. These measures are outlined in a table in Annex 1. They have been considered against the following requirements: a. An efficient company registration regime should remain a competitive advantage for New Zealand; b. Any measures should be effective in reducing misuse of the company registration regime; and c. The costs of legitimate businesses should be minimal unless the benefits can be clearly demonstrated to outweigh those costs. 12 I consider the amendments detailed below to meet these requirements. I have also been advised that they would not impact on New Zealand’s World Bank ranking for either starting a business of for ease of doing business. In Confidence MBIEMAKO 2937888 5 Accountability Measure Requiring New Zealand Companies to have a Resident Director 13 I recommend all New Zealand incorporated companies be required to have a director who is either a resident of New Zealand or a resident director in a prescribed enforcement country. 14 The Bill, as it currently stands, requires companies to have either a resident director or a resident agent. It includes an exemption for companies with resident directors in an enforcement country, which will include Australia. My proposal would involve removing the resident agent option from the Bill, but retaining the enforcement country exemption. The Companies Office would be able to require confirmation of residency on a risk assessed basis. 15 While the resident agent requirement was considered better than the status quo, it will only provide limited deterrence, as many criminals who seek to register a New Zealand company already use a local agent. The proposed duties for resident agents are not onerous and the penalties for non-compliance are light. There is no obligation for a resident agent to know much at all about the company they represent. In fact, it would be in their interests to know less rather than more about any such company. 16 Resident agents will therefore be of limited help to enforcement agencies and will in many cases not be legally liable for the actions of the company. Also, as there is no clear legislative precedent for such a company officer, the legal requirements necessary to underpin their functions and duties are novel and untested. 17 Requiring a resident director (without the alternative of a resident agent) would ensure that there is a person in New Zealand to hold criminally liable for the company's actions. Of the companies that have been identified as being involved in money laundering, fraud and tax evasion in overseas jurisdictions, a large number do not or did not have a resident director. I note that requiring a resident director is also consistent with the approach taken in a number of other jurisdictions, including Australia. 18 In addition, requiring a resident director would create a significant barrier for overseas based TCSPs that register companies in New Zealand. That is, offshore based TCSPs will need to seek the agreement of a New Zealand resident to act as a director for these companies, which may be difficult considering the legal liability associated with acting as a director. As noted above, New Zealand based TCSPs will be required to undertake due diligence and report suspicious matters to the Department of Internal Affairs under the AML-CFT Act. 19 The exemption of companies with resident directors from prescribed enforcement countries (Australia initially) is a compromise designed to ensure that this change does not impact Australia-based New Zealand companies, which currently make up the majority of companies without a New Zealand resident director. Additional countries will also be able to be prescribed if the Government is confident that they would impose New Zealand criminal fines. In Confidence MBIEMAKO 2937888 6 Im pact 20 The requirement for a resident director would therefore only impact the less than one per cent of New Zealand registered companies that are estimated not to already have a resident director in either New Zealand or Australia (4,200 out of 550,000). This figure is an estimate because information regarding directors’ country of residence is only available for about 85 per cent of companies. 21 Around 1,200 of the 4,200 companies affected have been categorised as “high risk” by the Companies Office since risk assessment began in 2010. These companies are still on the register as they meet the current registration requirements. Many of these companies have been created by the 77 TCSPs that the Companies Office monitors. A number of companies that have previously been placed in this category have subsequently been tied to criminal activity. Deterring these entities from continuing to trade on New Zealand’s reputation is a benefit rather than a cost to the New Zealand economy. 22 Therefore less than 3,000 of the companies affected are likely to be legitimately carrying on business in New Zealand. It should be noted a significant number of these companies are likely to be shell companies that have not yet been identified by the Companies Office. 23 I acknowledge that some companies may wish to have New Zealand subsidiaries, without New Zealand based directors, for legitimate governance reasons; however, these companies will have a range of options with different costs for complying with the new requirement. 24 Firstly, legitimate companies with substantive operations in New Zealand could hire a New Zealand based director. According to the Institute of Directors, average directors’ fees are in the order of $33,000 per year. The larger companies will pay an average of $50,000 while at the very small end of the scale the fees would be around a few thousand dollars. These costs will only be incurred if a company decides to increase the size of its board rather than replacing an existing director. There may also be additional costs associated with the complication and inconvenience of having a director who is based in a different country to the rest of a company’s board. 25 Companies that incorporate in New Zealand in order to hold intellectual property will need to hire a resident director, however I expect that the director fees would be low, reflecting the fact that the company is inactive. 26 Some resident directors may choose to act as a “proxy” for an overseas person by signing away their day-to-day powers over to another person, as allowed by the Companies Act. These proxy directors may have a lower level of legal liability for the actions of the company and would be less effective in assisting enforcement agencies. However, this could also provide a lower cost compliance option for overseas-based New Zealand companies that do not wish to have an actual director based in New Zealand. 27 Alternatively, persons based offshore are able to incorporate in their country of residence and still operate in New Zealand, without the need to have a New Zealand resident director. 28 I consider the benefits of this proposal to outweigh the costs that will be imposed on the relatively small number of legitimate companies affected. In Confidence MBIEMAKO 2937888 7 Consultation 29 Targeted consultation was undertaken on this issue in 2010, at which time Business New Zealand and the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants opposed requiring a resident director, but supported the resident agent proposal. 30 The majority of submissions to the Select Committee on the Bill have identified the limitations of the resident agent option, as stated above, with the Institute of Directors in New Zealand and the New Zealand Shareholders Association submitting that the resident agent option should be removed in favour of simply requiring a resident director. 31 The NZ Police, Reserve Bank, Financial Markets Authority and Ministry of Justice consider that this measure would significantly improve the effectiveness of enforcement actions. The Inland Revenue Department considers that the resident director requirement may also aid in their auditing of New Zealand companies, by providing a New Zealand based director to provide the required information and who is liable in certain circumstances for the tax obligations of the company. Transparency Measures Requiring a Date of Birth and Place of Birth 32 I recommend that company directors be required to provide their date of birth and place of birth. While Cabinet has previously decided not to adopt these measures, I consider them to be worth re-evaluating in light of recent examples involving the misuse of New Zealand companies. This information would be held by the Registrar and would not be on the public register. 33 These measures would provide additional levers for enforcement agencies to identify directors and general partners in an investigation. It is not uncommon for more than one person with the same name (e.g. father and son) to reside at the same residential address. Where enforcement or compliance action is required against an individual director, clear and accurate identification is desirable. 34 In a case where there are concerns about a company, the Registrar could, after the Bill is in force, require these details to be confirmed or corrected. If false details have been provided, the entity could be “flagged”, then deregistered and the directors and other officers banned. 35 Requiring directors to provide their date and place of birth would bring New Zealand company law into line with the Australian Corporations Act. This will in turn facilitate the harmonisation of the registration process between New Zealand and Australia. The United Kingdom and Singapore also require birth information from directors. 36 These requirements have been consulted on with industry groups, are not controversial and are of no significant cost to business. A number of submissions on the Bill are supportive of this measure. In Confidence MBIEMAKO 2937888 8 Identifying Ultimate Holding Companies 37 A number of submissions to the Select Committee on the Bill have also proposed requiring companies to advise the Registrar of its ultimate holding company, if it has one. The ultimate holding company is a company which controls the registered company, whether by equity ownership or otherwise. This holding company is currently not readily apparent, especially if the chain of holding companies includes offshore entities. This disclosure is a matter of public interest and record so that persons dealing with a company can know where “control” ultimately lies. 38 Australian companies are currently required to publicly disclose their ultimate holding company to the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC). This only applies if the ultimate controller is a company rather than an individual. The ultimate holding company is defined in the Australian Corporations Act as the holding company that is not itself a subsidiary. In effect it is the company that has control over the composition of the board of directors. 39 I consider this proposal to have merit and recommend the Companies Act should be amended to require companies to inform the Registrar of their ultimate holding company if they have one, in line with Australian requirements. 40 The management of a company will know who their ultimate holding company is and I therefore consider there to be minimal compliance costs associated with this change. Enforcement Measure Enabling Information on Ultimate Ownership and Control to be Required 41 I recommend expanding the Registrar’s powers to allow him to require information identifying the ultimate ownership and control of a company. This change would go some way to addressing the concerns raised in the previous FATF assessment of New Zealand. New Zealand’s next progress report to the FATF is due to be considered at the FATF plenary in October 2013. Included in the latest FATF standards, issued in February this year, is a recommendation that: Countries should ensure that there is adequate, accurate and timely information on the beneficial ownership and control of legal persons that can be obtained or accessed in a timely fashion by competent authorities. 42 While the Registrar and other authorities already have investigation powers, these new powers would allow the Registrar to require companies and other relevant persons to provide information on who really owns the company if the shares are held in a trust, and to provide information on any person who is controlling the management of the company. Refusal to provide this information would be a serious and persistent breach of the Companies Act and could ultimately result in the removal of the company from the register. 43 This information would only be required by the Registrar on a risk assessed basis and the vast majority of New Zealand companies would be unaffected. In Confidence MBIEMAKO 2937888 9 Limited Partnerships 44 The concerns relating the misuse of New Zealand companies also extend to the limited partnerships regime created under the Limited Partnerships Act 2008. From its inception there has been a high uptake of the New Zealand limited partnership vehicle by offshore interests which have no business presence in New Zealand and general and limited partners who are located wholly offshore. Many of registered limited partnerships are known to be carrying on business as offshore financial institutions. 45 The proposals in the paper would require limited partnerships to have a general partner who is: a natural person resident in New Zealand; or partnership with a partner who is a resident in New Zealand, or a New Zealand company with a resident director. This will apply to the approximately 440 limited partnerships out of the 1380 (32 per cent) currently registered who have no connection with New Zealand. 46 I propose that, to the extent that they are applicable, the proposed measures in this paper should also apply to limited partnerships, noting that some changes will be needed to reflect the differences between the companies and limited partnerships. 47 I propose that Cabinet delegate authority to the Minister of Commerce, the Minister of Economic Development and the Minister of Finance, to take decisions on minor policy issues relating to these changes, including the application of these proposals to limited partnerships. International Obligations 48 New Zealand has obligations under the World Trade Organisation General Agreement of Trade in Services and in the services and investment chapters of various bilateral and plurilateral free trade agreements. These obligations may be relevant to the resident director requirement if New Zealand was found to be modifying the conditions of competition in favour of its own service suppliers or investors. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade does not consider there to be a high risk that New Zealand would be found to be in violation of these obligation Consultation 49 Consultation has been undertaken with the Registrar of Companies and the inter- departmental Organised Crime Policy Committee, comprising of: the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet; the Police; the Inland Revenue Department; the Financial Markets Authority; the Reserve Bank; the Department of Internal Affairs; the Serious Fraud Office; Treasury; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade; and the Ministry of Justice. In addition, the views of submitters on the Companies and Limited Partnerships Amendment Bill have been taken into account when formulating these proposals. Financial Implications 50 While there will be costs associated with the establishment of any new registration requirement, the Companies Office considers that it would be able to absorb these within current baselines. The proposal to require a resident director will be less costly and complex to implement than the existing measure in the Bill allowing for resident agents. 51 The enhanced powers of the Registrar may give rise to enforcement action. Any costs to the Companies Office arising out of these proposals would be absorbed within the current baseline funding for its current enforcement functions. In Confidence MBIEMAKO 2937888 10 Human Rights 52 The proposals in this paper appear to be consistent with the rights and freedoms affirmed in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 (NZBORA) and the Human Rights Act 1990. A final conclusion as to the consistency of the proposals with NZBORA will be possible once the legislation is drafted. Legislative Implications 53 The Companies and Limited Partnerships Amendment Bill would provide the appropriate legislative vehicle for progressing the recommended measures. If agreed, these proposals may be included as recommendations in the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment’s report to the Commerce Committee. Regulatory Impact Analysis 54 The Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) requirements apply to the proposal in this paper and a Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) has been prepared and is attached. The Regulatory Impact Analysis Team (RIAT) has reviewed the RIS prepared by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, and considers that the information and analysis summarised in the RIS partially meets the quality assurance criteria. Quality of the Impact Analysis 55 The RIS provides adequate support for a decision on whether to remove the Resident Agent option. However, on the issues of transparency and enforcement the problem definition is not set out clearly enough to enable the reader to judge whether the proposed interventions will provide the best possible solutions. There has been only limited consultation on the proposals, but the RIS draws appropriately on the previous consultation and the input received during the Select Committee stage of the Bill. Consistency with Government Statement on Regulation 56 I have considered the analysis and advice of my officials, as summarised in the attached Regulatory Impact Statement and I am satisfied that, aside from the risks, uncertainties and caveats already noted in this Cabinet paper, the regulatory proposals recommended in this paper:  Are required in the public interest;  Will deliver the highest net benefits of the practical options available; and  Are consistent with our commitments in the Government Statement on Regulation Publicity 57 It is likely that the Bill’s progression through the select committee process will receive some media attention. Recently some reporters have criticised the Bill as not going far enough to prevent the misuse of corporate entities. Conversely any decision to implement further measures may be opposed by some commentators if they are thought to create an impediment to the starting or running of a business. I do not propose any media statement on these matters while the Bill is under consideration by the Select Committee. In Confidence MBIEMAKO 2937888 11 Recommendations It is recommended that the Committee. 1 Note that there have been a number of recent examples of New Zealand companies being used by criminals to mask the source of funds used to buy property, conceal true ownership of property, maintain control of criminal proceeds and assets and obscure the link between illegal activity and assets; 2 Note that the majority of these companies had no substantive link to New Zealand and were seeking to exploit New Zealand’s reputation as a well regulated jurisdiction; 3 Note that while the Companies and Limited Partnerships Amendment Bill includes some measures to reduce this misuse, there are a number of further measures that could be implemented that would further improve the effectiveness of the Companies Act 1993 in this area, at minimal cost to legitimate businesses; 4 Agree that the Companies Act 1993 be amended to require New Zealand incorporated companies to have a director who is either a resident of New Zealand or a resident director in a prescribed enforcement country; 5 Agree that the Companies Act 1993 be amended to require directors to provide their date and place of birth to the Registrar when they are appointed; 6 Agree that the Companies Act 1993 be amended to require companies to publicly disclose their ultimate holding company, if they have one; 7 Agree that the Companies Act 1993 be amended to provide the Registrar with the power to require companies to provide information relating to their ultimate ownership and control; 8 Agree in principle that the same decisions made in respect of companies also apply to limited partnerships to the extent that they are applicable; 9 Agree that a committee consisting of the Minister of Commerce, the Minister of Economic Development and the Minister of Finance may take decisions on any necessary transitional provisions required to implement recommendations 4 – 8 above; 10 Agree that a committee consisting of the Minister of Commerce, the Minister of Economic Development and the Minister of Finance may take decisions on minor policy issues relating to these changes, including the application of these proposals to limited partnerships; and 11 Note that these decisions will be given effect through amendments to the Companies and Limited Partnerships Amendment Bill. Hon Craig Foss Minister of Commerce \_\_\_\_\_ /\_\_\_\_\_ /\_\_\_\_\_ In Confidence MBIEMAKO 2937888 12 Annex 1 – Proposed Measures Proposed Measure Benefits Potential Costs Accountability Requiring New Zealand companies to have a director who is resident in New Zealand or a resident director in an enforcement country (Australia initially). Resident directors are legally accountable for the actions of the company; able to usefully aid enforcement agencies in their enquiries; and less complex to implement than resident agents. It is difficult to quantify these benefits. Around 4,200 out of 550,000 companies (0.77%) do not already have a director resident in NZ or Australia. Less than 3,000 of these companies are likely to be legitimate companies. The cost of a resident director may range from a few thousand dollars to around $50,000, and may be defrayed by replacing an existing director. Transparency Requiring the date and place of birth of directors. Provides additional levers to assist in the identification of directors in the event of an investigation. While this would apply to all companies the costs would be negligible. Requiring companies to disclose to the Registrar their ultimate holding company. Improves public transparency regarding the control of New Zealand companies and bring New Zealand into line with Australian requirements. There is no data on how many companies have an ultimate holding company. However, the cost on impacted companies is likely to be low. Enforcement Expanding the Registrar’s powers to seek information on the ultimate ownership and control of a company. Would align New Zealand with the latest FATF recommendations regarding corporate transparency and provide a disincentive to use New Zealand companies for financial crime. Note most jurisdictions have this ability. Would be applied on a risk- assessed basis and should not impose costs except on those firms under investigation. In Confidence MBIEMAKO 2937888 13 Regulatory Impact Statement Enhancements to the Companies and Limited Partnerships Acts to reduce misuse by organised crime Agency Disclosure Statement 1 This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. 2 It provides an analysis of further measures to enhance the effectiveness of the Companies Act 1993 and the Limited Partnerships Act 2008 to better address issues relating to shell companies in order to ensure New Zealand remains a trusted place to do business. The status quo is considered to not sufficiently deter criminals from registering companies and limited partnerships in the first place, allow timely detection by the Registrar nor address the perception that New Zealand’s company registration system is particularly vulnerable to misuse 3 The options fall out of further work the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment has done as requested by Cabinet to consider further measures for improving New Zealand ‘legal person transparency’ to assist the investigation and prosecution of serious crime \[DES (11) 2/3 refers\]. Options have been recommended in the context of a framework that: a. An efficient company registration regime should remain a competitive advantage fo r New Zealand; b. Any measures should be effective in reducing misuse of the company registration regime; c. The costs of legitimate businesses should be minimal unless the benefits can be clearly demonstrated to outweigh those costs; and d. That, where possible, there are benefits of aligning with the Australian regime. 4 Consultation has been undertaken with the Registrar of Companies and the inter- departmental Organised Crime Policy Committee, comprising of: the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet; the Inland Revenue Department; the Financial Markets Authority; the Reserve Bank; the Department of Internal Affairs; the Serious Fraud Office; Treasury; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade; and the Ministry of Justice. In addition, the views of submitters on the Companies and Limited Partnerships Amendment Bill, currently before select committee have been taken into account when formulating these proposals. Melanie Porter Manager, Corporate Law and Governance Competition, Trade & Investment Economic Development Group 021 584 002 In Confidence MBIEMAKO 2937888 14 Status Quo and Problem Definition New Zealand’s Registration System 1 The key feature of New Zealand’s registration requirements is that anybody can register a company or limited partnership from anywhere, online, at low cost and with only basic information needing to be supplied. A company or limited partnership can be registered in New Zealand within a few hours of applying. 2 This reflects underlying principles of both the Companies Act 1993 and the Limited Partnerships Act 2008. Both Acts provide basic and adaptable requirements for the incorporation, organisation, and operation of those legal persons. A legal person can enter into contracts, undertake business transactions and take, or be subject to, legal action in its own right. This means the persons behind the company or limited partnership are able to take business risks with limited personal liability. 3 The Registrar of Companies (‘the Registrar’) is a statutory position that exercises the powers, duties and functions of the Registrar under the Companies Act and the Limited Partnerships Act. Details of the company or limited partnership are kept by the Registrar on specific registers. 4 The Registrar has powers of inspection to investigate compliance with the Companies Act, the Financial Reporting Act 1993 or the Limited Partnerships Act 2008. The Registrar also has powers to remove companies from the register for various grounds including where it is satisfied that the company has ceased to carry on business and there is no other reason for the company to continue in existence, or where the application or annual fee has not been paid. 5 The simplicity of the registration regime is deliberate and is a contributor to New Zealand’s enviable reputation for ease of doing business. Coupled with its reputation as a well- regulated jurisdiction, this provides a comparative advantage that underpins New Zealand’s ability to attract and retain internationally-mobile business investment. Companies and Limited Partnerships Amendment Bill 6 A review in 2010 of the circumstances surrounding the SP Trading Ltd case 1 identified a number of areas where New Zealand’s registration regime is out of step with comparable foreign counterparts. It further identified an inability for the Registrar to take administrative and investigative steps to ensure the integrity of the information on the companies register where he is aware that such information is inaccurate. 1 This New Zealand-registered company was implicated in a weapons smuggling operation in Thailand. It had no business presence in New Zealand and its sole nominee director had signed a comprehensive power of attorney regarding the control of the company to two offshore nationals. In Confidence MBIEMAKO 2937888 15 7 In October 2011 the Companies and Limited Partnership s Amendment Bill (the Bill) was introduced. The Bill is currently in the Select Committee process and a report back is due by 24 January 2013. It is expected to be enacted in the first half of 2013. 8 The Bill intends to address issues relating to shell companies in order to ensure New Zealand remains a trusted place to do business. As it was introduced will put in place the following measures: a. Companies and limited partnerships, if they have no director or general partner resident in New Zealand (or an enforcement country 2 ), will need to appoint a New Zealand resident agent to respond to requests from regulatory, investigatory and law enforcement agencies; b. The Registrar has enhanced investigative powers to have in formation on the register confirmed or corrected a nd verified if required; c.The Registrar can publish notes of warning on the register if it has concerns about the bona fides of a compa ny or limited partnership on any of the current grounds for removal plu s three new additional grounds. This warning power extends to inserting a flag in relation to any other company or limited partnership that shares a director, a general part ner or an officer with that entity under investigation; d. A company or limited partnership may additionally be removed from the register if it fails to assist the Registrar, or there is substantial or persistent failure to comply with the Compan ies Act 1993 or the Financial Reporting Act 1993 ; and e. The Registrar can prohibit persons from acting as directors, general partners or resident agents for up to five years where the companies or limited partnerships for which they are responsible have been removed from the register through the exercise of the new removal powers. Update since 2010 9 The Bill goes some way towards addressing the vulnerabilities of the New Zealand registration system by putting in place additional registration and maintenance requirements. However, the measures in the Bill were recognised at the time as being limited in nature and that further work would be undertaken in order to address other issues around the misuse of New Zealand legal persons by offshore criminal interests. 2 This will be a country that has an agreement with New Zealand that allows for the recognition and enforcement there of New Zealand judgements imposing regulatory regime criminal fines. In Confidence MBIEMAKO 2937888 16 10 The wider package of w ork included: a. Across government work being carried out in relation to key actions the Response to Organised Crime report (improving domestic and international information sharing, legal assistance and coordination; protecting against cybercrime; preventing bribery and corruption; enhancing anti-money laundering and crime proceeds recovery; disrupting identity crime and reducing misuse of legal persons); b. The full implementation of the Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism Act 2009 (AML/CFT) including imposing obligations on and supervision of trust and company service providers (TCSPs) 3 ; c.Responding to the Financial Action Task Force recommendations 4 ; and d. Establishment of the Registries I ntegrity and Enforcement Team within t he Companies Office. 11 While by far the vast majority of the approximately 550,000 companies and limited partnerships registered are legitimate, low entry barriers and a high international standing also makes the New Zealand registration regime vulnerable to misuse. 12 Since 2010, there has been ample further evidence to show that New Zealand registered corporate structures are still being used by criminals, often with the assistance of TCSPs, to create a confusing web of legal persons to launder money, traffic arms and illegal substances, and commit tax and other fraud. Corporate structures can be used by criminals to mask the source of funds used to buy property, conceal true ownership of property, maintain control of criminal proceeds and assets and obscure the link between illegal activity and assets. These layers make it exceptionally difficult for law enforcement to identify individuals and hold them to account. 13 Concerns relating to the exploitation of the New Zealand companies registration regime by rogue offshore interests also extends to the limited partnerships regime established under the Limited Partnerships Act 2008. From its inception there has been a high uptake of the New Zealand limited partnership vehicle by offshore interests which have no business presence in New Zealand and general and limited partners who are located wholly offshore. Many of registered limited partnerships are known to be carrying on business as offshore financial institutions. 3 TCSPs act as formation agents for legal persons and legal arrangements, arrange for persons to act as nominee directors or trustee shareholders and/or provide registered offices or correspondence or administrative addresses for registered companies. 4 New Zealand was last assessed in 2009 and is currently non-compliant with several FATF recommendations. Many of these will be addressed when the AML/CFT legislation comes fully into force in July 2013. The other main compliance gap is in the transparency of legal persons where authorities and regulators face difficulties obtaining information concerning the beneficial owners and ultimate controllers of companies and limited partnerships, as well as details of their activities. In Confidence MBIEMAKO 2937888 17 14 It appears that those who wish to conduct unlaw ful activities overseas are increasingly seeking to incorporate companies in New Zealand. They will do this: a.In order to benefit from New Zealand’s positive reputation as a well-regulated jurisdiction which will provide a veneer of legitimacy and credibility to facilitate their unlawful conduct; b. Because there is no need to have substantive links to New Zealand; and c.Because it is easier and cheaper to register companies here than in other jurisdictions, meaning that New Zealand companies are essentially disposable, being easily and cheaply replaceable if offending is detected or the company is struck off. 15 The Police have provided statistics on how many requests it has received about New Zealand companies allegedly committing crime in foreign countries. Taskforce Bael 5 identified that between 2006 and 2010, 134 requests had been received from overseas law enforcement agencies by the FIU, Interpol and NZ Customs Service. These requests identified 143 NZ companies allegedly facilitating crime. This is less than three per month. 16 Since 2010, the FIU and Interpol have received a further 171 requests regarding 248 companies allegedly facilitating crimes. This averages at more than 8 companies a month being identified as being involved in crime. 17 Fifty of these companies have a close association with one particular New Zealand resident. These are suspected of moving funds for overseas clients for the purposes of tax evasion and/or money laundering. Many of this person’s companies have already been struck off the register. 18 Of the remaining 341 companies, 330 do not or did not have a resident director (97%). Many of these companies have also been struck off. 19 The two company formation agents that have registered the majority of the 391 companies have registered approximately 4,000 companies in total 6 . In total, since 2006, 305 requests have been received regarding 391 companies. These figures are only what is reported to the FIU. The true extent of companies being exploited for criminal purposes cannot be quantified. 20 Quantifying the extent of money laundering is complicated but is estimated by Police to be approximately NZ$1.5 billion not including laundered funds relating to tax evasion. The Police and the FIU do not have enough information to accurately comment on the total scale of exploitation related to New Zealand offending but confirm that it is taking place. 5 An Organised Financial Crime Agency of New Zealand led multi-agency investigation as a result of the SP Trading incident. 6 Noting that there are over 550,000 companies on the register and that over 3,000 of this 4,000 have already been removed by the Registrar. In Confidence MBIEMAKO 2937888 18 21 Similar statistics apply to limited partnerships where 32% of those currently registered have no connection with New Zealand. The evidence from Police is that the formation and sale of companies and limited partnerships in a ‘ready-made’ form is a common method for offshore interests to obtain a New Zealand corporate form. Conclusion 22 The status quo, including the passing of the Bill as it stands, will still not meet the current challenges and sufficiently deter criminals from registering companies and limited partnerships in the first place, allow timely detection by the Registrar nor address the perception that New Zealand’s company registration system is particularly vulnerable to misuse. 23 In particular, the requirement for a New Zealand connection is weak, the information requirements for registration remain low and the Registrar is missing some simple but important tools for more effective enforcement. 24 If the status quo is maintained the risk of repeat examples like SP Trading Limited is still high. In cases where the illegal activity being conducted by the company involves breaches of international obligations such as United Nations sanctions, such episodes are especially undesirable. The repercussions of even a very small number of high profile cases have the potential to cause considerable reputational damage and reduction in confidence. Objectives 25 The framework for how the addition of further measures could usefully be considered is in the context that: a. An efficient company registration regime should remain a competitive advantage fo r New Zealand; b. Any measures should be effective in reducing misuse of the company registration regime; c. The costs of legitimate businesses should be minimal unless the benefits can be clearly demonstrated to outweigh those costs; and d. That, where possible, there are benefits of aligning with the Australian regime. 26 It is intended that individuals and companies that do not pose a high risk will continue to use the company and limited partnership registration system on a ‘good faith’ basis. This will help ensure that New Zealand keeps its reputation as an easy place in which to do business while taking action against those who wish to undermine our good standing as a well-regulated jurisdiction. Analysis 27 In the context of the All of Government Response to Organised Crime, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment was tasked by Cabinet to consider further measures for improving New Zealand ‘legal person transparency’ to assist the investigation and prosecution of serious crime \[DES (11) 2/3 refers\]. In Confidence MBIEMAKO 2937888 19 28 We have considered the framework outlined above in relation to many options and have undertaken consultation with the Registrar and limited consultation with the inter- departmental Organised Crime Policy group. 29 In addition, submitters on the Companies and Limited Partnerships Amendment Bill have made suggestions on measures to further strengthen the objectives of the Bill. 30 We outline several measures below as to how the Companies Act 1993 and the Limited Partnerships Act 2008 can be strengthened to reduce the misuse of legal persons by increasing accountability, transparency and enforcement while at the same time imposing minimal costs on legitimate business. Accountability – Removal of the Resident Agent Option 31 Under the Bill, companies and limited partnerships will have a choice to either appoint a New Zealand resident director or a New Zealand resident agent. 32 The objective of the measure is to provide an entry point for enforcement agencies to gain information regarding the activities of the company. Under the status quo it is difficult and costly to effectively investigate a company if all individuals are located offshore. A choice of resident agent reduces costs for businesses that wish to register in New Zealand but otherwise do not wish to have a substantive connection with New Zealand. 33 We recommend removing the option of a resident agent so that a company must appoint a resident director 7 . Disadvantages of the Status Quo - Resident Agent Option 34 The option of a resident agent was recognised at the time as being limited in nature. A resident agent will not be as effective at reducing misuse as the requirement to have a resident director and there are major disadvantages to retaining this option. 35 The most serious is that resident agents will not necessarily be of any help to enforcement agencies and will therefore defeat the primary objective of effectiveness. There is no obligation for a resident agent to know much at all about the company they represent and in fact, it will be in their interests to know less rather than more about any such company. 36 This is compounded by the less onerous duties of a resident agent who is an administrative officer only. Risk companies who are the target of this measures will undoubtedly choose a resident agent if the option is allowed. Risky company formation agents will only be too willing to perform this function. The resident agent requirement provides limited deterrence and may quickly become a loophole. 37 In addition, the resident agent is a new concept to New Zealand law there is no clear legislative precedent for such an officer. The legal requirements necessary to underpin their functions and duties are novel, uncertain and untested. 7 Or in the case of a limited partnership, a general partner who is a natural person resident in New Zealand or an enforcement country or where the general partner who is a partnership or company has at least one natural person who is resident in New Zealand or an enforcement country. In Confidence MBIEMAKO 2937888 20 38 Finally, the resident agent option will necessitate significant changes to the majority of the Companies Office online services, back office functions and search facilities to enable the new information to be collected, maintained and searched by the public. The extra costs may need to be passed on to all businesses. Benefits of a Resident Director Only 39 Police's and other agencies strong preference was, and still is, to require a resident director. Under this measure all companies which register in New Zealand would require at least one director to be ordinarily resident in New Zealand. The already agreed exemption for directors resident in enforcement countries will remain. 40 The exemption for companies with resident directors from prescribed enforcement countries is a compromise designed to ensure that this change does not impact Australia- based New Zealand companies, which currently make up the majority of companies without a New Zealand resident director. Additional countries will also be able to be prescribed if the Government is confident that they would impose both New Zealand civil and criminal penalties. 41 Requiring a resident director is only part of a response to reduce the misuse of companies and limited partnerships for organised criminal activities. However, the benefits that are that it will: a. Ensure that there is a person in New Zealand to hold criminally liable for the company's actions. A director owes duties to the company and therefore needs to have knowledge about the company; b. Bring New Zealand company law into line with comparable jurisdictions including Australia; c. Act as a better deterrent to offshore interests who do not intend to carry out lawful business. Anecdotal evidence from the Australian Securities and Investment Commission indicates that they do not experience a high incidence of the misuse of the Australian company structure by offshore interests. They attribute this to the deterrent effect of the requirement under the Australian Corporations Act for at least one company director to be ordinarily resident in Australia; and d. Create a significant barrier for overseas based TCSPs that register companies in New Zealand. Offshore based TCSPs will need to seek the agreement of a New Zealand resident to act as a director for these companies, which may be difficult considering the legal liability associated with acting as a director. Costs of a Resident Director 42 The requirement to have a New Zealand resident director or agent will impose no costs on New Zealand based companies and limited partnerships which will already have resident directors or general partners as a matter of course. Similarly, there are many overseas companies with a genuine connection with New Zealand that also have resident directors or general partners. In Confidence MBIEMAKO 2937888 21 43 We estimate that the requirement to appoint a resident director will fall on approximately 0.77 per cent of companies (approximately 4,200) currently registered in New Zealand that do not already have either a resident director in New Zealand or in a likely enforcement country 8 . 44 The requirement will also apply to approximately 439 limited partnerships out of the 1380 currently registered. 45 Around 1,200 of the companies affected have been categorised as “high risk” by the Companies Office since risk assessment began 2010. These companies are still on the register as they meet the current registration requirements. Many of these companies have been created by the 77 TCSPs that the Companies Office monitors. A number of companies that have previously been placed in this category have subsequently been tied to criminal activity. Deterring these entities from continuing to trade on New Zealand’s reputation is a benefit rather than a cost to the New Zealand economy. 46 Therefore less than 3,000 of the companies affected are likely to be legitimately carrying on business in New Zealand. It should be noted that a significant number of these companies are likely to be shell companies that have not already been identified by the Companies Office. Examples of the types of legitimate companies that will be impacted by this change are: a. A New Zealand subsidiary with directors that are all directors or senior managers of its overseas parent company. In most of the situations that we are aware of, the immediate parent company is based in Australia and is required under the Corporations Act to have an Australian resident director. These companies would not therefore be affected. b. New Zealand companies with a parent company elsewhere, such as the United States or Singapore, will be required to hire a resident director in New Zealand. These companies will either need to replace an existing director with a New Zealand resident or add a New Zealand resident as an additional director. This category is likely to consist of a relatively low number of large multinational companies. c. Some companies that are based overseas but do carry out some business in New Zealand may have incorporated in New Zealand instead of in their home country for reputational or tax reasons. These companies will need to determine whether these benefits warrant hiring a director in New Zealand, or whether they would be better to incorporate in their home jurisdiction. d. We are aware of some companies that incorporate in New Zealand in order to hold intellectual property, which may consist of New Zealand patents or may be purely a way of preventing a New Zealand entity from using their name. While these companies will need to hire a resident director, we expect that the fees would be low to reflect the fact that the company is inactive. 8 At this early stage, Australia only. In Confidence MBIEMAKO 2937888 22 47 The incremental cost f or legitimate companies appointing a resident director will arise when they choose to increase the size of the board rather than replacing an offshore director. The costs will be in recruitment and remuneration of a resident director. There may also be additional costs associated with the complication and inconvenience of having a director who is based in a different country to the rest of the board e.g. communications (including time delays) and travel costs. 48 The Institute of Directors reports that there is no shortage of willing directors but it is the quality that will vary. This will need to be taken into account by legitimate businesses as will the following costs: The Institute of Directors 2011 Director Remuneration survey shows average directors’ fees are in the order of $33,000. The larger companies will pay an average of $50,000. At the very small end of the scale the fees would be around a few thousand dollars. The cost of appointing a director for a legitimate company will be incrementally more than for the resident agent that otherwise may have been appointed. This cost was estimated in 2010 to be between $500 and $2000 p.a. 49 Some resident directors may choose to act as a “proxy” for another person by signing away their day-to-day powers over to another person, as allowed by the Companies Act. These directors may have a lower level of legal liability for the actions of the company and would be less effective in assisting enforcement agencies. However, this would also provide a lower cost compliance option for overseas-based New Zealand companies that do not wish to have an actual director based in New Zealand. 50 Proxy directors are likely to charge a broad range of fees, depending on how concerned they are about their level of legal liability. We are aware of some cases where New Zealand residents have been willing to act as directors for a very low charge. 51 While proxy directors will allow determined shell companies to incorporate in New Zealand, we do not consider that this will undermine the resident director requirement. These persons would still have a higher degree of legal liability than resident agents and would therefore act as a more effective and internationally recognised deterrent to the misuse of New Zealand companies. The Bill also provides the Registrar with the ability to ban directors for a period up to ten years for breaches of the Companies Act. Over time we expect that the banning and prosecution of New Zealand proxy directors will discourage New Zealanders from acting as a proxy director if they suspect the company is involved in criminal matters. 52 Companies could also choose to deregister as a company in New Zealand and instead register a company in their home jurisdiction. This company would be able to be registered on the New Zealand overseas company register and could continue to operate in New Zealand. In Confidence MBIEMAKO 2937888 23 53 We believe that the benefits of requiring a resident director will outweigh the marginal increased cost on a limited number of companies compared to a resident agent. Many of these companies will have no substantive link to New Zealand and are the intended target of this measure. The limited exemption proposal will remove these costs from those businesses that have a director residing in approved low-risk jurisdictions (specifically Australia at this stage). The option of other business governance options will reduce costs for those who wish to remain registered but otherwise have no desire to have a genuine New Zealand director. Consultation 54 Targeted consultation was undertaken on this issue in 2010, at which time Business New Zealand and the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants were opposed to requiring a resident director, but were supportive of the resident agent proposal. 55 The majority of submissions to the Select Committee on the Bill have identified the limitations of the resident agent option: a. The Institute of Directors in New Zealand and the New Zealand Shareholders Association have submitted that requiring that the resident agent should be removed in favour of simply requiring a resident director; b. Bell Gully, the New Zealand Law Society, the New Zealand Private Equity and Venture Capital Association, and Simpson Grierson are critical of the effectiveness and cost of the resident agent proposal but do not specifically address resident directors; and c. Joint submissions from Bell Gully, Chapman Tripp, Russell McVeagh and Simpson Grierson, along with an individual submission from Chapman Tripp specifically oppose requiring either a resident agent or a resident director based on costs to legitimate business. 56 Business New Zealand and the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants continue to support the resident agent option as currently included in the Bill. 57 The Inland Revenue Department considers that the resident director requirement may also aid in their auditing of New Zealand companies, by providing a New Zealand based director to provide the required information and who is liable in certain circumstances for the tax obligations of the company. 58 This proposal is supported by all of the government agencies consulted with, aside from Treasury who have reservations about the cost to legitimate business. In particular, the NZ Police, Reserve Bank, Financial Markets Authority and Ministry of Justice consider that this measure would improve the effectiveness of enforcement agencies. Transparency – More disclosure at registration 59 The current registration requirements are considered to be set at a level suitable and appropriate for companies and limited partnerships that carry on legitimate business. The Registrar takes a light-handed approach in the expectation companies and limited partnerships and their promoters have legitimate purposes and an interest in facilitating social and economic benefits within New Zealand. In Confidence MBIEMAKO 2937888 24 60 Details of t he company or limited partnership are kept by the Registrar on specific registers. Some details on the register are publicly available and some are not. This provides transparency so the public can know, to a certain extent, who they are dealing with. 61 The companies and limited partnership registration regime however fails to meet the objective of effectiveness in reducing misuse when dealing with criminal elements by not promoting transparency. Strengthening the registration regime in this regard should have a twofold benefit; firstly, increased transparency will deter criminals from registering companies and limited partnerships in New Zealand in the first place. Secondly, the availability of more accurate and up to date information about companies and limited partnerships will improve the integrity of the register and improve investigation and enforcement. 62 We recommend that further information is required that may help identify beneficial owners or ultimate controllers of risk companies or limited partnerships. A. Director Bi rth Information 63 This measure would require all directors to provide their date and place of birth to the Registrar and all general partners who are natural persons to provide their place of birth 9 . This information would form part of the register, but would not be available for public searching. It would be able to be used by the Registrar and other enforcement agencies in order to carry out their functions. Benefits a.Better identification and verification of individuals (for example, in situations where two people such as a father and son with the same name, reside at the same address); b.Alignment with the Australian regime; and c.Provides a further piece of information for the Registrar to require confirmation or correction of under the enhanced powers under the Bill. Costs 64 While this requirement will apply to all companies, no material costs to business have been identified as these details should be known to the director in any case. Consultation 65 These requirements were consulted on in 2010 with business groups, are not controversial and are of no cost to business. Consulted parties reported that international directors expect to provide this information in any event, as it is a common requirement for overseas jurisdictions. 66 A joint submission to the Select Committee from Bell Gully, Chapman Tripp, Russell McVeagh and Simpson Grierson, and an individual submission from Chapman Tripp also raised this measure as information that could be captured to improve the status quo. 9 Date of birth is already a requirement for partners who are natural persons under the Limited Partnerships Act. In Confidence MBIEMAKO 2937888 25 B.Disclosure of Ultimate Holding Company 67 A requirement that a company must advise the Registrar of its ultimate holding company, if it has one, would provide transparency regarding the control of the company. The ultimate holding company is a company which controls the registered company, whether by equity ownership or otherwise. This holding company is currently not readily apparent, especially if the chain of holding companies includes offshore entities. This is a matter of public interest and record so that persons dealing with a company can further know where ‘control’ ultimately lies. 68 This only applies if the ultimate controller is a company rather than an individual. Note that this may or may not be the same as the company’s beneficial ownership, as control can be exercised by means other than ownership. Benefits a.Alert the Registrar (and the public via register searches) who the true controller of the company is; b.Provide alignment with the Australia n regime; c. Provide a further piece of information for the Registrar to require confirmation or correction of under the enhanced powers under the Bill; and d.Provide better compliance with the Financial Action Task Force recommendations. Costs 69 While there is no data on how many companies would be impacted by this requirement, no material costs to business have been identified. This information will already be known. Consultation 70 A joint submission to the Select Committee from Bell Gully, Chapman Tripp, Russell McVeagh and Simpson Grierson, and an individual submission from Chapman Tripp also raised this measure as information that could be captured to improve the status quo. Enforcement – Further powers of the Registrar 71 The enforcement regime of the Registrar will be given added strength under the Bill to deal with at risk companies and limited partnerships. There is value in continuing to enhance this regime to detect and prevent misuse of legal persons. 72 Specifically, we recommend that a further tool be added to increase transparency and uncover beneficial owners and/or ultimate controllers if it is necessary to do so. Improved enforcement will also provide a deterrent effect on criminals considering registering a legal person in New Zealand. 73 All submitters were comfortable with the increased powers of the Registrar under the Companies and Limited Partnerships Amendment Bill. In Confidence MBIEMAKO 2937888 26 Seeking information on ultimate ownership and control 74 The Financial Action Task Force recommends that countries should ensure that there is adequate, accurate and timely information on the beneficial ownership and control of legal persons that can be obtained or accessed in a timely fashion by competent authorities. This ensures an international standard that aids enforcement and inter-country assistance. 75 The Registrar’s powers could be expanded to allow it to require information on the ultimate ownership and control of an entity to be provided as a result of a risk based assessment. This new power would allow this information to be obtained without the need to link the request other specific potential wrongdoing. Refusal to provide this information would be an offence under the Companies Act and could ultimately result in the removal of the company from the register. Costs 76 The vast majority of New Zealand companies would be unaffected. This power would also only be applied on a risk assessed basis, as with other inspection powers in the Companies Act. The benefits of increased transparency of the ultimate owners and controllers of companies would appear to outweigh any costs. Conclusions and Recommendations 77 It is recommended that: a. The option of resident agent be removed from the Companies and Limited Partnership s Amendment Bill; b. Date and place of birth of company directors is collected at registration; and c. That companies and limited partnerships must advise the Registrar of its ultimate holding company if it has one. 78 That the powers of the Registrar be clarified so that: a. The Registrar can require information on the ultimate ownership and control of an entity. Implementation 79 The proposals will require legislative amendments to the Companies Act 1993 and the Limited Partnerships Act 2008. We expect that the Companies and Limited Partnerships Amendment Bill will provide the appropriate vehicle to process these amendments. 80 Enforcement will be undertaken through the enhanced powers of the Registrar, and by modifying the application process to ensure that all new incorporation applicants are subjected to the new regime. 81 Publicity would be given to legislative changes by way of a communications programme which would be delivered through the usual Companies Office systems. This would include website content, communication through the Ministry of Economic Development Monthly Business Update publication, media releases, and short articles in professional publications such as the New Zealand Law Society magazine Law Talk. In Confidence MBIEMAKO 2937888 27 Monitoring, Evaluation and Review 82 Quarterly statistics on the number of requests from offshore enforcement agencies to the New Zealand police for assistance in investigations into New Zealand registered companies will be compared pre- and post- intervention in order to ascertain whether there has been a drop in the number of such companies involved in suspected criminal activity. 83 Monitoring of the effect of compliance costs will take place via the regular Companies Office surveys of its clients (which will include a specific question regarding the new processes), and via feedback through its website and contact centre. In addition, feedback from the business.govt.nz website (which is a cross-governmental business information website) will be monitored. 84 Monthly, quarterly, and annual registrations will be compared pre- and post-intervention to ascertain whether the intervention has had a material impact on the overall number of business registrations. These data will be collected by the Companies Office as a matter of course, and are able to be analysed in this manner at minimal marginal cost to the Ministry. File No: File No: M/007/AL/004/014 MED1102430 OFFICE OF THE MINISTER FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT The Chair C ABINET ECONOMIC GROWTH AND INFRASTRUCTURE COMMITTEE NEW ZEALAND COMPANY REGISTRATION PROCESS P ROPOSAL 1 This paper seeks direction from Cabinet regarding the possible introduction of a number of statutory measures aimed at strengthening the New Zealand company registration regime to: a Address threats to the integrity and reputation of New Zealand’s companies regime; and b Give the Registrar of Companies (“Registrar”) enhanced powers to respond effectively to risks which might arise in relation to the integrity of information recorded on the companies register. 2 The objective of these proposals would be to maintain and enhance the current high reputation of New Zealand as a place to do business, which is at least in part due to our company registration system and the New Zealand company form. The Companies Act 1993 has basic and adaptable requirements for the incorporation of companies. These are: a name, one or more shares, one or more shareholders (who may have limited liability), and one or more directors. 3 The implementation of these proposals requires amendment to existing legislation. There is no current legislative priority for these changes in the 2010 Legislation Programme. Accordingly, I seek a category 5 priority (instructions Parliamentary Counsel this year) if these proposals are accepted. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 4 There is evidence that individuals and groups (particularly offshore interests) are misusing the New Zealand company incorporation process and consequently threatening the international reputation of New Zealand. One recent case to receive significant publicity, both in New Zealand and internationally, is that of SP Trading Limited, where a New Zealand-incorporated company controlled from overseas was involved in chartering a plane later used in weapons trafficking in contravention of United Nations sanctions. High profile or repeated instances of foreign-controlled New Zealand companies Appendix A: Cabinet Paper- New Zealand Company Registration Process MED1102430 2 engaging in criminal activities overseas is likely to seriously impact New Zealand’s international standing. 5 The particular phenomena that sit behind these concerns relating to New Zealand’s company registration system are: a The unprecedented promotion of New Zealand- incorporated companies to wholly overseas interests by New Zealand and overseas company formation agents and brokers; and b The ability of persons based overseas to register companies in New Zealand via the internet, with no apparent intention of operating in New Zealand. 6 Officials in the Ministry of Justice are currently considering substantive reform in the context of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) reforms and in connection with New Zealand’s evaluation by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) report, to which New Zealand must respond by October 2011. In the present context, one of the significant proposed reforms is to bring company formation agents within the scope of AML legislation. This will require them to be supervised and to undertake due diligence on their customers. In conjunction with this work, further, more substantive reforms to legislation relating to the activities of companies will be considered. However, I seek the direction of Cabinet as to whether it would also be appropriate in the short term to implement a limited number of statutory measures aimed at strengthening the New Zealand company registration regime, given that the more substantive work already underway will take some time to complete. 7 Accordingly, these proposals should be seen as part of a wider overall package of reforms to strengthen New Zealand’s company registration system, while at the same time maintaining its reputation as a good and easy place in which to conduct business. In the medium term there is a broader range of issues arising out of New Zealand’s obligations as a member of FATF. As well as AML issues, in the corporate law area these include concerns around shell companies and difficulties in identifying beneficial ownership of companies. In this context a shell company refers to a company which is party to a number of transactions without itself having any significant assets or operations. Such companies are often formed to hide the true parties to the transaction. This lack of transparency is further underlined by practices such as the registered shareholder of the company holding the shares on trust for a third party and the registered directors granting wide- ranging powers of attorney over the management of the company. These act to obscure the ultimate managers and beneficial owners of the company. 8 It needs to be stressed that the measures recommended in this paper will not be a “silver bullet” to prevent all future cases such as SP MED1102430 3 Trading Limited and other similar instances of criminal and suspect activity. They will, however, strengthen the ability of the Registrar to test the bona fides of directors and the integrity of information supplied by company incorporators, and facilitate investigation and more targeted consequential action as appropriate. This will help deter those minded to exploit the highly regarded New Zealand company incorporation process for criminal and other suspect activities. 9 There are four broad groups of proposals that could be implemented in the short term which I believe would go some way towards achieving this outcome: a Requiring companies to appoint at least one director or an agent who is ordinarily resident in New Zealand: b Requiring directors to supply date and place of birth information; c Requiring all companies to apply for an IRD number as part of their registration application process; and d Enhancing the ability of the Registrar to investigate, respond to or remedy issues arising in regard to the bona fides of directors and shareholders and any integrity or compliance issues relating to company registration. 10 These changes could be implemented relatively quickly and are consistent with the objective of maintaining New Zealand’s reputation as an easy place in which to do business. 11 If all companies incorporated in New Zealand were to have either a director who is ordinarily resident in New Zealand, or a “local agent” who is resident in New Zealand, the Registrar and other parties would more easily be able to confirm the bona fides of those behind the company, test the accuracy of the personal particulars supplied as part of the registration process, and (where appropriate) hold someone to account for any breaches of the law. In order to minimise the cost to business emanating from well-regulated jurisdictions, certain exemptions to this requirement could apply where the company has directors resident in approved foreign jurisdictions, for example, Australia. 12 Requiring directors to provide information regarding their date and place of birth to the Registrar, while not constituting full identity verification, would provide an improvement to the ability of the Registrar to ensure that he is dealing with the correct individual. This birth information would not be available for public searching, however, but would be able to be used by the Registrar and enforcement agencies in order to carry out their statutory functions. MED1102430 4 13 The third proposal is that all companies which register in New Zealand should be required to apply for an IRD number. About 80% of companies already do so as part of an optional service provided by the Companies Office; and a further significant percentage go on to obtain a number shortly after incorporation. The aim of this requirement would be to provide a disincentive to those seeking to take advantage of New Zealand’s high international standing, but which do not intend to carry out lawful business in New Zealand. 14 Under the Companies Act 1993 the sanctions available to the Registrar to respond to recent cases which have attracted media interest are almost exclusively criminal. Where individuals are located offshore, the deterrent effect of and the ability to resort to such sanctions is clearly limited. The final proposal is therefore to introduce enhanced powers for the Registrar to enable him to undertake effective investigation and consequent administrative action, including: a The power to require someone to confirm or correct information on the Companies register; b The ability to “flag” a record on the Companies Office website as being under enquiry as to the integrity of the information or potential non-compliance with the Act; c The power to remove from the register a disqualified or prohibited person who acts as a director in contravention of such disqualification or prohibition; and d The power to ban a person from being involved as a director or manager of a company where they have provided inaccurate information to the Registrar or have persistently failed to comply with the requirements of the Companies Act or the Financial Reporting Act. 15 These proposals would impose relatively low additional compliance costs on companies. New Zealand-based companies would face almost no additional compliance costs, since such companies will already meet the requirements of a New Zealand-based director and an IRD number, and will only have to meet the additional requirement of supplying birth information of the directors. In the case of companies which have offshore directors, however, there would be some additional compliance costs by way of the requirement for a New Zealand based director or agent (although these would be mitigated by the proposed exemption for approved foreign jurisdictions). It should be noted, however, that the resident director proposal goes no further than the minimum requirements imposed by other comparable jurisdictions. B ACKGROUND 16 The media reporting of the SP Trading Limited case in late 2009/early 2010 highlighted certain issues with New Zealand’s MED1102430 5 company registration regime. SP Trading Limited is a New Zealand- registered company which was involved in the charter of a plane that was intercepted at Bangkok airport with a cargo of weapons. The flight originated in North Korea. UN Security Council sanctions prohibit trading in arms with North Korea. SP Trading Limited had no business presence in New Zealand. Its sole director was a New Zealand-based nominee director who had signed a power of attorney handing over all authority over the affairs of SP Trading Limited to two Ukrainian individuals. The sole shareholder was another New Zealand registered company, which held those shares on trust for the same two Ukrainians. 17 Investigations by the Organised and Financial Crime Agency of New Zealand (OFCANZ) in the SP Trading matter have provided further details on the scope of the problem. They confirm that the basic modus operandi employed in the formation of SP Trading has been followed by a number of New Zealand-based company formation agents, who sell a “package” of company documents to an overseas company broker. In many of the cases which have come to OFCANZ’s attention, both the sole director and the sole shareholder are based overseas. OFCANZ considers that many of the clients of the formation agent responsible for the formation of SP Trading are involved in illegal activity. From January 2006 to February 2010 New Zealand Police and the New Zealand Customs Services received between them 134 enquiries relating to 143 New Zealand-registered companies. These companies were implicated in criminal activity overseas, including smuggling, money laundering and tax fraud. 18 IRD consider that if these companies are involved in criminal activity overseas, they are also likely to be involved in tax fraud or evasion. A New Zealand-registered company with its effective base in Panama recently committed a significant tax fraud in the United Kingdom. This sort of fraud affecting our OECD partners impacts negatively on New Zealand’s international reputation. IRD is concerned that New Zealand will receive a poor report in an OECD forum later this year because it is unable to provide information which many other countries would be able to supply about such companies. 19 The Reserve Bank has similar concerns with respect to “overseas financial institutions”, of which approximately 1000 have been incorporated in New Zealand over the past three years. These shell companies are used to carry on banking activities without the necessary regulatory controls, and many appear to be engaged in fraudulent activities. 20 New Zealand’s highly-regarded company registration requirements are more straightforward than those of other similar jurisdictions, such as Singapore, Australia, and Canada. In particular, New Zealand makes extensive use of the internet for the process of company registration. It is unique in that it is a low-cost jurisdiction both in terms of entry costs and due to the fact that it does not impose an MED1102430 6 annual licensing fee. As a result, it is an attractive jurisdiction in which to incorporate a company. 21 There is a risk that people who wish to conduct unlawful activities overseas may increasingly seek to incorporate companies in New Zealand, in order to benefit from New Zealand’s positive reputation. This may provide a veneer of legitimacy with which to facilitate their unlawful conduct. The SP Trading case has became a very visible focus of such concerns. 22 While I believe that the prevalence of such cases is still relatively low in comparison to the total number of companies registered, and similar issues exist in other jurisdictions of equal standing, a number of agencies consider that New Zealand’s international standing has already been affected and believe that further high-profile incidents could see it seriously damaged. C OMMENT 23 It is impossible to impose a set of requirements in the company registration process that will entirely prevent the establishment of companies which undertake criminal or suspect activity overseas. However, there are features of New Zealand’s registration processes which could be improved to bring our companies law more into line with other comparable jurisdictions. Where New Zealand-registered companies are used for overseas criminal activities these changes will provide some deterrence to those using these companies (and their formation agents), and provide greater disincentives to use New Zealand as a country for this type of behaviour. 24 I therefore propose that Cabinet consider a limited number of measures relating to the company registration process. These measures are aimed at enhancing New Zealand’s standing as a well- regulated jurisdiction in which to carry on business. The objective of these proposals is to better ensure that the current high reputation of New Zealand company registration system and New Zealand companies is maintained, while maintaining a system of low compliance costs for bona fide businesses. I believe they should be considered in light of the recent events and the threat they pose to New Zealand’s international reputation. 25 I emphasise that these measures are limited in nature and relate to the company registration process only. Further work will need to be undertaken in order to resolve other issues around the abuse of the New Zealand corporate structure by offshore criminal interests. To that end, officials will consider a range of other mechanisms, including some in relation to AML and New Zealand’s response to FATF, that could further deter the use of New Zealand registered companies for activities like those of SP Trading Limited. This might include matters such as: a Regulation or prohibition of nominee directors; MED1102430 7 b Recording the beneficial ownership of companies; c Measures concerning open-ended powers of attorney; d Identification or verification of the identity of directors and shareholders, for example by way of a unique identifier such as a passport number; e Dealing with the issues of shell financial institutions; and f Regulation of company formation agents by including them as reporting entities under the Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism Act 2009. 26 Such measures require greater consideration and consultation than the measures proposed in this paper. They are therefore progressing on a slower timeframe. Justice have the lead on matters relating to New Zealand’s obligations to FATF and wider justice sector-related issues, including international criminal activity. Officials have prepared a discussion paper on the regulation of company formation agents. In addition, the recent MED discussion paper on the Review of Securities Law seeks views on the public enforcement of directors’ duties. It highlights the position in Australia, where directors of a company can be prosecuted if they are reckless and fail to exercise their powers for a proper purpose. Ease of doing business 27 New Zealand possesses an enviable reputation for ease of doing business, ranked number one in the World Bank Doing Business indicators (for starting a business) in both 2008 and 2009 and and number two in the overall “Ease of Doing Business” ranking behind Singapore. It is necessary to ensure that any proposed measures do not unduly impede the activities of New Zealand companies with foreign ownership legitimately carrying on business. The measures set out below aim to strike an appropriate balance between deterring the sorts of activities highlighted above and ensuring ease of business for New Zealand companies. New Zealand Resident Director or New Zealand Agent 28 The first option is to introduce a requirement for all New Zealand- registered companies to have at least one representative person resident in New Zealand. This could be achieved in one of two ways: a Requiring all companies to have at least one director who is resident in New Zealand; or MED1102430 8 b Where a company does not have at least one director resident in New Zealand, requiring it to appoint a “local agent” who is resident in New Zealand. New Zealand Resident Director 29 New Zealand company law is out of step with that of comparable overseas jurisdictions (including Australia, Singapore and Canada) which require at least one director to be resident in the “home” country. Under this option New Zealand would align its company law to introduce a New Zealand resident director requirement. 30 This would have the benefit of ensuring that there is at least one person legally responsible for the affairs of the company resident in New Zealand. This would be within the existing, well-established framework of directors’ duties. The Registrar would be able to look to the resident director to provide information about the company and be accountable for that information. The current prosecution of the New Zealand-based director in the SP Trading case shows that the New Zealand authorities will take strong action where those directors do not take their obligations seriously. However, that sanction is not available where the directors are based overseas. In this context, it is noteworthy that SP Trading Ltd’s sole shareholder and sole director are now based in Vanuatu. The evidence from OFCANZ is that a number of New Zealand companies where neither the director nor shareholder has any connection with New Zealand are sold to overseas brokers. 31 This requirement would mean that companies that do not already have New Zealand-resident directors will need to appoint a director. They would then have a substantive connection with New Zealand and an identifiable individual available for New Zealand authorities to question if any issue concerning the registration or the overseas activities of the company arose. Those individuals would run the risk of prosecution if, for example, the information they provided to the Registrar was false or misleading. This would provide a disincentive to individuals acting for directors based outside of New Zealand, where the bona fides of those external directors was in doubt. 32 Such a requirement would not cause issues for New Zealand- based businesses, as most companies with a business presence in New Zealand will comply with this requirement. Some international companies, however, may have all of their directors residing offshore and may be reluctant to appoint a New Zealand resident director. The limited exemption proposal I set out below should resolve this issue for most businesses where they also have a presence in an approved jurisdiction. New Zealand Local Agent 33 A less intrusive alternative to the New Zealand resident director proposal would be to require a New Zealand resident “local agent”. MED1102430 9 Local agents would be required to accept service of legal proceedings and ensure that the company met its disclosure and maintenance of records obligations under the Companies Act. They would not have any say in the operation of the company. 34 Such a local agent would be required to meet certain statutory qualifications (e.g. they must be a natural person and not be an undischarged bankrupt or disqualified from being a director). They would: a Be required to provide evidence of their valid appointment and continuing authority; b Be authorised to accept service or notices on the company’s behalf; c Be required to file or give any information about the company to the relevant regulatory agencies; and d Be liable for any penalties imposed on the company for any breach by the company of the Companies Office filing requirements under the Companies Act (for example, the requirements to file documents, and to be responsible for custody and maintenance of share registers etc.) 35 As the local agent concept is new to New Zealand law, the rights and obligations on a local agent would need to be carefully considered to ensure that they are confined to being administrative in nature and not so onerous as to constitute de facto directors’ duties, which would deter individuals from taking up an essentially representative role. As a result this option may take longer to implement than the requirement for a New Zealand resident director. 36 All public sector agencies consulted on this paper expressed reservations regarding this alternative. They considered that the accountability and liabilities of such a company officer are likely to be negligible, and thus the requirement is unlikely to provide an effective deterrent. Exemptions for Approved Jurisdictions 37 For either the resident director or local agent options described above I propose to have certain exemptions, particularly for Australian- owned New Zealand companies and potentially for jurisdictions where there are reciprocal information sharing arrangements. Under this proposal, companies which have at least one director resident in an approved overseas jurisdiction which has reciprocal enforcement or information sharing arrangements with New Zealand would be exempt from the requirement to appoint a New Zealand resident director or local agent. It would mitigate the compliance costs to companies from approved jurisdictions which do not already have New Zealand-resident MED1102430 10 directors, and enable New Zealand authorities to leverage off the registry integrity measures existing in approved jurisdictions, ensuring that the measure is only as burdensome as necessary to achieve the desired public policy objective. Director Date and Place of Birth Information 38 Currently directors are required to submit to the Registrar information regarding their name and residential address. Directors are not required to submit their date or place of birth. I do not consider a residential address alone is a comprehensive tool for identification. It is not uncommon for more than one person with the same name (e.g. father and son) to reside at the same residential address. Where enforcement or compliance action is required against an individual director, clear and accurate identification is desirable. This proposal thus supports the proposal for New Zealand-resident directors or local agents, by helping to ensure that those individuals provide more information to allow the Registrar to verify their identity if required. 39 Other related registers in New Zealand also require this information. For example, the Limited Partnerships Act 2008 requires all general and limited partners to supply their dates of birth as part of the application for registration. To protect directors’ privacy that information is not publicly accessible. These arrangements have been in force for almost two years without the Registrar having received any concerns or complaints regarding its operation. 40 The United Kingdom requires place and date of birth information from those consenting to act as directors. Singapore and Hong Kong in addition require passport or identity card numbers. Requiring directors to provide their date and place of birth would also bring New Zealand company law into line with the Australian Corporations Act. This will in turn facilitate the harmonisation of the registration process between New Zealand and Australia. Mandatory IRD Numbers 41 Under this proposal all companies would be required to apply for an IRD number as part of their application for registration. Requiring a mandatory IRD number would provide an additional disclosure or verification step to off-shore interests selecting New Zealand as a jurisdiction of convenience, while at the same time providing a service for commercially minded companies which will be either cost neutral or actually reduce their compliance costs. 42 Currently the Companies Office offers the option of obtaining a company IRD number as part of the registration process. This removes the need to provide the same information twice to two separate agencies. About 80% of companies use this service. MED1102430 11 43 The requirement for an IRD number entails submitting personal information relating to individual directors of companies. This information would be subjected to the usual checks carried out by IRD and would, therefore, provide another level of verification for those involved with New Zealand-registered companies based and operating overseas. It will not entail any change to the existing data sharing arrangements between the Companies Office and IRD. 44 Again, this measure does not offer a complete solution to the problem of New Zealand being used as a jurisdiction of convenience. Several New Zealand company formation agents apply for IRD numbers and bank account numbers as a matter of course for their clients, in an attempt to add further substance to the persona of the company as a New Zealand registered entity. Even so, the measure leaves open the opportunity for IRD to introduce enhanced verification procedures in the future. Enhanced Powers for the Registrar 45 The Registrar currently has limited powers of inquiry and intervention to test the integrity of company information. This proposal would give the Registrar enhanced powers to investigate, respond to or remedy issues arising in relation to the bona fides of directors and shareholders, and any integrity or compliance issues relating to companies. In particular, the following powers could be given (or existing powers strengthened) to allow the Registrar to: a Require companies, directors, shareholders and/or local agents to confirm or correct existing information on the Companies Register; b “Flag” on the Companies Office website a company’s registration in certain circumstances; c Remove a company from the Companies Register in certain circumstances; d Remove a director from a company if that person is disqualified under the Companies Act; e Extend the criteria for the imposition of management banning orders to include persistent non-compliance with the filing and reporting obligations of the Companies and Financial Reporting Acts or where they have provided inaccurate information to the Registrar; and f To the extent necessary, extend the Registrar’s investigation powers to matters where a company or its directors have not complied with the disclosure requirements of the Companies Act. MED1102430 12 46 As is the case with other proposals in this paper, these enhanced powers will not, in themselves, defeat the opportunity for off- shore interests to use New Zealand as a corporate jurisdiction of convenience. These proposals will, however, enable improved investigation and enforcement, and timely public notice of irregularities around information held on the Register about a company without imposing additional compliance costs on legitimate business activity. Confirm or correct existing information 47 From time to time the Registrar becomes aware that certain information on the Register is inaccurate. This may be due to simple oversight. For example, a director’s address was correct at the time of registration, but that director has since moved. However, sometimes inaccuracies are deliberate. 48 The Companies Act provides a criminal offence for providing false statements to the Registrar, and certain other criminal offences for failure to provide updated records to the Registrar. The Registrar also has the power to correct the Register in certain circumstances, but (with the exception of clerical error), only on application from a person and only after giving certain public notice. Finally, the Registrar has a limited power to inspect a company and its records. However this is a relatively formal process. 49 Given the importance of the accuracy of the information on the Register, the Registrar could be given wider authority to require a person (whether company, director or shareholder) to either confirm that the information about that person is correct, or to provide updated information. This would be a relatively simple and straightforward mechanism to improve the accuracy of the information on the Register, without the more complicated and formal processes of correction or inspection. 50 Further, the existing offence provisions relating to failure to provide information and providing false statements to the Registrar could be extended to apply to any information required by the Registrar. In addition, the new enforcement powers described below could be made applicable in cases of failure to provide information or providing false information. This would enable the Registrar to act quickly to deter and disrupt the activities of those who provide false information concerning the companies with which they are associated. Flag registration 51 Under this proposal the Registrar would be given the discretionary power to “flag” a company’s record on the Companies Office website to show that it is under investigation in certain circumstances. This would provide a public notice that there may be material concerns about information on the register relating to that company which is the subject of inquiry by the Registrar. It would not MED1102430 13 indicate any actual wrongdoing or affect the legal powers of the company. This would ensure that persons dealing with the company are aware of the data integrity concerns of the registry. Accordingly, bona fide businesses would be alerted to such companies and the “flagged” companies would be subject to heightened scrutiny from the legitimate businesses with which they do business. As such, it provides a heightened level of awareness and scrutiny. The discretion to “flag” a company would be exercisable in the following circumstances: a Where the Registrar has reasonable grounds to believe that the company or its directors or shareholders may have provided inaccurate information for the register, or in response to a request from the Registrar; or b Where the Registrar has reasonable grounds to believe that the company or its directors or shareholders may be in persistent breach of the Companies Act or the related Financial Reporting Act. This would not apply to minor or transitory breaches of the Companies Act; or c Where the Registrar has reasonable grounds to believe that the company may have ceased to carry on business. The Registrar already has the power to remove a company from the Register where it has ceased to carry on business; but as this process takes many weeks, as a precursor to removal I propose that the record be “flagged”. Removal from the Companies Register 52 The Registrar has the power to remove a company from the Register (strike it off) in certain circumstances, for example where the company has ceased to carry on business. 53 Under this proposal, the Registrar would also have the power to remove a company from the register for the grounds specified in paragraph 51, above. The removal provisions under the Companies Act contain a range of procedural safeguards to enable companies to have adequate notice of the intended removal of a company, to enable affected parties to object to an intended removal and to ensure a transparent and fair process. These safeguards would equally be applied to a removal of a company following its failure to resolve the issues raised in the “flagging” process. The proposal would allow the Registrar to take relatively quick and inexpensive administrative processes to end the activities of companies whose bona fides were in serious doubt, or which had persistently breached their legal obligations. 54 The Registrar would retain the existing powers to bring criminal prosecutions for breaches of the Companies Act. MED1102430 14 Removal of director 55 As discussed above, the Companies Act 1993 provides that certain persons are disqualified from acting as company directors. For example, a person who has been convicted in New Zealand of a crime involving dishonesty is prohibited from managing a company. While the Act provides that it is an offence for a person to act as a director in contravention of this prohibition, the Registrar has no ability to simply remove the person from the Register. Furthermore the Act does not disqualify a director with equivalent convictions in another country. 56 The existence of the prohibition from acting as director, coupled with the ability to prosecute where a person acts in contravention of the prohibition, are in my view undermined by the fact that there is no legal ability for the Registrar to take simple administrative steps to prevent a disqualified person continuing to act as a director or being appointed as a director pending any prosecution and by the focus on New Zealand convictions. 57 I propose, therefore, that the Registrar would be empowered to remove from the public record a director of a company where the person is disqualified or prohibited under the Companies Act from being a director. Further work will need to be done on how best to deal with situations where directors have a criminal record or have been banned from serving as a director in another country. 58 This proposal will make it more difficult for suspect companies to find New Zealand-based directors or local agents to act for them. The evidence from OFCANZ, confirmed by searches of the Companies Register, is that limited numbers of people are engaged as the sole directors of a large number of suspect companies. If any of those people are banned as directors, the Registrar would be able to remove them as directors from all of the companies with which they are involved. This would then leave the company at risk of being “flagged” and ultimately removed from the Register for persistent breach of its legal obligations. Again, the proposal makes it more difficult for suspect companies to do business in New Zealand, while retaining the ease of business for legitimate companies which comply with their obligations. Management banning orders 59 The Registrar has the power to ban certain persons from being a director or involved in the management of a company for up to five years. 1 This arises invariably from their mismanagement causing company failure. The Court has the power to ban persons in a wider range of circumstances, such as where the person has been convicted of a crime involving dishonesty, or has persistently failed to comply with 1 The recent MED discussion paper on the Review of Securities Law seeks views on extending the maximum period for Registrar-imposed bans to ten years, and allowing the High Court to impose indefinite bans (increased from the current maximum of 10 years). MED1102430 15 the requirements of a number of enactments which govern business such as the Companies Act 1993, the Securities Act 1978 or the Securities Markets Act 1988. 60 In practice, the Registrar has been far more active in issuing management bans than the Courts because the more expeditious and less expensive administrative process has served in most cases. Only the High Court, however, has the power to ban a director for persistently failing to comply with the requirements of the Companies Act. 61 Under this proposal the Registrar’s power to make banning orders would expand to allow him to ban a person who has been a director of a company removed from the register on the grounds in paragraph 51(a) and (b) above, and whose acts or omissions have contributed to such removal. As is the case currently, the director would be banned for up to five years. As with the existing management bans imposed by the Registrar, where the person was the director of two or more companies that have been removed, the onus would shift to the director to show that he/she has not contributed to the circumstances giving rise to the removal of the companies. 62 The Companies Act provides a range of procedural safeguards that the Registrar must satisfy prior to banning a person. These include the requirements for notice to be given to the director and the ability for that person to make representations to the Registrar. The Companies Act also contains a right of appeal against decisions of the Registrar. These safeguards would equally apply to any extended power of the Registrar to prohibit directors. 63 The banning of a director would see that person removed as a director from all of the companies they were associated with, in accordance with the proposal at paragraphs 55 to 58, above Banning local agents 64 If the proposals relating to local agents are adopted, to ensure consistency, the management banning orders discussed above would need to be extended to local agents. That is, a person banned from acting as a director would be banned from acting as a local agent too, and a person that is the local agent of a removed company could be banned from acting as either a director or local agent. Limited Partnerships 65 My concerns relating to registration processes under New Zealand company law extend to the registration of limited partnerships under the Limited Partnerships Act 2008. My officials have noticed from the inception of the limited partnerships regime that there has been a high uptake by offshore partnerships which have no presence in New Zealand and carry out all of their business offshore. As with the MED1102430 16 offshore companies, there is concern as to the activities of many of the limited partnerships. Officials are aware that some company formation agents (who register offshore shell companies) are also in the business of forming limited partnerships for foreign clients. 66 I therefore propose that, to the extent that Cabinet agrees to the proposals for reform suggested above, they should apply also to limited partnerships. Officials would need to carry out some further work to identify the necessary adjustments to take into account differences between the entities such as the fact that limited partnerships do not have directors, but instead have a combination of general and limited partners, and report to me with proposals to align the requirements for limited partnerships. International Obligations 67 There is some risk that the proposal to require a New Zealand- resident director and to exempt “approved jurisdictions” from that requirement will be challenged as being inconsistent with New Zealand’s obligations under international trade agreements. This is because countries such as Singapore, Australia and Canada have made “reservations” in their trade agreements which expressly permit them to impose such requirements, while New Zealand has not. Trade partners may, therefore, query the measure either bilaterally, at the WTO, or in the context of trade negotiations. Investor nationals of some trade partners could ultimately seek recourse to investor-state dispute settlement. 68 Despite this, officials assess that there is only a small risk of international challenge over a New Zealand-resident director requirement (and an exemption for approved jurisdictions). Should a challenge eventuate, officials believe there are reasonable arguments to defend the proposal on the basis that: a that the measure does not modify the conditions of competition in favour of New Zealand persons or persons from approved jurisdictions; and b there are differences between companies with a New Zealand resident director or local agent and companies with a director resident in approved jurisdictions, on the one hand, and companies without a director resident in New Zealand or in an approved jurisdiction, on the other, which justify the imposition of these requirements in pursuit of legitimate public policy objectives (i.e. ensuring proper investigation into the registration of companies). International Funds Service Development Group 69 The International Funds Services Development Group (IFSDG) was established to investigate the opportunities available to New MED1102430 17 Zealand to become an Asia-Pacific funds domicile and funds administration centre where collective investment schemes can be incorporated and serviced. In their pending final report to Ministers, the IFSDG raises the issue that the registration and maintenance of a New Zealand company does not require a single resident director. In their view, this is incompatible with establishing New Zealand as a trusted location for international financial services, largely because of enforcement concerns. The requirement of at least one resident director would aid accountability and better protect New Zealand’s business reputation. Therefore, the proposals within this Cabinet paper are consistent with the recommendations of the IFSDG and would facilitate New Zealand’s endeavours in this area. C ONSULTATION 70 The Treasury, Ministry of Justice, New Zealand Police, Reserve Bank, OFCANZ, Department of Internal Affairs, IRD, Privacy Commissioner, Securities Commission and Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade have been consulted on the contents of this paper. The Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet has been informed. Their comments have been taken into account in the preparation of this paper. 71 Targeted consultation has been carried out with the Commercial and Business Law committee of the New Zealand Law Society, the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, the Institute of Directors and Business New Zealand. These parties were broadly supportive of the proposals regarding birth information, IRD numbers and enhanced powers for the Registrar. Business NZ and the Institute of Chartered Accountants were opposed to the resident director proposal, although they were supportive of the local agent proposal. Their comments were taken into account in the preparation of this paper. FISCAL IMPLICATIONS 72 The enhanced powers of the Registrar may give rise to enforcement action. Any costs to the Companies Office arising out of these proposals would be absorbed within the current baseline funding for its current enforcement functions. 73 IRD has noted that a significant increase in company registration is within its present capability to manage, although it could affect its processing workflows. They consider that there is possibility that the proposal for mandatory IRD numbers could involve additional expense, although no costing work has been done. H UMAN RIGHTS 74 The proposals in this paper are consistent with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990, and the Human Rights Act 1993. MED1102430 18 LEGISLATIVE IMPLICATIONS 75 Amendments to the Companies Act 1993 and the Limited Partnerships Act 2008 would be required If these proposals are approved. There is no current legislative priority for these changes in the 2010 Legislation Programme. Accordingly, I seek a category 5 priority (instructions to the Parliamentary Counsel Office to be provided in the year) should Cabinet agree to make any of the changes discussed in this paper. R EGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 76 Regulatory Impact Analysis Requirements The Regulatory Impact Analysis requirements apply to the proposals contained in this paper, and therefore a Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) is attached to this paper. The RIS has been reviewed by the regulatory impact analysis review panel of the Ministry of Economic Development. 77 Quality of the Impact Analysis The Deputy Secretary, Economic Strategy Branch, Ministry of Economic Development, and members of the Regulatory Impact Analysis Review Panel have reviewed the RIS prepared by the Ministry of Economic Development and associated supporting material, and consider that the information and analysis summarised in the RIS is sufficiently comprehensive and robust, and effectively communicated to enable Ministers to fairly compare the available policy options and take informed decisions on the proposals in this paper. 78 Consistency with Government Statement on Regulation I have considered the analysis and advice of my officials, as summarised in the attached RIS and I am satisfied that, aside from the risks, uncertainties and caveats already noted in this Cabinet paper, the regulatory proposals recommended in this paper: • Are required in the public interest • Will deliver the highest net benefits of the practical options available, and • Are consistent with our commitments in the Government Statement on Regulation P UBLICITY 79 The Ministry of Economic Development will post a copy of this paper and the accompanying RIS on its website and that of the Companies Office. MED1102430 19 RECOMMENDATIONS 80 It is recommended that the Committee 1 NOTE that there is a risk that New Zealand could become a jurisdiction of choice for criminal interests that wish to incorporate a company in a reputable jurisdiction, with the potential for harm to New Zealand’s international reputation as a result; 2 NOTE that work on broader issues relating to corporate law and AML requirements will continue; 3 NOTE that other comparable jurisdictions require at least one director to be ordinarily resident in the jurisdiction in which the company is registered; 4 NOTE that the International Funds Services Development Group is likely raise the issue that the registration and maintenance of a New Zealand company does not require a single resident director as an obstacle to establishing New Zealand as a trusted location for international financial services; 5 AGREE that : 5.1 The Companies Act 1993 be amended so that all New Zealand-registered companies must have at least one director resident in New Zealand; OR 5.2 While recognising that it may have limited deterrent effect, the Companies Act 1993 be amended to require all New Zealand-registered companies have at least one director or a local agent resident in New Zealand; OR 5.3 There should be no new requirement for either a New Zealand resident director or local agent; 6 AGREE that, should Recommendation 5.1 or 5.2 be accepted, companies which have a director resident in a jurisdiction which has entered into information sharing arrangements with the Registrar of Companies (e.g. Australia) by exempted from the requirements of the Recommendation; MED1102430 20 7 AGREE that: 7.1 The Companies Act 1993 be amended to require directors to provide date of birth and place of birth information to the Registrar when they are appointed; OR 7.2 There should be no new requirement for directors to provide date and place of birth information to the Registrar when they are appointed; 8 AGREE that: 8.1 The Companies Act 1993 be amended to require all companies to apply for an IRD number as part of the company registration process; OR 8.2 There should be no mandatory requirement for companies to apply for an IRD number as part of the company registration process; 9 AGREE that: 9.1 The Companies Act 1993 be amended to provide the following additional or enhanced powers for the Registrar: 9.1.1 The power to require companies to confirm or correct information on the Register; 9.1.2 The power to “flag” records on the Register as being under investigation, if: 9.1.2.1 The Registrar has reason to believe that the company or its directors or shareholders have provided inaccurate information on the Register, or in response to any request for information or inspection by the Registrar; or 9.1.2.2 The Registrar has reason to believe that the company or its directors or shareholders are in persistent or serious breach of the Companies Act 1993 or the Financial Reporting Act 1993; or MED1102430 21 9.1.2.3 The Registrar has reasonable grounds to believe that the company has ceased to carry on business; 9.1.3 The power to remove the registration of a company for the grounds listed in Recommendation 9.1.2; 9.1.4 Amending the existing power of the Registrar to ban a person from being involved as a director or manager of a company to include the following as grounds for making such a banning order: 9.1.4.1 The person has been involved as a director or manager of a company or companies that have been removed from the Register under Recommendation 9.1.3 where that person has contributed to such removal; or 9.1.4.2 The person has been involved as a local agent of a company to which the power to make a banning order would otherwise apply; OR: 9.2 The status quo should be retained and the Registrar should not be conferred any of the additional powers set out in Recommendation 9 .1; 10 NOTE that the Companies Amendment Bill will implement any changes agreed to in recommendations 5.1, 5.2, 6, 7.1, 8.1 and 9.1, above; 11 NOTE that there is no Bill in the 2010 Legislative Programme to give effect to any legislative changes; 12 AGREE to establish a category 5 priority (instructions to go to Parliamentary Counsel Office within the year) to give effect to the substantive decisions; 13 AGREE in principle that the same decisions made in respect of companies apply also to limited partnerships; 14 AGREE that the Minister of Commerce may take decisions on minor policy issues that arise as the Bill is MED1102430 22 drafted, including the application of these proposals to limited partnerships; 15 INVITE the Minister of Commerce to issue drafting instructions to Parliamentary Counsel Office to give effect to recommendations 5.1 or 5.2, 6, 7.1, 8.1 and 9.1, above; and 16 AGREE to the Ministry of Economic Development publishing this paper and the accompanying Regulatory Impact Statement on its website and that of the Companies Office. Hon Simon Power Minister for Economic Development Date signed: MED1102430 23 30 June 2010 REGULATORY IMPACT STATEMENT C OMPANY REGISTRATION PROCESSES AGENCY DISCLOSURE STATEMENT This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by the Ministry of Economic Development. It provides an analysis of a limited range of statutory measures designed to strengthen company registration processes in order to improve the reputation of New Zealand’s company registration system, and gives the Registrar of Companies enhanced powers to respond to risks which might arise in relation to the integrity of information recorded on the companies register. There is separate work being undertaken by officials in the Anti-Money Laundering context which will make recommendations on other measures (including additional substantive changes to the operation of company formation agents) aimed at reducing the abuse of the New Zealand corporate form by offshore interests. The statutory measures in this paper deal only with a range of changes to the company registration regime under the Companies Act 1993 that can be made quickly. The analysis undertaken includes consideration of the known crime statistics in relation to New Zealand registered companies operating offshore. In addition it takes into account the impact of the proposals on the overall body of New Zealand registered companies by reference to the statistics relating to the number of companies involved. Targeted consultation, particularly with representatives of business interests such as Business NZ and the Business Law Committee of the New Zealand Law Society, also guided the options considered. The main constraint on the achievement of the targeted outcomes is the requirement that compliance costs on legitimate businesses are not increased; that is, measures target, so far as practicable, only those offshore persons seeking to register a New Zealand company with no intention of conducting business here. A further constraint on assessing the true magnitude of the problem is the criminal nature of the activity which has given rise to the proposals. By its very nature this activity is covert and its true extent must be a matter of speculation, although it is probably safe to assume that the number of entities engaged in such activity is greater than the reported incidence brought to the attention of enforcement agencies. The policy options will impose minimal costs on New Zealand based companies and low costs on legitimate overseas businesses from some jurisdictions which seek to operate via a New Zealand registered company. They will not impair private property rights. Whilst a very small proportion of companies (under 3% of companies on the companies register) may face a new barrier to operating in New Zealand by virtue of the requirement to appoint a New Zealand resident director or local agent, the benefits to New MED1102430 24 Zealand’s international reputation would outweigh such costs. The policy proposals will not override fundamental common law principles. Liz Thomson Manager, Legal Services, Business Services Branch STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM Status Quo The registration and administration of companies is governed by the Companies Act 1993 and its subordinate legislation. New Zealand’s company registration regime is low-cost and straightforward by comparison to foreign jurisdictions. The incorporation process is highly electronic, can be entirely completed online, and does not require directors to be present in, or resident of, New Zealand. The registration requirements of the Companies Act impose no additional entry criteria for companies which register in New Zealand but which are controlled by offshore interests, including those who do not carry on business in New Zealand. In addition, the application fee for incorporation is low by international standards, and New Zealand is unique in not imposing an ongoing annual licensing fee. The simplicity of the regime is a contributor to New Zealand’s enviable reputation for ease of doing business. Coupled with its reputation as a well- regulated jurisdiction, this provides a comparative advantage that underpins New Zealand’s ability to attract and retain internationally-mobile business investment. Problem Definition Ironically, the confluence of low entry barriers and high international standing also makes the New Zealand registration regime vulnerable to misuse by illegitimate offshore operations. A r eview of the circumstances surrounding the SP Trading Ltd event 2 has identified a number of areas where New Zealand’s regime is out of step with comparable foreign counterparts. It has further identified an inability for the Registrar of Companies to take administrative and investigative steps to ensure the integrity of the information which appears on the companies register where he is aware that such information is inaccurate. The lack of any requirements under the Companies Act registration criteria to address the issue of wholly offshore interests being able to use the New Zealand company structure makes it very easy for these operations to use the company registration process to create a false sense of association with New Zealand. In turn, this enables such operations to enjoy a lesser degree of scrutiny than might otherwise be applied when conducting their affairs around the globe. Where these affairs are unlawful, the reputation of New Zealand in general - and its company registration regime in particular - may be tarnished 2 This New Zealand-registered company was recently implicated in a weapons smuggling operation in Thailand. It has no business presence in New Zealand and its sole nominee director had signed a comprehensive power of attorney regarding the control of the company to two Ukrainian n ationals. MED1102430 25 by association. This has implications for the integrity of the registration regime and its appeal to legitimate offshore investment. Furt her, the Companies Act 1993 (“the Act”) confers only limited powers on the Registrar of Companies to take action where he is aware that a company or its directors are failing to ensure that the information which appears on the register is accurate, and that the company is complying with its registration requirements. While the Act allows prosecution of individuals (including directors) who make or authorise false or misleading statements relating to the affairs of a company, there is no ability for the Registrar to take steps to ensure that the information relating to the company which appears on the companies register is accurate and complete. The Organised and Financial Crime Agency of New Zealand (“OFCANZ”) has advised that the New Zealand Police have, over the last three years, assisted overseas authorities with around 134 information requests relating to New Zealand registered companies operating from offshore believed to be engaging in criminal activity overseas. Each investigation may involve a web of companies, registered both in New Zealand and offshore. In addition, the Reserve Bank has received frequent complaints and enquiries about “offshore financial institutions” incorporated in New Zealand but with no other connection to the country. It estimates that there are at least 1000 such companies on the register, of which a number are suspected of carrying out fraudulent activities New Zealand and overseas company law formation agents are known to be actively promoting New Zealand to offshore interests (including those of a dubious nature) as a jurisdiction of choice due to its lighter company regulatory environment in comparison with other jurisdictions. The re are currently around 530,000 companies on the companies register, so the number of suspect companies is a small proportion of the overall body of New Zealand registered companies. The repercussions of even a very small number of high profile cases however, has the potential to cause considerable reputational damage and reduction in confidence. If the status quo is maintained the risk of repeat examples like SP Trading Limited under the current regime is high. In cases where the illegal activity being conducted by the company involves breaches of international obligations such as United Nations sanctions, such episodes are undesirable. Conc erns relating to the exploitation of the New Zealand companies registration regime by rogue offshore interests also extends to similar concerns with the limited partnerships regime established under the Limited Partnerships Act 2008. From the inception of this regime there has been a high uptake of the New Zealand limited partnership vehicle by offshore interests which have no business presence in New Zealand and general and limited partners who are located wholly offshore. Many of registered limited partnerships are known to be carrying on business as offshore financial institutions. OBJ ECTIVE The overall objective is to make low cost changes to the registration system that would reduce the risks of a recurrence of undesirable events similar to those that arose in the SP Trading case. MED1102430 26 OPTIONS Option 1 - Requiring Full Identity Verification of Directors This option would involve requiring full verification of the identity of directors of companies at the time that they are appointed. Such verification would involve the checking of a number of corroborating identification documents such as birth certificates and passports. However, this option is not being recommended because: • It is relatively straightforward for offshore individuals who are engaged in illegal activities to falsify identity information, and relatively difficult for agencies in New Zealand to check the bona fides of identity information provided from offshore; • Even if law enforcement agencies are able to prove that identity information has been falsified, investigation and enforcement of individuals located offshore is problematic, costly and time- consuming; • Although the Identity Verification Service will provide assurance as to the identity of New Zealand individuals, there is currently no sufficiently developed technology to accurately verify the identity of the higher risk category of offshore directors; • Full identity verification in and of itself would not deter determined criminal elements from exploiting the good reputation of the New Zealand companies regime. Option 2 - Requiring Disclosure of Beneficial Control of Companies This option would require shareholders and directors of companies to disclose information regarding the beneficial ownership of shares held on trust, as well as the identity of those who control companies in cases where directors are acting pursuant to a power of attorney or other arrangement. Such disclosure could facilitate targeted crime prevention and enforcement. This option was discounted at this time because it will be considered by officials working on the report back to FATF in October 2011. PREFERRED OPTION The preferred option is to introduce a combination of measures to amend the Companies Act 1993. A Enhancing the Powers of the Registrar Under this measure the Registrar of Companies would have enhanced powers to take administrative and investigatory action if he has reasonable grounds to believe that the company or its directors are in breach of their registration requirements. Such powers would be additional to the ability to bring a prosecution for making or authorising the making of false statements which currently exists under the Companies Act 1993. 3 3 Section 377 Companies Act 1993 MED1102430 27 In summary, it is proposed that the Registrar be given the following powers: a Requi re companies, directors, shareholders and/or local agents to confirm or correct existing information on the companies register in situations where the Registrar; b “Flag” publicly a company’s registration in circumstances where the Registrar has reasonable grounds to believe that: •The company or its directors or shareholders have provided inaccurate information for the register, or in response to a request from the Registrar; •The company or its directors or shareholders are in persistent breach of the Companies Act or Financial Reporting Act; •The company has ceased to carry on business. c Remove a company from the Companies Register for the same reasons that he would be able to flag their registration, following a range of procedural safeguards to ensure that the there is a power to object to such removal; d Remove a director from a company if that person is disqualified under the Companies Act; e Extend the criteria for the Registrar to impose management banning orders to include persistent non-compliance with the filing and reporting obligations of the Companies and Financial Reporting Acts or where they have provided inaccurate information to the Registrar; and f Extend the Registrar’s investigation powers to matters where a company or its directors have not complied with the disclosure requirements of the Companies Act. Benefits •Increased confidence for those searching the register regarding the accuracy and integrity of information on the register; •Improved protection to investors, creditors and others who deal with companies by: oPr oviding a clear warning on the register when a company is under investigation for breaching its registration requirements under the Companies Act; oEnabling the removal of a company from the register if it fails to rectify breaches of its registration requirements; oEnabling the Registrar to ensure that companies do not continue to be recorded on the register as fulfilling their basic registration requirements (e.g. that they have at least one director) when in fact they do not; oPermitting the Registrar to remove persons who are disqualified from acting as a director from office due to the company’s failure to remove them as a director; oEnabling the Registrar to ban directors for a period of up to five years if they repeatedly fail to ensure that a company is fulfilling its registration requirements; oMaking it easer for the Registrar to confirm the bona fides of those persons behind any company, and to hold any company to account for breaches of law. Lim itations This measure will not prevent New Zealand registered companies controlled by rogue offshore interests from carrying out illegal activities. It provides only MED1102430 28 the means for ensuring that the consequences of such activities are not exacerbated by misinformation in relation to such companies being permitted to remain on the register. Costs The enhanced enforcement powers of the Registrar would have cost implications (both direct and indirect) for those firms suspected of failing to comply with compliance and disclosure requirements. Such costs would include the compliance cost of correcting information on the register and reputational costs for companies which are the subject to the exercise by the Registrar of the powers outlined. This compliance cost would range from a minimal cost for submitting forms containing, for example, a correct residential address (there is no fee for filing such documents, but if professional advisors are used a fee based on such a professional’s hourly rate would be incurred), up to a significant cost due to loss of business opportunities arising from the action of the Registrar in alerting the public to the fact that the company is not meeting its registration requirements. The costs of the increased functions of the Registrar would be absorbed from within existing baseline funding. B New Zealand Resident Director/Agent Under this measure all companies which register in New Zealand would require at least one director to be ordinarily resident in New Zealand. This requirement is contained in the company laws of other comparable jurisdictions such as Australia, Canada and Singapore. Alternatively, rather than requiring a New Zealand resident director, a local agent could be required, who would act as a New Zealand representative of the company, with limited functions such as being able to accept service on behalf of the company and holding information relating to the company. Unlike a director, the local agent would not be responsible for the governance of the company, and would not be subject to or liable for the directors’ duties imposed under company law. It is proposed that companies whose directors are resident in approved jurisdictions should be exempted from this requirement. Jurisdictions which have entered into information sharing arrangements with the Registrar of Companies (for example, Australia) would be eligible to be exempted from this requirement. Benefits • Introducing the resident director requirement would bring New Zealand company law into line with Australia, Canada and Singapore; • The duties and liabilities imposed by company law on a New Zealand director would act as a deterrent to offshore interests who do not intend to carry out lawful business. Anecdotal evidence from staff of the Australian Securities and Investment Commission indicates that they do not experience a high incidence of the misuse of the Australian company structure by offshore interests. They attribute this to the deterrent effect of the requirement under the Australian Corporations Act for at least one company director to be ordinarily resident in Australia; • The presence of a company representative in New Zealand would provide an entry point for enforcement agents to gain information regarding the activities of the company. Under the status quo it is MED1102430 29 difficult and costly to effectively investigate a company if all individuals are located offshore; • The company representative would provide a point of accountability for the activities of the New Zealand company. Under the status quo there is often no identifiable and/or available individual who is liable for the actions of the company. The accountability of the resident director measure would be greater than that of the local agent, given the director’s greater responsibility for the actions of the company; • It would overcome issues relating to service on directors located offshore, which is problematic for practical and logistical reasons. Limitations • The presence of a New Zealand resident director or local agent will not necessarily prevent a company from engaging in illegal activities; • As the New Zealand resident director would in some cases be appointed merely to fulfil the registration requirements for incorporating in New Zealand, a nominee director with no real role in the business may be appointed. This was the case with SP Trading Limited, which had a nominee New Zealand resident director who executed a power of attorney handing all control of the company over to Ukrainian individuals; • Even if a New Zealand resident director was not a nominee, there may not be a sufficient pool of well qualified and experienced directors available to take up directorships; • In the case of the local agent alternative, the level of accountability of the local would be minimal given the restricted role of the agent in comparison with a company director. Costs This requirement would not impose a regulatory cost on New Zealand-based businesses since they will have New Zealand resident directors as a matter of course. As both New Zealand resident directors and local agents would in many cases charge fees for their services, costs would be imposed on some international businesses. It is estimated that less than 3% of the total number of companies on the register would fall into this category. This number would reduce significantly if the exemption proposal is approved (i.e. companies whose directors reside in approved jurisdictions are not required to appoint a New Zealand-resident director or local agents). The quantum of such a fee would vary according to the type and size of any business undertaken by a company. At the lower end of the scale the fee would be around a few hundred dollars. At the upper end, the fee would be much higher – for example in the case of company with operations the size of some of our largest listed companies, fees in the hundreds of thousands are occasionally paid. Based on Companies Office statistics, nearly 95% of companies on the register can be characterised as small or medium sized businesses. The higher fee levels would therefore apply to around 5% of affected companies. Based on the weighted average of the size of most companies involved, an estimate of the compliance cost is a range of between $500 up to $5000 per company, with a small number of larger multinational companies liable for the higher fee which directors of such entities could expect to charge. It should be emphasised that this is an estimate, however. MED1102430 30 Given the vast range of businesses undertaken by companies it is difficult to calculate a standard fee for such services. In the case of a local agent it is expected that the fee would be significantly lower. A local agent would not have a role in the governance of the company, and would not be subject to the directors’ duties imposed under company law. The functions of a local agent would be confined to accepting service of documents and holding information relating to the company. An estimate of the fee for an agent is in the range of $500 to $2000 per annum. The costs are a justifiable regulatory burden because: • Other comparative jurisdictions to New Zealand impose such requirements, therefore New Zealand would not be at a competitive disadvantage; • A number of existing businesses will have access to agents already in the form of New Zealand employees or professional advisors. All companies are required to have an address for service and registered office, and it would be a small additional step to nominate a party at that address as a local agent or director; • The limited exemption proposal will remove these costs from businesses whose directors reside in approved low-risk jurisdictions. There is also an element of compliance imposition on the way in which some international businesses carry out their business. A number of international companies, particularly those based in Australia, prefer to incorporate a New Zealand subsidiary and control its operation from a parent company with all members of its board of directors located in its home jurisdiction. Such entities may be reluctant to appoint a New Zealand resident director for issues of convenience, such as the logistical requirements of holding board meetings where one director is resident in New Zealand. C Director Birth Information This measure would require all directors to provide their date and place of birth to the Registrar of Companies. In the same way that the Limited Partnerships Act is drafted, this information would form part of the register, but would not be available for public searching. It would be able to be used by the Registrar and other enforcement agencies in order to carry out their functions under the Companies Act. There will be privacy issues around the collection of this personal information, and consultation with the Privacy Commissioner will be required. Benefits • Better verification of individuals against whom action may be taken (for example, in situations where two people such as a father and son, reside at the same address); • Alignment with Australian company law, which would in turn help in facilitating the harmonisation of New Zealand and Australian company registration processes. Costs There is a very low financial cost for this requirement. The date of birth information would be collected by way of a field on either the form for the MED1102430 31 application for incorporation, or the form of consent to be appointed a director, either at the time that the company is formed or when the director is appointed. Consulted parties reported that international directors expect to provide this information in any event, as it is a common requirement for overseas jurisdictions. D M andatory Tax Numbers This measure would make it mandatory for all companies to apply for a tax number as part of the registration process. Under the status quo this is an option for companies, and around 80% of companies currently do so. Benef its •All directors would be subjected to the standard Inland Revenue Department checking processes, including its “failsafe” systems; •The requirement would send a signal to those seeking to incorporate in New Zealand that they should be doing so with the ultimate intention of carrying on business here. Lim itations •not all companies will be taxpayers immediately upon incorporation. For example, shelf companies formed by organisations such as legal firms, accountants or company formation agencies for on-selling to clients may not be used for the conduct of a business for some time after their formation; •the obtaining of an IRD number will not necessarily prevent the conduct of illegal offshore activity via a New Zealand company vehicle. It is not uncommon for company formation agents to include the obtaining of an IRD number as part of the “package” of services which they provide to offshore clients. Costs •There is no fee for applying for a tax number, and no related or downstream costs associated with obtaining a tax number. On the contrary, the removal of duplicate processes for applying for company registration and a tax number would result in a reduction in compliance costs to firms. Benef its of the Preferred Option Notwithstanding the limitations to the measures discussed above, the preferred option will improve the standing of New Zealand’s company and limited partnerships registration regimes. •Reput ation: The proposals would address the perception that New Zealand’s company registration system is particularly vulnerable to incidents; •Comparability with similar jurisdictions: the proposals would bring New Zealand’s company law registration requirements more into line with other similar jurisdictions, thus reducing the scope for it to be particular target jurisdiction for rogue offshore interests; •Deterrence: the imposition of increased registration requirements are aimed at deterring those who view New Zealand as a jurisdiction of convenience. The fact that the registration requirements and the MED1102430 32 Registrar’s powers are being increased would send a signal that such activity is being subjected to increased scrutiny and enforcement; • Compliance with international obligations: the preferred option would go towards reducing the risk that New Zealand companies or limited partnerships may engage in activities which may breach international obligations such as United Nations sanctions measures; • Trans-Tasman harmonisation: the introduction of the resident director proposal and the date and place of birth proposal would bring New Zealand’s company law into line with that of Australia. That in turn would facilitate the harmonisation of registration processes between New Zealand and Australia; • Better enforcement: the resident director or agent requirement coupled with the date and place of birth information would enable enforcement agencies to undertake more effective enforcement. LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS Concerns relating to the exploitation of the New Zealand companies registration regime by rogue offshore interests also extends to similar concerns with the limited partnerships regime established under the Limited Partnerships Act 2006. It is therefore proposed that the same measures be applied to limited partnerships with the necessary modifications to take into account their differing legal structure (e.g. the fact that they have general partners rather than directors). CONSULTATION Departmental consultation The Treasury, Ministry of Justice, New Zealand Police, Inland Revenue Department, Department of Internal Affairs, the Privacy Commissioner and Ministry of Foreign and Trade have been consulted on the contents of the paper. Targeted Consultation Targeted consultation has been carried out with the following groups: the Commercial and Business Law committee of the New Zealand Law Society (“NZLS”), the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants (“NZICA”), the Institute of Directors and Business New Zealand. All agencies other than the Institute of Directors expressed reservations with the resident director proposal, objecting to the regulatory burden that this requirement would impose on offshore businesses seeking to expand into the New Zealand market. Business NZ contended that the ability of New Zealand to attract business and investment would be undermined by the removal of the competitive advantage currently provided by the absence of such a requirement in comparison to other markets. The NZLS expressed qualified support for the proposal if there could be some form of “carve out” for Australia. This could take the form of either excluding Australia from the requirement, or introducing a mutual arrangement whereby neither New Zealand businesses seeking to incorporate in Australia nor Australian businesses seeking to incorporate in New Zealand would be required to meet the resident director requirement. A further concern advanced by NZLS and NZICA is that there may not be a pool of suitable persons available to act as New Zealand resident directors. All parties were supportive of the proposal to require directors’ dates and places of birth. MED1102430 33 The p rivate sector agencies consulted did not specifically object to the proposal to require tax numbers as part of the registration process. The general response was that a genuine company wishing to do business in New Zealand would obtain an IRD number. NZICA did however express a reservation about imposing any additional regulatory burden whatsoever if there was no guarantee that it would solve the problem identified. Al l the parties consulted expressed the view that the Registrar should be given greater powers to collect relevant information relating to the bona fides of companies and to intervene in clear cases of abuse of their compliance and disclosure obligations under the Act. None of them, however, had any specific suggestions as to the precise form or ambit of such powers. IMP LEMENTATION The proposals will require legislative amendments to the Companies Act 1993 and the Limited Partnerships Act 2008. There is currently no legislative priority for such amendments, so the timing of implementation is not able to be indicated at this stage. Enf orcement will be undertaken through the enhanced powers of the Registrar, and by modifying the application process to ensure that all new incorporation applicants are subjected to the new regime. Publ icity would be given to legislative changes by way of a communications programme which would be delivered through the usual Companies Office systems. This would include website content, communication through the Ministry of Economic Development Monthly Business Update publication, media releases, and short articles in professional publications such as the New Zealand Law Society magazine Law Talk. MONIT ORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW Quarterly statistics on the number of requests from offshore enforcement agencies to the New Zealand police for assistance in investigations into New Zealand registered companies will be compared pre- and post- intervention in order to ascertain whether there has been a drop in the number of such companies involved in suspected criminal activity. Mon itoring of the effect of compliance costs will take place via the regular Companies Office surveys of its clients (which will include a specific question regarding the new processes), and via feedback through its website and contact centre. In addition, feedback from the business.govt website (which is a cross-governmental business information website) will be monitored. Mont hly, quarterly, and annual registrations will be compared pre- and post- intervention to ascertain whether the intervention has had a material impact on the overall number of business registrations. These data will be collected by the Companies Office as a matter of course, and are able to be analysed in this manner at minimal marginal cost to the Ministry.
www.ird.govt.nz Ref: 24 OIA1386 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 2 Nove mber 2023 Dear Thank you for your request made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA), received on 7 October 2023. You requested the following: 1.How exactly do you monitor for early intervention to stop this widespread overpayment \[of WfFTC entitlements\] which has been an issue for well over 5 years? 2.What precisely does your department actually do towards early intervention \[to stop overpayments of WfFTC entitlements\]. When a family chooses to get Working for Families Tax Credits (WfFTC) weekly or fortnightly, these payments are based on what the customer estimates their family will earn from 1 April to 31 March. A family’s WfFTC entitlement is calculated based on these finalised income details at the end of each tax year. If a family has overestimated their income and kept Inland Revenue up to date with changes throughout the tax year, they might be entitled to more WfFTC. This will be paid in a lump sum when the income tax assessments have been completed. Alternatively, if a family has underestimated their income, or not informed Inland Revenue of changes throughout the tax year, they might have been paid more WfFTC than they were entitled to get and will need to pay this amount back to Inland Revenue. The amount of WfFTC a family is entitled to receive depends on the types of payments they’re receiving, number of hours worked each week, and number of children in their care throughout an entitlement period. Throughout the tax year, early interventions are used to identify families who may be receiving an under or over payment of WfFTC. Early interventions help families receive the right entitlement and avoid a WfFTC bill at the end of the tax year. It remains the responsibility of the customer to advise Inland Revenue of any changes to their family details or income, even if they are not selected for an early intervention. Early interventions take place every week. F amilies who are receiving weekly or fortnightly payments, and who are not receiving WfFTC through Ministry of Social Development (MSD), may be selected for an early intervention. There are currently 21 different early interventions, covering a range of different scenarios. A family may be selected for one or all intervention types, depending on the family’s circumstances. Inland Revenue continually review these interventions to ensure they are effective at stopping under or overpayments of WfFTC, and that they notify the right customer groups. Some interventions initiate an automatic reassessment of entitlement, and others will first issue a letter to the customer to advise of the changes that may need to occur, providing a timeframe for a response. If Inland Revenue do es not hear from the customer within that timeframe, automatic reassessment of entitlement will take place. A re-selection date is set for each intervention as to when they can be re-selected for the same early intervention again. Ref: 24 OIA1386 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] The early interventions will calculate PAYE income for both the principal caregiver and the partner as follows: • 12 months of continuous income divided by 365 days to get the daily rate. • Daily rate multiplied by the number of days between the date the calculation is being completed and the end of the tax year. • This amount is added to the year-to-date income and is treated as the new projected income estimate (rounded up to the nearest whole dollar). If the customer’s income started during the year, the income is divided by the number of days worked to get a daily rate. The daily rate is multiplied by the remaining days in the year and added to the year-to-date income. If the current employer information filed is nil, early interventions will not project the income for this employer but will use year to date earnings only. Early interventions will use the most recent IR3 return from the past 2 years unless the family has overridden this amount in their income estimate.

You requested the following regarding the COVID-19 Support Payment (CSP): 1.Would you kindly share the process and policy documentation etc for approving these payments which specifically cover the business' use of CVCs (Covid Vaccination Certificates)? I request your process to assess businesses eligibility for following both the CVC and for following the non-CVC rules. CVC rules are in the Covid19 Public Health Response Protection Framework 2021 (2nd December) u nder Sub Part 3: you’ve got CVC rules and non CVC rules. 2.Would you also kindly define your criteria or policy document(s) what you state as "all reasonably practical steps" in the following from your website: "They did not include circumstances where businesses that were able to operate under the Red setting of the COVID Protection Framework, but had chosen to close temporarily without taking all reasonably practical steps to minimise their revenue losses. " Background The CSP was administered under a process pursuant to which applicants: •declared that they met the published CSP eligibility criteria (published on Inland Revenue’s website in accordance with s 7AAB(3)(c) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA)); and •agreed to the terms and conditions (the CSP terms and conditions). As part of the CSP terms and conditions, applicants also undertook to comply with their declarations (including declarations about compliance with the CVC criteria and taking all reasonable steps to minimise revenue decline), and to keep evidence, materials and records of such compliance, which they could provide to Inland Revenue for audit purposes (as required) (cl 4.1(d)(ii) of the CSP terms and conditions). Section 7AAB(4) of the TAA also required applicants to provide such information as required by the Commissioner for review purposes. The CSP terms and conditions are attached as an Appendix to this response for your reference. Questions 1 and 2 Two documents are within scope of your request. The policy documents regarding approval of CSP applications are provided in the table on the following page, which include references to the CVC criteria (items 1 and 2) and taking all reasonable steps to minimise revenue decline (item 1). Therefore, your request is refused in part under section 18(d) of the OIA, as the information requested is publicly available.

Inland Revenue could – in line with the CSP terms and conditions that applicants agreed to - request evidence, materials, and records from the applicant to demonstrate that they had complied with the CVC requirements and taken all reasonably practicable steps (if any) to minimise the decline in revenue. A repayment event could be actioned under the CSP terms and conditions if the applicant could not demonstrate that they met these requirements (i.e., if they could not demonstrate that they had complied with the CVC requirements and taken all reasonably practicable steps (if any) to minimise the decline in revenue). The published CSP criteria can be found on Inland Revenue’s website at ird.govt.nz/covid- 19/business-and-organisations/covid-19-support-payment/eligibility-for -the-csp. This includes examples in relation to approval of CSP applications with CVC rules/non-CVC rules and reasonably practicable steps (if any) to minimise revenue decline. Right of Review If you disagree with my decision on your OIA request, you can ask an Inland Revenue review officer to review my decision. To ask for an internal review, please email the Commissioner of Inland Revenue at: commissionerscorrespondence@ird.govt.nz.

Yours sincerely Sharyn Rea Project Programme Director Customer & Compliance Services \[UNCLASSIFIED\] COVID-19 Support Payments Scheme General Terms and Conditions for Grants as at 18 February 2022 1 Introduction 1.1 These are the general terms and conditions applying to grants made under the COVID-19 Support Payments Scheme (“these General Terms”). Additional definitions used in these General Terms are set out below. 1.2 These General Terms form part of your “CSP terms” for the purposes of section 7AAB of the Act and will be binding on you when your Application is completed by you or on your behalf and we notify you that your Application is accepted. 1.3 You agree and confirm that: (a)by your Application being completed and submitted to us online, in other electronic form or in any other manner specified or permitted by us from time to time, you agree to be bound by your CSP Terms; and (b)any declarations, representations and statements that have been indicated as agreed or confirmed in your Application (whether by ticking a checkbox or otherwise, and whether by you or on your behalf) are to be treated as declarations, representations and statements made by you. 2 Definitions and interpretation 2.1 In these General Terms: “we”, “us”, “our” and related terms means the Crown acting by and through the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. “you” and “your” mean the person listed in the Application. If a person listed in the application is a partnership, an unincorporated joint venture, the trustees of a trust or otherwise does not have separate legal personality, ”you” and “your” (unless the context requires otherwise) also include each partner, joint venturer, trustee or member jointly and severally.

All information obtained by Inland Revenue must be held in the upmost trust. Consideration must be given to the concepts of confidentiality and privacy when dealing with any information. Inland Revenue is subject to the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA), Official Information Act 1982 (OIA) and Privacy Act 2020 (PA). These Acts impose requirements on how we deal with requests for information. The purpose of the OIA is to facilitate open government, and therefore the presumption is Government agencies will be as open as possible. Likewise, the PA gives individuals a right to access personal information about themselves that is held by an agency. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue has an obligation under the TAA to maintain confidentiality in relation to sensitive revenue information and is not required to disclose information that would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system or the maintenance of the law. The general right of access under the OIA and the individual’s right to personal information under the PA are both subject to these provisions. Therefore, it is important to understand the inter-relationship between the TAA and the OIA or PA. This guide is designed to assist people to recognise and respond to requests for official information. This guide is based on a guide produced by the Ombudsman for requests made under the OIA and PA. This guide also explains the process to determine whether requests for information fall within the confidentiality provisions in the TAA. Although case study examples are included in this guide, requests for official information must be assessed on a case-by-case basis under the relevant Acts (the TAA, OIA and/or PA) when deciding to release or withhold information. Decisions to release information must be made by those with the appropriate revenue delegation or approval authority. 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] What is official information? All information held by Inland Revenue is official information. Official information is not limited to documentary material. It includes material held in any format, such as: • Written documents including reports, memoranda, letters, notes, emails, eCase notes and attachments—even text messages and draft documents. • Non-written documentary information such as material stored on or generated by computers, including databases, storage devices e.g. iron–keys, video or audio recordings. • Information that is known to Inland Revenue, but which has not yet been recorded in writing or otherwise (including knowledge of a particular matter held by an officer, employee or member of Inland Revenue in their official capacity). • Documents and manuals that set out the policies, principles, rules or guidelines for decision-making by Inland Revenue. • The reasons for any decisions that have been made about a person. What is not official information? Official information does not include: • Library or museum material for reference or exhibition purposes. • Information held by an agency solely as an agent or for the sole purpose of safe custody on behalf of a person who is not subject to the OIA. • Information held by the Public Trustee or Māori Trustee in their capacity as a trustee. • Evidence or submissions to a Royal Commission or a commission of inquiry. • Certain information relating to inquiries established under the Inquiries Act 2013 (evidence or submissions subject to an order forbidding publication, and documents relating to the internal deliberations of an inquiry). • Any correspondence or communication between any agency and the Ombudsman or the Privacy Commissioner, in relation to their investigations. • Victim impact statements. • Evidence, submissions or information given or made to the Judicial Conduct Commissioner, a Judicial Conduct Panel, or the Judicial Complaints Lay Observer. Is the information ‘held’ by Inland Revenue? It doesn’t matter where the information originated, or where it is currently located, as long as it is held by Inland Revenue. For example, the information could have been created by a third party and sent to Inland Revenue. The information could be held in the memory of an employee of Inland Revenue. For the OIA to apply, the information must be held by Inland Revenue. With the exception of providing a response to a request for a statement of reasons, there is no obligation on Inland Revenue to form an opinion or create information to answer a request. 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] If a requester seeks information by asking a question, there is a distinction between: • questions which can be answered by providing information already known to and held by Inland Revenue (official information), and • questions which require Inland Revenue to form an opinion or provide an explanation and so create new information to answer the request (not official information). If a request is made for information that is not held by Inland Revenue, you need to consider: • whether a valid request has in fact been made under section 12 of the OIA • whether to transfer the request to another agency subject to the OIA or the Local Government Official Information and Meeting Act (LGOIMA), or • whether to refuse the request under sections 18(e) or 18(g) of the OIA (because the requested document does not exist, or the information is not held). However, there is nothing to prevent Inland Revenue from creating information in response to a request, if we choose to do so. Even if there is no information held by Inland Revenue that can be requested under the OIA, it may be administratively unreasonable for Inland Revenue to refuse to provide a response to the questions asked. If the person has any concerns about the response that they receive, then they can complain to the Ombudsman under the Ombudsmen Act 1975. Information held by employees Information which an officer, employee or member of Inland Revenue holds in their official capacity is deemed to be held by Inland Revenue. Information held by Ministers of the Crown The OIA applies to information held by a Minister of the Crown in their official capacity only. Official information does not include information which is held by a Minister: • in their private capacity • in their capacity as an MP (electorate information), or • in their capacity as a member of a political party (caucus information). However, such information may become official information if it is subsequently used for official Ministerial purposes. Information held by independent contractors Inland Revenue may contract private individuals, companies or other organisations to carry out particular work on their behalf. Information which an independent contractor to Inland Revenue holds in that capacity is deemed to be held by Inland Revenue. For examples of the types of information held by Inland Revenue, refer to Information Law at Inland Revenue 7 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Tax confidentiality When an OIA or Privacy Act request is made to Inland Revenue the first consideration is whether or not the information requested is sensitive revenue information and therefore confidential under the TAA. The requirements of the TAA will take precedence over the OIA and the PA. Section 18(1) of the TAA requires all officers of Inland Revenue to keep confidential sensitive revenue information, unless the disclosure is permitted under sections 18D to 18J of the TAA. Also, they may not disclose revenue information, where disclosure of that information would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system or the maintenance of the law. Is the information revenue information? First determine whether the information is revenue information. Revenue information is defined in section 16C (2) of the TAA as any information acquired, obtained, accessed, received by, disclosed to, or held by the Commissioner— • under or for the purposes of a revenue law; or • under an information sharing agreement. Revenue law is defined in section 16C(1), and includes: • the Inland Revenue Acts; • the Accident Compensation Act 2001, the Accident Insurance Act 1998, the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act 1992, or the Accident Compensation Act 1982; • the New Zealand Superannuation Act 1974; and • any Act that imposes taxes or duties payable to the Crown. An information-sharing agreement includes an approved information sharing agreement made under s 18E(2) of the TAA; an agreement made through consent under s 18E(3); agreements made by regulations under section 18F for public services purposes; and memoranda of understanding that IR has with other agencies to share information. If the information is not held under or for the purpose of a revenue law, or under an information sharing agreement, consider the information under the PA or under the OIA. If the information is revenue information, next determine if it is sensitive revenue information. Is the information sensitive revenue information? Sensitive revenue information is defined in section 16C (3) of the TAA as revenue information that relates to the affairs of a person or entity and: • identifies, or is reasonably capable of being used to identify, the person or entity, whether directly or indirectly; or • might reasonably be regarded as private, commercially sensitive, or otherwise confidential; or 8 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] • the release of which could result in loss, harm, or prejudice to a person to whom or entity to which it relates. “reasonably capable” of identifying a person or entity The information does not necessarily of itself need to disclose a person/entity’s identity but could enable someone to identify a person/entity. Whether information is reasonably capable of identifying a person/entity depends on the facts. For example, where the information disclosed could be combined with information that is publicly available to identify the person/entity then it may be reasonable capable of identifying a person or entity. private, commercially sensitive, or otherwise confidential Information “might reasonably be regarded” as private if it is reasonably foreseeable that information belonging to particular persons is of a type that the persons concerned would prefer is kept private. It is common practice to have confidentiality clauses in commercial contracts, particularly in a competitive industry. It is also reasonable to conclude that a company would want Inland Revenue investigating them kept private as it could damage their reputation. commercially sensitive What is commercially sensitive is usually measured in terms of the possible business harm or negative commercial effect through the disclosure of that information. The release of information of a commercial nature relating to a taxpayer should be approached with caution even if the information is anonymised. For example, in the course of a tax investigation we may come across information about a product that is being developed and kept secret pending an application for a patent. otherwise confidential This is a catch all provision - although it is difficult to see what information would be confidential on this basis that is not already private or commercially sensitive. However, it would cover any information reasonably regarded by the taxpayer/s to whom it relates as confidential. To determine this, as well as considering the nature of the information, it is necessary to consider the basis on which it was provided. So, for example, if the person provided the information on the condition that it was kept confidential, then the information may meet this requirement. The release could result in loss, harm, or prejudice to a person to whom, or entity to which, it relates As well as “commercially sensitive” information, this would also include all forms of potential damage or detriment to any person or entity to whom the information relates. It would include physical or non-physical harm, monetary and non-monetary loss, reputational harm, and any disadvantage resulting from being prejudiced. Exclusion from sensitive revenue information Aggregate data (suggests a grouping of things that are not necessarily numbers focused) and statistical data are explicitly excluded from being sensitive revenue information. If the information is sensitive revenue information, consider whether there is a permitted disclosure applicable under s18D – s18J of the TAA. If there is no applicable permitted disclosure refuse the request under s18(c)(i) of the OIA on the basis that disclosure of the information is contrary to the TAA. Aggregate or statistical data that may contain information about a person or entity is not sensitive revenue information. gg 10 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] If the information is not sensitive revenue information, consider whether disclosure of that information would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system or the maintenance of the law. If it would not, the information should be considered under the PA or OIA as applicable. Integrity of the tax system and maintenance of the Law A request for revenue information should be refused if the disclosure of the information would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system or the maintenance of the law. Before releasing revenue information, that is not sensitive revenue information, consider whether communicating the information “would adversely affect” taxpayer perceptions that tax liabilities are determined fairly and impartially, that all taxpayers must comply with the law, and that Inland Revenue keeps individuals' and entities’ tax affairs confidential. Consider the following questions when determining whether disclosure of the information would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system: • What are the likely short and long-term effects on taxpayer compliance of releasing the information, and of not releasing the information? • Could releasing the information assist Inland Revenue or taxpayers to make better decisions about how the current law applies, or assist in developing a better tax system? • Could not releasing the information cause taxpayers to view Inland Revenue as unnecessarily secretive and unwilling to promote greater taxpayer participation in the tax system? The following types of information are examples of information that if disclosed may adversely affect the integrity of the tax system: • investigative techniques • industry benchmarks • audit strategy • tolerance levels and thresholds • new policy development If releasing the information is likely to have negative effects on compliance that outweigh any benefits to tax integrity from releasing it, then a request for the information should be refused under s18(c)(i) of the OIA on the basis that disclosure of the information is contrary to the TAA. Example Information about generic audit or investigative techniques would be revenue information which is not sensitive revenue information because it is revenue information that applies generally and does not relate to a particular person. However, releasing this information is likely to have a material negative impact on taxpayer compliance because some taxpayers may attempt to use it to avoid their tax obligations. This negative impact is likely to outweigh any benefits to the integrity of the tax system from releasing this information (from, for example, increased transparency). Therefore, the information should not be released. 11 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Another reason for not disclosing revenue information that is not sensitive revenue law is where the maintenance of the law would be prejudiced. This includes tax laws and laws administered or maintained by other agencies. The OIA and PA both have a ground for refusing information on the basis of “maintenance of the law”. The Privacy Act allows agencies to collect, withhold, use or disclose personal information where it is necessary for the ‘maintenance of the law’. Under the OIA and PA maintenance of the law relates to law enforcement action by a public sector agency, including the prevention, detection, investigation, prosecution and punishment of offences. These reasons only require the maintenance of the law to be “prejudiced”. This does not require the maintenance of the law to be negated or nullified. It would be enough if release could have a compromising or detrimental effect. Example would be where the Police have informed Inland Revenue that they are investigating a possible scam in a particular part of New Zealand. They have asked if Inland Revenue has any specialised investigative techniques that Inland Revenue uses in countering organised crime. The media has subsequently asked if Inland Revenue has been approached by the Police regarding any investigation into the suspected scam, and if so, in which location in NZ. This information would not be able to be released under the OIA if disclosure would prejudice the maintenance of the law by compromising the Police investigation. Permitted Disclosures of sensitive revenue information Sensitive revenue information can only be disclosed if doing so is a “permitted disclosure” under sections 18D-J of the TAA. Carrying into effect - s18D(1) Sensitive revenue information can be disclosed for the purpose of carrying into effect a revenue law, or for the purpose of performing or supporting a function lawfully conferred on the Commissioner under a revenue law. Example A customer has income tax arrears. You have issued a deduction notice, instructing the taxpayer’s bank to deduct a sum of money. In this way, you have disclosed to the bank that the customer has tax arrears. This disclosure, however, is necessary for the purposes of carrying into effect the TAA. Carrying out or supporting a function of the Commissioner – s18D(2) Sensitive revenue information can be disclosed under this section by a senior member of Inland Revenue with appropriate delegation, who has considered competing factors to reach a judgement that a disclosure is reasonable in the particular circumstances (guidance on the application of s 18D(2) can be found in Standard Practice Statement 11/07). The first step is to assess if disclosure would be made in carrying out or supporting a function of the Commissioner. The functions of the Commissioner include: • administering the tax system • implementing the tax system, and • improving, researching or reforming the tax system. 12 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] The second part of the test is to determine whether disclosure would be reasonable, after weighing and balancing the following five factors: 1. the Commissioner’s obligation at all times to use best endeavors to protect the integrity of the tax system, and 2. the importance of promoting compliance by taxpayers, especially voluntary compliance, and 3. any personal or commercial impact of the communication or in any other way, and 4. the resources available to the Commissioner, and 5. the public availability of the information. Disclosures to persons and their representatives – s18G Sensitive revenue information can be disclosed to the person (or their agent) in relation to whom the information is held. Clause 15 of schedule 7 of the TAA sets out caveats on provision of personal information. The Commissioner must consider whether – • the information is readily available; and • if it is “reasonable and practical” to provide the information. If the information is not “readily retrievable” – • if the request is by or on behalf of an entity the request may be refused under s.18(c)(i) of the OIA on the basis that the information is sensitive revenue information and there is no permitted disclosure • if the request is by or on behalf of a natural person the request may be refused under s.29(1)(i) of the PA on the basis that the information is sensitive revenue information and there is no permitted disclosure If we consider that the disclosure of the information would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system. Although the information may be personal information, there would not be a permitted disclosure as it would not be “reasonable and practical” for the Commissioner to disclose the information. Other permitted disclosures Other permitted disclosures that will not usually be relevant in the context of an OIA/PA request. Seek any advice as required, from subject matters experts, LTS, Corporate Legal, or Inland Revenue’s Privacy Officer. 13 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Eligibility to request official information OIA and Privacy interface If you have concluded that you are permitted to disclose the information requested under the TAA, then you may consider the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA) and the Privacy Act 1993 (PA). The OIA and PA are two pieces of legislation that govern most information requests. You first need to work out which Act applies: o When an individual asks for information about themselves, the PA applies; this includes requests from a person’s authorised agent. o When the request is from someone else, the OIA applies. The following flow chart can be used to determine whether the request should be considered under the OIA or PA. Who can make an OIA request? Any person is entitled to make a request under the OIA who is: • a New Zealand citizen • a permanent resident of New Zealand 14 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] • a person who is in New Zealand • a body corporate which is incorporated in New Zealand • a body corporate which is incorporated outside New Zealand but which has a place of business in New Zealand, or • a duly appointed agent acting on behalf of any of the above. Who can make an PA request? Any person is entitled to make a request under the PA for information about themselves. Such request can be made by a duly appointed agent. Inland Revenue is entitled to satisfy itself as to the requester’s eligibility to make a request under the OIA or PA. If a request is made by email or over the internet, system verification may be required to confirm eligibility. If you are still uncertain as to whether the request is valid or not, you are entitled to ask reasonable questions to check whether the person is eligible to make a request. If you do wish to query eligibility, please do so promptly so as to not unnecessarily delay the processing of a valid request. What if a requester is not eligible? Even if a person is not eligible to make a request for official information under the OIA (for example a person who is overseas and not a New Zealand citizen or resident), they can still ask an agency for the information they are seeking. Although Inland Revenue isn’t required to respond in accordance with the requirements of the OIA, we should still deal with the request for information in an administratively reasonable manner. If the person has any concerns about the response that they receive, then they can complain to the Ombudsman under the Ombudsmen Act 1975. The form of an official request What does an OIA request look like? There is no set way in which a request must be made. An OIA request is made in any case when an eligible person asks Inland Revenue for access to specified official information. In particular: • a request can be made in any form and communicated by any means, including orally • the requester does not need to mention that it is an OIA or Privacy Act request, and • the request can be made to any person in Inland Revenue. If a request is made orally, we may ask the requestor to put it in writing if that’s “reasonably necessary” to clarify the request. If the requester declines or is unable to do 17 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] • whether the “new” request is intended to amend or clarify the terms of the original one, or to be separate and additional to it. The following scenarios may arise: Requester amends or clarifies the request on their own initiative. The new request replaces the original one, and the 20 working- day time limit for responding starts the day after the new request is received. IR has no further obligation to respond to the original request. NB. It must be clear that the new request is intended to replace the original request by amending or clarifying its terms. This will not apply where the new request is clearly intended to be separate and additional to the original one. IR seeks amendment or clarification within 7 working days and the amendment or clarification is received within 20 working days The new request replaces the original one, and the 20 working- day time limit for responding starts the day after the new request is received. IR has no further obligation to respond to the original request. IR seeks amendment or clarification within 7 working days and amendment or clarification is not received within 20 working days The original request still stands, and to ensure that it complies with its obligations under the OIA, IR must, within the original 20 working days, either extend the time limit for responding (to enable consultation with the requester) or convey its decision on the request. IR will need to consider whether the request can be granted as it stands, or whether extending or charging would enable it to be granted or, as a last resort, whether the request must be refused under one (or more) of the applicable refusal grounds. IR seeks amendment or clarification outside 7 working days and amendment or clarification is received within 20 working days Provided that what is received is in fact an amended or clarified version of the original request, then the maximum 20 working- day time limit for responding to that request still counts from the day after the original request was received. Within that time, IR must either extend the time limit for responding, or convey its decision on the request. However, if a completely different request is received (as opposed to an amended or clarified version of the original request), that will be a new request and the 20 working day time limit for responding will start the day after that request was received. Note. It must be clear that the new request is intended to replace the original request. If there is any doubt about this, it may be wise to check with the requester. 18 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] IR seeks amendment or clarification outside 7 working days and amendment or clarification is not received within 20 working days The original request still stands, and to ensure that it complies with its obligations under the OIA, IR must, within the original 20 working days, either extend the time limit for responding (to enable consultation with the requester), or convey its decision on the request. IR will need to consider whether the request can be granted as it stands, or whether extending or charging would enable it to be granted, or, as a last resort, whether the request must be refused under one (or more) of the applicable refusal grounds. A duty to assist requesters Inland Revenue has a duty to give reasonable assistance to a person who: • wishes to make a request in accordance with section 12 of the OIA or the PA • in making such a request, has not done so in accordance with the requirements of the OIA or PA, or • has not made the request to the appropriate agency. If Inland Revenue cannot reasonably identify what information is being requested, then there is a duty on Inland Revenue to give reasonable assistance to the requester to reformulate the request in order to determine exactly what information is being requested. Reasonable assistance is more than telling the requester that the request is not specific. Having regard to the purposes of the OIA and the principle of availability, all reasonable steps should be taken to provide assistance. The aim of the assistance should be to enable the requester to clarify the request so that it is specific enough for Inland Revenue to identify the information sought. The key is to communicate with the requester. If a request isn’t clear, contact the requester and explain what you need to help them. 19 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] What is reasonable assistance? Reasonable assistance may include things like: • providing an outline of the different kinds of information which might meet the terms of the request • helping the requester understand the general nature and extent of information held by Inland Revenue (at a high level) • providing a general response to the request, setting out options for further information which could be provided on request, and • giving the requester a reasonable opportunity to consult with a contact person. Processing requirements How should I document OIA requests? The knowledge base currently includes processing instructions for various business groups. The following key points need to be included in system updates and/or reports/ sign off check sheets to ensure all relevant information is captured for reporting and reviewing purposes. Record: • the date the request was received • the request identifier (reference number, e.g. 19/OIA0012) • the information requested • any contact/clarification with customer • the outcome of the contact • any transfers or extensions of time needed • a copy of what was released • what was withheld and why • the factors considered in making the decision, e.g. internal advice, emails • the time taken to complete the request • evidence of consultation with other agencies or any internal consultation • reference legislation and DLN numbers of the information sent out • the revenue delegation level, name and position title of who had the authority to approve the release or withholding of the information • Government and Executive Services sign off – if applicable. All requests for information should be lodged with Government and Executive Services by sending a copy of the request to oia@ird.govt.nz. 20 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Key timeframes Inland Revenue’s legal timeframe requirements for responding to requests for official information are to: • make a decision and communicate it to the requester “as soon as reasonably practicable” and no later than 20 working days after the request is received, and • make available any official information it has decided to release without ‘undue delay’. Where necessary in a particular case, additional timeframe requirements are to: • request clarification of a request within seven working days, if the amended request is to be treated as a new request • transfer a request to another agency promptly, and no later than 10 working days, after the request is received, and • extend the maximum time limits to make a decision or transfer a request, within 20 working days after the day on which the request was received. How to count time A tool to automatically calculate response times is available on the Ombudsman’s website at www.ombudsman.parliament.nz. You find information about OIA requests and access the Ombudsman’s time calculator via the Stakeholder Relations intranet page. When counting working days, day one is the first working day after the day on which Inland Revenue receives the request. “Working day” means any day of the week other than Saturday and Sunday and excludes national public holidays: Waitangi Day, Good Friday, Easter Monday, Anzac Day, Queen’s Birthday, Labour Day, and from 25 December to 15 January inclusive. A regional anniversary is a working day. A working day is not limited to 9am to 5pm. Therefore, if a request is received by email or other electronic means outside business hours, it will still be counted as being received on that day, and the count will start on the next working day. 21 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Examples of how to count time Example 1 Inland Revenue receives an information request by email at 9pm on 6 October 2019 (Sunday). The working day after which the request is received = 7 October 2019 (the time and that it is received is irrelevant). Public holidays that don’t count in the 20-working-day timeframe: • Labour Day = 28 October 2016 The 20-working-day maximum time limit is 4 November 2016. Example 2 Inland Revenue receives an information request at 3pm on 21 December 2019 (Saturday). The working day after which the request is received = 23 December 2019 (Monday). The days between 25 December to 15 January of every year are not “working days”. The 20-working-day maximum time limit is 10 February 2017. There is a calculator on the Ombudsman’s web-site which can help you work out the maximum timeframe for when a response is required, at www.ombudsman.parliament.nz. Timeframe for making and communicating a decision Inland Revenue must make a decision and communicate it to the requester “as soon as reasonably practicable” and no later than 20 working days after the day on which the request is received. The decision must state whether the request will be granted, and if so in what manner and for what charge (if any). 22 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Inland Revenue’s primary legal obligation is to notify the requester of the decision on the request “as soon as reasonably practicable”. The reference to 20 working days is not the de facto goal but the absolute maximum (unless it is extended appropriately). Timeframe for making information available If a decision is made to release information, then we must not unduly delay in making it available. In some cases, Inland Revenue may be justified in providing the information to the requester at a later date, after the decision is made and communicated within the timeframe. Note. The distinction between the time requirements for making and communicating a decision on a request, and for making information available, can be important, especially when responding to large requests. Ideally, where a request is granted, the decision and the information will be sent to the requester together. If the information is ready to be released at that stage, not to send it would amount to ‘undue delay’. However, that may not always be possible and sometimes we may need extra time to prepare the information for release. For instance, we may know that we intend to grant a request subject to some redactions but the process of preparing the material for release will take a bit longer. We can advise the requester of our decision on the request as soon as reasonably practicable and within the maximum 20 working-day time limit, and give an indication of when we will be in a position to release the information requested. Our decision must still comply with the OIA, but so long as there is no ‘undue delay’ in making the information available there will be no breach of the timeframe requirements in the OIA. Transferring a request The OIA and PA require requests to be transferred between agencies in certain circumstances. Transfers are not common with requests for entity-specific tax information. Transfers can be made between any agencies subject to the OIA or Local Government Official Information and Meetings Act 1987 (LGOIMA), including Ministers, central government agencies and local government agencies. Refer to the template letters for transferring a request to another agency, and advising the requester of the transfer. The obligation to transfer Inland Revenue must transfer a request to another agency if some or all of the information requested: • is not held by Inland Revenue, but is believed by the person dealing with the request to be held by another agency, or • is believed by the person dealing with the request to be more closely connected with the functions of another agency. The obligation to transfer is not discretionary, but a mandatory requirement in circumstances either of the above two criteria are fulfilled. 24 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] valid extension of that time limit is made within 20 working days of the original request.) The requester must be informed that the request has been transferred. When the other agency receives the transferred request, it is effectively a new request made to that agency under the OIA. The working day count, in terms of the maximum time limit for making and communicating a decision, begins again when they receive the request. Note: The OIA is clear—the need to transfer a request is something that every agency should identify and action as early as possible. An extension to the maximum time limit of 10 working days for transfer may be made, for example where the relevant agencies are consulting about the proposed transfer. However, if a request is transferred outside the maximum (or extended) time limit, this could potentially be the subject of complaint to the Ombudsman under the Ombudsman’s Act (OA) and a potential finding that the agency had acted ‘contrary to law’. Having said that, a delay will not invalidate the transfer. Even if a transfer is made out of time, it will still have the effect of shifting the responsibility for reaching a decision on the request to the most appropriate agency. That is, after all, what the transfer provision is about—ensuring that the agency that holds the information, or that is best placed to know whether there are valid concerns about disclosure, makes the decision on the request. If Inland Revenue identifies the need to transfer all or part of a request outside the 10 working days (or extended time period), we should consider contacting the requester to explain the reason for the delay and the need for the transfer. Requesters will appreciate being kept informed, and may be more understanding if the agency ends up in breach of the timeframe requirements. Consulting about the proposed transfer It may be a good idea to consult the requester and/or the other agency before transferring a request. The requester can clarify why they made the request to Inland Revenue, and what information they hoped to obtain. They may be interested in knowing what Inland Revenue holds in connection with its functions, and not what the “lead agency” on a particular issue holds. Consulting with the other agency will enable you to make appropriate arrangements for the transfer. It is helpful to ask the other agency: • Have they already received the same request? • Are they the right agency to receive the transfer? • Who within the other agency should the transfer be addressed to? Consulting will also minimise the risk of “bounce-backs”, where the other agency disagrees that the information is more closely connected with its functions, and returns the request to Inland Revenue. 26 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] request should identify the relevant information first and, if necessary, transfer that information along with the request. Extensions of time Inland Revenue may extend the maximum time limits for making a decision and communicating it to the requester and also for transferring a request – but only if certain criteria are met. These are: • there must be a valid reason for the extension, either: o the request is for a large quantity of information or necessitates a search through a large quantity of information, and meeting the original time limit would unreasonably interfere with the operations of Inland Revenue; or o consultations necessary to make a decision on the request are such that a proper response to the request cannot reasonably be made within the original time limit. • the extension must be for “a reasonable period of time having regard to the circumstances”; and • the decision to extend the maximum time limit must be communicated to the requester within 20 working days after the day on which the request was first received by Inland Revenue. When making an extension, Inland Revenue must advise the requester: • that it has decided to extend the time limit • the specific period of the extension • the reasons for the extension • the section of the OIA or PA the request is being extended under, and • that the requester has a right to complain to the Ombudsman or the Privacy Commissioner about the extension decision. To keep things simple when giving the period of the extension, it may be helpful to specify a date rather than the number of working days or weeks when the response can be expected. Nothing in the OIA prevents multiple extensions being made, providing any extensions are made within the original 20 working-day time period after receiving the request. For example, if Inland Revenue notifies the requester of a one-week extension, and then later realises that a two-week extension is actually necessary, a second extension may be notified as long as the original 20 working-day time period has not yet passed. To avoid confusion, it may be better to make one extension, for a reasonable but realistic period of time, and indicate that Inland Revenue will respond to the request sooner if possible. Failure to meet the maximum time limits If it looks like it will not be possible to meet either the original or an extended maximum time limit, Inland Revenue should consider contacting the requester to let them know the current state of play and reasons for the delay. Requesters will appreciate being kept informed, and may be more understanding if Inland Revenue ends up in breach of the timeframe requirements. 27 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Another option is a staged reply. If most of the decision on a request is straightforward and ready to go, there is often no need to hold that up in order to deal with a few remaining issues. However, failure to comply with a time limit may be the subject of a complaint to the Ombudsman. Requests for urgency A requester may ask that a request is treated as urgent, and if so must give the reasons for seeking the information urgently. Inland Revenue should consider any request for urgency, and assess whether it would be reasonable to give the request priority. Notwithstanding a request for urgency, Inland Revenue’s legal obligations remain the same – in other words, to: • make and communicate the decision on the request as soon as reasonably practicable and no later than 20 working days after the day on which the request was received, and • release any official information without undue delay. A genuine and legitimate need for urgency may affect when it is ‘reasonably practicable’ to make a decision on the request, and what would constitute ‘undue delay’ in releasing the information. In responding to a request for urgency, Inland Revenue should: • assess the requester’s reasons for seeking urgency (do they merit the request being accorded priority over other work, including other information requests?) • decide whether to accord urgency to the request, and • advise the requester of this decision, and (if applicable) provide an indicative timeframe for response. Inland Revenue can consider discussing an urgent request with the requester. This may enable: • Inland Revenue to clarify the competing priorities that would need to be side-lined in order to accord urgency to the request • requesters to clarify the reasons for urgency, in light of these competing priorities, and • requesters to clarify the intended scope of their request, or to prioritise particular information, allowing decisions on certain information to be made sooner rather than later. The OIA makes it clear that charges may be imposed to cover the costs incurred pursuant to a request to make information available urgently. A requester who is dissatisfied with Inland Revenue’s response to an urgent request may complain to the Ombudsman that Inland Revenue has failed to make and communicate its decision on the request “as soon as reasonably practicable”, or to release the information without “undue delay”. 28 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Urgent requests are often made in order to enable the requester to participate in a consultation or decision-making process on an informed basis. If you can see that this is a valid concern in the context of the particular request at issue, you could consider extending the deadline for participation. This may enable the information to be released and used by the requester, without imposing an unreasonable burden on Inland Revenue to comply with an urgent request. Consultation Inland Revenue may consult before making a decision on an official information request. When consulting externally, staff should bear in mind their confidentiality obligations under the TAA. Consultations may be with: • the requester • relevant business areas within IR, such as Government and Executive Services, LTS, the Internal Communications Team and other Inland Revenue specialists. • external third parties, e.g. those who originally provided the requested information to Inland Revenue, or whom the information is about, and • any other agency with an interest in the information, including Ministers. Any consultations should be necessary for Inland Revenue to make a proper decision on the request. If there are unnecessary consultations and sign-offs taking place, this could give rise to a complaint that Inland Revenue has failed to make and communicate its decision on a request ‘as soon as reasonably practicable’. When consultations are being undertaken, Inland Revenue should consider: • whether the maximum time limit for responding to the request needs to be extended • whether all or part of the request must be transferred to another agency, on the basis that its functions are more closely connected with the requested information • whether a decision can be made in respect of some of the information requested while consultations on the remaining information are under way, and • speaking to the requester to explain the need to consult with others. Although the requester is not obliged to do so, they may be able to clarify why the information is being requested. This often helps to expedite or inform the consultation process. Equally, the requester may be able to narrow or limit the request so that any consultation is no longer necessary. Consulting requesters Consulting requesters can be very useful when considering a request. The reasons for consultation can include: • confirming the exact nature of the information requested • explaining any difficulties Inland Revenue is having in processing the request (for example when there is a large amount of information at issue), and allowing the requester to consider amending or refining the scope of the request, and 29 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] • informing the requester if there are likely to be any delays in processing their request. Often there may be a perception that agencies are unwilling to provide information or are deliberately seeking to delay or to hide information due to a lack of understanding about the process. If there is going to be a delay for any reason, it is important to let a requester know the reasons for this. Inland Revenue can consult with requesters for any reason. However, the OIA specifically requires agencies to consider consulting them before refusing a request on the basis that the information does not exist or cannot be found, despite reasonable efforts to locate it, or the information cannot be made available without substantial collation or research. Consultation with a requester may result in an amended or clarified request. The implications of this for our statutory obligations are discussed above, under “Amended or Clarified Requests”. Consulting third parties - Commercial sensitivity considerations s18 There is no requirement under the OIA for agencies to consult external third parties before making a decision on a request. However, we should consider whether it is necessary to do so if: • the information is about the third party • the information was supplied by the third party, and/or • release could adversely affect the third party. This will often be relevant if we are proposing to release information that may raise privacy, confidentiality or commercial concerns. Notwithstanding the outcome of any consultation, the decision on the request for information remains with Inland Revenue to take. We should consider what the third party has to say, and reach an own independent view on the applicability of any withholding grounds, and the public interest in release. The OIA provides protection for agencies that release information in good faith in response to a request. However, a complaint may potentially be made to the Ombudsman under the Ombudsmen Act that an agency has acted unreasonably in either omitting to consult an external third party, or in how they went about that consultation, or in deciding to release the information notwithstanding consultation. 35 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] The release would breach the confidentiality of advice tendered by, or to Ministers of the Crown and officials. section 9(2)(f)(iv) – to maintain the current constitutional conventions protecting the confidentiality of advice tendered by Ministers and officials. The release would prevent the free and frank expressions of opinions. section 9(2)(g)(i) – to maintain the effective conduct of public affairs through the free and frank expressions of opinion. An administrative reason for refusing a request for information. section 18(d) – the information requested is or will soon be publicly available. We can’t be sure the information exists, or know where it is. section 18(e) – the document alleged to contain the information requested does not exist or cannot be found \[note that you should check section 18B if you intend to withhold information under section 18(e)\]. The release requires substantial collation or research. section 18(f) – the information requested cannot be made available without substantial collation or research \[note that you check section 18A and 18B if you intend to withhold information under section 18(f)\]. Common withholding provisions under the PA Section 18G of the TAA permits Inland Revenue to provide people (or their representative) with sensitive revenue information. Clause 15 of schedule 7 of the TAA sets out to caveats on provision of the personal information. The Commissioner must consider whether – • the information is readily available; and • if it is “reasonable and practical” to provide the information. Inland Revenue is subject to the information privacy principles in the PA. Principle 6 provides that where an agency holds personal information in a form that is readily retrievable, individuals are entitled to have access to information relating to them. If we consider that the disclosure of the information would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system. Although the information may be personal information, there would not be a permitted disclosure as it would not be “reasonable and practical” for the Commissioner to disclose the information. Before releasing information in response to a request under the Privacy Act consider whether any of the reasons for refusal to supply information are contained in sections 27, 28 and 29 of the PA are applicable in the circumstances. Consideration PA reference The release could prejudice the maintenance of the law including the detection, investigation or prosecution of offences. section 27(1)(c) \[note this can be used if there is a current investigation, but generally not if the investigation has been completed\]. It can also be used to withhold the names of informants. The release is likely to put a person in danger. section 27(1)(d) \[note this must be physical safety and you must have evidence to prove the danger\]. 36 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] The release would provide personal information about other individuals. section 29(1)(a) An agency may refuse to disclose any information requested under principle 6 if disclosing the information would involve the unwarranted disclosure of the affairs of another individual or a deceased individual. \[note this may be used to remove staff names in some circumstances but if staff have had direct contact with the requester there would be no reason to delete their name The information requested is evaluative material and disclosing the information, or information identifying the person who supplied it, would breach a promise made to that person that the information, or their identity, would be held in confidence. section 29(1)(b) \[note evaluative material is very specific and only applies to evaluative or opinion material compiled solely to determine someone’s suitability, eligibility or qualifications for employment, appointment, promotion or removal from employment\]; Disclosure of the information would breach legal professional privilege; section 29(1)(f) The information requested is not readily retrievable. section 29(2)(a) The information does not exist or cannot be found section 29(2)(b) The information requested is not held by Inland Revenue and the person dealing with the request has no grounds for believing the information is held by another agency. section 29(2)(c) Communicating the decision A decision on the request must be communicated by giving or posting notice to the requester within the relevant timeframe. 37 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Notice of the decision must include: • whether the request will be granted, and if so • in what manner, and • for what charge (if any) if an OIA request (you cannot charge for responding to a PA request). Decisions should be clearly worded and sensitive to any particular needs the requester may have. If the decision is to refuse the request, reasons must be given for that decision. This means that you must refer to the particular subsection relied on under the OIA or PA (as applicable) to refuse the request. The OIA also requires agencies to provide the grounds for relying on the relevant subsection, if the requester asks for them. Every decision to refuse a request must advise the requester of the right to complain to the Ombudsman or the Privacy Commissioner (as applicable) and to seek an investigation and review of Inland Revenue’s decision. Refer to the template letter(s) for communicating a decision to the requester. The requester also has the option of seeking a review on OIA decisions by an Inland Revenue officer. This option doesn’t preclude the requester seeking a review by the Ombudsman if the requester is not satisfied with the department’s internal review. Releasing information in response to a request The OIA requires that information must be made available without “undue delay”. Generally, when a decision is made to grant a request for information, whether in full or in part, the decision and the information should be provided to the requester at the same time. However, there may be times when this is not possible. For example, when the request is for a large amount of information and although Inland Revenue has reached a decision to grant the request, it will still take further time to prepare the information for release. Provided that there is no undue delay, the information may be provided to the requester at a later stage, after the decision has been made and communicated. In these circumstances, the notice of the decision should clearly indicate that the information will be provided, with an estimated timeframe for the release. If some of the information is to be withheld, the notice should also advise this and state the reasons for refusing that part of the request. A later release of information may also be appropriate when a decision has been made to charge for providing the information. Inland Revenue may require all or part payment of the charge in advance, before the work is undertaken to prepare the information for release. (See the “Charging” section below.) Awaiting the requester’s response to know if they are prepared to be charged for the information will not generally be considered to be an undue delay in making the information available. 38 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Complaints: OIA Complaints about OIA decisions Requesters have the option of raising any concerns about their OIA decision with the Office of the Ombudsman (www.ombudsman.parliament.nz) or by applying for an Inland Revenue internal review (by emailing oia@ird.govt.nz). Inland Revenue’s internal review is an independent review carried out by Government and Executive Services. Complaints: Privacy Complaints about PA decisions Requesters who have concerns about their PA decisions should contact the Privacy Commissioner to seek resolution (www.privacy.org.nz). Charging Public sector agencies cannot charge for responding to a Privacy Act request. Part of making a decision on a request under the OIA includes whether to charge. Any decision to charge must be notified to the requester at the same time as the requester is advised of the decision to release information, of: • the decision to charge • the maximum amount of the charge • how the charge has been calculated • whether all or part payment of the charge is required in advance of release of the information, and • that the requester has the right to complain to the Ombudsman about the decision to charge. Charges can be made for making the information available, including time spent retrieving and collating the information, and preparing it for release. However, charges cannot be made for the time spent or any expenses incurred in deciding whether or not to release the information. It may not be reasonable to charge for locating or retrieving information if there are poor record-keeping practices in place that mean the information is not stored where it should be (in accordance with Inland Revenue’s normal business practice). The Ombudsman has published Charging: A Guide to charging for official information under the OIA and LGOIMA. You can access the publication here, or go to www.ombudsman.parliament.nz and look under “Resources and publications” and “Guides”. 39 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Special categories of official information Certain rules apply to three particular categories of information that may be requested under the OIA. These are: • internal rules or guidelines for decision making • statements of reasons for decisions, and • personal information requests by corporate entities. The OIA provides requesters with a right to access any document which: ... contains policies, principles, rules, or guidelines in accordance with which decisions or recommendations are made in respect of any person or body of persons in \[their\] personal capacity. The ability to refuse such a request is very limited. Requests for statements of reasons Section 23 of the OIA also provides a right to a written statement of reasons for a decision or recommendation made about the requester by the agency. Requests for written statements of reasons are often made by individuals or groups with concerns about a decision or recommendation that affects them personally. The right to a statement of reasons provides a requester with the ability to obtain further information about that decision. Requesters need not specifically refer to section 23 of the OIA in seeking to invoke their right to request a written statement of reasons for a decision that has affected them personally. However, it should be relatively clear from the terms of the request that this is what they are seeking to obtain. If it is unclear whether the requester is seeking a written statement of reasons, it may help to consult them. The right to request for a written statement of reasons must be exercised within a ‘reasonable time’ of the decision or recommendation at issue. A written statement of reasons should be full and comprehensive in explaining the decision making process, and must include the following elements: • the findings on material issues of fact • a reference to the information on which the findings were based, and • the reasons for the decision or recommendation. Inland Revenue may already hold a written statement that contains all the elements listed above. If not, we will need to create such a statement. There is only a limited basis to withhold information from a statement of reasons (see sections 23(1), 23 (2A) and 23 (2B) of the OIA). 40 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Information requests by corporate entities Every corporate entity (company or incorporated society), which is either incorporated in New Zealand or has a place of business in New Zealand, has the right to access any information an agency holds about it, under section 24 of the OIA. The requirements for Inland Revenue to process such requests are more or less the same as for any other request for official information. However, as the corporate entity has a specific right to access any information about itself that can be readily retrieved, the reasons for refusing such requests are more limited. Section 24 of the OIA is subject to section 52 of the OIA, which makes it clear that such reasons may include that the information is subject to tax confidentiality obligations under the TAA and no exception to secrecy applies. Special precautions must also be taken when information is released, to confirm the identity of the requester and ensure that the information will only be received by the requester or their authorised agent. The requester must also be advised of their right to request correction of the information released. Conditional release The OIA implicitly recognises that information may be released subject to conditions on the use, communication or publication of the information. Conditions can include: • an embargo • a requirement that the requester keep the information confidential • a requirement that any discussion of the information should include reference to a contextual statement the agency has also provided, and • a requirement to use the information only for a specific purpose. It is important to note that conditions are not enforceable under the OIA. Releasing information subject to a condition therefore relies on a relationship of trust and confidence between the agency and the requester, or the establishment of a formal contract or deed. You cannot place conditions on the use of information released under the Privacy Act. Publication of information An agency may, whether proactively or in response to a request, choose to publish information as it sees fit. For example, an agency may decide to make information generally available to the public on its website. Proactively releasing information to the public promotes good government, openness and transparency and fosters public trust and confidence in agencies. Proactively releasing information also has administrative benefits for the agency, including by reducing requests for information which is already publicly available, and allowing for greater ease of handling of the requests that are received. Note that responses to requests made via the FYI website www.fyi.org.nz are published online on that site. 41 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Good faith protection Occasionally, an agency may be reluctant to make official information available for fear that release of the information could expose the agency to litigation. However, releasing information in good faith in response to a request made under the OIA will not expose an agency to civil or criminal proceedings. The OIA explicitly states: Where any official information is made available in good faith pursuant to this Act no proceedings, civil or criminal, shall lie against the Crown or any other person in respect of the making available of that information, or for any consequences that follow .... This means that, as long as an agency releases information in the honest belief that the OIA requires disclosure (which may be demonstrated by the agency having made reasonable efforts to identify the interests requiring protection as well as any public interest in release, and to consider those interests in good faith), no civil or criminal proceedings will lie against the agency. This section effectively protects the Crown from any defamation or breach of confidence proceedings, or complaints to the Privacy Commissioner under the Privacy Act, in respect of information which is made available in good faith under the OIA. Some protection is also afforded to the author or supplier of the information. However, such protection does not extend to publication of the information by the requester or subsequent parties, such as a newspaper. The good faith protection under the OIA is also not available when an agency decides to proactively release information, rather than releasing information to a requester in response to an OIA request. Even when an agency does release information in good faith under the OIA, a complaint to the Ombudsman under the OA may still be made by any person affected by the release, if it is considered that the agency has not acted in an administratively reasonable manner. For example, by not taking due care when making deletions to information, or not affording them a reasonable opportunity to comment before release. Further guidance from the Ombudsman Separate guidance is available on making a decision whether or not to grant a request, in relation to particular sections of the OIA and specific subject areas. The Ombudsman’s website contains searchable case notes, opinions and other material relating to past cases considered by the Ombudsman: www.ombudsman.parliament.nz. The Ombudsman’s staff can provide general advice to agencies on the processing of an official information request, including the current interpretation of the OIA and how it has been applied in similar fact situations in the past. You can email info@ombudsman.parliament.nz or freephone 0800 802 602. 42 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Appendix Process for responding to straightforward information requests: eight steps Once you have decided that Inland Revenue holds the information requested, and you have determined which Act(s) applies (TAA, OIA or PA), the following steps must always occur: 1) Identify the information you need to respond to the request, or if it should be transferred to another agency 2) Develop your timeline 3) Find the documents 4) Analyse and consult 5) Update records 6) Decide if you need to extend the time limit 7) Draft the response 8) Get the sign-off, send the response and update records Identify the information you need to respond to the request Scope the response: read the request carefully and identify anything that seems unclear. If there is any ambiguity, consider consulting with the requester to clarify exactly what they are requesting. Think about the context of the request and what the requester may want to know, and why. This may help identify things that the requester may not need or want to receive. Clarifying a request will save time and effort in the long run. Develop your timeline The statutory deadline for a response is 20 working days from when Inland Revenue (not the relevant business unit) receives a request. A tool that automatically calculates the statutory due dates for responses to information requests is available on the Ombudsman’s website at www.ombudsman.parliament.nz. You find information about OIA requests and access the Ombudsman’s time calculator via the Stakeholder Relations intranet page. Once you have the final 20-day deadline, work backwards to calculate your timeline – for example, how long you can take to compile the information, when you will need to finish drafting your response by, and when it will need to be approved by a manager. It’s very helpful to leave a buffer of at least two days, as some steps take longer than expected. Be aware that some steps in the process affect each other, so you may need to keep adjusting your timeline (this is also where the buffer comes in handy). The statutory deadline is 20 working days from when the request is received, but Inland Revenue’s obligation is to respond as soon as reasonably practicable. So if we can respond to a request before the maximum statutory time limit, we should. 43 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Find the documents If the requester is asking for various types of information or complex data, identify and consult with key staff who are likely to know what information exists and where it might be held, including access to other system or databases, to gather the requested information. Keep a record of your searches. In the event that no relevant information can be found, it’s helpful to be able show that all reasonable efforts were made to locate the information (especially in the case of a complaint to the Ombudsman about our response). Analyse and consult Analyse the material gathered to see whether any information can be released. There are times when even personal information about a requester cannot be released to them: • once Inland Revenue has advised that a tax investigation is to commence and disclosure would prejudice the effective conduct of the investigation • when the information requested would disclose the identity of a person who has supplied information to Inland Revenue, thereby breaching an obligation of confidentiality, or • when the information requested would disclose particular targeting or investigation techniques and selection criteria which, if disclosed, would prejudice Inland Revenue’s ability to investigate in the future. In these cases, a request can be refused under 6(c) of the OIA, as the release of this information would likely to prejudice the maintenance of the law. If you have any doubts about anything check it out with the appropriate people. For example: subject-matter experts, LTS, Inland Revenue’s Privacy Officer, or Government and Executive Services. Keep records Any decision to withhold official information can be reviewed by the Ombudsman or by an internal review. It is therefore important to keep clear and accurate records of what has been released or withheld and why. When preparing documents that will have information redacted (withheld), make three copies of each document: a clean copy, a mark-up copy (that shows which parts of the document will be withheld or released and why), and the final, redacted copy (with information blacked out). The redacted copy will be sent to the requester. It is no longer necessary to redact user ID, screen-system ID and screen identifier information from system screenshots. Decide if you need to extend the time limit If extensive retrieval of documents or consultations necessary to make a decision are making the 20-day time limit unachievable, you can extend the time limit to respond to a request. You can extend the time limit at any point before the original 20 days end. However, unless it is obvious at the start, it’s best practice not to extend until you have already, in good faith, tried to answer the request. This way, you will have a good idea of how long to extend the time. 44 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] If you need to extend the time limit, you must advise the requester of the period of the extension (which must be reasonable, for example five or ten working days) and give the reasons for the extension. Under the OIA, the only acceptable reasons for extending the time limit are: • the request is for a large quantity of information or necessitates a search through a large quantity of information, and meeting the original time limit would unreasonably interfere with the operations of Inland Revenue; or • consultations necessary to make a decision on the request are such that a proper response to the request cannot reasonably be made within the original time limit. In all other cases, Inland Revenue must keep to the statutory deadline. Get the sign-off, send the response and update records Remember to check that you know who in your area has the revenue delegation to sign the response. This means they have the approval to authorise the release or withholding of information. It’s a good idea to include in your records the position or title of the person who holds the revenue delegation and has approved the response. This is an added protection for Inland Revenue. In the past, people have signed out responses without having the appropriate delegation to do so. Troubleshooting tips A number of factors can contribute to delays and administrative difficulties in processing an OIA or PA request. Most of these factors are addressed in this guide or on the Ombudsman’s website at www.ombudsman.parliament.nz Consulting the requester If you need to consult the requester, do so as soon as possible. If you consult within the first seven working days of the request, it may be possible to treat any amended or clarified request as a new request (see the “Amended or clarified requests” section). If you need to consult the requester, it may really help you to collate the information if you ask them: • to be as clear and specific as possible about the information they want, and • if there’s any information they don’t want. These points may also be helpful: • If the requester is seeking reasons why a decision or recommendation was made: the request may be for a statement of reasons under section 23 rather than for documentary information. • If a requester has asked for urgent consideration, it’s reasonable to ask why it’s urgent and for their timeframe. (The Ombudsman’s view is that agencies should consider requests for urgency, but do not have to treat the request as such.) • If you need to consult third parties before making a decision on the request, ask the requester if they have concerns with the disclosure of their identity to third 45 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] parties. (If they do have concerns, we can consult without revealing the requester’s identity). • If there’s a lot of information or the requester has asked for it to be provided in a format that’s difficult to do, you can ask if they would be happy to receive the information in an alternative form that would be easier to provide (e.g. an oral briefing, a viewing, or a summary of the information). Taking ownership to co-ordinate and manage a broad or multi-revenue detailed request Inland Revenue often receives requests that are very broad. For example, a customer might request information that covers a wide range of information including multiple tax types (child support and income tax), and that covers a long period of time. If this is the case: • First, ascertain if this request meets the criteria to be managed by Government and Executive Services. If not, then: • Establish who will take overall responsibility and ownership of the request. • If you are responding to the request identify who else needs to be involved in considering the request to supply the information. • Arrange a scoping meeting with these identified people to verify if the requester has previously made similar requests or if there are any investigations or legal cases underway. • To avoid multiple contacts about different aspects of the request by various Inland Revenue people, nominate one person to make contact with the customer. • Explain the problem, including how much information their request covers as currently phrased. • Invite the requester to reconsider or refine their request. If you take steps to consult the requester within the first seven working days, it may be possible to treat any amended or clarified request that is received as a new request (see amended or clarified requests above). Have in mind some potential strategies for refining or redirecting the request that might be able to meet the needs of the requester without imposing an unreasonable administrative burden on Inland Revenue. For instance: o Refining the time period covered by the request. o Refining the types of document covered by the request. o Consider engaging additional staff. o Consider whether charging for the supply of information would be reasonable and appropriate in the circumstances. o Consider whether to extend the maximum time limit for making a decision on the request. o Consider whether it is possible to release the information in an alternative form, for example, summarised. o Consider releasing the information at a later time, after the decision is made, as long as the information is prepared for release without undue delay. o As a last resort, the decision maker who holds the appropriate delegation may need to consider whether it is necessary for Inland Revenue to refuse the request under section 18(f) of the OIA, on the basis that the 46 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] information cannot be made available without substantial collation or research. Managing multiple requests from the same requester • Invite the requester to prioritise the order in which they would prefer the requests to be answered. • Consider extending the time limit on each request as needed. • Consider whether charging for the supply of information would be reasonable and appropriate in the circumstances. • Advise the requester of the decision on each request as soon as reasonably practicable (and no later than 20 working days), and subsequently roll out the information to be released without undue delay. • Consider whether it is possible to release the information in an alternative form, for example, summary, viewing, or oral briefing. • Consider whether, in the circumstances of the case, the multiple requests can be treated as a single request under section 18A(2) of the OIA, for the purposes of deciding whether it is appropriate to refuse the request under section 18(f) on the basis that the information cannot be made available without substantial collation or research. • Consider whether it would be appropriate to refuse the requests under section 18(h) on the grounds that the requests are frivolous or vexatious. What to do when the information requested is difficult to identify or cannot be found • Contact the requester—explain the problem and ask whether the request can be made more specific, or whether they can provide more information to assist in locating the information. • Consider whether Inland Revenue is being asked to create information or express an opinion rather than to provide information that it holds. • If the information is in the form of discussions that were held but not recorded, identify the relevant officials and record their recollections in writing. • Consider extending the time limit to give Inland Revenue more time to locate the information. • Consider whether all or part of the request should be transferred to another agency that does hold the information. • Consider whether it is appropriate to refuse the request under section 18(e) of the OIA on the basis that the relevant document does not exist or cannot be found, despite reasonable efforts to locate it. • Consider whether it is appropriate to refuse the request under section 18(g) of the OIA on the basis that the agency does not hold the information and has no grounds for believing the information is held by, or more closely connected with the functions of, another agency subject to the OIA or LGOIMA. 47 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] What to do when the information is not ready to be released • Consider refusing the request under section 18(d) of the OIA, if the information will soon be publicly available (for example the information is being printed or is in the final stages of being prepared for imminent public release). If so, explain to the requester: o where and how the information will be able to be obtained; o the date of public release; and o the difficulty in meeting the request immediately. • Consider whether there is a substantive concern about releasing the information at the time of the request. If so, identify the particular harm in release at this stage and assess that harm against the reasons in the OIA for withholding information. Revenue delegations Under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has the authority to delegate functions or powers of the Commissioner, to Inland Revenue employees under any of the Inland Revenue Acts. The purpose of these delegations is to enable you to make decisions that are delegated to you under the appropriate Inland Revenue Act and that relate to your day to day work in the position you currently hold taking into account an assessment of your level of skills and experience you have displayed. Delegations fall under three main areas of responsibility: • revenue • financial, or • human resources. Your delegation letter sets out the authority levels you have under those three areas of delegations. Check your delegation letter to identify your Business Group and Position. The Business Group is the group you currently work for, and your current position title for which these delegations apply. Example: Your Business Group is Customer Services, identified on the matrix as Group K Your position title is: Customer Service Specialist, Fundamental/Applied – position identifier in the matrix as CSSFA. Revenue Delegations The Acts for which you have revenue delegations are: (Example:) • Income Tax Acts 1994, 2004 and 2007 • Tax Administration Act 1994 48 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] •Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 •Child Support Act 1991 •Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 •KiwiSaver Act 2006 The specific provisions within the Acts that you are delegated to make tax technical decisions under can be found in the Revenue delegations matrix.

These Acts impose requirements on how we deal with requests for information. Official Information Act The Official Information Act 1982 provides a general public right of access to official information. The purpose of the OIA is to facilitate open government, and therefore the presumption is that government agencies will be as open as possible. Privacy Act The Privacy Act 1993 gives individuals a right to access personal information about themselves that is held by an agency. Personal information about an entity that is not a natural person is considered under the OIA. The Privacy Act 2020 will come into force on 1 December 2020. Tax Administration Act Under the Tax Administration Act 1994, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has an obligation to maintain confidentiality in relation to sensitive revenue information, and is not required to disclose information that would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system or the maintenance of the law. The general right of access under the OIA, and the individual’s right to personal information under the PA, are both subject to the confidentiality provisions of the TAA. Unless otherwise stated, legislation in this guide refers to the OIA. In a hurry? Go straight to the summary. Examples of wording you can use are here. Need help with an OIA?

Examples of wording are in the Examples section at the end of this guide. Statutory deadline – Official Information Act requests (OIAs) have a statutory deadline, which means Inland Revenue must respond by the due date. The statutory deadline is 20 working days from the working day after we receive the request. The Ombudsman has a handy online OIA response calculator at www.ombudsman.parliament.nz. Rights of review – A requestor can complain to the Ombudsman and ask for an investigation into our decision on their OIA request. Requestors can also ask us for an internal review of the OIA decision. Making a decision on the request – The statutory deadline is the date by which you must make a decision on the request, not necessarily to provide the information. If you know you can release the information, but it will take longer to retrieve or collate, reply by or before the deadline with your decision and the date by which you will provide the information. If you need more time to decide, consider if you can extend the timeframe. Clarifying a request – If you ask the requestor to amend or clarify their request within 7 working days of us receiving the request, the amended/clarified request may be treated as a new request. This resets the timeframe to 20 days from the date the requestor responds. If you ask for clarification after 7 days, the original deadline will apply. Transferring a request – You can transfer a request to another agency if they have the information requested, but you must transfer within 10 days. Extending a request – You can extend a request for a reasonable amount of time, e.g. 10 working days, but only for specific reasons. Inform the requestor – Whatever you’re doing with a request: responding, extending or transferring, you must let the requestor know by the original statutory deadline. Releasing all information – If there is no reason to refuse the information, release it. Tax confidentiality and sensitive revenue information – Is the information requested sensitive revenue information and therefore confidential under s.18 of the TAA? If so, you can refuse it, as the TAA takes precedence over the OIA (and PA). Aggregate and statistical data is not sensitive revenue information, so can usually be released. Refusing information – The OIA allows refusals, but only for specific reasons. The most common refusal grounds are in the following table. For more reasons and more details, see Refusing information in the next section. 5 OIA training: Summary (updated on 4 November 2020) For questions or comments, contact Sarah Letellier, GES \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Table of common reasons for needing to refuse the information Reason for needing to refuse the information Refuse under this section of the OIA to protect personal privacy (of staff or customers) 9(2)(a) the information is already publicly available or soon\* will be 18(d) the information is sensitive revenue information and therefore confidential under the TAA\*\* 18(c)(i) of the OIA (contrary to legislation), because it is contrary to s.18(1) of the TAA. the information does not exist or cannot be found 18(e) the information is not held 18(g) release would require substantial collation and research\*\*\* 18(f) the information is confidential 9(2)(ba) the request is frivolous, vexatious or trivial 18(h) refusing is necessary to protect the politically neutrality of officials 9(2)(f)(iii) refusing is necessary to protect the confidentiality of advice tendered by officials to the Minister 9(2)(f)(iv) refusing is necessary to protect the free and frank, and effective conduct of government 9(2)(g)(ii) refusing is necessary to protect legal professional privilege 9(2)(h) refusing is necessary to protect commercial prejudice 9(2)(b) \* “Soon” is about eight weeks after the statutory deadline. \*\* If information is not sensitive revenue information but is revenue information, you may be able to release it. Some sensitive revenue information can be released if certain exceptions are met. \*\*\* Before using the substantial collation and research section, s.18(f), first consider if you could provide the information if: the requestor refined their request; or you extended the time limit; or you imposed a charge for providing the information (there are set amounts). Wait for the requestor to agree to the charge before you go ahead with collating the information. A full list of all the possible refusal grounds is here. 6 OIA training: Summary (updated on 4 November 2020) For questions or comments, contact Sarah Letellier, GES \[UNCLASSIFIED\] What is official information? All information held by Inland Revenue is official information. However, official information is not limited to documents. It includes information in any format, such as: • Written documents including reports, drafts, letters, notes, emails, eCase notes and attachments, text messages and messages sent via apps. • Non-written documentary information such as material stored on or generated by computers, including databases, video or audio recordings e.g. recordings and transcripts created in Teams. • Information that is known to Inland Revenue, but which has not yet been recorded in writing or otherwise (including knowledge of a particular matter held by an officer, employee or member of Inland Revenue in their official capacity). • Documents and manuals that set out the policies, principles, rules or guidelines for decision-making by Inland Revenue. • The reasons for any decisions that have been made about a person. Inland Revenue’s obligations under the OIA Principle of availability Requested information should be made available unless there is good reason to withhold it under the OIA. Deadline for responding to an OIA request We must respond to an OIA request by or before the statutory deadline. Don’t wait until the day of the deadline if you can respond earlier. Under the OIA, agencies have an obligation to respond “as soon as reasonably practicable”. It’s best to use the Office of the Ombudsman’s online OIA response calculator. Type in the date you received an OIA request and it will give you the deadline for responding to the request. This is a statutory deadline, so we must respond by this date. The calculator is on the Ombudsman’s website: www.ombudsman.parliament.nz To work out the deadline, count 20 working days from the day after you received the request. Weekends and national public holidays are not working days. Local holidays, such as anniversary days, are counted as working days. A working day is a weekday and finishes at midnight. So, whether a request is received on 10am or 10pm on a Monday, it’s still received on Monday. Equally, whether we send a response on a Monday before or after 5pm, it’s still sent on Monday. For the OIA to apply, the information must be held by Inland Revenue at the time the request is received. Apart from providing a response to a request for a statement of reasons, there is no obligation on Inland Revenue to form an opinion or create information to answer a request. 7 OIA training: Summary (updated on 4 November 2020) For questions or comments, contact Sarah Letellier, GES \[UNCLASSIFIED\] There is a difference between a requestor asking: • questions that can be answered by providing information already known to and held by Inland Revenue (official information), and • questions that require Inland Revenue to form an opinion or provide an explanation and so create new information to answer the request (not official information). If a request is made for information that is not held by Inland Revenue, consider: • transferring the request to another agency subject to the OIA or the Local Government Official Information and Meeting Act 1987 (LGOIMA), or • refusing the request under sections 18(e) or 18(g) of the OIA (because the requested document does not exist, or the information is not held). Creating information Inland Revenue may choose to create information to respond to a request. We are not required to create information in order to answer a request. See advice about refusing requests under section 18(e) of the OIA, because the information does not exist or cannot be found. However, if the information would be easy to create, consider if it could be seen as unreasonable for Inland Revenue to refuse to do so. Under the Ombudsmen Act 1975, a requestor can complain to the Ombudsman about our response. Provide a decision within 20 days A decision whether to grant a request or charge for a request must be made and communicated to a requestor “as soon as reasonably practical” and no later than 20 working days after the day on which the request was received. Ref section 15(1) of the OIA. The decision on a request can be to: • release • refuse • extend, or • impose a charge. Failure to meet the 20 working-day deadline The request is deemed to be refused if the statutory deadline is not met (a delay is deemed a refusal). The requestor may make a complaint to the Ombudsman. Transfer a request within 10 days Under section 14 of the OIA, if you need to transfer an OIA request to another agency, you must transfer the request within 10 working days. We need to write to the requestor to advise them of the transfer, and also to the agency we’re transferring the request to. Remember to send the agency the request and the requestor’s contact details. 8 OIA training: Summary (updated on 4 November 2020) For questions or comments, contact Sarah Letellier, GES \[UNCLASSIFIED\] First, ensure the information is held by the other agency When transferring a request because another agency is more closely connected to the information, first ensure that the other agency does hold all the information in scope of the request. If there is some information Inland Revenue holds that the other agency does not hold, we should transfer the part of the request we cannot answer and respond to the part of the request we can answer. The other agency will have 20 working days to respond to the OIA from the date they receive our transferred request. Similarly, when another agency transfers an OIA request they have received to Inland Revenue, the 20 working days begin from the date we receive the transferred request. Advice about Ministers and transfers is here. Clarify a request within 7 days and reset the day count If Inland Revenue seeks to amend or clarify the request within 7 working days of us receiving the request, the amended/clarified request may be treated as a new request that replaces the original request. Under s.15(1AA) of the OIA, we can reset the timeframe for responding to a request – but only if we have asked the requestor to clarify their request within 7 working days. The new date will be 20 days from the date the requestor comes back with the amendment/clarification. If the requestor does not respond, we are still obliged to respond to the initial request within 20 working days, although this may result in refusal based on our interpretation of the request. You can ask the requestor to clarify their request after seven days, but the original deadline will apply. Extend the time to respond to the request The 20 working-day requirement is for a decision to be made on a request, not for the actual information. However, the OIA specifies that the information should be released (if the decision is to release) “without undue delay”. Under section 15A of the OIA, you can extend the time to respond to a request if: a) the request is for a lot of information or you need to search through a lot of information (and meeting the original time limit would unreasonably interfere with the operations of the department or the Minister), or b) you need to consult in order to make a decision on the request. “Consulting” can be discussions within Inland Revenue or with another agency. You must let the requestor know in writing that you are extending the deadline within the original 20 working-day deadline. Let the requestor know the new extended statutory deadline for their OIA by giving a date as well as the number of working days, for clarity. You can extend more than once if you must, but you must send out both extensions within the original deadline. 9 OIA training: Summary (updated on 4 November 2020) For questions or comments, contact Sarah Letellier, GES \[UNCLASSIFIED\] You can extend the time for as long as you will need but keep it reasonable: 10 working days if you can (or 20 working days if you really need longer). You must respond to the request by your extended date, or this will be deemed to be a refusal of the request. Send the response as soon as you can—don’t wait until the extended deadline if it’s ready before then. We still have the obligation to respond as soon as reasonably practicable. You must let the requestor know that, under s28(3) of the OIA, they have the right to complain to the Ombudsman about the extension of time. Extending and transferring an OIA It’s not ideal, but if you haven’t realised within 10 days that you need to transfer a request (see Transferring the request), you can still transfer the request to the appropriate agency. If you have to, you can extend and transfer at the same time. Quote both sections of the legislation in your response to the requestor: the extension grounds in s.15A and the transfer grounds in s.14(b)(ii) of the OIA. Provide the information in the format requested A requestor might specify that they need the information in a specific format, such as a spreadsheet. Section 16 of the OIA states that we should try to give information in the format requested if we can. However, we don’t have to give information in the format requested if doing so would impair the department’s efficient administration (e.g. the requestor has asked for information to be sent on a DVD or other technology we no longer use, so it would be difficult for us to provide the information this way). In this case, we should still supply the information, but it’s reasonable to do so in a format that’s more convenient for us. If you can’t supply the actual information, can you release a summary? You could also consider allowing the requestor to view the document, giving them a copy of the document with redactions, or telling them what the document contains. Right to complain to the Ombudsman Under section 28 of the OIA, if we are refusing a request or part of a request, or have decided to charge the requestor for providing the information, we must advise the requestor of their right to make a complaint to the Ombudsman. There’s an example of the wording here. Correspondence with the Ombudsman General correspondence with the Office of the Ombudsman that is not about an investigation is subject to the OIA. However, correspondence with the Office of the Ombudsman that relates to an Ombudsman’s investigation is not subject to the OIA, so you can withhold this without referring to any grounds. Right to Inland Revenue review Requestors also have the right to ask for a review of an OIA decision by someone else at Inland Revenue. It must be by someone else—it wouldn’t be ethical for someone to review their own decision. See example wording here. 10 OIA training: Summary (updated on 4 November 2020) For questions or comments, contact Sarah Letellier, GES \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Ministers and the OIA The OIA applies to information held by a Minister in their official capacity only. Official information does not include information which is held by a Minister: • in their private capacity • in their capacity as an MP (electorate information), or • in their capacity as a member of a political party (caucus information). Such information may become official information if it is subsequently used for official Ministerial purposes. If this type of information is provided to Inland Revenue merely for the purpose of responding to a request for information, it is arguable that we hold the information solely as an agent on behalf of Minister. Someone making an OIA request to a Minister has the right to complain to the Ombudsman about a decision to withhold information. However, the Minister of Revenue is not subject to a review by Inland Revenue, so only add the Ombudsman’s review paragraph. The Minister of Revenue The current Minister of Revenue prefers to prepare his own responses to OIAs, so Inland Revenue usually transfers OIA requests for Ministerial business (such as reports the Minister has received) to his office to answer. If you’re preparing a suggested OIA response for the Minister of Revenue, the same OIA deadline and withholding grounds apply. Ministers and transfers The Ombudsman cannot investigate transfers under the OIA. When investigating a decision to transfer or an out-of-time transfer, this is done under the Ombudsman Act 1975. Ministers are not subject to the Ombudsman Act, so cannot be investigated for an out-of-time transfer. Cabinet papers and the OIA Cabinet papers must be proactively released within 30 days of Cabinet’s decision on the paper. If you need to withhold some information from a Cabinet paper, you can use the OIA – just state what you’re withholding and which grounds you’re using. Releasing information If you can release all the information requested, do so. You don’t need to wait until the statutory deadline to respond to a request if you can respond earlier. OIA or Privacy? Whether the OIA or Privacy Act applies depends on who is asking for what information. When an individual asks for information about themselves, the Privacy Act applies; this includes requests from a person’s authorised agent or nominated person. When the request is from someone else, or from an entity rather than a natural person, the OIA applies. See the following flow chart: 11 OIA training: Summary (updated on 4 November 2020) For questions or comments, contact Sarah Letellier, GES \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Deleting information from documents (redactions) A request is for each bit of information that is within scope. We are obliged to release part of a document if we can. If you can’t release the whole document, release the document with the parts you can’t release redacted (deleted). Provide a reason for refusing each part of the request. Information is out-of-date, inaccurate, incomplete or can be misinterpreted This is not a reason for withholding. Reasonable steps should be taken to ensure that what is provided is accurate and complete. If the information is not accurate or complete, this is not a refusal reason in the OIA. We should provide the information with a contextual statement about the limitations on the accuracy or completeness of that information. However, there may be a basis to withhold incomplete data where release would result in harm, such as commercial prejudice. Making a decision on a request The following flow chart summarises all our options when we receive an OIA request. 12 OIA training: Summary (updated on 4 November 2020) For questions or comments, contact Sarah Letellier, GES \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Principle of availability 13 OIA training: Summary (updated on 4 November 2020) For questions or comments, contact Sarah Letellier, GES \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Remember the principle of availability: information should be made available unless there is good reason to withhold it under the OIA, Tax Administration Act, or Privacy Act. Public interest If you’re refusing information under section 9 of the OIA, you need to consider if your reason for refusing it is outweighed by the public interest in making the information available. See example wording here. What is the public interest? It’s broadly equivalent to the public good. This is always subjective, and has to be considered on a case-by-case basis. It can be in the public interest to have information about elections, high-profile tragedies, public spending, or finding out if government agencies have acted correctly. Something that is interesting is not the same as being in the public interest! If you can’t supply the actual information, consider releasing a summary. If you’re refusing information under sections 6 or 18 of the OIA, you don’t need to consider the public interest. Legal privilege Agencies can sometimes waive their legal privilege if this is outweighed by the public interest. However, Inland Revenue would have to apply to the Crown Law for permission to do so: it is not our legal privilege but the Government’s. All reasons for refusing requests On the next page is a list of all the grounds under which a request for official information may be refused. Commonly used grounds are discussed in the following pages. For a discussion of all the grounds, see the OIA training – full guide. 14 OIA training: Summary (updated on 4 November 2020) For questions or comments, contact Sarah Letellier, GES \[UNCLASSIFIED\] All refusal grounds Administrative grounds for refusal of requests – section 18 The administrative grounds for withholding are: • Contrary to legislation – s.18(c)(i) • Constitutes contempt of Court or Parliament – s.18(c)(ii) • Publicly available or soon will be – s.18(d) • Request could be made under the Criminal Disclosures Act 2008 – s.18(da) • Information does not exist or cannot be found – s.18(e) • Substantial collation and research – s.18(f) • Information not held – s.18(g) • Request is frivolous or vexatious or the information requested is trivial – s.18(h). Conclusive reasons for refusal of requests – section 6 The conclusive grounds for withholding are: • Security or defence or the international relations of New Zealand – s.6(a) • Prejudice the entrusting of information to New Zealand by another country or international organisation – s.6(b) • Maintenance of the law – s.6(c) • Prejudice the safety of any person – s.6(d) • Damage the economy of New Zealand – s.6(e) (i) exchange rates (ii) regulation of banking (iii) taxation (iv) stability or control of the prices of goods and wages (v) borrowing of money by the New Zealand Government (vi) entering trade agreements Other reasons for refusal of requests – section 9 These reasons must be weighed against the public interest favouring disclosure. If the public interest reasons favouring disclosure outweigh the reasons for withholding, the information should be disclosed. The section 9 grounds for withholding are: • Privacy of a natural person – s.9(2)(a) • Commercial prejudice - s.9(2)(b) • Confidential - s.9(2)(ba) • Measures protecting the health and safety of members of the public - s.9(2)(c) • Substantial economic damage - s.9(2)(d) • Material loss to members of the public - s.9(2)(e) • Constitutional Conventions - s.9(2)(f) (i) confidentiality of communications between the sovereign and her representative – s.9(2)(f)(i) (ii) collective and individual responsibility of Ministers – s.9(2)(f)(ii) (iii) politically neutrality of officials – s.9(2)(f)(iii) (iv) confidentiality of advice tendered by officials to the Minister – s.9(2)(f)(iv) • Effective conduct of government - s.9(2)(g) (i) free and frank (ii) harassment • legal professional privilege – s.9(2)(h) • Commercial activities – allow Minister or agency to carry on without prejudice – s.9(2)(i) • Improper gain or disadvantage - s.9(2)(k) 15 OIA training: Summary (updated on 4 November 2020) For questions or comments, contact Sarah Letellier, GES \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Discussion of most used refusal grounds Protecting a person’s privacy The OIA defines “personal information” as “any official information held about an identifiable person”. Under section 9(2)(a) of the OIA, you can withhold information about natural persons if: • the withholding of the information is necessary to “protect the privacy of natural persons, including that of deceased natural persons”; and • this interest is not “outweighed by other considerations which render it desirable, in the public interest, to make that information available”. Most of the information Inland Revenue holds about taxpayers is sensitive revenue information and cannot be released under the OIA (unless an exception in section 18 of the Tax Administration Act applies). You should refuse to provide information that identifies or could identify taxpayers, such as information about small groups of people (fewer than 10). Personal information about staff would usually be names, phone numbers and email addresses that are in a report or email in the scope of an OIA request. At the moment (as at 3 Nov 2020: this may soon change): When releasing reports or emails under the OIA, Inland Revenue releases the names of staff who are managers and above, and withholds names under manager level. However, we withhold the phone numbers and email addresses of all staff. The information is or soon will be publicly available Under section 18(d) the OIA, you can refuse to provide information that is or soon will be publicly available. Information is publicly available if it is freely available on a website, available for purchase, available in a public library, or available for public inspection. In these cases, refuse the information but advise the requestor where they can find it. For example, give them a website link to a document or describe how to find it online. (This would obviously be unhelpful if the requestor had advised us that they do not have easy access to the internet. In this case, it would be more appropriate to release the information and send the document.) How soon is soon? Before you use section 18(d), be reasonably certain that the requested information will be published soon: about eight weeks after the statutory deadline is fine. Let the requestor know where, when, and how they will be able to obtain the information. It’s also good practise to advise the requestor once the information has been released, and to contact the requestor if there is a delay with the planned release. The information does not exist or cannot be found Under section 18(e) of the OIA, information may be refused if the document alleged to contain the information does not exist or cannot be found. Sometimes it can be difficult to assess whether the information should be refused because it does not exist or because it is not held (in this case you would refuse under s.18(g)). 16 OIA training: Summary (updated on 4 November 2020) For questions or comments, contact Sarah Letellier, GES \[UNCLASSIFIED\] It may be that we do hold the information on some level (e.g. in numerous forms or tax returns), but would have to create the data to provide it in the form requested. In many cases, we may choose to create the data in the form requested, in the interests of transparency and promoting voluntary compliance with the tax system. However, sometimes creating the data in the form requested would take considerable resources. This is not a situation where we should refuse on the basis of substantial collation and research, as we would need to create the information to provide the information in the form requested. In this case, we should refuse the request under section18(e), on the basis that “the document alleged to contain the information does not exist”. Providing the information would require substantial collation or research Under section 18(f) of the OIA, you can refuse information that would require “substantial collation or research”. This term refers to the administrative difficulty in finding the information in the scope of the request, or in bringing together the requested material. Section 18(f) may be used where there is a substantial amount of work involved in locating, extracting and collating the information in order to comply with the request, but not because of the time required in order to decide (or consult with a view to deciding) whether the information can be released. Conditions to using 18(f) Before you refuse on the grounds of substantial collation or research, under sections 18A and 18B of the OIA, you must consider whether doing one of the following would enable you to grant the request: • impose a charge for providing the information • extend the time limit for making a decision, or • consult with the requestor to make the request more manageable. What is collation and research, and when is it substantial? “Research” (finding the information) and “collation” (bringing it together) includes identifying, searching for and retrieving the requested information, determining whether it is held, and assembling or compiling the requested information. The above tasks may be considered “substantial” where they would have a significant and unreasonable impact on the agency’s ability to carry out its other operations. We can also consider the resources we have available to do the work, such as the resources available to process OIA requests, the number of other OIA requests we have to deal with, the number of people capable of processing the request and, where only certain people can do the work (e.g. subject matter experts), the other responsibilities of those people. We can also consider how much information has been requested, how much needs to be searched through to find what has been requested, how long it will take to find the information and bring it together, and who can do the work—will diversion of these people to complete the required tasks impact on IR’s ability to carry out its other operations? Alternatives to using 18(f) There is no obligation on an agency to create information in order to respond to a request. Where the request is in the form of questions, particularly argumentative or “loaded” questions, instead of s.18(f), consider using s.18(g), the information is not held. If the work required to complete the request is such that it amounts to the creation of new information, rather than extraction or compilation of existing information, instead of s.18(f), the relevant refusal ground to consider is also s.18(g). 17 OIA training: Summary (updated on 4 November 2020) For questions or comments, contact Sarah Letellier, GES \[UNCLASSIFIED\] The information is not held Under section 18(g) of the OIA, you can refuse information that is not held. You can also refuse under this section where a piece of work is incomplete, e.g. a policy is still in development. Information can be refused on the basis that it is not held by Inland Revenue if you have no grounds for believing that the information is either: (i) held by another Minister or agency subject to the OIA or LGOIMA, or (ii) connected more closely to a Minister or agency subject to the OIA or LGOIMA. If Inland Revenue believes the information is held by a Minister or another agency, the request should be transferred to that Minister or agency. See Transfers. Inland Revenue is only required to provide information that is already held, it is not required to create information in order to respond to a request. The information requested should be held at the time the request is received. See the section on whether information is held. Maintenance of the law Under section 6(c) of the OIA, information may be refused if releasing it would be likely to prejudice the maintenance of the law, including the prevention, investigation, and detention of offences. Inland Revenue has statutory enforcement abilities and the ability to prosecute. However, in terms of revenue information, it is unlikely that we would rely on this section. We would probably refuse the request on the basis that disclosure was contrary to s.18 of the TAA - disclosure would prejudice the maintenance of the law. Section 6(c) may be relevant where the information is not revenue information, or the information is sensitive revenue information and there is a permitted disclosure. Tax confidentiality and sensitive revenue information When Inland Revenue receives an OIA or Privacy Act request, the first consideration is whether the information requested is sensitive revenue information and therefore confidential under the TAA. The requirements of the TAA take precedence over the OIA and PA. Section 18(1) of the TAA requires all officers of Inland Revenue to keep confidential sensitive revenue information, unless the disclosure is permitted under sections 18D to 18J of the TAA. We are also not allowed to disclose revenue information if disclosing the information would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system or the maintenance of the law. If the information is sensitive under section 18 of the TAA, we must usually refuse the request, or at least refuse that part of the request. See example wording here. Step 1: Is the information revenue information? First determine whether the information is revenue information. Revenue information is defined in section 16C (2) of the TAA as any information acquired, obtained, accessed, received by, disclosed to, or held by the Commissioner under or for the purposes of a revenue law; or under an information-sharing agreement. 18 OIA training: Summary (updated on 4 November 2020) For questions or comments, contact Sarah Letellier, GES \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Revenue law is defined in section 16C(1), and includes: • the Inland Revenue Acts • the Accident Compensation Act 2001, the Accident Insurance Act 1998, the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act 1992, or the Accident Compensation Act 1982 • the New Zealand Superannuation Act 1974, and • any Act that imposes taxes or duties payable to the Crown. If the information is not held under or for the purpose of a revenue law, or under an information-sharing agreement, consider the information under the PA or under the OIA. If the information is revenue information, determine if it is sensitive revenue information. Information-sharing agreements An information-sharing agreement includes an approved information-sharing agreement made under section 18E(2) of the TAA; an agreement made through consent under section 18E(3) of the TAA; agreements made by regulations under section 18F of the TAA for public services purposes. Information-sharing agreements also include memoranda of understanding where Inland Revenue can share information with other agencies. Step 2: Is the information sensitive revenue information? Sensitive revenue information is defined in section 16C (3) of the TAA as revenue information that relates to the affairs of a person or entity and: • identifies, or is reasonably capable of being used to identify, the person or entity, whether directly or indirectly, or • might reasonably be regarded as private, commercially sensitive, or otherwise confidential, or • the release of which could result in loss, harm, or prejudice to a person to whom or entity to which it relates. Reasonably capable of identifying a person or entity The information does not necessarily of itself need to disclose a person/entity’s identity but could enable someone to identify a person/entity. For example, where the information disclosed could be combined with information that is publicly available to identify the person/entity, then it may be “reasonably capable” of identifying a person or entity. Private, commercially sensitive, or otherwise confidential Information “might reasonably be regarded” as private if it is reasonably foreseeable that information belonging to particular persons is of a type that the persons concerned would prefer is kept private. It is common practice to have confidentiality clauses in commercial contracts, particularly in a competitive industry. It is also reasonable to conclude that a company would want the fact that Inland Revenue is investigating them kept private, as this could damage their reputation. 19 OIA training: Summary (updated on 4 November 2020) For questions or comments, contact Sarah Letellier, GES \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Commercially sensitive What is commercially sensitive is usually measured in terms of the possible business harm or negative commercial effect through the disclosure of that information. The release of information of a commercial nature relating to a taxpayer should be approached with caution even if the information is anonymised. For example, during a tax investigation, we may come across information about a product that is being developed and kept secret pending an application for a patent. Otherwise confidential This is a catch-all provision, although it is difficult to see what information would be confidential that is not already private or commercially sensitive. However, “otherwise confidential” would cover any information reasonably regarded by the taxpayer/s to whom it relates as confidential. To determine this, as well as considering the nature of the information, it is necessary to consider the basis on which it was provided. For example, if the person provided the information on the condition that it was kept confidential, then the information may be “otherwise confidential”. The release could result in loss, harm, or prejudice to a person to whom, or entity to which, it relates As well as commercially sensitive information, this would also include all forms of potential damage or detriment to any person or entity to whom the information relates. It would include physical or non-physical harm, monetary and non-monetary loss, reputational harm, and any disadvantage resulting from being prejudiced. Aggregate or statistical data is not sensitive revenue information Aggregate data is a grouping of things that are not necessarily numbers focused. Aggregate and statistical data is explicitly excluded from being sensitive revenue information, even if it contains information about a person or entity. If the information is not sensitive revenue information, consider whether disclosure of that information would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system or the maintenance of the law. If it would not, the information should be considered under the PA or OIA (instead of TAA). The following flowchart shows the steps to take to work out if information is revenue information or sensitive revenue information. 20 OIA training: Summary (updated on 4 November 2020) For questions or comments, contact Sarah Letellier, GES \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Revenue information or sensitive revenue information? 21 OIA training: Summary (updated on 4 November 2020) For questions or comments, contact Sarah Letellier, GES \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Integrity of the tax system and maintenance of the law A request for revenue information should be refused if the disclosure of the information would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system or the maintenance of the law. Before releasing revenue information that is not sensitive revenue information, consider whether communicating the information “would adversely affect” taxpayer perceptions that tax liabilities are determined fairly and impartially, that all taxpayers must comply with the law, and that Inland Revenue keeps individuals’ and entities’ tax affairs confidential. When determining if disclosing the information would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system, ask yourself: • What are the likely short and long-term effects on taxpayer compliance of releasing the information, and of not releasing the information? • Could releasing the information assist Inland Revenue or taxpayers to make better decisions about how the current law applies, or assist in developing a better tax system? • Could refusing the information cause taxpayers to view Inland Revenue as unnecessarily secretive and unwilling to promote greater taxpayer participation in the tax system? Types of information that, if disclosed, may adversely affect the integrity of the tax system include: • investigative techniques • industry benchmarks • audit strategy • tolerance levels and thresholds, and • new policy development. If releasing the information is likely to have negative effects on compliance that outweigh any benefits to tax integrity from releasing it, the information should be refused under section 18(c)(i) of the OIA, as disclosure of the information is contrary to the TAA. Contrary to legislation – section 18(c)(i) Section s.18(c)(i) of the OIA allows information to be refused if to do so would be contrary to a statutory provision. This is the section to use when refusing information because disclosure is contrary to section 18 of the TAA. Inland Revenue must not disclose sensitive revenue information unless there is a permitted disclosure. Refer to the revenue information or sensitive revenue information? flowchart to work out if the information is requested is sensitive revenue information and, if it is, whether there is a permitted disclosure. If the information is revenue information: • and disclosure would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system, or • the maintenance of the law, or • the information is sensitive revenue information and there is no permitted disclosure under sections 18D to 18DJ of the TAA, the information should be refused under section 18(c)(i) of the OIA. 22 OIA training: Summary (updated on 4 November 2020) For questions or comments, contact Sarah Letellier, GES \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Maintenance of the law The OIA and PA both have a ground for refusing information on the basis of “maintenance of the law”. The Privacy Act allows agencies to collect, withhold, use or disclose personal information where it is necessary for the maintenance of the law. Under the OIA and PA, the maintenance of the law relates to law enforcement action by a public sector agency, including the prevention, detection, investigation, prosecution and punishment of offences. These reasons only require the maintenance of the law to be “prejudiced”. This does not require the maintenance of the law to be negated or nullified. It would be enough if release could have a compromising or detrimental effect. Example: Generic audit or investigative techniques Information about generic audit or investigative techniques would be revenue information that is not sensitive revenue information because it is revenue information that applies generally and does not relate to a particular person. However, releasing this information is likely to have a material negative impact on taxpayer compliance because some taxpayers may attempt to use it to avoid their tax obligations. This negative impact is likely to outweigh any benefits to the integrity of the tax system from releasing this information (from, for example, increased transparency). Therefore, information about generic audit or investigative techniques should not be released. Another reason for not disclosing revenue information that is not sensitive revenue information is where the maintenance of the law would be prejudiced. This includes tax laws and laws administered or maintained by other agencies. Example: Police investigation An example would be where the Police have informed Inland Revenue that they are investigating a possible scam in a particular part of New Zealand. They have asked if Inland Revenue has any specialised investigative techniques that Inland Revenue uses in countering organised crime. The media has subsequently asked if Inland Revenue has been approached by the Police regarding any investigation into the suspected scam, and if so, where. This information should be refused if disclosure would prejudice the maintenance of the law by compromising the Police investigation. Permitted disclosures of sensitive revenue information Sensitive revenue information can only be disclosed if doing so is a “permitted disclosure” under sections 18D-J of the TAA. Carrying into effect – s.18D(1) Sensitive revenue information can be disclosed for the purpose of carrying into effect a revenue law, or for the purpose of performing or supporting a function lawfully conferred on the Commissioner under a revenue law. Example A customer has income tax arrears. You have issued a deduction notice, instructing the taxpayer’s bank to deduct a sum of money. In this way, you have disclosed to the bank that the customer has tax arrears. This disclosure, however, is necessary for the purposes of carrying into effect the TAA. 23 OIA training: Summary (updated on 4 November 2020) For questions or comments, contact Sarah Letellier, GES \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Carrying out or supporting a function of the Commissioner – s.18D(2) Sensitive revenue information can be disclosed under this section by a senior member of Inland Revenue with appropriate delegation, who has considered competing factors to reach a judgement that a disclosure is reasonable in the particular circumstances (guidance on the application of s.18D(2) can be found in Standard Practice Statement 11/07). The first step is to assess if disclosure would be made in carrying out or supporting a function of the Commissioner. The functions of the Commissioner include: • administering the tax system • implementing the tax system, and • improving, researching or reforming the tax system. The second part of the test is to determine whether disclosure would be reasonable, after weighing and balancing the following five factors: 1. the Commissioner’s obligation at all times to use best endeavours to protect the integrity of the tax system, and 2. the importance of promoting compliance by taxpayers, especially voluntary compliance, and 3. any personal or commercial impact of the communication or in any other way, and 4. the resources available to the Commissioner, and 5. the public availability of the information. Disclosures to persons and their representatives – s.18G Sensitive revenue information can be disclosed to the person (or their agent) in relation to whom the information is held. Clause 15 of schedule 7 of the TAA sets out caveats on provision of personal information. The Commissioner must consider whether: • the information is readily available, and • if it is “reasonable and practical” to provide the information. If the information is not “readily retrievable”: • If the request is by or on behalf of an entity, the request may be refused under s.18(c)(i) of the OIA, as the information is sensitive revenue information and there is no permitted disclosure. • If the request is by or on behalf of a natural person, the request may be refused under s.29(1)(i) of the PA, as the information is sensitive revenue information and there is no permitted disclosure. If we consider that the disclosure of the information would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system Although the information may be personal information, there would not be a permitted disclosure as it would not be “reasonable and practical” for the Commissioner to disclose the information. Other permitted disclosures Other permitted disclosures will not usually be relevant in the context of an OIA/PA request. If you need further advice, ask GES, subject matters experts, LTS, Corporate Legal, or Inland Revenue’s Privacy Officer. 24 OIA training: Summary (updated on 4 November 2020) For questions or comments, contact Sarah Letellier, GES \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Security, defence or international relations of New Zealand Under section 6(a) of the OIA, information may be withheld if disclosure would be likely to prejudice the security or defence of New Zealand or the international relations of the Government of New Zealand. At Inland Revenue, this section may be relevant if we have concerns that the disclosure of the information may have an adverse effect on our relationship with a tax agency of another country. An example would be where we have concerns that a comment we have made in a briefing to a Minister, about another tax agency, would be likely to be interpreted in a negative way by the Government of that country. As an agency, we do not comment on or hold views on the tax agencies of other countries. Information entrusted by another country Under section 6(b) of the OIA, information may be withheld if disclosure would be likely to prejudice the entrusting of information to the Government of New Zealand by another country or an international organisation. At Inland Revenue, this section may be relevant where we have been provided information by another country’s tax agency (perhaps under a mutual tax agreement) and we are concerned that, if the information is disclosed, this would be likely to adversely affect information being provided in the future. Prejudice the safety of any person Under section 6(d) of the OIA, information may be refused under this section if release would be likely to endanger the safety of a person. The request is frivolous, vexatious or trivial A request may be refused under section 18(h) of the OIA where the request is frivolous or vexatious, or the information is trivial. Please note that it is the request that must be vexatious, rather than the requestor. The threshold for considering a request vexatious is very high. The Ombudsman’s view is that requestors should not be unfairly denied the opportunity to make genuine requests. If you do use s.18(h), make sure to document your reasons thoroughly. What makes a request frivolous, vexatious or trivial? You can consider factors such as: • The request would impose an unreasonable burden on the agency due to being very complex or for large amount of information. • The request lacks any serious purpose or value (consider discussing the request with the requestor, as there may be a purpose that is not evident to the agency). • The requestor has specifically stated that their intention is to cause disruption, irritation or distress to the agency, or there is evidence that suggests this. • The request causes unreasonable harassment or distress to staff (seeks personal information about staff, makes derogatory comments about staff, or the burden of dealing with the request will necessarily fall to particular staff. • The language or tone of the request is aggressive, offensive or abusive. 25 OIA training: Summary (updated on 4 November 2020) For questions or comments, contact Sarah Letellier, GES \[UNCLASSIFIED\] • There have been repeat requests for the same information (although there may be genuine reasons for a repeat request for exactly the same information). • The requestor’s conduct has raised safety concerns for staff. • The information has already been provided by the agency. Trivial information includes autoreplies, read receipts, meeting arrangements, emails noting that a document is attached, correspondence referral cover sheets, and information that contains only a fleeting reference to the subject of the request. However, in requests for large amounts of information, extracting trivial information is unlikely to be worth the time and effort. Alternatives to using the frivolous, vexatious or trivial grounds If you prefer not to use section 18(h), you have three options: Refuse under section 18(f): If the concern is the administrative burden, consider using s.18(f), substantial collation or research, and consider consulting with requestor to refine or consider charging. Refuse under section 18(g) There is no obligation on an agency to create information in order to respond to a request. Where the request is in the form of questions, particularly argumentative or “loaded” questions, consider using s,18(g), the information is not held. Refuse under section 9(2)(g)(ii) Where the concern is the protection of staff, consider using s.9(2)(g)(ii), withholding is necessary to maintain the effective conduct public affairs through the protection of staff members from improper pressure or harassment. 26 OIA training: Summary (updated on 4 November 2020) For questions or comments, contact Sarah Letellier, GES \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Examples of wording to use Public interest In refusing your request for information, I have taken into account the public good considerations in section 9 of the OIA. Rights of review If you’re withholding any information, you must inform the requestor of their review rights. The wording we use is: If you disagree with my decision on your OIA request, you can ask an Inland Revenue review officer to review my decision. To ask for an internal review, please email the Commissioner of Inland Revenue at: CommissionersCorrespondence@ird.govt.nz. Alternatively, under section 28(3) of the OIA, you have the right to ask the Ombudsman to investigate my decision. You can contact the office of the Ombudsman by email at: info@ombudsman.parliament.nz. Refusing revenue and sensitive revenue information (s.18 of the TAA): Example of refusal wording - revenue information The information you have requested is revenue information and I consider that disclosure of the information would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system/the maintenance of the law \[may wish to explain reasoning\]. I am therefore refusing your request under section 18(c)(i) of the OIA, as disclosure would be contrary to section 18 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). Example of refusal wording - sensitive revenue information The information you have requested is sensitive revenue information. Inland Revenue is required to maintain confidentiality in respect of sensitive revenue information, and it is therefore necessary to refuse your request under section 18(c)(i) of the OIA, as disclosure would be contrary to section 18 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). 1 Published January 2022 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Tānga o te whakautu ki te tono mō ngā Pārongo Ōkawa Publication of responses to requests for Official Information This paper outlines Inland Revenue’s approach to the publication of responses to requests for Official Information Introduction One of the key principles of the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA) is to make information more freely available, which promotes good government, openness and transparency, and it fosters the public’s trust and confidence in Inland Revenue. Publishing OIA responses can make it easier for the public to obtain information they would otherwise seek through the OIA, which can reduce the administrative burden, and time delay, that OIA requests can place on Inland Revenue and requesters. Application While Inland Revenue supports proactive release (including publishing appropriate OIA responses) in line with the OIAs purpose, this approach does not direct business units to always proactively release (or publish) responses to requests for official information. It encourages consideration of whether information produced by Inland Revenue should be considered for release publicly, as part of business-as -usual activity where the content is in the public interest. We will continue to ensure that our staff exercise caution and undertake necessary due diligence before making information publicly available. This includes consideration our confidentiality requirements set out in Section 18 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Definition of terms Official information means any information that Inland Revenue or its employees 1 hold. It includes: • documents, reports, memos, letters, texts, emails (including drafts). • non -written information such as video or voice recordings. • internal policies and guidelines. • information that is known to Inland Revenue but has not yet been written down. 1 Includes permanent or fixed-term staff, contractors and consultants Appendix C 2 Published January 2022 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Publication of requests means making responses to requests under the OIA available to the public af ter it has been provided, where the information is of public interest. This includes: •publishing Inland Revenue’s documents (such as annual reports, statements of intent, research reports, briefing) on our website. •publishing the same, or edited, information that we have already or are about to release to a requester under the OIA. Public interest equates to the concept of public good, or legitimate public concern. It does not simply mean that information is ‘interesting to the public’. Inland Revenue considers it is in the public interest to release information that: •is useful or meaningful to the public. •provides insight into the work we do. •pr omotes the purposes of the OIA. If our consideration of the public interest in disclosure outweighs the need to withhold the information, it should be released. Key principles Inland Revenue will: •consider our confidentiality obligations under Section 18 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. •observe the spirit of the OIA and comply with its requirements. •as a primary consideration, release information unless there is ‘good reason’ to withhold it. •consider whether the information is of public interest. •consider whether releasing additional information would help to provide context or mitigate any harm from the information being released. •where information is being released in response to an OIA request, consider whether the information is suitable to be published on our website. •undertake due diligence and assess potential effects of releasing information (including the effects on personal privacy) before releasing official information. Decision-making Business groups producing official information should consider proactively releasing the information in situations where the information: •tells the public about how we undertake our functions. •is about our projects, corporate functions or advice to ministers. •or the topic it covers, has been requested more than once. •meets the ‘public interest’ test. •if made publicly available, would not create any legal risk to Inland Revenue. The following framework can be used as a basis to assist with decision-making •Information released by default (high public interest and low risk) Information that is likely to be of high value to the public and there is little or no risk from releasing it. •Information released in a case-by-case basis (high public interest and higher risk) Information that is likely to be of high value to the public, but the associated risks will require consideration before the information is published. 3 Published January 2022 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] • Not proactively released (low public interest and low risk) The low public interest does not justify the administrative burden of publishing the information. • Not proactively released (low public interest and high risk) The costs of managing the risks are outweighed by the limited value to the public. The withholding grounds in the OIA need to be considered to ensure that proactively publishing information doesn’t prejudice one of those interests. Due Diligence When the decision has been made to proactively release information, the relevant documents must undergo due diligence. There are four parts to this – Review to assess liability Section 48 of the OIA protects agencies from liability that may otherwise result from making information available in good faith under the OIA. These protections do not extend to proactive publication of information, even if the information has previously been released under the OIA. Inland Revenue must therefore consider any potential liability, whether civil or criminal, that might result from the proactive publication of any official information. The relevant documents need to be reviewed to establish their appropriateness for release – to ensure that the information will not expose Ministers or Inland Revenue to any civil or criminal liability ( including defamation, copyright or breach of privacy). Appendix A provides information on risks that Inland Revenue might need to consider before proactively releasing information. Risk assessment and mitigation The content must be assessed to identify any media, political and/or reputational risk; and establish how any risks can be mitigated. Business groups must assess the risks of proactively releasing information, which involves assessing the potential effects of releasing the information in good faith – and considering if: • the information includes any content that would be withheld if it was requested under the OIA or other legislation. • any potential liability (civil or criminal) might result – as mentioned earlier. • any of the information is subject to section 18 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. • the public would need access to any other information to make sense of the information being considered for proactive release. Advice should be sought from Governance and Ministerial Services or Corporate Legal if there is any doubt about whether releasing the information would pose a risk. Consulting affected parties Individuals and organisations outside of Inland Revenue (including other government agencies) need to have the opportunity to comment if we intend to release information about them, or provided by them, that is not already publicly available. No surprises The proactive release of information should not come as a surprise to the Commissioner, the Executive Leadership Team or relevant Minister(s). They need to be informed, in advance, if there 4 Published January 2022 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] are any matters of significance in the documents that have been considered for release – particularly where these matters may be controversial or may become the subject of public debate. Publication of responses to OIA requests GMS will consider whether it is appropriate to publish responses to requests for official information, with recommendations made as part of the final approval process. Requests from customers about information relating to the tax affairs of specific entities will not be considered for publication. . In responses to requests for official information, we will include a paragraph to say that the response to them, and the information provided, may be published on Inland Revenue’s website. All personal information or information that may identify them will be redacted. In some instances, information requests may be refused and no information is released (other than the reason for declining the request). For example, where the information is (or will soon be) publicly available under section 18d. These responses should still be considered for publication if there is public interest in that topic. Each case should be considered on a case-by -case basis. Redactions Content from information that we proactively release can be redacted. Redactions do not need to be identified with the related sections of the OIA. Officials’ personal information Section 9 of the OIA allows the withholding of a person’s name to protect their privacy. The Ombudsman’s view is that it is not necessary to withhold the names of officials acting in an official capacity and names should, in principle, be made available when requested. Inland Revenue’s approach is to release the names of all Inland Revenue staff, unless there is a good reason to withhold it. We will withhold telephone numbers, email and signatures. Responsibilities The business group creating any official information is responsible for ensuring that they identify whether this should be considered for proactive release – this also includes assessing whether a response to an OIA request should be considered for publication. Governance and Ministerial Services (GMS) is responsible for overseeing the proactive release process and can provide guidance on assessing any risks (including political) that may arise from proactively releasing information. GMS will keep a record of information that has been proactively released. GMS will also be responsible for uploading information to Inland Revenue’s website. Corporate Legal is responsible for helping business groups identify and assess any legal risks that may arise from proactively releasing information. The business groups’ Service Leader is responsible for approving the information to be proactively released, with input from GMS. Marketing & Communications is responsible for helping identify any publicity risks that may arise from proactively releasing information. Other business groups (including Finance Services and Policy & Regulatory Stewardship) can provide advice on any sensitivities associated with information that a business group is considering for proactive release. 5 Published January 2022 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Further information For further information, this paper should be read in conjunction with other guidance material on responding to requests for official information.

The OIA is a law that applies to ministers and central government agencies, enabling people to request official information. Inland Revenue (IR) is a government department, so all information we hold is subject to the OIA. The purpose of the OIA is to make information available to the people of Aotearoa New Zealand so that they can effectively participate in the making and administration of the Government’s laws and policies. The OIA also ensures government ministers and agencies are held accountable for their decisions and actions. All information that IR holds is official information. This doesn’t just mean information in documents – it includes things like sound recordings, film, emails, text messages, Microsoft Teams chats, and information known to IR employees that isn’t recorded in writing. OIA requests can be made in any form, including verbally, and they don’t have to mention the Act. The person making the request doesn’t have to tell us why they want the information or what they’ll do with it. Anyone physically present in New Zealand is eligible to make an OIA request, as well as New Zealand citizens, permanent residents and companies that have a place of business in New Zealand. Providing and withholding requested information Under the OIA, we must provide official information when it is requested, unless there are good or conclusive reasons not to. The OIA sets out the reasons for which official information can be withheld. For example, we can withhold information to protect people’s privacy or the maintenance of the law. This means we wouldn’t release information about a specific customer to another person, and we wouldn’t release information about the tax system if someone could use that information to get away with tax avoidance or evasion. Section 18 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (the TAA) requires us to keep all sensitive revenue information confidential and sets out the circumstances in which sensitive revenue information can be disclosed. The requirements under the TAA take precedence over the OIA. The OIA doesn’t cover information that an individual requests about themselves. This is covered by the Privacy Act 2020, which aims to promote and protect individual privacy. Which Act applies? Some student loan-related examples Taika asks for information about his own student loan. The law that applies to this request is the Privacy Act. There’s unlikely to be any problem with supplying this information. All frontline IR people can respond to Privacy Act requests (apart from those involving child support, which are handled by a specialist team). Nikau asks for information about their sister’s student loan. But Nikau is not an authorised person on their sister’s account. The laws that apply to this request are the TAA and the OIA. We wouldn’t supply this information. Gina asks for data about how many student loan borrowers there are and how much they owe on average. The laws that apply to this request are the TAA and OIA. No one’s privacy is impacted, as no information about specific people can be inferred. We would likely provide this information. Alex asks for information on overseas-based borrowers’ student loan repayment obligations. There would be no need to treat this as an OIA request, as general Appendix D \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] information about obligations is easily found on our website. We can just refer Alex to where she can find the information she needs. Tim asks for information about the number of student loan borrowers who are currently being monitored by IR because we’re considering stopping them from leaving the country. The laws that apply to this request are the TAA and the OIA. We wouldn’t supply this information, as it could be used to help people get around their compliance obligations. How quickly do we need to respond to an OIA request? By law, we must respond to an OIA request with our decision on the request within 20 working days. The Ombudsman’s website has a calculator to work out the due date for the response. The clock starts when IR receives the request, not when it is picked up to be completed. This means we must send any OIA request to the right person as soon as we can. This will be the team or person with the knowledge and experience to apply the relevant laws, provide the requested information and consider any other important factors. If you don’t know who should respond to an OIA request, check with your team leader or manager, or with Governance and Ministerial Services (GMS) at oia@ird.govt.nz. Can we extend the deadline for responding? The OIA allows us to extend the 20-working-day timeframe if the request is for a lot of information, or we would need to search through a lot of information and meeting the original time would unreasonably interfere with IR’s operations. The OIA also lets us extend if we are unable to reasonably respond within 20 working days because we need to consult another agency, organisation or person on the request. We must let the requestor know in writing that we’re extending the deadline, and we must do this within the original 20-working-day deadline. What is GMS’s role in OIA requests? OIA requests come from many different people for many different reasons. The requested information is often on political topics and can end up in the public eye. IR’s Governance and Ministerial Services Team (GMS) can provide guidance on the OIA and help with managing OIA requests. GMS also coordinates and helps with OIA requests where there might be some risk associated with releasing the information. GMS ensures that these requests are carefully managed and that the necessary stakeholders are engaged at the right time. Get in touch with GMS as soon as possible if the request: •comes from the media, a Member of Parliament, or a political party’s parliamentary research unit •relates to an issue that has received recent media coverage •contains any issue involving alleged misconduct, mistakes, or serious oversight by IR people •relates to information that the Minister may be asked about •could potentially affect IR’s relationship with important stakeholders. If you have any questions about responding to OIA requests, please contact the team at oia@ird.govt.nz. Updated January 2023 (SL) \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Day-by-day OIA process BS = Business Support, DS = Domain Specialist, L2 = Level 2 Domain Specialist The below timeline is a guide. We aim to provide information to requestors as soon as available, therefore in many instances, the full 20 days is not required. Day 1 Request received through OIA inbox: • L2 checks to see whether it is an OIA, and applies tags on how and who to action • BS actions most tags and adds as much detail as possible to OIA tool • BS scans (if required) and uploads request to Stax • BS considers acknowledgment and uploads to Stax Request received through OIA form (via website): • OIA inbox receives alert from the OIA Tool notifying that there is a new OIA • L2 check OIA tool regularly • L2 reviews, adds further details to the OIA tool and allocates to team member • L2 will set date if a copy is to be sent to the MoR’s office either in advance of, or at the same time as, sending the response to the requestor. For an IR OIA, the time period will be dependent on if there is requirement to consult with the Office, or solely to inform. For a MoR OIA, the time period is at the MoR Office’s discretion, and is typically 3working days before release, this is done on a case-by-case basis Consult – 5 working days before OIA due date. This would generally be where there is shared content with the Minister's office and can be open for their feedback. Inform (FYI) – 2 working days before OIA due date. This would generally be when it is IR content, but the MoR’s office should be made aware in line with the no surprises convention. Same day: morning of for noting not for changes. Especially for media or MP OIAs. Day 2 – or as soon as allocated • DS reviews and checks the due date/s and determines due date for the business to supply the information (at least 5 working days before due date to allow for reviews) • Adds subject, summary and tags to OIA Tool • DS considers: ➢ Previous similar OIA requests (or those published on the website) ➢ Do we need a scoping/planning meeting? Who needs to attend? Appendix F Out of Scope Updated January 2023 (SL) \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Out of Scope 1 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Release of staff names in responses to OIA requests This paper outlines Inland Revenue’s approach to the releasing the names of Inland Revenue staff in response to information requests (including Privacy Act requests) Introduction The basic premise of the Official Information Act (OIA) is that information must be released on request unless there is a ‘good reason’ not to. In essence, it is where release would harm one (or more) of a series of protected interests. There are also some administrative reasons for refusing information requests. The Ombudsman’s general view is that staff names should, in principle, be made available. Such information normally only discloses an individual’s employment and what they are doing in that role. Anonymity may be justified if a real likelihood of harm can be identified. The Privacy Commissioner, in response to consultation by the Ombudsman, also considers there is a low level of privacy interest in the names of staff, and they should be released for reasons of accountability. Inland Revenue’s approach Inland Revenue’s practice has previously been to withhold the names and email addresses of staff below manager level. This approach has now been updated and Inland Revenue will now release the names of staff where their names fall within the scope of the request for information, unless there are situations where staff have concerns about safety, improper pressure or harassment. Telephone numbers, email addresses and signatures will continue to be withheld. These decisions should be considered on a case-by-case basis in the context of each request for information. If there is reason to believe that harm could result from the release of a staff member’s name, they should be informed before the information is released. Any decision to withhold the names of any officials should be clearly justified and documented. This approach applies to all requests for information. Further information Further information can be found in the Ombudsman Guide Names and contact details of public sector employees (April 2020). If you have any further questions or concerns about this approach, please contact Governance and Ministerial Services (GMS) at oia@ird.govt.nz. Appendix G Page 1 of 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] OIA requests The information on this page will help you to recognise and respond to requests for official information. It explains the three Acts that set out how IR must deal with these requests. What is the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA)? The OIA is a law that applies to ministers and central government agencies, enabling people to request official information. Inland Revenue (IR) is a government department, so all information we hold is subject to the OIA.

Appendix J Page 2 of 24 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Privacy affects all areas of Inland Revenue. It can't be managed by one person. A number of people within Inland Revenue also have important operational roles in terms of privacy compliance: • Day-to-day operations require employees to deal with personal information as part of their duties. • An incident management team respond to breaches. • Complaints Management respond to privacy complaints raised by customers and Government and Executive Services respond to Privacy Act complaints notified by the Privacy Commissioner. It's important that everyone takes an interest in privacy and understands just how important it is. Feel free to contact Dawn if you have any questions or ideas about what you'd like to see on this site. What is Privacy? Privacy can mean different things to different people but the Privacy Act is all about personal information and how it’s managed. Personal information is defined as information about an identifiable person, so the information must tell the reader or listener something about a particular person. If no one is identified by the information then it is not personal information. Information about organisations (ie. companies or trusts) is not personal information. Inland Revenue holds and uses a lot of personal information so we must keep that information safe and only use it for specific purposes. The Privacy Act 2020 sets out 13 principles that govern how all agencies have to treat personal information and gives individuals some control over who has their information. It’s important that Inland Revenue treats personal information correctly and we all have a role to play in that. We live in an information age where personal details are very valuable. Sometimes you want to share your details to get a benefit (deals and discounts), for convenience (doing business online), or to connect with others. Every time you give someone your details, you also expect them to be kept safe. What happens if your personal information is misused or not kept safe? You don’t trust the agency that didn't do enough to protect you. You might get spammed, be contacted or harassed by strangers, feel unsafe, or have your identity stolen. In extreme cases, Page 3 of 24 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] when an address is disclosed when it shouldn’t have been, some people have to relocate to feel safe again. That’s why privacy is so important. People should know who has their personal information and what it will be used for. Agencies should be open with people about what they will do with personal information that it holds. Privacy is about trust and transparency. Privacy at work Protecting the integrity of the tax system is the responsibility of all Inland Revenue employees. The public expect us to be beyond reproach in our behaviour and delivery of work and to keep their information secure. The following are some tips to help you ensure that you are doing everything possible to comply with IR policies and minimise the risk of privacy breaches. Tips for all staff • Before hitting 'Send' on an email, double check you are sending it to the right person (do not rely on the auto-populate feature in Outlook). • Don't leave printed documents at the printer, make sure you take them with you. • Before sending letters or emails to a customer, double check that no other customer’s details are included. • Do not email work to your personal email address. • Do not take customer information home with you unless this is absolutely necessary. Keep it secure at home. • Place any paper rubbish that contains personal information in the document destruction bins or use a shredder to destroy it. • Ensure that your desk is clear of work at the end of the day. • Lock your screen every time you step away from your device. Tips for frontline staff • Follow the correct validation process in START Help. • Try not to have more than one customer account open at a time. This ensures that you’re looking at one customer’s details and minimises the risk of giving them someone else’s information or entering a note under the wrong IRD number. • Be careful when copying and pasting IRD numbers from screen to screen. Check the IRD number is for the right customer. • Be careful when using the suspend screen option and ensure that you have the correct customers details on the screen in front of you. • Ensure that you enter the correct person’s details under the correct IRD number. • Have one letter or application on your desk at one time. File the others in an in- tray or folder and only get them out as you work on them. The Privacy Act The Privacy Act 2020 governs how individuals, organisations and businesses collect, use, disclose, store and give access to personal information. Personal information is defined as information about an identifiable, living person. If information does not identify anyone, the Privacy Act will not apply. The Privacy Act applies to ‘agencies’. Almost every business, organisation, and individual that handles personal information is considered an agency under the Privacy Act – whether they are a government department, private company, religious group, school, or even an individual person in some cases. The Act also applies to organisations that 'carry on business' in New Zealand even if they don't have a physical presence here. Page 4 of 24 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] At the heart of the Privacy Act are 13 privacy principles that state how agencies must treat personal information. These principles reflect internationally accepted standards for good personal information handling: 1. Only collect necessary personal information for a lawful purpose. 2. Get information direct from the person concerned unless an exception applies. 3. Tell people what you're going to do with their information. 4. Don't collect information by means that are unfair or intrusive. 5. Once you hold personal information, keep it secure. 6. People are allowed to request, and have access to, their own information. 7. People can ask for their information to be corrected. 8. Information should be accurate before it is used. 9. Don't keep information for longer than is necessary. 10. You can't use personal information collected for one purpose for another unless an exception applies. 11. You shouldn't disclose personal information unless an exception applies. 12. You can only disclose personal information overseas if the recipient country has comparable privacy protections. 13. Don't assign unique identifiers, or require someone to disclose one, unless it's lawful. The Act also sets out specific reasons when an agency may refuse to release personal information to a requester, rules around information sharing, information matching, and public registers. Privacy at IR It is vital that IR builds and maintains the trust and confidence of individuals who provide us with their personal information. Protecting this information is a core responsibility of everyone at IR and is endorsed in our Code of Conduct. The Tax Administration Act provides that we all must keep information confidential and privacy is wider than confidentiality. The Privacy Act 2020 sets out obligations covering the collection, storage, use and disclosure of personal information and each business area in IR is responsible for meeting these obligations. Every employee and contractor needs to understand and apply the basic requirements necessary to meet IR's privacy obligations. The Privacy Act also governs information sharing arrangements between agencies. IR is involved in many important information matching and sharing agreements and you can find out more about these, and how information sharing works, on the Information Sharing site. IR's Privacy Policy explains what IR's obligations are and what we must all do to manage privacy. Please take the time to read the Privacy Policy and get to know your privacy obligations. There is a specific Staff Personal Information Policy which explains IR's commitment and practices in relation to ensuring the privacy of staff personal information. Information security standards and processes include the Acceptable Use Standard, Access Controls, Information Handling, Password & Authentication Standard, Internet and Email Use. IR has an Information and Knowledge Management strategy, policies and principles, including guidance on retaining and deleting information. People Policies & Guidelines on People & Culture's site covers: • Use of business tools. • Disclosure & conflict of interest. Page 5 of 24 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] • Confidentiality & secrecy. Governance Mary Craig, Deputy Commissioner Enterprise Design & Integrity (ED&I), has overall responsibility with the Executive Leadership Team for privacy. IR's Privacy Officer is Dawn Swan who reports directly to Mary. Dawn provides advice and assistance on privacy matters and the privacy programme. The programme consists of policies and processes across IR, training and education, breach and incident management and risk identification and controls. The Privacy Officer also manages IR's relationship with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner and the Government Chief Privacy Officer (GCPO). IR's Privacy Officer should be advised if the Privacy Commissioner or GCPO becomes involved in any matter you are dealing with. At IR, we have a decentralised privacy office governance structure. One Privacy Officer oversees privacy compliance, practices and advises, while decision-making for day-to- day activities is delegated. This allows decisions and information to flow bottom-to-top and widens the span of control. Privacy breaches While we must do all we can to ensure a privacy breach doesn't occur, where one does happen, it's important that it is managed properly and dealt with immediately. Proper breach management is vital to ensure IR retains the trust of the individual whose information has been breached and enables them to protect themselves. All privacy incidents and breaches are managed by Complaints Management, part of PD&D (Planning, Design & Delivery). Privacy incidents or breaches should be reported immediately through the Sensitive Incident notification form (this form is used for reporting privacy breaches or lost/stolen devices). Contact the Privacy Officer for more advice or if you're not sure whether to report an incident. Training A Privacy Awareness e-learning module is available through Atea. Privacy is also covered in the following e-learning modules: • Our Code of Conduct – Tikanga Whanonga: (MANDATORY) This provides a walk-through of the four sections of our Code and has a number of interactive scenarios for you to consider along the way. • Keeping Information Safe at IR : (MANDATORY) Gain a better understanding of our policies and procedures that help us keep information safe, learn about some key threats, how our behaviours can make a significant difference in protecting IR’s, and our own, personal information. • Navigating IR - Information Handling & Security: required learning for all staff new to IR. Focuses on security at IR, the Code of Conduct, information classification and handling and keeping our information safe. • Integrity discussion topics - these are scenarios to work through as a team and include topics such as Inappropriate Conversations, Accidental email breach, After work drinks and Unauthorised access to START. Use them to start a conversation. Page 6 of 24 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] If you have specific training requirements, or want privacy training, contact the Privacy Officer. Managing People's Personal Information At IR we deal with a lot of people’s personal information, so it’s really important that we all know how this information should be treated – whether you should or shouldn’t be able to see it, who you can share it with and how you can protect it properly. Handling people's personal information We hold lots of personal data for all NZ citizens and have a number of powerful technology tools. So, it’s important we all ensure that no matter which system we use, we are always protecting people’s information – both for our customers and us as IR staff. In order to do this, you need a basic understanding on what 'personal information' is and how you can identify it as well as the impact of how you are sharing this information. Different information categories There are a few different ways we talk about personal information here at IR. For a start there’s customer’s personal information, but we also hold a lot of personal information about us, the staff, as well. Here we will try to break it down for you: Information held by the Commissioner is divided into three categories: • Revenue information (“RI” or “Revenue Information”); • Sensitive revenue information (“SRI” or “Sensitive Revenue Information”); • Other information. Revenue information (RI) Revenue information relates to information held by Inland Revenue. RI is all the information that we acquire and hold in relation to our role in administering Revenue Law and Social Policy. Revenue Information could include, for example: • thresholds and tolerance levels; • profiling information; • investigative techniques; • operational policies and procedures; • aggregated compliance statistics; and • programme evaluations. Sensitive revenue information (SRI) Sensitive Revenue Information is a subset of Revenue Information. It means: Revenue Information that identifies, or is reasonably capable of identifying our customers, (directly or indirectly) or that might reasonably be regarded as private or commercially sensitive, or the release of which could result in loss, harm or prejudice to the person it relates to. Other Information Other information not falling into the definition of Revenue Information (or SRI) includes information held by Inland Revenue for purposes outside of its statutory revenue and social policy roles, such as personal information about employees (e.g. home phone numbers), or held for other corporate reasons such as commercial agreements or leases Inland Revenue is a party to. Page 7 of 24 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Personal Information (PI) PI is any information about a living, identifiable person. Anything you can look at and say, “This is about a specific person”. PI is intended to protect personal privacy. The SRI category is intended to protect the integrity of the tax system. It just happens to be that a lot of SRI is PI. Personally identifiable information (PII) PII refers to any data that can be used to identify a specific individual by using Personal information (PI). This can include information such as a person's name, address, IRD number, date of birth, and other sensitive information. It can be any information about a person, the content does not have to include their name. Most of what we do at IR uses people's personal information – from dealing with customers, registering them for voice ID to managing your team’s leave or updating your details in Ātea. We wouldn’t get much done if we didn’t use people’s information. Key tips for handling people's personal information To do our job well, we need to be trusted custodians of information. So here are some things to think about: • Access and use people's personal information only when you have a valid business reason to do so. • If you’re not sure, ask yourself: Is there a relevant business purpose for accessing or sharing this info? • Don’t look at any customers information just because you’re interested. Only look at information that is required for you to do your work, don’t browse as you can get into very serious trouble if you do! • It’s okay to discuss someone's circumstances (taxpayer or IR staff) for valid work reasons but think about whether you need to identify them and where you do this Page 8 of 24 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] • Do keep people's personal information secure – store it appropriately and restrict access if necessary • Don’t collect personal information from customers or staff unless you actually need it • Do think about how you want your own information to be treated and offer the same respect to customers and staff. Privacy breaches It's important that everyone takes an interest in privacy and understands just how important it is. Privacy can mean different things to different people but the Privacy Act is all about personal information and how it’s managed. Protecting the integrity of the tax system is the responsibility of all Inland Revenue employees. The public expect us to be beyond reproach in our behaviour and delivery of work and to keep their information secure. For any questions regarding Privacy in IR you can contact Dawn Swan IR's Privacy officer - How can a Privacy breach happen in IR? Despite our best efforts to keep information safe, sometimes we fail. So here’s some examples of where things can go wrong and what we can learn. Privacy breaches happen when personal information is compromised, usually by being disclosed when it shouldn't have been. Don’t forget that a privacy breach with customer information is also likely to be a breach of confidentiality (under the Tax Administration Act). Unsurprisingly, many breaches happen in CCS as it deals directly with customers, but no business area is exempt! Anyone who deals with PII of customers, staff or colleagues, can cause a breach. Here are some examples on how these mistakes can be made Mistake 1 – Disclosing by email Many of IR’s privacy breaches happen when we send an email or web message to the wrong person. For example, if: • an email about a staff members performance issues are sent to their whole team instead of the person concerned, • we incorrectly send another government agency a staff members salary information, • we disclose details of a customers student loan debt to a relative. These sorts of breaches are made even worse if we incorrectly attach information to the email, like: • an Excel spreadsheet containing customer names, IRD numbers and enquiries for IR to action • pre-filled forms, debt relief applications, student loan statements, Child Support admin review documents, unsuccessful job application letters. Mistake 2 – Verbal disclosures When we are speaking to customers, we need to take care that we don’t talk about other people's affairs. Don’t disclose information (unless they are a Nominated person) like: • an individual's income details to their spouses, • a company director’s personal debt when talking to an agent about the company, • that a relative has applied for child support, • the name of a receiving carer who has asked their name to be withheld s9(2)(a) Page 9 of 24 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] But don’t think this is just a CCS issue – Everyone has to be careful - if you’re talking about anything work related, be aware of your surroundings. Mistake 3 – not keeping information safe Do not: • leave documents containing personal or revenue information on the printer, or abandoned outside IR like at a café, • leave an IR device behind such as on a train, plane, bus or at a venue, • take USB devices containing IR information outside of IR unless absolutely necessary (and if you do, keep them secure), • also definitely don’t use real customer information in presentations or training. For guidance on responding to a privacy breach or for more information, refer to privacy beaches. So, what can we learn from these mistakes? To ensure we don’t make these sorts of mistakes listed above, here are some practical tips for you to follow. • Always check you are sending an email to the right recipient – it only a takes a few seconds to look at whose name is in the “To” box • If you’re sending an email to a lot of people, especially outside of IR, use the “BCC” function so email addresses can’t be seen by all recipients • Check you’ve attached the correct document to an email (or letter if you’re putting it in the post) • If sending documents internally send a link instead of a copy • Don’t leave personal information lying around so others can see it • Lock your device when not using it – this applies in the office and when working from home (WFH) • If taking information out of the office first ask if you really need to and, if you do, always secure it in a bag or compendium • Watch what you say and where you say it especially if you can be overheard • When WFH, don’t let others see your work, store hard copy documents appropriately • If you use START, ensure you add information to the correct customer record.

You can email Dawn Swan - IRs Privacy officer or for any IKM questions email us at AskIKM@ird.govt.nz Tips to keep your information safe On this page we share tips on how to keep your own personal information safe. Social media • Only be Facebook friends with people that you actually know. • Be cautious when accepting invitations on LinkedIn from people you don't know. • Don’t post your address, phone number or credit card details online. Page 10 of 24 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] • Check privacy settings on your social media accounts regularly. • Don’t post holiday snaps while you’re on holiday (people will know exactly where you are and that you’re not at home). Post them when you get home. • Similarly, don’t give out your exact location at exact times on social media unless you want everyone to know where you are. • Take care when uploading photos to the internet. Location data is often added to images via a phone's camera or an app, so details of where a photo has been taken within eight metres can be uncovered. • Be careful who you trust with your information and details - they could post it online. • If you want to post information on your page about others’ travel plans, check with them first – they may not want your friends to know their itinerary. • When installing a new app, read the permissions. Many apps want to access your contacts, email address, and browser history and will pass this onto third parties. If you’re not comfortable giving them this information, don’t install the app. Online security • Consider use your middle name as your 'online only' surname. Any websites which are truly secure, and legally require your real name (banks etc) will then address you using your real surname. Any site which only knows your 'online' surname will only ever use that name. • Similarly, use a nickname for your online presence. • Change passwords regularly and don’t use the same one twice. • Have a separate, low-limit credit card to limit your risk when buying online. • Have more than one email address – one for registrations on sites, another for a particular group of friends and/or another for family. • Make regular back-ups, use anti-viral and anti-phishing software. • Don't use public WiFi to check online banking. • Keep a close eye on credit card statements and reconcile any transactions. Contact your bank immediately if there’s a transaction you didn’t make. • Don’t click on links in emails from someone you don't know, and if someone you know sends you something odd, check with them before opening it. • When an online site has mandatory fields that are not relevant to the transaction, fill them with trivia such as the CEOs name or their own 0800 number or email address. • Consider your online information to be like any piece of personal property - you can control what happens to it to some extent - but it will never be fully protected. • Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) when doing "sensitive" stuff on your mobile or laptop. • Treat any information that you put online to be public information. You have very little control over who will copy and disseminate it and you can’t protect your information when someone else decides to make it public. Other tips • Ask to have your personal details suppressed from public registers such as your council’s Rating Roll. If you have concerns about your safety, you can also register for the Unpublished Electoral Roll rather than have your details publicly available. • Shred airline boarding passes with Q codes - they give access to personal data plus past and future travel. • When retailers ask for your personal details when making a purchase ask them why they need the information. Don’t be pressured into providing the information if you don’t want to. Any genuine business will respect your wishes. • Read the fine print before agreeing to sign up to anything – especially the privacy statement. This should tell you what your information will be used for and who it may be passed onto Page 11 of 24 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] • To protect yourself from identity theft, securely dispose of mail that contains personal information, like bills or bank statements, and never put documents that contain personal details in the recycling bin. • If you don't want to receive unsolicited marketing calls to your home telephone number, or unsolicited marketing mail to your home, you can add yourself to the Do Not Call and Do Not Mail registers operated by the Marketing Association. • If someone asks to take a copy of driver’s licence, ask them why this is necessary. The licence contains a unique identifier (the licence number) and the Privacy Act states that you are not required to disclose this information to anyone but NZTA or Police. If they need the licence to verify your identity, they can view it, so it’s not necessary for them to copy the unique identifier and other information. Black out your personal details and the licence number. • Ask providers to remove all your personal information when you close accounts, cancel subscriptions, or leave loyalty programmes. Privacy Act requests Under the Privacy Act individuals are entitled to request and have access to their personal information. They can also ask for their information to be corrected. Principle 6 of the Privacy Act gives people the right to request access to information about themselves. Principle 7 gives people the right to request that their information be corrected. The Act covers private and public sector agencies and even groups like clubs. This means you have the right to see what information is held about you by most organisations (although the media and courts are exempt). Inland Revenue is subject to the Privacy Act. However, there is also a requirement under section 18 of the Tax Administration Act (TAA) that all officers must keep confidential sensitive revenue information unless the disclosure is a permitted under the TAA. When responding to a Privacy Act request, you will also need to consider this section. Generally, information about a customer, that has been provided to Inland Revenue by that customer, can be released to them. General points • Personal information' is defined as information about an identifiable individual - so it must tell the reader or listener something about a specific person. If someone is not identified by the information they won't be entitled to it under the Privacy Act; • We must respond to an information request within 20 working days. The law says during that time we should decide whether to grant the request and let the requester know of that decision. The information requested doesn't have to be provided within 20 working days but it's best practice to release information as soon as possible - if you can release it within 20 working days, do; • A request doesn't have to be in writing and it can be made verbally; • People are only entitled to information that is readily retrievable; • Requesters are not entitled to original documents; • The agency receiving the request should make information available in the way preferred by the individual requesting it (for instance hard copy, or electronic or if they want to view the information, you should make arrangements to make this happen); • A public sector agency cannot charge for making information available under the Privacy Act. Privacy vs the OIA and TAA What's the difference between a Privacy Act and Official Information Act request? Page 12 of 24 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] The Official Information Act (OIA) gives people the right to ask for access to any information held by a public sector agency. The Privacy Act gives people the right to ask for access to their own information held by any agency. So if you want information about yourself it's a Privacy Act request, if you want any other information including information about other people (and it's held by a public sector agency) it's an OIA request. Here's more info about OIA requests. Example 1: if a child support customer (let's say the father of a child) wants a copy of information IR holds about them this would be a request under the Privacy Act. However, if the father also wanted information about the mother of the child, this would be an Official Information Act request as that information is not about them. Example 2: IR receives a request from Jo Bloggs for a copy of our Corporate Security policy. This is an Official Information Act request as the information is not about Jo Bloggs (so it's not his personal information) but it is information held by IR. What about section 18 of the Tax Administration Act? Section 18 of the Tax Administration Act (TAA) imposes a duty on revenue officers to maintain the confidentiality of sensitive revenue information and not disclose it unless the disclosure is a permitted disclosure that meets the requirements of sections 18D to 18J or Schedule 7. It also prevents disclosure of other revenue information where that would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system or prejudice the maintenance of the law. Sensitive revenue information means: • information held by the Commissioner in connection with a revenue law (and for a purpose in s16B(1) • that identifies, or is reasonably capable of being used to identify, a person or entity, whether directly or indirectly; or • that might reasonably be regarded as private, commercially sensitive or otherwise confidential or • the release of which could result in loss, harm, or prejudice to a person to whom, or an entity to which, it relates. When the confidentiality requirement in section 18 of the TAA is applicable (ie the information requested is sensitive revenue information), it is necessary to consider whether the information should be made available under the permitted disclosures to section 18. For example, we can disclose sensitive revenue information to the person to whom the information relates or their representative under Part B, Schedule 7 of the TAA. Occasionally we receive requests from customers who want to know who has accessed their information and why. They may ask for a copy of the access log that shows who has accessed their information in START. The view of IR's technical specialists is that an access log is not automatically made available to customers. See further information on the page about reasons to refuse requests. Process when responding to a request How will I know it's a Privacy Act request? The requester will be asking for a copy of their own information such as their own student loan statements, child support letters or maybe a complaint they've sent in. The information will identify them personally in some way. Page 13 of 24 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] The requester could also be a lawyer or tax agent acting for someone else. If it's a parent or nominated person, check that they are correctly authorised to act on the other person's behalf. Requests could come in by letter, email, fax or over the phone (they do not have to be in writing). What if I'm not sure? Contact the requester to clarify what they're asking for. You might even be able to give them the information over the phone. Who should respond? Responsibility for a request should be allocated to the actual person who is going to collate and draft the response. Ideally this will be someone who understands the part of the business the customer has been involved in. For instance, if it's a child support customer, then someone within child support, who understands the information held, should be assigned responsibility. How much time do I have to respond? You have to respond as soon as reasonably practicable but no later than 20 working days after the day on which the request is received. During this time, you must make a decision on the request and let the requester know. Usually the information to be disclosed will be provided at the time the decision is conveyed to the requester. Inland Revenue can be prosecuted if it doesn't respond within 20 working days. The definition of 'working day' does not include most Public Holidays. The Privacy Commissioner has a 20 working day calculator on the front page of its website to help you figure out when you need to respond. It's good practice to establish a timeline for responding. Work backwards from the 20 wording day due date and leaving a buffer of at least 2 days in case there are delays. But remember, while the time limit is 20 working days, your obligation is to respond as soon as reasonably practicable. What if I need more time? If you won't be able to make a decision within 20 working days, you can extend the time to respond but only if: • The request is for a large quantity of information, or meeting the request will necessitate a search through a large quantity of information; or • Consultations necessary to make a decision on the request are such that a proper response to the request cannot be made within the original time limit. You cannot extend the time for any other reason. You extend the time limit by writing to the requester, letting them know why you can't meet the 20 working day limit and letting them know what the new timeframe will be. What do I need to do? Step one Collate the documents or information being asked for. The Automation Team have developed a tool to assist the staff who process Privacy Act requests. The Note Extractor efficiently summarises all (or some) correspondence notes from a customer’s account, with the choice of exporting as a Word document. This eliminates the need for staff to manually go through a customer’s account and copy and paste screens. Out of Scope Page 14 of 24 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Have a good look at the request and read it carefully - is it for specific documents or more general? If it's for specific documents, locate those documents. If the request is general, check what databases or information you're able to access and see if you can locate information about the requester that falls within the scope of the request. You must make a reasonable search for information that falls within the scope of a request. Look in relevant physical and electronic locations. Don’t hesitate to get specialist help from records or IT staff. If a requester has a myIR account, you could also advise them they can access some information through that and we don't have to provide copies. You could also phone the requester and ask them what they want, this can save time and effort in the long run. Identify and consult with key staff who are likely to know what information exists and where it might be held. If the request is from an IR employee or contractor, this should be referred to People and Culture. Step two Analyse the documents and see if there is any information that should be withheld from the requester. For instance, is the information about someone else? Is there a current investigation that might be affected if the information was released now? Reasons you can refuse to provide information can be found here. Consult with others as necessary. The privacy officer is happy to provide advice on when the Privacy Act withholding grounds can apply. TIP: Keep a record of any information that is withheld from a requester and why. When preparing documents that will have information blacked out, make three copies of each document: a clean copy, a mark-up copy (that shows what parts of the document will be withheld and why), and a redaction copy (when the information has been blacked out). The redacted copy will be sent to the requester. If the requester makes a complaint to the Privacy Commissioner's office, we will have to provide a copy of our response including what information we refused to provide. Step three Draft a response using a template letter. Have it peer reviewed by a manager, Legal Services or Corporate Legal, especially if we are refusing to provide information, and then send it. Requests to correct information Under principle 7 of the Privacy Act, individuals have the right to ask that their information be corrected. However, the information does not have to be corrected. If you receive a request for correction, decide if the information should actually be corrected. For instance if someone’s date of birth or address is wrong then we would certainly want to update that information and would agree to correct it. However, if someone disagrees with a decision made by IR and wants that corrected, we do not have to make any changes. Principle 7 states that if an agency is not willing to correct information, it should attach a statement of correction to the information at issue. Usually, the statement is provided by the individual themselves and records the correction sought. The statement should then be attached to the information in such a way that they will always be read together. Let the requester know that their statement has been attached and give them a copy. If IR attaches a statement of correction it should, if reasonably practicable, inform anyone to whom the information has been disclosed that a statement of correction has been added. Page 15 of 24 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Reasons to refuse a request The right to have access to personal information under the Privacy Act is not absolute and sections 49-53 of the Act provide some reasons why information may be withheld. This page provides the most common reasons why information may be withheld. When providing screen-shots to requesters, Inland Revenue used to redact the user ID, screen system ID and screen identifier. However, in May 2015, the Chief Information Security Officer rated the security risk of releasing this information as Low. Given the effort involved in redacting (removing) this on every screen, it was recommended this information didn't have to be deleted when releasing screen-shots to requesters. Maintaining the law Disclosure of the information would be likely to prejudice the maintenance of the law, including the prevention, investigation, and detection of offences, and the right to a fair trial - section 53(c). Agencies that have criminal law enforcement functions (including Inland Revenue) can rely on this section. It's important that agencies that maintain the law can investigate and prevent crime and other offences. Sometimes, there's a real risk that releasing information to a requester could get in the way of investigating and detecting offences. Agencies should release as much information as they can without prejudicing their ability to maintain the law. For example, releasing a summary of information can be a good way to give a requester as much information as possible, while not revealing investigation techniques. This section can also be used to withhold the names of informants. Example: Donald Duck runs a distribution company. Mickey Mouse has contacted IR and said that Donald is not declaring all of the goods that he sells, and is paying his nephews, Huey, Dewey and Louie, in cash so they aren't paying tax. IR's investigation team starts to look into Donald's business. Donald finds out and asks IR for a copy of its investigation file so he can see what's been uncovered. IR can refuse to provide Donald with its file as disclosing some of the information at this stage may prejudice the investigation. If Donald finds out the details of what's being investigated, he could hide evidence or influence witnesses. Breach of another's privacy Disclosure of the information would involve the unwarranted disclosure of the affairs of another individual - section 53(b) This section is designed to protect the privacy of people other than the requester. A requester's right of access to information about themselves is very strong but sometimes other people's privacy rights are even more important. This section is most often used where information about the requester is also information about someone else (for instance, information about family members). Disclosing information about the other person must be 'unwarranted' and disclose the 'affairs' of another person. 'Affairs' has been interpreted broadly and applies to private situations as well as aspects of ordinary life pursuits or professional business. Even someone's name will constitute their 'affairs'. In deciding whether disclosure is 'unwarranted,' you have to balance the requester's right to access information against the other person's privacy rights. Consider: • What does the information reveal about the other person? • Is the information confidential or sensitive? Page 16 of 24 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] • What were the other person's expectations about how the information would be used and disclosed? Were they told it would be treated confidentially? • What harm might there be to the other person if the requester gets the information - for instance, would they be harassed, would it result in serious damage to relationships or affect their business standing? • If the requester already knows the information about the other person, releasing it is unlikely to be unwarranted. Example: In the example above, Mickey has made a complaint to IR about Donald Duck. Donald asks IR for a copy of the complaint that was made about him. IR could withhold Mickey's name under this section of the Privacy Act, as releasing his identity would be an unwarranted disclosure of his affairs. Mickey thought he was being a good citizen by letting IR know about Donald's alleged illegal practice and expected his name to be kept confidential. If IR told Donald who the complainant was then this would prejudice the future supply of such information. IR relies on the free flow of information from third parties in order to detect and prevent offences. If the identities of informants are released, those people would not provide information, which would prevent offending from being discovered. In this case, IR could release general details to Donald of what the allegation is without disclosing who the informant was. Another law prohibits the information being released (TAA's section 18) Another law prohibits or restricts information from being released - section 24(1)(b) The Privacy Act can be overidden by other laws that authorise, require, prohibit or restrict the availability of information. For example, section 62 of the Insolvency Act 2006 provides there must be a public register of people who are discharged or undischarged bankrupts. Because this is required under the Insolvency Act a person cannot make a Privacy Act complaint about their name being made public. Section 18 of the Tax Administration Act is an example of a law that prohibits or restricts information being made available, unless communicating the information is to carry into effect tax law or an exception applies. If you're refusing a request using section 18, this will override the Privacy Act reasons to withhold so use the following text: Information is refused under section 24(1)(b) of the Privacy Act 2020 as disclosure is prohibited under another Act, namely section 18 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (officers to maintain confidentiality). Disclosure of the information requested does not fall within any of the specific permitted disclosures to confidentiality, or would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system or would prejudice the maintenance of the law under section 18(3). Request to know names of staff who have accessed someone's information Occasionally, we receive requests from customers who want to know who has accessed or read their information and why. They may ask for a copy of the access log that shows who has accessed their information in START. The view of IR's technical specialists is that an access log is not automatically made available to customers. We do not withhold the names of staff that appear in START notes (see IR's approach to the release of staff names in response to an OIA request) but an access log is a tool that sits behind START. Often customers ask for the access log as they are concerned an IR employee may have accessed their information without proper authority. If this is the case, refer the Page 17 of 24 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] customer to Integrity Assurance () in the first instance. The Integrity team can investigate the concerns if the customer provides the name of the employee they suspect is involved and why they believe their file may have been accessed. After that investigation is complete, we can then consider if providing the access log, or part of it, is appropriate. The access log is considered revenue information so we need to consider the test in section 18 of the Tax Administration Act in deciding whether to release it (section 18 overrides the reasons in the Privacy Act for withholding information). If the release of the access log would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system or would prejudice the maintenance of the law then we may withhold it. A danger to safety or risk of harassment Disclosure would endanger the safety of any individual - section 49(1)(a) Disclosure would create a significant likelihood of serious harassment of an individual - section 49(1)(b) Sometimes releasing information to a requester may put someone's physical safety at risk: either the requester him or herself, an employee of the agency, or someone else. However. there must be some evidence to indicate that a danger in fact exists. If there is evidence that physical harm will result if the information is released, the agency can withhold the information. If there is a risk releasing information would result in someone being seriously harassed then the information can also be withheld. Safety is more important than rights of access to information. Evaluative material The information is evaluative material and disclosure of the information, or of information identifying the person who supplied it, would breach a promise made to that person that the information, or their identity, would be held in confidence - section 50 Evaluative material is very specific and only applies to evaluative or opinion material compiled solely to determine someone’s suitability, eligibility or qualifications for employment, appointment, promotion or removal from employment (for instance, a reference check). Evaluative material is information about what someone thinks about the person who's asking for the information - it's a judgment about the person's skills, their character, or their qualities. The agency must be able to show that the person who gave them the evaluative material (the supplier) did so on a clear understanding that the material was to be kept confidential or that they wouldn't be identified as the source of the material. For instance, there is a record on file. If there's no record, to claim confidentiality it has to be obvious from the circumstances that the supplier must have expected that it would be kept confidential. Would the supplier have given the agency the evaluative material if he or she thought the agency would hand it over to the person concerned? If the answer is no, then it's confidential. Legal professional privilege Disclosure of the information would breach legal professional privilege - section 53(d) When people go to see a lawyer, they need to know that what they say, and the lawyer's advice, will be kept confidential. There are two types of privilege: 1. 'Solicitor/client privilege' protects information contained in communications between a lawyer and their client undertaken for the purpose of seeking or giving advice, and the communications were intended to be confidential; Out of Scope Page 18 of 24 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 2. 'Litigation privilege' protects communications between a lawyer and their client or third parties relating to court proceedings. The document(s) requested must have come into existence when litigation was already under way or 'reasonably apprehended' and the 'dominant purpose' for creating the document was to enable the client's legal adviser to conduct the case or advise the client. Note: if you forward a lawyer's email to someone else, you may actually waive the legal privilege. Forwarding the email means it's no longer a communication between a lawyer and their client in which advice is sought or provided. Information cannot be found or retrieved The information requested is not readily retrievable - section 44(2)(a) - or the information requested does not exist or cannot be found - section 53(a) An agency can refuse a request if the information is not 'readily retrievable', does not exist or cannot be found, or the agency dealing with the request does not believe that another agency would have the information. Agencies cannot provide what they don't have or can't locate. Section 44(2(a) provides that a response to a request can notify the requestor that the agency does not hold personal information in a way that enables the information to be readily retrieved. A request can also be refused if the information requested does not exist or, despite reasonable efforts to locate it, cannot be found. A lot of information is technically 'retrievable'. For instance, even if information has been deleted from a computer, it can often be retrieved. It may also be difficult to retrieve physical documents particularly if they date back a long way and the records of where they are is not clear. Agencies need to try their best to get information for requesters, but there is only so far that they can reasonably be required to go. Vexatious, frivolous, trivial Personal information can be withheld if the request is frivolous or vexatious, or the information requested is trivial - section 53(h) It's not common to withhold information on this ground. However, it is a protection against requests that are made for malicious or other improper reasons. You cannot use this withholding ground simply because a requester is an annoying or even malicious individual. Unpleasant individuals are still entitled to access their personal information. It is the request that needs to be vexatious or frivolous before the information can be withheld. Information is not personal information about the requester Under the Privacy Act, people are only entitled to access their own information. Sometimes information requested is simply not information about the requester as it does not identify them in anyway. In this case, you should consider the Official Information Act and reasons to withhold under that law. Inland Revenue is subject to the Official Information Act which covers any information held by a public sector agency. You can find out more about the Official Information Act here. Out of Scope Page 19 of 24 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Privacy impact assessments If you’re thinking about starting a project or proposal that relies on personal information (information about an identifiable person), you need to consider privacy implications and risks. The privacy impact assessment (PIA) is a practical, useful tool to identify whether a project will impact on individuals’ privacy or change the way that IR manages personal information. PIAs help to: • Identify the potential effects that a proposal may have on people and their information. • Examine how any detrimental effects might be overcome. • Ensure that new projects comply with the information privacy principles. Out of Scope Page 20 of 24 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Failure to think about privacy issues when embarking on new projects can be an expensive mistake. PIA's identify opportunities for IR to bake privacy into processes and systems (not bolt it on at the end), which meets best practice. This enables decision makers to get to grips with the issues at the right time - before decisions are taken. A PIA involves summarising your project, describing the personal information to be used, assessing the project against the privacy principles, and thinking about risk. A PIA will be a useful part of any change project that: • Involves information about people or information that may be used to identify or target people. • May result in surveillance of individuals. • Will hold or process personal information off-site or off-shore. Privacy breaches Privacy breaches happen when personal information is compromised, usually by being disclosed when it shouldn't have been. Breaches are a reality for all organisations that hold people's personal information and it is vital to IR’s reputation and its relationships with customers that we do everything we can to prevent breaches. This page explains how to report breaches and how IR responds to them. A privacy breach may occur when one of the principles in the Privacy Act is violated. The most common breach is when there is unauthorised or accidental access to personal information or if personal information is disclosed, altered, lost or destroyed. A privacy breach only happens when personal information is involved and this is defined as information about an identifiable, living person. If you disclose information about a company or other organisation, this is not a breach of privacy. Breaches can happen in a number of ways: • Personal information being sent to the wrong physical or email address; • The loss of laptops, mobile devices, USBs or paper records; • Computers being thrown away or recycled without erasing the contents; Out of Scope Page 21 of 24 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] • Databases being hacked or accessed from outside the organisation; • Employees looking at information outside of their authority; • Personal information given to a person pretending to be someone else. It's compulsory that you report a privacy breach if you think one has happened - for instance, if you have sent an email to the wrong person, and the email contained personal information about someone else. We need to know about breaches so we can contain them and prevent them happening again. Report a breach using the Sensitive Incident notification form (this form is used for reporting privacy breaches or lost/stolen devices). Notifiable privacy breaches From 1 December 2020 all agencies in New Zealand have to report notifiable privacy breaches to the Privacy Commissioner and affected individuals. A notifiable breach is a privacy breach that it is reasonable to believe has caused, or is likely to cause, serious harm to an affected individual. When assessing harm we consider: • the sensitivity of the information (the more sensitive, the higher the risk of harm. A combination of personal information is usually more sensitive than a single piece of personal information); • size of the breach – how many people can access the information, how many are affected; • who has the information? Information in the hands of people with unknown or malicious intentions can be of greater risk; • whether the breach has been contained; • is the information protected, for example is it encrypted? • is there a risk of identity theft, fraud or physical harm? • is there a risk of humiliation or loss of dignity, damage to the individual’s reputation or relationships? You don't have to assess harm but you do have to report a privacy breach using the online form. The Complaints Management Team and Privacy Officer will decide if it's a notifiable privacy breach. A failure to notify the Privacy Commissioner of a notifiable privacy breach can result in a $10,000 fine. Responding to and managing a privacy breach At IR, privacy breaches are logged and managed by the Complaints Management Team with input from the Privacy Officer when necessary. Four key steps should be considered when responding to a privacy breach. Step 1: Breach containment and initial assessment • Stop the practice/action. • Recover the records (if possible). • Revoke or change computer access (if necessary). • Ensure evidence is preserved (particularly when information has been stolen). • Complete the Sensitive Incident notification form (this form is used for reporting privacy breaches or lost/stolen devices). Step 2: Evaluate the risks associated with the breach • Consider and identify what personal information was involved. • Establish the cause and extent of the breach. • Consider who is affected by the breach. • Identify whether harm could result from the breach. Page 22 of 24 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Step 3: Notification Decide whether to notify the affected people. If a breach may cause serious harm then we have to formally notify the Privacy Commissioner and affected individuals as soon as possible. It's not mandatory to notify people of privacy breaches that won't cause harm, but notification is transparent and provides customers with the opportunity to take steps to protect their personal information if necessary, such as by changing passwords or being alert to possible scams resulting from the breach. Each incident needs to be considered on a case-by-case basis to determine whether notification is necessary. If we do decide to notify, then do it promptly. It's important that staff engage with individuals who have been affected by a data breach with sensitivity and compassion, in order not to cause them further harm. However, sometimes notifying individuals can cause undue stress or harm. For example, a breach that poses little risk of harm can cause unnecessary anxiety. Don't notify people unless you're sure whose information has been compromised by the breach. More damage can be done if the wrong people are notified. If it's a notifiable privacy breach we have to notify the Privacy Commissioner and affected individuals as soon as practicable after becoming aware of the breach. We should also consider who internally needs to know (the Commissioner or media team for instance) or the Minister's office. Breach notifications should contain: • Information about the incident, including when it happened. • A description of the personal information that has been disclosed. • Steps taken, or intended to be taken, in response to control or reduce the harm. • What steps people can take to protect themselves if necessary. • Contact information for enquiries and complaints. • Offers of assistance when necessary; for example, advice on changing passwords or a link to Identity Security information. Apologies It may be appropriate to apologise for a breach. An apology should acknowledge the hurt or inconvenience caused by Inland Revenue’s actions/inactions, and if appropriate, briefly explain the steps taken to prevent the issue from happening again. There is no apology template as each needs to be considered based on the facts and taking account of the circumstances of the individual(s) affected. However, an apology should be sincere and genuine and acknowledge the mistake. It may include wording such as: • This breach/error is regrettable and I apologise that you were one of the affected people. • Inland Revenue takes personal information, privacy and security seriously and it is disappointing we fell short of our high standards when we made this error. • I would like to offer Inland Revenue’s sincere apologies for this incident. We regret that this has occurred. • Inland Revenue has notified relevant parties and identified improvements to prevent a similar incident. • We are currently reviewing procedures to ensure an incident of this type does not happen again OR These are the actions Inland Revenue has undertaken to prevent .... happening again. If a customer has received information about another individual, you can also say: Regrettably, you have received information that is not yours and we would like you to return the document. The information was never intended to be sent to you and Page 23 of 24 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] needs to be treated like the valuable lost property that it is. I would ask that you return it in the envelope provided or, if you don’t want to return it to Inland Revenue, you could alternatively send it to the Office of the Privacy Commissioner. Step 4: Prevent future breaches Once the immediate steps are taken to mitigate the risks associated with the breach, investigations are required to determine the cause of the breach and whether or not a prevention plan should be developed. Privacy incident impact calculator The Government Chief Privacy Officer has created a calculator to determine the severity of privacy breaches. It can be used to gain insights into privacy practices and culture by assessing the actual and potential impact of its privacy incidents. The calculator assesses seven areas (including number of individuals affected by the breach, sensitivity of the information and whether the information has been recovered) and determines the impact level from 1 (No Impact) through to 5 (Severe). You can access the calculator on Digital.govt.nz.

www.ird.govt.nz Page 1 of 3 Ref: 24 OIA1454 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 5 Decemb er 2023 Dear Thank you for your request made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA), received on 7 November 2023. You requested the following (numbered for ease of response): For each calendar year as far back as your records allow searching: 1.how many people overpay their final payment because the system forces them to retain the M SL code when there is no automatic mechanism to only pay the remaining balance; 2.what was the total amount overpaid due to this discrepancy in the Student Loan repayment system; 3.how many days (minimum, maximum, mean, median & mode) did Inland Revenue retain the overpaid funds before returning them to the borrower; 4.how much interest or other revenue did Inland Revenue earn from the overpaid amounts while it was held by Inland Revenue; 5.has any policy work, papers, reports, briefings, aides memoire or other communications been written or prepared where this issue is acknowledged, in part or in full; 6.is any work currently underway or planned to address this discrepancy and if so (i) what are the timelines for completion and implementation, and (ii) what are the project costs? As a guide this work might include (for example, but not limited to) not sending employers advice to change tax codes back to M SL if the loan balance is expected to be fully repaid based on modelling of repayments made to date, etc. Student Loan Payment Cessation For New Zealand based borrowers, when their loan balance is less than $1,000, Inland Revenue advises the borrower that they are getting close to repaying their loan. If a borrower is earning salary or wages and only has one employer, Inland Revenue notifies the employer to adjust the last loan payment to clear the loan balance and to change the employee’s tax code. Once the last payment has been received, confirmation is sent to the borrower and employer confirming that student loan deductions are no longer required. Inland Revenue will also inform overseas based borrowers that they are getting close to repaying their loan. As overseas based borrowers do not have New Zealand based employers or deductions, they will be provided with guidance on how to close off their student loan via their myIR account. Any overpayments received with the final deduction will be repaid to the borrower provided Inland Revenue holds details for an active bank account. Before student loans moved into a different system as part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation, cessation of a student loan was a manual process. Overall, each account took about 40 to 45 days to finalise and required considerable follow up (calls and letters) with employers, customers, and other agencies. All system-related processes relating to straight forward loans are now fully automated, with all but the more complex cases closed with no human intervention. Page 2 of 3 Ref: 24 OIA1454 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Payday filing has enabled almost immediate identification of fully paid loans, enabling automated overnight loan closures and refunds. Information being released The data provided is for student loan cases ceased after 1 May 2020. Data prior to this is from Inland Revenue’s old system and retrieving this information would be extremely difficult and require significant manual effort. Also, cases may have taken up to 45 days to complete due to the amount of additional checks required. The data provided for the following questions is as at 1 December 2023. Question 1 and 2 Since May 2020, 93,731 customers have overpaid their student loan through deductions from their wages. As the deductions were not ceased immediately after the loan was ceased 257,000 refunds were issued, an average of 2.7 refunds per customer. The total amount refunded $32.2m. The average refund per customer was $344.26. Question 3 The number of days (minimum, maximum, mean, median & mode) Inland Revenue retained the overpaid funds before returning them to the borrower are detailed in the table below. This data is as at 1 December 2023, for any loan ceased, where there has been a refund since 1 May 2020. Average days to refund\* 16.15 Minimum days to refund 0 Maximum days to refund\* 1,213 Median days to refund 2 Mode days to refund 1 \*The average and maximum days to refund are higher as IR is dependent on having an active bank account to refund the overpayment into. Over 51% of refunds are issued within 1 day with a further 21% issued with 2 days. Question 4 Inland Revenue does not earn interest or other revenue on student loan overpayments. Question 5 Four documents are within the scope of your request. Documents regarding Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation contain reference in part about student loan cessations and overpayments. Three documents detailed in the table below are available on Inland Revenue’s website and are therefore refused under section 18(d) of the OIA, as the information requested is publicly available.

I recommend that you note the contents of this report. Noted Noted Greg James Deputy Commissioner, Transformation 01 May 2020 Hon Grant Robertson Hon Stuart Nash Minister of Finance Minister of Revenue / /2020 / /2020 5 IR2020/128: Transformation status update: April 2020 IN CONFIDENCE Key risks and issues 10. The transformation programme’s risk profile remains amber with a future trend of amber. An amber profile means risks and mitigations are reasonably defined and understood, and support is needed from senior leaders to actively manage specific issues in some areas. 11. The programme has a total of 64 open risks, of which 22 are reported to the PGC. This is unchanged since the last report and changes are expected following the successful go-live of Release 4. 12. Risks and issues have not been reviewed individually this month, given the go- ive of Release 4 over Easter weekend. We expect to report a number of changes in next month’s report. In particular, the following risks will be closed: • the Release 4 go-live date not being met • testing of the transitional KiwiSaver business-to-business solution not being completed before go-live • inability to decommission the Student Loans business-to-business heritage solution. 13. There may also be some changes in risk levels for some risks. 14. On the issue reported to the PGC during March 2020 (IR2020/061 refers), we continue to keep a watch for any potential impacts on customers and scheme providers resulting from challenges with our historical KiwiSaver data. While we have had a few minor issues with KiwiSaver, they have been resolved quickly and have not at this stage impacted customers, providers or our people. Release 4 15. Release 4 went live on 16 April 2020 as planned and our systems and processes are working effectively. From 16 April to 28 April 2020, approximately 400,000 returns were processed including approximately: • 254,000 employment information returns • 105,000 GST returns • 17 ,000 individual tax returns. 16. Approximately 357,000 Working for Families payments were made over the same period. 17. When Release 4 went live we had a backlog of 7.5 million payment messages for KiwiSaver. The backlog related to KiwiSaver member contributions due to be processed by our heritage system in late April 2020. These contributions were held until we were confident that member contribution data was correct in START. 18. In addition, we received further contributions during the shutdown period. P ayment message volumes coming out of START are higher than they were out of our heritage system as a result of payday filing. 19. We are progressively clearing the backlog and have been passing on the messages and payments to KiwiSaver scheme providers as quickly as possible. We have had to ensure that payment message volumes are manageable from a provider perspective as some of the providers do have capacity constraints. 6 IR2020/128: Transformation status update: April 2020 IN CONFIDENCE 20. The highest number of payment messages we sent in one day was 1.17 million. From 20 to 30 April 2020, we sent as many messages to scheme providers as we have for any whole month previously. We have also transferred approximately $96 million in contributions in a single day, whereas we usually send about $700 million per month (excluding the one-off annual Government contribution). 21. As at 29 April 2020, we have cleared more than half the backlog and expect to have cleared it completely by 6 May 2020. 22. Logins to myIR are up on last year as expected, as people log in to look at the additional information, they can now see all the new services available. From 16 April to 28 April 2020, there were 2.7 million logins to myIR, significantly above the 1 million recorded for the same period last year. This is not a true like-for-like comparison however, as myIR was unavailable last year from the afternoon of 18 April to the morning of 26 April 2019 when Release 3 went live. Performance levels for myIR have been as expected, since the slow login issue was resolved on 17 April 2020. 23. Our Pou Whirinaki (extended support period) team is up and running and are focusing on providing support for customers, our people, our operations, and technical issues where needed. Customers as at 28 April 2020 24. Customers are reacting to the things that are different for them and are seeking support and guidance from us as they interpret information or work out what actions they need to take. A small number of customers are telling us that they are confused about these changes, especially at a time when they have a lot of other things impacting them. 25. We amended the wording on our website to make it clear that overpayments of student loans are refunded on request after some confusion about whether refunds would be held by us or paid out. Previously, borrowers had to contact us to ask for a refund of their overpaid loan, now they can do it online. 26. We have seen an increase in student loan customers making contact in response to seeing interest added to their student loan in error when they are New Zealand based. We are also seeing an increasing number of student loan customers contacting us to query why they have a student loan debt showing when they have already paid their student loan in full. We are working on clarifying exactly what these issue are and will resolve them once we are clear about what needs to be fixed. 27. We are closely monitoring a couple of issues raised by employers. The summary balance for employers showing in myIR includes future debt, which is the amount they need to pay in the following month and not yet due. Some employers using the file upload option are doing so incorrectly and, as a result, are not able to check their employment information before they send it to us. Some employers have reported that payments and returns filed are not showing in their accounts. 28. Initial feedback from KiwiSaver scheme providers is that things are going reasonably well. They are expecting that there will be some teething issues and are comfortable with this. 29. One customer took the time to contact us to say thanks for making it easier for them to see and reconcile their KiwiSaver contributions. “I would like to say a big "Thank you" to the team who rolled-out the latest update to the myIR website, especially around the Kiwisaver interface. Before that upgrade I could never completely reconcile the IRD transactions against what I knew had been provided via my employer, and what I knew had been passed-on to my Kiwisaver fund. It all works now, down to the very last cent :) I like that a lot; it was doing my head in before that”. 7 IR2020/128: Transformation status update: April 2020 IN CONFIDENCE 30. Our social media and complaints channels have remained relatively quiet since cutover. People – as at 28 April 2020 31. Initial feedback from our people is that they like having customer information in one place and can see the possibilities of our new capabilities. However, it is too early for any process efficiencies to be evident. 32. Site leads, key users and union delegates continue to report that Release 4 is going smoothly and that appropriate support for our people is in place. 33. On the whole, while our people are managing well, most are dealing with some lockdown challenges. These include their family situations, equipment set-up, internet connection quality and adapting to new work patterns. Our leadership teams are engaging regularly with our people to check on their wellbeing. This is the case across Inland Revenue, not just for our customer-facing teams. Operations – as at 28 April 2020 34. Overall we have not seen any unusual trends in customer contacts due to Release 4. 35. Online dashboards are providing transparent information about the status of the release. They are enabling the right information to quickly get to the right people and teams to support decision-making. Technical – as at 28 April 2020 36. Since go-live we have implemented approximately 200 changes, representing a mix of changes to START and business support changes such as updates to training material. 37. The level of issues being raised is less than 50% of those raised at the same time following Release 3 go-live. Many of the issues raised have been resolved by deskside support teams. Initial observations are that this is the result of our people now being very familiar with START, a consequence of working remotely, and the nature of the products within this release. 38. Deskside support is being provided remotely and is working very well. Due to the lower volume of issues being raised, some sites have redeployed some of their key users back to business-as-usual work. They can quickly return to deskside support if the number of issues being raised increases. 39. The transformation programme team have been raising issues and proactively resolving them before they become visible to or impact our people and customers. Other updates Policy 40. On 24 April 2020, we reported to the Minister of Revenue seeking policy decisions on the review of Unclaimed Money Act 1971 (IR2020/221 refers). 41. The Child Support Amendment Bill is awaiting the completion of its first reading. 8 IR2020/128: Transformation status update: April 2020 IN CONFIDENCE Cheques 42. Since 10 September 2019 when we announced we would stop accepting cheques from 1 March 2020, we have been closely monitoring the number of cheques we receive. The year-on-year decrease each month is very pleasing so far as can be seen in the table below. Table 3: Cheque volumes Sep Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar Received Sep 18-Mar19 19,517 47,694 22,340 22,240 50,758 27,407 35,024 Received Sep 19-Mar 20 12,600 28,189 11,657 12,025 27,107 13,101 4,498 % decrease -35% -41% -48% -46% -47% -52% -87% 43. Early indications for April 2020 show a 96% decrease compared to April 2019. 44. Proactive outbound calling, educating customers who continue to pay by cheque (without an approved exception) is underway, with most customers able to change to another payment option. However, some customers are unable to change and, to date, we have made 279 exceptions based on the customer’s specific situation. G enerally these have been due to the customer being elderly and/or rural. 45. A new phone payment option is now available to customers following Release 4 go- live. This is a self-service option which can be used from any phone (landline or cell). Following an initial set up (customers are assisted by our contact centre team), credit/debit card details will be stored and customers will be able to easily self-manage phone payments 24/7. Release 5 46. The impact of COVID-19 on Release 5 is hard to forecast at this point in time. Given current levels of uncertainty, we are considering our options for implementing the remaining changes and completing the transformation programme. We have adopted some core principles to help us assess the most realistic option(s): • During 2020 and 2021, our focus will be on supporting customers, responses to COVID-19, and other government priorities. We must be able to accommodate emerging government priorities, optimise what has been delivered to date, and complete delivery of new systems and processes. • The impact of COVID-19 on our business and customers will be a key consideration. The final products to be migrated to new systems and processes can be implemented progressively at the most appropriate time. Minor products such as unclaimed monies could be implemented at any time. • We will run a lean and flexible change delivery process. T his will be the basis for delivering changes once transformation has been completed and will help to ensure that Inland Revenue is sustainable in the long-term. • The programme team will work closely with Inland Revenue’s business units to progressively transition new capabilities, methods and enduring services to the post-transformation operating model. 47. We will keep you informed as our thinking develops and options become clearer. 9 IR2020/128: Transformation status update: April 2020 IN CONFIDENCE Coming up in the next two months 48. Key activities over the next two months include: May 2020 • Hyper care period of Pou Whirinaki/early life support ends. • 2020 automatic assessment process begins (this is being led by business-as-usual teams with support from the programme). • Re -planning of Release 5. June 2020 • Continuing to prioritise and respond to requests for Release 4 support. • Finalise the July 2020 Transformation update for consideration by the Cabinet Government Administration and Expenditure Review Committee.

Anyone who is looking to apply for parental leave and anyone wondering if their leave request could be covered under the Parental Leave & Employment Protection Act, 1987 (PLEPA) or IR’s parental leave provisions. It’s important to be informed about what could be relevant for you. Talk with your leader if you have any issue’s regarding the parental leave process and have a look at the key reference material. This guide also provides information which will support leaders when a team member is applying for parental leave. It is aligned with the structure of the Leader’s parental leave checklist. What this guide covers This guide looks to provide detail around what you might need to consider and various actions required at different stages of the parental leave process. It covers: • Initial steps and considerations • Before commencing leave • Whilst on leave • Returning to work Key reference material The Employment New Zealand website This site contains lots of parental leave information and specific sections are referenced in this resource. Parental leave » Employment New Zealand Parental leave and payment eligibility table » Employment New Zealand Your Employment Agreement These contain specific clauses relevant to parental leave. Employment Agreements IR’s People Policies & Guidelines Specifically, T opic 2 Parental Leave Guidelines and Leave Policy. People policies & guidelines IR’s Parental leave checklists Useful for all parental leave types and lines up with this more detailed resource. Some, or all of the checklists will be relevant to you and your application. Team member’s parental leave checklist Leader’s parental leave checklist Parental leave at IR - People & Workplace Services Updated - October 2023 Page | 4 Initial steps and considerations Who can apply for parental leave? Anyone may be able to take leave from work to care for their new child. What specific type of leave might be available to you is explained in more detail below. Parental leave eligibility You may be eligible for parental leave: • before your baby’s birth. • after your baby has been born (up until the baby’s first birthday). • when a child under six -years-of -age has come into your care. For more information check the following The key reference material above. The Parental leave and eligibility table can be particularly useful in determining your legislative eligibility. What type of parental leave can I apply for? The leave options available to you will depend on your situation and whether or not you meet the 6 or 12 month legislative eligibility criteria 1 . There are various legislative leave types you may qualify for such as: • primary carer leave • extended leave • partner’s leave • special leave • negotiated carer leave For more information check the following • Types of parental leave » Employment New Zealand – for descriptions of the various leave types • Parental leave eligibility » Employment New Zealand - for more eligibility information as it relates to the various leave types including a tool to help you work out your leave entitlement. NOTE: Even if you don’t meet the service requirements under legislation , IR’s collective employment agreements provide access to up to 26 weeks parental leave. T he employee does not have to have been employed at IR for the minimum 6 month period stipulated in the PLEPA 1987. Generally negotiated carer leave is the legislative option which employees can request if they don’t meet the 6- month PLEPA eligibility criteria, (and are also eligible for paid parental leave). Employees who meet the 6- month PLEPA eligibility criteria but not the 12 month criteria have access under legislation to up to 26 weeks primary carer leave or extended leave, and no further entitlement is available under IR’s collective clause. How do I apply for parental l eave? Talk to your leader: L et them know your circumstances and your intentions regarding parental leave. They will provide you with the appropriate level of support and work with you on your application end-to-end. 1 You must have worked for IR for at least an average of 10 hours a week, for a minimum of 6 months or been back at work for at least 6 months since your last period of parental leave to qualify for 26 weeks primary carer leave or for a minimum of 12 months or been back at work for at least 12 months since your last period of parental leave to qualify for 52 weeks extended leave. 1 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] This is the Parental Leave section from Inland Revenue’s wider Leave Policy, which covers a range of leave types (e.g. annual, sick, bereavement, family violence and parental leave). \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ PARENTAL LEAVE The purpose of parental leave is to provide employees with time away from work when a new child comes into their family. Entitlements are set out in employment agreements and in the Parental Leave and Employment Protection Act 1987 (PLEPA). An employee may also be entitled to paid parental leave through the Government’s paid parental leave scheme. Inland Revenue offers some provisions beyond the legislated entitlement, including the following. Employ er Parental Leave Payment (effective 1 July 2023) 1 If an employee meets the 6 or 12 month employment eligibility criteria under the PLEPA 2 and takes parental leave they will be entitled to either: •A lump sum payment equivalent to six weeks’ pay; or •A lump sum payment pro-rated to the number of weeks they were absent (if the period of leave is less than six weeks). Employees may choose to have this payment made upon commencement of, or on return from, parental leave. Both these options are paid at the salary pay rate that applied when the parental leave commenced. This provision is also included in employment agreements other than those on the standard terms agreements (for whom this provision is extended by policy). STEA 2011 also contains clause 4.8.1 Ex gratia payment, so these employees could elect to apply that clause if they choose to (though this provision is generally more favourable if criteria are met) Contribution to KiwiSaver on return to work following parental leave (effective 1 July 2023) 3 To be eligible for any KiwiSaver contribution payment, a person must meet the 6 or 12-month employment eligibility criteria in the Parental Leave and Employment Protection Act (‘PLEPA’) and have taken that leave. The employee must meet the requirements of their KiwiSaver scheme to receive employer contributions at the time they commence parental leave, and be receiving employer contributions at that time. If they are not receiving employer contributions at the commencement of parental leave, no lump sum payment will be made on their return. No payment will be made if the employee is on a KiwiSaver contributions holiday at the time parental leave commences. 1 This provision does not apply to the small number of employees who have elected to remain on a version of an Individual Employment Agreement predating 2023.

24OIA1472 and 24OIA1473 Page 1 of 7 11 December 2023 Dear Thank you for your requests made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA), received on 23 November 2023. The information you requested is enclosed as Appendix A. 24OIA1473 – Section FE 16B(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007 Section FE 16B(3) was inserted into the Income Tax Act 2007 as part of the amendments made to section FE 16B by section 120 of the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Act 2020. Section 120 was first introduced into the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Bill at the second reading stage as clause 81B. The changes made by section 120 were discussed in an officials’ report (report) to the Bill at pages 143-144. The relevant information from pages 143-144 is set out below. The full report is available on Inland Revenue’s website at Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans and Remedial Matters) Bill – officials’ report to the Finance and Expenditure Committee on submissions on the Bill (October 2019) (ird.govt.nz). Issue: Non-debt liabilities – shareholder loans Submission (Deloitte) The wording “a shareholder that is a member of the group” in section FE 16B(1)(b) should read “a shareholder”. This wording is likely to be an unintentional drafting error. This is because the wording will, essentially make the provision redundant as, if the shareholder was a member of the New Zealand group, the debt would be consolidated away. Comment Section FE 16B(1)(b) excludes from non-debt liabilities, in the thin capitalisation rules, financial arrangements providing funding that are pro rata with shareholding or by a substantial shareholder. As thin capitalisation is calculated on a group basis, a financial arrangement between a company and a shareholder where both were members of the group would not increase the debt of the group as the arrangement would disappear upon consolidation. Therefore, the submitter is correct that the current wording would apply only to arrangements that would not affect the group’s debt levels. Also, officials have been made aware of situations where two members of a wholly- owned group exist where the first member is a shareholder of a New Zealand group member and the second member provides either an interest free loan or redeemable preference shares in proportion with the first members shareholding. By removing the wording discussed in the paragraph above this situation will be covered by the associated person reference in section FE 16B(1)(b)(ii) and (c)(ii) but there is no equivalent for proportional shareholdings where the total shareholding in the New Zealand group member is less than ten percent. Officials recommend changes to section FE 16B(1)(b)(i) and (c)(i) to ensure this situation is also excluded from being a non-debt liability. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. www.ird.govt.nz 24OIA1472 and 24OIA1473 Page 3 of 7 Appendix A – OIA requests 24OIA1472: 1.

www.ird.govt.nz Page 1 of 2 Ref: 24 OIA1485 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 20 Dece mber2023 Dear Thank you for your request made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA), received on 28 November 2023. You requested the following: I have a keen interest in tax and recently learned about denied deductions, other than the Private Limitation in DA 2, I wondered what other forms of denied deductions were there for example say losses lost due to breach of shareholder continuity and breach of the bct test. What other examples of denied deductions are there? Denied deductions The Income Tax Act 2007 (the Act) allows deductions to be offset against a person’s annual gross income. The Act provides a “general permission” under section DA 1 which allows a deduction if it is linked to an income earning process or a business and also “general limitations” under section DA 2. There are also further specific sections which supplement or override to the general permission. The key areas are summarised below, however the relevant part of the Act is part D of the Act, which is available at: legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2007/0097/latest/DLM1512301.html. It is also important to note there is a large amount of case law in this area. •The general permission is a key part to whether an expenditure or loss is deductible. This usually requires that an expenditure or loss is incurred in deriving assessable income or in the course of a business carried on to derive assessable income. •The general limitations prohibit deductions for certain types of expenditure, for example expenditure of a capital nature or expenditure incurred in deriving exempt income. Each of the general limitations, to the extent applicable to the expenditure or loss, overrides the general permission. The general limitations include: •The capital limitation - A person is denied a deduction for an expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is of a capital nature. •The private limitation - A person is denied a deduction for an expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is of a private or domestic nature. •The exempt income limitation - A person is denied a deduction for an expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is incurred in deriving exempt income. •The employment limitation - A person is denied a deduction for an expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is incurred in deriving income from employment. •The withholding tax limitation - A person is denied a deduction for an expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is incurred in deriving non-resident passive income. •The non-residents’ foreign-sourced income limitation - A person is denied a deduction for an expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is incurred in deriving non-residents’ foreign-sourced income. •An important concept is that if an amount is to be deductible in the first place, a taxpayer must have incurred it. Case law determines whether an amount has been incurred. Page 2 of 2 Ref: 24 OIA1485 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] •Expenditure or losses may be apportioned into deductible and non-deductible amounts. Part D of the Act also details a number of specific rules for expenditure types incurred in deriving assessable income or in the course of a business to derive assessable income. These rules supplement or override the general permission and allow some expenditure as deductible and conversely deny deductions in some circumstances. E xamples of these include: •Denying a portion of expenditure incurred on specific forms of entertainment - subpart DD •Denying land contouring costs for those deriving income under the provisions dealing with disposal of timber – subpart DP •Denying a life insurer deductions for premiums in specific circumstances – subpart DR It is also important to note that Part E of the Act (viewable in the same link above) details a number of timing and quantifying rules. These rules can reduce or address the timing of deductions in specific circumstances. An example of this is the limitation of foreign investment fund losses under the comparative value methodology in section EX 51 of the Act. Inland Revenue’s website provides some specific information on common deductions, which can be found at : ird.govt.nz/income-tax/income-tax-for -businesses-and- organisations/types-of -business-expenses. This is the basic structure of the deduction’s regime in the Act. The other items that you have mentioned include tax losses impacted by a breach in shareholder continuity and the business continuity test. These rules do not technically deny deductions, rather they deal with the treatment of a tax loss which is carried forward to a future year. Entities, such as a company, may have a loss in one year which arises because deductions are greater than the assessable income. This tax loss can then be carried forward to a future year to be offset against a future year’s net income. The continuity rules and business continuity test are in place to ensure that the losses generated are enjoyed by the largely the same shareholders (in the case of the continuity rules) or largely the same business (in the case of the business continuity test) and where these are breached the losses are reduced. These rules are detailed in Part I of the Act. Publishing of OIA response We intend to publish our response to your request on Inland Revenue’s website (www.ird.govt.nz) as this information may be of interest to other members of the public. This letter, with your personal details removed, will be published in its entirety.

It proposes that, from 1 July 2023, child support collected by Inland Revenue would be paid to those beneficiaries, and the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) would then treat these payments as income when determining entitlement to a benefit or other assistance. Currently, parents and carers who receive a sole parent rate of main benefit are required to apply for child support to be assessed and collected by Inland Revenue. Child support payments collected by Inland Revenue on behalf of these sole parent beneficiaries are retained by the government to offset the cost of their benefits. Once the cost of their benefit has been offset, any excess is paid to the beneficiary. Excess payments are not treated as income by MSD when determining the sole parent’s benefit entitlement. However, other beneficiaries (such as re-partnered beneficiaries) have their child support passed on. This creates an inequity and inconsistency between how sole parent beneficiaries and other beneficiaries are treated in the benefit system. To correct this inequity and inconsistency, the Bill proposes to remove the obligation for sole parent beneficiaries to apply for child support to be assessed and collected by Inland Revenue. Any child support payments collected by Inland Revenue would be passed on to sole parent beneficiaries. These changes would not apply to Unsupported Child’s Benefit beneficiaries. The proposal is estimated to have a positive impact on approximately 41,550 sole parent families. On average, they would receive $65 per week of child support income, with a median gain of $24 per week (before the abatement of benefits). This Bill further proposes that MSD automate the treatment of child support payments passed on by Inland Revenue as income when determining their eligibility to, or rate of, benefit. The proposals in this Bill would align the treatment of child support payments received by sole parent beneficiaries with the treatment of child support payments received by other beneficiaries. Child support would be income for upcoming benefit payments. Monthly child support would be treated as income and spread across four or five weeks. Following the abatement of benefits, families would gain overall by an average of $47 per week, with a median gain of $20 per week. It is estimated that this proposal would reduce child poverty by around 6,000 (+/- 3,000) children on the fixed-line after housing cost (AHC50) 1 measure, and by around 10,000 (+/- 1 This is defined as income below 50% of the median equivalised household income in the base year (2017/2018), after accounting for housing costs. This measure tells us how households with low incomes are doing relative to previous years and the impact of housing costs. 8 4,000) children on the moving-line before housing cost (BHC50) 2 measure in the 2023/24 financial year. This initiative aligns well with the Government’s ten-year longer-term child poverty reduction target to reduce material hardship from 13.3 percent of children to six percent. Related to the proposals outlined above, this Bill also proposes that a formula assessment of child support payable by liable parents would be a cost that can be considered for Temporary Additional Support and Special Benefit purposes. Passing on child support was recommended by the Welfare Expert Advisory Group (WEAG) in 2019. This change would build on the earlier policy change made in 2020 to remove the financial penalty for sole parent beneficiaries who did not name the other parent of their child and apply for child support, which was also recommended by WEAG. Child support pass-on is being implemented in two phases. This Bill implements the first phase, which would mean that child support is passed on and most child support would be treated as income. The second phase would implement rules for how child support payments are treated as income in rarer cases and may come into effect at a later date. Effective date All the proposed amendments contained in the Bill would take effect on 1 July 2023. 2 This is defined as having income below 50% of the median equivalised household income in the year measured, before accounting for housing costs. This measure tells us how low-income households are doing relative to other households. 9 Amendments to the Child Support Act 1991 11 Passing on child support Clause 14 Summary of proposed amendment This Bill proposes that child support assessed and collected by Inland Revenue for parents or carers receiving a sole parent rate of main benefit would no longer be retained. 3 Instead, child support payments would be passed on to these beneficiaries in the same way they are currently passed on to other beneficiaries. Background Child support is money paid by parents who do not live with their children or who share care with someone else. The money is to help with the cost of raising a child. One of the main objects of child support is to ensure children are maintained by their parents. Parents and carers who are receiving a sole parent rate of main benefit or Unsupported Child’s Benefit (UCB) are called “social security beneficiaries” in the Child Support Act 1991. Those beneficiaries are currently required to apply to Inland Revenue for a formula assessment of child support. Child support payments collected by Inland Revenue on their behalf are retained by the government to offset the cost of their benefit. Once the full cost of their benefit has been offset, child support payments in excess of that full cost are paid to them. This excess payment is not treated as income for main benefits but is taken into account by the Ministry of Social Development for determining entitlements to other assistance, such as Temporary Additional Support, Special Benefit, and Childcare Assistance. These settings do not apply to other beneficiaries. Parents on a couple’s rate of main benefit who have children in their care from a previous relationship and parents receiving only supplementary assistance are not required to apply for child support. If they do receive child support, they receive the payments in full, with none of it retained by the government. There is, therefore, an inconsistency between how social security beneficiaries and other beneficiaries are treated in the benefit system. Key features The proposed amendments would ensure child support payments collected by Inland Revenue for parents or carers receiving a sole parent rate of main benefit would no longer 3 These beneficiaries may be receiving Emergency Benefit, Jobseeker Support, Sole Parent Support, Supported Living Payment - health condition, injury, disability, or total blindness, or Young Parent Payment depending on their circumstances. 12 be retained by the government. Instead, their child support payments would be passed on in the same way they are currently passed on to other beneficiaries. Child support assessed and collected by Inland Revenue for UCB beneficiaries would continue to be retained (see “Proposals not to apply to UCB beneficiaries” below). 13 Removing the requirement to apply for child support through Inland Revenue Clauses 5–7 Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments would remove the requirement for parents receiving a sole parent rate of main benefit to apply for child support through Inland Revenue. Background Currently, parents and carers receiving a sole parent rate of main benefit or an Unsupported Child’s Benefit (UCB) are required to apply for formula assessed child support through Inland Revenue unless one of the grounds for exemption (such as a risk of violence) applies. This requirement does not apply to other beneficiaries with children or other parents outside the benefit system. Key features The requirement that parents receiving a sole parent rate of main benefit apply for child support would be removed. This would enable these parents to enter the type of child support arrangement that best meets their needs – a formula assessment, a voluntary agreement, a private arrangement, or no child support arrangement at all. The requirement for UCB beneficiaries to apply for child support would remain (see “Proposals not to apply to UCB beneficiaries” below). 14 Proposals not to apply to UCB beneficiaries Clauses 4, 9, 11–13, and 15–18 Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments would ensure that the proposals in the Bill to pass on child support collected by Inland Revenue and to remove the obligation to apply for child support through Inland Revenue would not apply to Unsupported Child’s Benefit (UCB) beneficiaries. Background The UCB is administered by the Ministry of Social Development for children living with caregivers outside the State care system. It is a payment that helps caregivers who are supporting children whose parents cannot care for them because of a family breakdown. Currently, caregivers who receive a UCB are subject to the same process for retaining child support as parents receiving a sole parent rate of main benefit. However, while the proposals contained in the Bill to pass on child support collected by Inland Revenue and to remove the obligation to apply for child support through Inland Revenue would apply for parents receiving a sole parent rate of main benefit, the proposals would not apply to UCB beneficiaries. Key features Caregivers receiving the UCB for children will still be required to apply for child support through Inland Revenue for those children, and the government will continue to retain those child support payments, up to the value of the UCB, to offset the cost of that benefit. This is because child support settings for UCB beneficiaries are currently being considered by Oranga Tamariki – Ministry for Children as part of the work to reform the system of financial assistance and support for caregivers, following the 2019 review. “UCB beneficiary” would be a defined term in the Child Support Act 1991. Consequential amendments would be made to various provisions in the Child Support Act 1991 to reflect that they would only apply to a “UCB beneficiary”. The proposals in the Bill will apply to UCB beneficiaries for children they are not receiving the UCB for. 15 Amendments to the Social Security Act 2018 and Social Security Regulations 2018 17 Definitions of “information share child support payment” and “non-information share child support payment” Clause 37 Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment would insert definitions of “information share child support payment” and “non-information share child support payment” into schedule 2 of the Social Security Act 2018. These definitions are necessary to apply the proposed new income rules. Background The proposal to treat certain child support payments as income under new income rules means it is necessary to specify the child support payments the new rules would apply to. It would not be appropriate to apply the proposed new income rules to all types of child support payments (for example, child support relating to periods before 1 July 2023). Therefore, it is necessary to set out which child support payments the proposed rules would apply to, the types of payments that the general rules should continue to apply to, and the child support payments that would not be included as income for benefit and other assistance. Key features The proposed new rules for treating child support as income would apply to an “information share child support payment” (see “Child support payments treated as income” below). An “information share child support payment” would be child support that is:  paid by direct credit to the person’s nominated bank account  notified to the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) by Inland Revenue under their approved information sharing agreement, and  not a “non-information share child support payment”. A “non-information share child support payment” would be child support that is:  excess child support paid to an Unsupported Child’s Benefit (UCB) beneficiary (because the child support paid is more than the cost of the UCB) or a mixed child support payment 18  paid in a lump sum under an order made by a Family Court  a foreign child support payment (being a payment that relates to child support Inland Revenue is collecting on behalf of another country)  child support passed on to an MSD beneficiary living outside New Zealand  paid after 30 June 2023 for a period before 1 July 2023, or  specified as a “non-information share child support payment” in regulations. It is proposed that the current income rules would continue to apply to non-information share child support payments (see “Child support payments treated as income” below). The Bill proposes that new payments can be added to the definition of “non-information share child support payment” via regulations if they are identified. This would allow these payments to be treated appropriately in a timely manner. Child support payments that do not come under either definition would not be income for benefit or other assistance. For example, child support that two parents owe each other that has been netted off and is no longer payable. 19 Child support payments treated as income Clauses 39–46 Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments provide that “information share child support payments” passed on by Inland Revenue would generally be treated by the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) as income for benefit purposes. The income would be spread across the next four or five weeks (depending on the number of benefit payments in the month and whether a weekly or fortnightly benefit is being received). “Non-information share child support payments” would continue to be treated under MSD’s current income rules. Background Currently, parents and carers receiving a sole parent rate of main benefit or an Unsupported Child’s Benefit (UCB) only receive child support payments to the extent that the payments exceed their benefits. These payments are not treated as income for those benefits as their cost has already been offset. Other beneficiaries receiving child support are required to tell MSD about any child support they receive so it can be treated as income. The proposal to also treat “information share child support payments” as income would align with the principle that financial support from the government is provided to people while taking into account the resources available to them. Child support is a monthly payment, whereas benefit payments are paid weekly or fortnightly. Under the current income rules, MSD has a discretion to determine the period to which any income relates. This means when MSD is made aware of a person’s income, they may determine it relates to a past or future period. If MSD determines the income relates to a past period for which the benefit has already been paid, this can result in benefit debt for the beneficiary. Under the new income rules, specific rules are proposed to treat child support payments as income on a weekly basis. Key features Under the proposed new income rules, information share child support payments would be treated as income on a weekly basis for the purpose of benefits and other assistance. These proposed changes would replace how MSD treats child support payments from Inland Revenue as income for all beneficiaries, not just parents receiving a sole parent rate of main benefit. Non-information share child support payments would continue to be treated as income under MSD’s current income rules. 20 Detailed analysis Information share child support payments Child support payments collected by Inland Revenue are based on an annual liability. This annual amount is then divided equally into 12 monthly payments due by liable parents. In contrast, benefits are paid on either a weekly or fortnightly basis. If the monthly child support payment was only treated as income in the week or fortnight it was received, the payment may result in more benefit abatement than if the payment was spread over the length of time it is intended to represent. The Bill therefore proposes to take the monthly child support payment and turn it into weekly amounts by spreading the payment evenly across the next four or five weeks. This ensures that entitlement to a benefit is assessed in a way that is consistent with the number of weeks the child support payment is intended to support the child. This means that benefit entitlement would be assessed based on the financial resources available to the receiving carer and debt for families would also be minimised by ensuring child support payments do not impact benefits that have already been paid. Example 1: Spreading of income Jo is receiving a sole parent rate of benefit. Her ex-partner is paying child support of $180 each month. Currently, the government retains all the child support to offset the cost of Jo’s benefit. Assuming the proposals in the Bill are implemented, child support for periods from July 2023 would be passed on to Jo. The child support for August 2023 would be due to be paid to Inland Revenue by 20 September, and Inland Revenue would then pay Jo. Rather than treating the child support as income for August, or as income in the week it is received (which would only abate Jo’s benefit in that week), the payment would be treated as $36 of income in each of the following five weeks. This is different from the current income rules in the Social Security Act 2018. Those rules provide MSD with a discretion to determine the period the income is taken into account for benefit purposes. How child support will be treated as income for benefit purposes Whether a person is receiving their benefit weekly or fortnightly will impact the number of weeks their child support payment is treated as income as well as the start and end dates of the income treatment. Weekly benefits When the payment starts to be treated as income The period of entitlement for weekly benefits runs from Monday to Sunday. The benefit payment is made to the beneficiary in the following week. 21 Under the proposed amendments, a child support payment would start to be treated as income from the Monday of the week that the payment is treated as being received (referred to in the Bill as the “deemed receipt”). A payment would be treated as received on the business day after Inland Revenue notifies MSD that the payment has been made to the receiving carer. Example 2: When payment starts to be treated as income Inland Revenue notifies MSD that a child support payment has been made to a receiving carer’s nominated bank account on 22 August 2023. Assuming the proposals in the Bill are implemented, the payment would be treated as being received on 23 August (being one business day after Inland Revenue notifies MSD the payment has been made). The payment would start to be treated as income for benefit purposes on 21 August - the Monday of the week the payment is treated as being received. Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun 21 Start date for treating as income 22 Payment made and MSD notified 23 Date treated as being received 24 25 26 27 If notification is sent to MSD on a Friday, the payment would be treated as being received on the following Monday, and the payment would start to be treated as income on that same Monday. 4 4 If the day after the payment is made is a public holiday, the payment would be treated as received on the next day. 22 Example 2 (continued) Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun 21 22 23 24 25 Payment made and MSD notified 26 27 28 Date treated as being received Start date for treating as income 29 30 31 1 2 3 When the payment stops being treated as income When a child support payment stops being treated as income for weekly benefits would depend on whether it is an “in-cycle payment” or an “out-of-cycle payment”. An in-cycle payment would be any child support payments made by Inland Revenue to a receiving carer on the day that is two business days after the 19th of the month. For example, if the 19th of a month is a Saturday, any child support payment that Inland Revenue pays to a receiving carer on Tuesday 22nd would be an in-cycle payment. In-cycle payments generally represent a child support payment that has been made on time. However, any late child support payments made on this day would also be treated as an in- cycle payment for benefit purposes. Any child support payments made to a receiving carer on any other day of the month that is not the in-cycle payment date would be an out-of-cycle payment. Using the example in the previous paragraph, if the payment was made on, for example, Monday 21st or Wednesday 23rd, the payment would be an out-of-cycle payment. Inland Revenue does not make child support payments on non-business days – such as weekends or public holidays. Out-of- cycle payments represent payments for an earlier child support period that have not been paid by the due date. When an in-cycle payment stops being treated as income For in-cycle payments, the child support payment would stop being treated as income on the Sunday before the “expected date of the next in-cycle payment”, being the third business day after the 19th of the following month. This rule is designed to ensure that an in-cycle payment stops being treated as income before the next payment starts to be treated as income. 23 Example 3: How in-cycle payments would be treated as income Paul is a receiving carer and is receiving a sole parent rate of main benefit. On 21 June 2024, Inland Revenue makes a $400 child support payment to Paul’s bank account and notifies MSD of the payment. Assuming the proposals in the Bill are implemented, the payment would be treated as being received one business day after MSD is notified. In this case, as 21 June 2024 is a Friday, the payment would be treated as being received on Monday 24 June. The period the child support would be considered as income would start on the Monday of the week the payment is treated as being received, which is also 24 June. The expected date of the next in-cycle payment would be the third business day after 19 J uly, which would be Wednesday 24 July. The period the child support would be treated as income would therefore end on Sunday 21 July, being the Sunday before the expected date of the next in-cycle payment. Therefore, the period the child support payment would be treated as income would start on 24 June and end on 21 July. There are four weekly benefit payments between these dates. Therefore, the child support payment of $400 would be divided by four. MSD would treat $100 of child support as Paul’s income for each week during this period. Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun 17 18 19 20 21 In-cycle payment made, and MSD notified 22 23 24 Date treated as being received Start date for treating as income 25 26 27 28 29 30 24 Example 3 (continued) Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 End date for treating as income 22 23 24 Date we expect the next payment to be treated as received 25 26 27 28 When an out-of-cycle payment stops being treated as income An out-of-cycle child support payment would stop being treated as income on the Sunday before the date that is the same date in the next calendar month as the date the payment is treated as received in the current month. Example 4: How out-of -cycle payments would be treated as income Inland Revenue makes a child support payment of $100 on 8 November 2023 to Maggie. Assuming the proposals in the Bill are implemented, this would be an out-of- cycle payment as the payment is not made on the in-cycle payment date of 21 November (two business days after 19 November). The payment would be treated as being received on the next business day, which is 9 November. The payment would be treated as income starting on the Monday of the week the payment is treated as being received – this would be 6 November. The same date in the next calendar month would be 9 December. The period would end on the Sunday before this date – this would be 3 December. In the event that this date is a Sunday, the income treatment would end on the Sunday the week before this date. 25 Therefore, the period the child support payment would be treated as income would start on 6 November and end on 3 December. There are four benefit payments between these dates. Therefore, the child support payment of $100 would be divided by four. MSD would treat $25 of child support as Maggie’s income for each week during this period. Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun 6 Start date for treating as income 7 8 Out-of- cycle payment made, and MSD notified 9 Date treated as being received 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 1 2 3 End date for treating as income 4 5 6 7 8 9 Same day in the following month 10 When the date in the next calendar month does not exist, the “same” date will be the 1st of the following month. Example 5: Out-of-cycle payments – no date in the next calendar month Assume a child support payment is treated as being received on 31 August. As there is no 31 September, the same date would be 1 October. The rest of the rules for treating child support as income would apply as described above. 26 Fortnightly benefits The period of entitlement for fortnightly benefits runs from Wednesday to Tuesday for two weeks. The benefit payment is made to the beneficiary in the second week of the fortnightly period. Under the proposed amendments, when a child support payment would start to be treated as income would depend on whether the child support is treated as being received in the first week or the second week of the fortnight. As discussed under “Weekly benefits”, a payment would be treated as received on the business day after Inland Revenue notifies MSD that the payment has been made to the receiving carer. If the payment is treated as being received in the first week of a fortnight, the payment would be treated as income from the Wednesday on or before the payment is treated as being received. Example 6: Fortnightly benefits – receipt in the first week Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun Mon Tue Week 1 16 Start date for treating as income 17 18 Payment made, and MSD notified 19 20 21 Date treated as being received 22 Week 2 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 If the payment is treated as being received in the second week of a fortnight, the payment would be treated as income from the Wednesday following the date the payment is treated as being received – that is, the beginning of the next fortnight. Example 7: Fortnightly benefits – receipt in the second week Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun Mon Tue Week 1 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 Payment made, and MSD notified 27 Example 7 (continued) Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun Mon Tue Week 2 23 Date treated as being received 24 25 26 27 28 29 Week 1 (next pay period) 30 Start date for treating as income 1 2 3 4 5 6 If a person is paid their benefit fortnightly, the child support payment would be treated as income for four weeks only. The child support payment would be divided by four to get the weekly income amount. Therefore, when a child support payment is made, MSD would work out when the payment would start to be treated as income and spread the child support payment across the next two fortnightly benefits. Whether a payment is an in-cycle or out- of-cycle child support payment would not be relevant when benefits are paid fortnightly. Example 8: Fortnightly benefits Kahla receives a fortnightly benefit. One of her benefit payments is for the fortnight from 16 August to 29 August 2023. Inland Revenue makes a $400 child support payment to Kahla on 17 August. Assuming the proposals in the Bill are implemented, the payment would be treated as received on the next business day – 18 August. As the payment would be treated as received in the first week of the fortnight (16 August to 22 August), the payment would be treated as income from 16 August. The child support payment would be treated as income across two fortnight benefit periods. MSD would treat $100 as income for each week in the fortnight from 16 August to 29 August, and $100 for each week in the fortnight from 30 August to 12 September. 28 Example 8 (continued) Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun Mon Tue Week 1 16 Start date for treating as income 17 Payment made, and MSD notified 18 Date treated as being received 19 20 21 22 Week 2 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 Week 1 (next fortnight) 30 31 1 2 3 4 5 Week 2 (next fortnight) 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 End date for treating as income Transferring between different benefit frequencies When a beneficiary transfers from a weekly benefit to a fortnightly benefit, or vice-versa, the above rules may sometimes result in their benefit being abated more than intended. The Bill includes a limited discretion that would allow MSD to treat the child support payment as income over a different number of weeks. The intent is for the income to be treated as close as possible to the prescribed rules. However, sometimes a beneficiary may transfer to a benefit with a different payment frequency part way through the period. This means a child support payment could start being treated as income before the new benefit commences. In those circumstances, the beneficiary would not be paid the correct amount of benefit. MSD could not rectify the incorrect payment using the proposed discretion outlined above. The Bill therefore proposes to exempt child support payments from being included as income for benefit purposes when all of the following occur:  a beneficiary transfers from a weekly benefit to a fortnightly benefit or vice versa 29  the child support payment would be treated as being received on or after the day of the new benefit, and  the child support payment would be treated as income before the day of the new benefit. Example 9: Transferring between benefits – child support exemption Assume the proposals in the Bill are implemented, and Barry moves from a fortnightly benefit to a weekly benefit on Tuesday 17 October 2023. Inland Revenue notifies MSD of a child support payment on Thursday 19 October. The payment would be treated as received on Friday 20 October. If Barry was on a weekly benefit for the whole period, his child support income would have been treated as income from Monday 16 October. However, Barry’s weekly benefit did not begin until Tuesday 17 October, which means this child support payment would be treated as income before the day the new benefit starts. Therefore, the child support payment received by Barry would be an exempt child support payment and would not be treated as income for benefit purposes. Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun 16 Would normally treat as income start date 17 New weekly benefit begins 18 19 Payment made, and MSD notified 20 Date treated as being received 21 22 Non-information share child support payments Child support paid to UCB beneficiaries and mixed child support payments Currently, UCB excess (the amount of child support paid to the receiving carer after the cost of their benefit has been recovered) is only treated as income for supplementary assistance purposes – for example, Temporary Additional Support (TAS) and Special Benefit (SpB). This is because the cost of the UCB has been recovered by retaining child support. A “mixed child support payment” refers to when a receiving carer is paid child support and the payment is for a child for whom UCB is paid and another child for whom UCB is not paid (and so child support is not retained). It is not possible to determine the amount of the payment that relates to each child to apply different income rules to the payment. Therefore, the Bill proposes that MSD treat the entire child support payment as if it were a 30 payment in excess of the UCB payment. This treatment is to ensure the person is not negatively impacted. Because mixed child support payments are only income for some benefits, it is not appropriate to apply the proposed income rules. Example 10: Child support payments for more than one child when UCB is paid for some of those children Hayden is assessed to pay $200 a month of child support to Jess for Oliver, for whom Jess is also receiving a UCB. Hayden is also assessed to pay Jess $200 a month of child support for Liam. Jess is not receiving UCB for Liam. This month, Hayden only pays $280 instead of the full $400. Under the proposed rules, the entire child support payment would be treated as if it were excess child support paid. This means the $280 paid by Hayden would only be treated as income for determining Jess’s entitlement to TAS, SpB, and Childcare Assistance. Other non-information share child support payments Payments ordered by a Family Court and foreign child support payments will continue to be treated as income under the current income rules, which means these payments will be processed manually and MSD will have discretion over which periods to allocate these payments to. This is because the current discretionary rules are considered more appropriate for determining the relevant period for which these payments should be treated as income. 31 Use of automated electronic systems Clauses 30–31, 34, and 55–56 Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments would introduce automated decision-making, which would allow the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) to automate the process of treating child support payments as income for benefit purposes. This would ensure the rules are applied consistently, accurately, and in a timely manner and would reduce the compliance burden on beneficiaries. The Bill proposes that benefit debt would not be recovered when the debt arises from an error in the information shared by Inland Revenue or the processing of that information. Background A person receiving a benefit payment is currently required to tell MSD about any income they receive. MSD then manually determines the period for which the income affects any benefits they receive. The Bill proposes to treat child support payments passed on as income for benefit purposes. The proposals in the Bill would greatly increase the number of beneficiaries who would receive child support that would be treated as income. If child support were manually included as income, this would create a large volume of additional manual transactions for MSD to administer and a considerable compliance burden for beneficiaries. Key features The Bill proposes to automate the treatment of child support payments as income for benefit purposes. This would be achieved by Inland Revenue sharing child support information with MSD under the Approved Information Sharing Agreement between the two agencies. Automating the process of treating child support payments as income is proposed to reduce the compliance burden for beneficiaries, improve the consistency and accuracy of MSD’s administration, and ensure child support is treated as income in a timely manner. This is important to minimise the potential for debt to be incurred by families. The Bill proposes that if there is a systems failure, sudden unplanned event or error in the processing of the child support information shared between Inland Revenue and MSD, any resulting overpayment of benefit (debt) would not be recovered from the client in all cases and would be written off. This is because it would be unfair for such debts to be recoverable as they arise from errors with the information share. 32 Limited ability to review child support income Clauses 32– 33, and 35 Summary of proposed amendments The Bill proposes to remove the Ministry of Social Development’s (MSD) power to review a past benefit period for information share child support payments except in specified circumstances. Background MSD has broad powers that allow them to review a person’s benefit entitlement. This power is necessary for MSD to ensure beneficiaries receive their “full and correct entitlement”. Child support amounts assessed by Inland Revenue may change. This may be due to a change in either parent’s circumstances coming to light after the fact. Ordinarily, MSD uses their broad powers to review the receiving carer’s benefit. However, this increases income uncertainty for beneficiaries and contributes toward families incurring benefit debt. Key features The Bill proposes to limit the use of MSD’s review power for child support payments except in specified scenarios. The purpose is to ensure child support payments are almost always spread forward, which reduces the likelihood of debt, and to ensure that child support payments are treated as income in a way that best reflects money that the beneficiary has available. Example 11: Limited ability to review Elaine was receiving child support for her two children, Chloe and Claire. When Chloe left her care, Elaine did not tell Inland Revenue immediately. When she finally told Inland Revenue, her child support was recalculated from the date Chloe left her care. Elaine now has a child support debt. Despite Elaine’s child support assessment being reduced, under the proposals in the Bill, MSD would not go back and change the amount of child support that was previously treated as income for Elaine. This is because Elaine still received and had use of the amount of child support that was treated as income at the time. However, if Elaine’s circumstances result in her child support assessment being increased, the increased child support would be treated as income when it is received. MSD would not retrospectively review her benefit for periods the child support relates to. 33 The Bill sets out the following circumstances under which MSD would be able to review child support income and amend the amount that was previously treated as income:  Inland Revenue makes a payment of child support to a beneficiary, and MSD is later notified either by the beneficiary or by Inland Revenue that the beneficiary has not received the payment or not received it by the deemed date of receipt.  MSD is satisfied, in exceptional circumstances, that a person cannot access their child support payment.  An error has occurred in the administration of how a child support payment has been treated as income. These include situations where the information shared is incorrect due to Inland Revenue error; or where the information is read incorrectly by MSD’s system or was input incorrectly due to human error.  A beneficiary has been incorrectly matched or is not matched at all via the information share.  MSD receives the information shared by Inland Revenue late, or the information is provided late.  When a beneficiary has died and they receive a child support payment after their death, as a beneficiary’s benefit entitlement cannot change after they have died. This would allow MSD to amend a beneficiary’s entitlement as necessary. Example 12: Circumstances where MSD will review Barret receives $200 child support each month. One month, Inland Revenue makes a payment of child support to Barret’s bank account. However, an issue with the bank’s processes means Barret did not receive his child support. Because Inland Revenue have notified MSD of the payment, MSD treats Barret as having received income $50 per week for the next four weeks. Barret notifies MSD that he has not received his child support. Under the proposals in the Bill, after confirming that Barret has not received his child support, MSD is able to go back and remove the child support income that is on his record. Once MSD has confirmed that the payment has been processed by Barret’s bank, they will add the child support income back onto his record from when it is processed. 34 The Bill proposes that new review grounds can be added via regulations if they are identified. This would allow new scenarios to be reviewed in a timely manner. 35 Deprivation of income Clauses 47–48, and 64 Summary of proposed amendments The Bill proposes to exclude not applying for a child support arrangement or cancelling an existing child support arrangement from being considered deprivation of income for benefit purposes. Background One of the principles underlying the Social Security Act 2018 is that people should use the resources available to them before seeking financial support. When someone has changed their position to put themselves at a financial disadvantage, and this leads to them qualifying for assistance, or assistance at a higher rate, this is considered “deprivation”. Deprivation can apply regardless of whether this was intentional. When the Ministry of Social Development is satisfied that deprivation has occurred, it may refuse to grant a benefit, cancel or reduce a benefit already granted, or grant a benefit at a reduced rate. Key features The Bill proposes to remove the requirement for parents receiving a sole parent rate of main benefit to apply for child support through Inland Revenue. Therefore, a parent newly eligible for a benefit may choose not to apply. In addition, existing beneficiaries who previously had to apply for child support through Inland Revenue may choose to cancel their child support. Treating these decisions as deprivation would defeat the purpose of the proposed policies. The Bill therefore proposes to exclude the above choices from being considered deprivation. This exclusion would apply to all forms of child support, including private arrangements that Inland Revenue does not administer. This proposal is also intended to apply to income-related rent subsidies. The Bill therefore includes a proposed amendment to the Public and Community Housing Management Act 1992 to achieve this. 36 Stand downs Clause 54 Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment provides that all child support paid to a person under the Child Support Act 1991 (excluding an amount that the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) has determined is capital) would be considered when calculating the person’s stand-down period. Background Most main benefits are subject to an initial income stand-down period. The stand-down period is either one or two weeks after the date a person becomes entitled to the benefit. The period depends on the person’s circumstances and their average income determined over an “average income calculation period”. Key features The Bill proposes that all child support paid under the Child Support Act 1991 that a person receives over the relevant period would be included in their “average income” for calculating the stand-down period. This includes excess child support paid to an Unsupported Child’s Benefit beneficiary. An amount that MSD determines is capital would be excluded. 37 Cash asset test Clauses 58–61 Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments would exempt information share child support payments from being a cash asset for the period the payment is treated as income for benefit purposes. After this period, any unspent child support could be included in a cash asset test. The initial exemption period would be able to be extended by an additional 28 days in exceptional circumstances. Background The Accommodation Supplement and Temporary Additional Support are subject to a cash asset test. This means that the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) considers a person’s cash assets (such as savings) when working out their benefit entitlement. If a person has cash assets over a set threshold, they cannot receive these benefits. This test is to ensure that people use the resources available to them before receiving assistance. MSD’s current practice is generally to treat payments as a cash asset from the time they are received. Child support payments are intended to support the child for four or five weeks after they are received. Treating child support payments as a cash asset from the time they are received is incompatible with this intent. If the cash asset tests continue to apply to child support payments, receiving carers would be penalised for spending the child support payment over the period it is intended for. Key features The Bill proposes to exempt child support payments from the cash asset test for the period the payments are treated as income for benefit purposes. MSD would also have the discretion to extend this period by a further 28 days in exceptional circumstances. After the exemption expires, any unspent child support payment would be included in a cash asset test. 38 Abatement of youth and young parent payments Clause 49 Summary of proposed amendment The Bill proposes to amend the abatement regime of the youth payment (YP) and the young parent payment (YPP) so that child support passed on would abate those payments on a dollar-for-dollar basis instead of causing the recipient to lose their payment altogether. Background Currently, YP and YPP have an abatement regime where a person’s weekly income starts to abate once it exceeds a specified threshold. Once the person’s weekly income exceeds a second, higher threshold, the payments stop altogether. This is to encourage the young person to further their education or training. With the proposal to pass on child support, a receiving carer could lose their benefit if their weekly income exceeds the second threshold. Example 13: Abatement of YP and YPP Rydia is receiving YPP of $440.96 a week. Her weekly income is $298.08 per week. Her YPP is currently abated $1 for every $1 that her weekly income exceeds $258.08 (the first threshold), meaning her YPP is abated by $40. This reduces her YPP to $400.96 per week. Rydia starts receiving child support of $20 per week, and therefore her weekly income increases to $318.08. Under current rules, she would no longer be eligible for YPP as her weekly income now exceeds $308.08 (the second threshold). Key features The Bill proposes that a person would not immediately lose their YP or YPP if their weekly income exceeds the second threshold because of a child support payment passed on by Inland Revenue. Rather, the child support income would continue to abate their benefit at the rate of $1 for every $1. If a person’s income from all other sources exceeds the second threshold, they would still lose their YP or YPP. To achieve this result, income from employment and other sources would be considered against the threshold before any abatement for child support payments passed on by Inland Revenue would be undertaken. 39 Example 14: Proposed YP/YPP abatement rules for child support payments Kain has $298.08 weekly income and receives an abated YPP of $400.96 per week. Kain starts receiving child support of $20 per week and his weekly income increases to $318.08. Under the proposed abatement rules, Kain would have his YPP abated by a further $20 to $380.96 per week instead of losing his YPP altogether. However, the new abatement rules would only apply to child support payments passed on by Inland Revenue. Therefore, if Kain’s weekly income excluding any child support payments (e.g., wages) exceeded $308.08, he would lose his eligibility for YPP. 40 Child support as an allowable cost Clauses 52-53 Summary of proposed amendments The Bill proposes to treat a child support liability assessed by Inland Revenue as an “allowable cost” for determining a liable parent’s Temporary Additional Support (TAS). This proposal would also be extended to Special Benefit (SpB) by updating the Ministerial Direction. Those already receiving TAS and SpB on 1 July 2023 would be able to have these costs backdated (taken into account) to the later of 1 July or the date they become liable for child support. They would have to apply before 30 September 2023 to have the costs backdated. Background SpB is a form of hardship assistance that was replaced by TAS in 2006. TAS is a form of hardship assistance paid to people who do not have enough income to meet their “essential costs”. Essential costs are made up of a person’s “allowable costs” and “standard costs”. Allowable costs are regular, essential, and unavoidable expenses that cannot be reduced. Beneficiaries assessed by Inland Revenue to pay child support are required to have the child support directly deducted from their main benefit or pension. Child support liability assessed by Inland Revenue has the attributes of a regular, essential, and unavoidable cost and should therefore be an allowable cost. Key features The Bill proposes to allow the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) to consider formula- assessed child support liabilities as an allowable cost when determining a liable parent’s entitlement to TAS. This proposal does not extend to other child support arrangements (such as voluntary agreements or private arrangements) as they do not meet MSD’s standard of “regular, essential, and unavoidable”. The proposed amendments in the Bill only apply to TAS. However, the proposed rules are intended to apply to both TAS and SpB. It is therefore proposed to update the Ministerial Direction for SpB to achieve this. Backdating The proposal to include child support as an allowable cost is expected to result in an influx of calls from beneficiaries from 1 July 2023. There is a concern that beneficiaries may be disadvantaged if they cannot contact MSD as soon as they are eligible as allowable costs cannot normally be backdated. 41 Therefore, the Bill further proposes to temporarily allow MSD to backdate child support liabilities as an allowable cost for people who are already receiving TAS or SpB on 1 July 2023. It is expected that this would also spread the administrative impact on MSD. Under the proposal, existing MSD beneficiaries would be able to backdate their child support liability to 1 July 2023 or the date on which they become liable to pay child support – whichever is later. To backdate their child support costs, these beneficiaries would have to apply to MSD on or before 29 September 2023. 42 Redundant provisions Clauses 21–23, 25–28, and 65 Summary of proposed amendments The Bill proposes to repeal the following provisions that are no longer required:  the prescribed forms and other rules relating to urgent maintenance orders in the Child Support Rules 1992 and Family Court Rules 2002, and  schedule 2 of the Public and Community Housing Management Act 1992. Background The Child Support Amendment Act 2021 repealed the provision of the Child Support Act 1991 that allowed a person to apply to the Family Court for an urgent maintenance order if they had made an application for child support to Inland Revenue, but child support had not yet been assessed. This provision was originally included in the Child Support Act 1991 to cover the transition when child support moved to Inland Revenue in case there were unforeseen circumstances that meant Inland Revenue was unable to assess child support. However, the prescribed forms and other rules relating to urgent maintenance orders in the Child Support Rules 1992 and Family Court Rules 2002 were not repealed at the same time as the provision. The Bill proposes to repeal these forms and other rules as they are redundant. In addition, schedule 2 of the Public and Community Housing Management Act 1992 was a transitional arrangement that has been replaced by regulations in the Public and Community Housing Management (Prescribed Elements of Calculation Mechanism) Regulations 2018 and is no longer operative. The Bill therefore proposes to repeal schedule 2.

“digital economy”. The digital economy refers to economic activity that is significantly reliant on information and communication technology. 1 There has been significant international concern over the under-taxation of the digital economy, and digital multinational enterprises in particular. This under-taxation is mostly caused by deficiencies in the current international tax rules, which have not kept up with digitalisation and other modern business developments. The digital economy provides many benefits to New Zealanders, and it is an important source of future economic growth. However, its under-taxation impacts the sustainability of Government revenues and the fairness of the tax system. It also distorts investment in favour of digital multinationals, which pay lower worldwide income tax compared with other industries. The Government is committed to ensuring everyone pays their fair share of tax, including digital multinationals. Achieving this will require changes to the current tax rules. In June 2019, the Government issued a discussion document: Options for taxing the digital economy 2 (the discussion document). In the discussion document, the Government outlined two options for taxing the digital economy:  New Zealand’s preferred option is to change the current international income tax rules, (usually referred to as the “international tax framework”) via an internationally agreed solution. Jurisdictions, including New Zealand, have been discussing different ways of achieving this via the Inclusive Framework, led by the Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development (OECD).  The other option is to apply a unilateral DST to certain digital activities. A DST taxes, at a low rate, the gross revenue attributable to a jurisdiction received by certain highly digitalised businesses. While the Government remains committed to an internationally agreed solution, it wishes to introduce a DST Bill so it can be ready to quickly impose a DST if jurisdictions cannot make sufficient progress towards implementing the OECD solution. The DST Bill proposes that the DST commences on 1 January 2025. However, the Government can defer the commencement date for up to five years through Orders in Council. The Government’s intention is that this commencement date would be deferred if sufficient progress is made 1 Refer to OECD (2018), Tax Challenges Arising from Digitalisation – Interim Report 2018: Inclusive Framework on BEPS, OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project, OECD Publishing, Paris, for more information on the digital economy, its business models, and key features. 2 Options for taxing the digital economy (ird.govt.nz) Date: August 2023 7 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] on implementing an acceptable global solution. Once such a solution was in place, the intention is to ask Parliament to repeal the Act. Accordingly, this Bill does not represent a definitive commitment to impose a DST. The measures proposed in this Bill will provide the legislative framework for a DST in order to address the issue of adequately taxing the digital economy. The DST proposed in this Bill (the New Zealand DST) is a flat tax charged at 3% on a group’s gross revenue attributable to New Zealand from in-scope activities. It is levied at the group level and regardless of the legal separation of the various group members. The application of the New Zealand DST to a group involves these steps:  Determine if the DST applies to the group. The DST would apply if: o Step 1 – one of the group’s business services includes any of the activities defined to be taxable digital services; and o Step 2 – the group’s global revenue from in-scope activities exceeds €750 million per year.  If the DST applies, the group would calculate and pay its DST liability. This would involve these further steps: o Step 3 – the group determines the amount of its revenues that are attributable to New Zealand users or New Zealand land from its in-scope activities; o Step 4 – the group calculates the DST on those attributable revenues at the rate of 3%. However, the DST would be nil if the group’s digital services revenue attributable to New Zealand is less than $3.5 million per year; and o Step 5 – the group returns and pays the DST to Inland Revenue by the due date. Summary of key features Taxable digital services The New Zealand DST is intended to apply to services resulting from digital business activities that can be scaled up without a physical presence in New Zealand, and whose value is dependent on the size and active contribution of their user base (although these are not specific requirements of the Bill). The Bill deems these in-scope activities as taxable digital services and are defined by reference to specific business models. These core taxable digital services are:  intermediation platforms  social media and content sharing platforms, and Date: August 2023 8 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\]  internet search engines. An activity that is incidental to an in-scope activity will also be a taxable digital service. To provide certainty, the Bill also details activities or services that are out of scope of the New Zealand DST. Digital services revenue All revenue that is connected to a taxable digital service is digital service revenue for the purposes of the New Zealand DST. For example, it would apply to revenue from advertising provided through social media platforms and search engines, and commissions charged on transactions carried out through intermediation platforms. The revenue is the gross amount received, without any deduction for expenses. This reflects the fact that a DST is charged on the supply of the relevant services. It is not charged on the profit made by the supplier for those services. Digital services group A digital services group is a group of all the companies included in the consolidated financial statements of an ultimate parent entity. Where an ultimate parent entity does not prepare consolidated financial statements, a digital services group is defined on the basis of deemed consolidation as if that ultimate parent entity did prepare consolidated financial statements. A digital services group would be liable for DST where the revenue of the consolidated accounting group satisfies the global threshold. This is where global revenue from taxable digital services is €750 million or more for the revenue year. Calculating the DST liability The DST would be paid on the revenues attributable to New Zealand users or New Zealand land at a rate of 3% if those revenues total $3.5 million or more per year. Background The New Zealand DST proposed in this Bill is designed to ensure digital businesses pay tax reflecting the value they derive from New Zealand users. It is a response to problems with the current international income tax framework. Under the current framework (formed by our double tax agreements (DTAs) and related OECD guidance) a non-resident’s business income is only taxable in New Zealand if:  the non-resident has a sufficient taxable presence in New Zealand; and Date: August 2023 9 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\]  some of the multinational’s profit is attributable to that taxable presence. For a non-resident entity to have a taxable presence, it must operate in New Zealand either through a New Zealand resident subsidiary (in which case the subsidiary is taxable on its income) or through a permanent establishment (PE) of a non-resident group member. For a PE to exist, the non-resident must have some kind of physical presence in New Zealand, for example, through a fixed place of business, or a dependent agent that enters into contracts on its behalf. T his is generally referred to as the nexus requirement. If a non-resident does have a PE in New Zealand, then under our DTAs New Zealand can only tax the income that is attributable to that PE. Most jurisdictions follow detailed guidelines published by the OECD on how to attribute income to a PE. The guidelines aim to attribute income to a PE by reference to the value generated by the non-resident through that PE, compared to the value it generates overseas. To do this, the guidelines generally look at the assets of the PE and the activities carried on through the PE by its personnel. The effect of this is that a non-resident’s business income is only taxable in New Zealand under our DTAs to the extent the non-resident has assets or personnel here. If the non-resident has no assets or personnel here, they are not taxable on their New Zealand income. These are referred to as the profit allocation rules. While the rules limit New Zealand’s ability to tax non-residents that do business here, they also benefit New Zealand by limiting the rights of other jurisdictions to tax New Zealanders that do business in those jurisdictions. Since these nexus and profit allocation rules are contained in New Zealand’s DTAs, the Government cannot change them unilaterally – it would require the consent of the other jurisdictions that are party to these DTAs. In addition, the nexus and profit allocation rules in most DTAs are based on a common standard published by the OECD or the United Nations, which in turn reflect a consensus on international taxation established nearly a century ago. It would be difficult to fundamentally diverge from these nexus or profit allocation standards in our DTAs (although most DTAs diverge in some less significant respects). Policy issue The main problem with this international tax framework is that it was established nearly a century ago and has not kept up with modern business practices. The digitalisation of the economy now means that a non-resident company can be significantly involved in the economic life of New Zealand without being subject to income tax here. The OECD has identified that this issue is caused by three main factors: Scale without mass – Digital companies can transact with customers over the internet without having the physical presence (ie, a PE) required by the international tax framework for income tax to be charged in the users’ or customers’ jurisdiction. This is a problem for both the nexus and the profit allocation rules – even if the digital company was deemed to Date: August 2023 10 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] have a PE in the jurisdiction, the lack of activities carried out in the jurisdiction by the multinational means there would be no profit to attribute to that PE. User value creation – Even where a digital company does have a PE, the profit allocation rules do not recognise the new kinds of value that digital companies can generate in their market jurisdictions. Digital companies can derive significant value from the active participation of their users, from data generated by the users and from network effects. None of this value is recognised by the current profit allocation rules. Intangible assets – Much of the value of digital companies can be attributed to intangible assets, such as trademarks and other intellectual property. These intangibles are hard to value. They are also mobile, meaning the income attributable to them can be easily moved to low tax jurisdictions. While not all these issues with the international tax framework are limited to digital companies, they are all exacerbated by digitalisation. The problems with the international tax framework in relation to user value creation and scale without mass are particularly acute for digital companies. For this reason, the DST proposed in this Bill is aimed at certain highly digitalised business activities or services that generate significant value from active user participation and network effects. This follows the approach of other jurisdictions that have adopted a DST.

Background While the Government remains committed to a multilateral solution to the problem of taxing highly digitalised businesses, it also wants to be prepared if the multilateral solution takes an unacceptable amount of time to implement or otherwise fails to take effect in practice. Providing for a flexible commencement date balances the need to provide certainty for taxpayers while allowing the Government to quickly react to changing circumstances, including progress at the OECD, the actions of similarly situated jurisdictions and the overall international context. Detailed analysis If enacted, the DST Bill will commence on 1 January 2025. This date may be deferred by Order(s) in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Revenue. Constitutional best practice requires limitations on the ability of the Executive to alter the will of Parliament. This means the DST Bill cannot propose an unlimited ability to defer the application date by Order(s) in Council. Consequently, a backstop commencement date is necessary. To conform with best practice, the DST Bill must commence by 1 January 2030. This five-year backstop would allow the Government a reasonable length of time to defer the imposition of the DST and repeal the DST in favour of a satisfactory multilateral solution. The DST would be imposed for DST revenue years starting on or after the 1 January that follows the commencement date – this would be 1 January 2030 at the latest.

Background Digital businesses generate significant value from the active participation of their users, from data generated by the users, and from network effects. None of this value is recognised by the current income tax profit allocation rules. The New Zealand DST would address this issue by taxing the services or activities provided by businesses whose value is dependent on the size and active contribution of their user base (although this is not part of the legislative test). Detailed analysis The Bill provides a list of the types of business activities or services that would be within scope of the New Zealand DST. Clause 11(1) defines these in-scope activities or services as “taxable digital services”. The core categories of taxable digital services are detailed in clause 11(1)(a)–(c) and are the provision of: (a) an intermediation platform (b) a social media and content sharing platform, and (c) an internet search engine. In addition to these categories, clause 11(1 )(d)–(f) also details activities that are deemed to be taxable digital services where there is a nexus or connection with a taxable digital service. These are as follows:  advertising on, linked to, connected with, or facilitated by, a platform or engine detailed above in (a)–(c)  activities in relation to user-generated data, gathered in connection with a platform, engine, or advertising described above in (a)–(c), and Date: August 2023 15 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\]  any activity carried on, that is incidental to a platform, engine, or advertising described above in (a)–( c). Online platform Under clause 5 of the Bill, an online platform means a website, application or any other electronic medium through which data or digital content is collected, viewed, consumed, delivered or interacted with. This definition is intended to reflect the ordinary meaning of online platform. Intermediation platform An intermediation platform is defined in clause 5 of the Bill. When interpreting this definition businesses should consider whether:  the platform is an online platform (as detailed above)  the platform facilitates the sale by users of goods or services to other third-party users, and  a main purpose of the platform is to facilitate the sale of goods or services offered by third party users. If all three conditions are met, then a business is providing an intermediation platform. Facilitation of the sale of goods or services between users This condition will be satisfied when the online platform enables users to sell or advertise goods or services to third party users. This does not include e-commerce retailers or online sales directly to users. It is limited to situations where the online platform’s business acts as an intermediary between users. In other words, it only captures platforms that provide an intermediation service for users to sell their own goods or services to other third-party users including platforms that facilitate peer to peer transactions (such as peer to peer gambling). Goods and services have the same meaning as that in the Goods and Services Act 1985. Therefore, it will capture most of the items or services listed by users on online platforms. This includes transportation and accommodation services. The types of business models covered are intended to be wide and it is irrelevant whether:  the platform facilitates transactions between business to business, business to consumer or consumer to consumer (including peer to peer)  the platform facilitates the final transaction (ie, payment and delivery) on its online platform or where the platform service is limited to allowing users to advertise goods or services for sale between themselves, or Date: August 2023 16 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\]  the platform is merely an intermediary for users or if it also regulates the platform’s content and/or offers significant value adding services like delivery. Example 1 Barter Us allows users to list secondhand goods for sale on an online platform and charges a fixed listing fee for each item. Interested parties then contact the seller through the platform’s communication channel. If a sale and purchase is concluded, the users arrange payment and collection. The payment and collection of the goods is independent of Barter Us because the platform does not provide this service. Barter Us meets the second condition for being an intermediation platform because it enables users to list goods for sale to other third-party users. A main purpose of the platform This condition will be satisfied when a main purpose of the online platform is to enable or facilitate the sale of goods or services between users. This condition is intended to exclude businesses that do not actively facilitate the sale of goods or services between users but instead displays advertising on their websites as part of their ordinary course of business. Example 2 Xtreme Fishin’ provides a quarterly digital magazine to its audience of recreational game fishers. One of the revenue sources for the magazine is advertisements. Xtreme Fishin’ would not meet the definition of an intermediation platform because it does not actively promote or facilitate the exchange of goods or services between users as a main purpose. Xtreme Fishin’s main purpose is to provide a digital magazine. Social media and content sharing platform A social media and content sharing platform is defined in clause 5 of the Bill. When interpreting this definition, businesses should consider whether:  the platform is an online platform, and  a main purpose of the platform is to promote interaction or facilitate the sharing of content between users.

The meaning of user interaction or sharing of content is intended to be wide and includes:  users joining and creating networks  communicating with other users  organising events or meet-ups with other user.; and  posting or displaying content for other users. While “content” has not been defined in the Bill, it is intended to have a wide meaning and includes text and media content such as images, videos or audio. The content shared by users does not need to be user generated and can originate from a third party. A main purpose of the platform This condition would be satisfied when a main purpose of the online platform is to promote interaction or facilitate the sharing of content between users. This will be determined by reference to the facts and circumstances of the online platform. However, the following indicators may be useful in showing that the promotion of interaction or sharing of content between users is a main purpose of the platform:  the value of the business is highly dependent on the number of users engaged on the platform  interaction with other users is a key factor in retaining existing users and attracting new users, or  the business spends resources researching user behaviour and network effects. Example 3 Network Us is an online platform that actively encourages users to join or create public networks and interact with other users. The large number of users on Network Us is a key reason in retaining existing users and attracting new users. Network Us is a social media and content sharing platform because:  it promotes user interaction by encouraging users to engage in user networks, and Date: August 2023 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\]  one of its main purposes is to promote user interaction as indicated by the value of Network Us being dependent on user interaction. Example 4 Inflowenz is an online platform that allows users to share videos on its platform. The large number of users on Inflowenz is a key reason in retaining existing users and attracting new users. Inflowenz is a social media and content sharing platform because:  it facilitates the sharing of content between users, and  one of its main purposes is to facilitate the sharing of content between users as indicated by the value of Inflowenz being dependent on the number of users on the platform. Internet search engine An internet search engine is defined in the Bill as an online platform that allows users to search the internet for digital content of multiple unrelated websites. Internal search functions Websites that provide a search function to allow users to navigate information solely on that website, rather than providing links to third party websites, are not included in the definition of an internet search engine. These search functions are not a distinct activity from the rest of the website or business but rather are an incidental activity that helps to support the main business activity. An internal search function would not fall within the ordinary understanding of an internet search engine business in any case. A search engine business will in principle search the whole of the internet and will continuously collect data to improve the performance of the search engine. In contrast, an internal search function exists primarily to enable the user to find content on a particular website. There may be situations where a website’s search function displays search results from third- party websites. Generally, the underlying search technology is provided by a third-party rather than the website owner. In those situations, it is the third-party search technology provider, rather than the website owner, that is providing an internet search engine and thus performing a taxable digital service.

The advertising function is not in itself a separate taxable digital service but rather it forms part of the underlying in-scope activity to which it is connected. This reflects the fact that advertising generally forms one of the main revenue streams in digital business models and therefore needs to be included within the New Zealand DST. To capture these revenue streams, the scope of advertising is deliberately broad and is intended to capture the full range of services in the advertising supply process, apply irrespective of the form of advertising, and disregard whether the advertising is highly targeted to a specific type of user or to a broader audience. Example 5 Network Us provides a social media and content sharing platform. It allows users to access the platform free of charge and generates its revenue from selling advertisement slots to third parties that are displayed to users on its platform. Network Us facilitates the display of online advertising because it sells advertising space on its platform to third parties. The revenue it generates from these advertising space sales is the only revenue source for the business. Therefore, the online advertising activity of Network Us would form part of its taxable digital services. User-generated data Digitalised businesses can gather a considerable amount of data based on a user’s profile, their interaction with the digital interface and through passive monitoring (eg, user location tracked through mobile geolocation data). This data can result in useful information that can be used by the business or aggregated and sold or licensed to third parties for exploitation in their own businesses. Because user-generated data can give rise to an important revenue stream for some digitalised businesses, the gathering of such data in connection with an intermediation platform, social media and content sharing platform, or internet search engine, or advertising with a link to these digital activities, is deemed to be a taxable digital service under clause 11(1)(e) of the Bill.

An activity is incidental to a taxable digital service if the activity would not have occurred but for the business carrying on a main purpose of providing the taxable digital service. The GST principles of incidental supplies provide analogous analysis to this concept of incidental activity. This test is further described below in relation to clause 11(2)(a). Example 6 Pōhutukawa is an intermediation platform that provides an optional delivery service users can access as part of facilitating the sale and purchase of goods between users. This is incidental to providing the intermediation platform because Pōhutukawa would not have carried on a delivery service if it was not also providing the intermediation platform and providing the intermediation service is the main purpose of the platform. Therefore, the delivery function is considered to be part of the taxable digital service of providing an intermediation platform.

Background The New Zealand DST proposed in this Bill is targeted at highly digitalised activities or services that generate significant value from active user participation. To provide certainty for businesses, the Bill details activities that are specifically excluded from being within scope of the New Zealand DST. Digital activities or services have generally been excluded because the business model does not generate significant value from active user participation or network effects. Detailed analysis The DST proposed in this Bill would be narrowly targeted at certain highly digitalised business models. In particular, it is focused on business models that derive significant value from active user participation. Clause 11(2 )(a)–(c) of the Bill specifically excludes the following activities or services from the meaning of taxable digital services:  a taxable digital service detailed in clause 11(1) of the Bill where the activity is merely incidental to a supply of goods and services that is not a taxable digital service  online financial marketplace activities that are supervised or regulated under specified New Zealand laws (Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013, Financial Markets Authority Act 2011, Financial Service Providers (Registration and Dispute Resolution) Act 2008 or Banking (Prudential Supervision) Act 1989) or are supervised or regulated under corresponding legislation in another jurisdiction, and  loyalty programme online platforms. The list in clause 11(2) is intended to provide certainty for businesses where it not clear whether the activities or services they provide may satisfy one of the definitions of taxable digital services in clause 11(1).

In determining whether an activity is merely incidental to an out-of-scope activity, a business may consider the following:  Does the activity generate significant value for the business?  Do users or customers engage with the business primarily for the purpose of accessing the activity?  If the business no longer provided or facilitated the activity, would people continue to engage with the business?  Would it be viable for the business to provide the activity as an independent offering? Ultimately, whether an activity is merely incidental to an out-of-scope activity will depend on the particular facts and circumstances of each business. Example 7 Content Printing publishes news articles in both a digital and printed form. The digital format allows people to leave comments under articles and interact with each other. People primarily access the website to view news stories and Content Printing generates value from this facility. While allowing users to post comments on the website has elements of a social media platform, this activity would be considered merely incidental to Content Printing’s main purpose of publishing news articles (which is an out-of-scope activity). People do not primarily access the digital platform to interact with users and Content Printing could continue to operate its business without this functionality. Financial marketplace activities Clause 11(2)(b) of the Bill excludes online financial marketplace activities that are supervised or regulated under specific New Zealand legislation, or the corresponding legislation in another jurisdiction. These activities are all related to markets and financial services. This exclusion reflects that such activities are regulated industries that undertake activities akin to the direct sale of services. The fact that these activities have shifted to digital platforms over time as a more efficient means for participants to trade is therefore not considered an activity that should be captured by the New Zealand DST.

Loyalty programmes Clause 11(2)( c) of the Bill excludes loyalty programmes accessed via online platforms from being within the definition of taxable digital services where it is part of a digital services group and incidental to the supply of goods and services. Loyalty programmes of this nature are generally a marketing strategy designed to encourage customers to continue to shop at or use the services of a business associated with the programme. Value derived from loyalty programmes that are incidental to the supply of goods and services is not connected with users but rather the underlying business service to which the loyalty programme relates. Other exclusions Clause 11(2) of the Bill does not explicitly exclude the following activities or services, but they are intended to be out of scope of the New Zealand DST. E- commerce E- commerce or online sales generally (including the online sale of digital content such as software or music directly by the provider) are not within the meaning of taxable digital services. The value that businesses generate by selling goods or services via e-commerce is not linked to user-generated value. Businesses are not relying on user participation to sell their goods or services online but use the platform to market to a customer base and generate sales revenue. E- commerce would not come within the definition of an intermediation platform in clause 5 of the Bill because businesses are originating the sale of goods and services rather than facilitating transactions between users. Example 8 Victory Co manufactures sporting products and sells these goods on its e-commerce platform. This service would not be a taxable digital service and thus out of scope of the New Zealand DST.

These business models are not relying on user participation to generate significant value. Whether a content provision service has a large number of users on the platform is irrelevant because it is the content available on the platform that is the key factor in attracting and retaining users. The provision of online content would not come within the definition of social media and content sharing platform in clause 5 of the Bill because it is the business providing the content to consumers on its platform, not users sharing it with other users. Television and radio broadcasting Where television or radio content is made available online this would be considered to be the provision of online content (discussed above). This exclusion is consistent with the principle for excluding business models from the DST that do not derive significant value from user interaction.

Background The New Zealand DST proposed in this Bill is targeted at highly digitalised activities or services defined as “taxable digital services”. Therefore, the revenues the DST is levied on would be the revenues that result from the supply of in-scope taxable digital services. Key features A digital services group would need to determine its global revenue from activities or services provided to New Zealand users or connected to New Zealand land. The Bill proposes that group revenue is calculated on a consolidated basis to determine whether the group is subject to the New Zealand DST. These revenues are termed digital services revenue and consist of all the revenues that arise in connection with a taxable digital service. Revenue for the purposes of the New Zealand DST is the gross revenue before any expenses, losses or other deductions. Digital services groups would use the gross revenue figures that are recognised in their consolidated financial statements for the period. Where there is a connection between a revenue stream and a taxable digital service, then the revenue is taxable digital services revenue no matter how it is described. Whether a revenue stream is connected to the taxable digital service depends on the particular facts and circumstances of the business. If the group carries on both taxable digital services and out-of-scope business activities, then only the revenue from taxable digital services would be included. Accordingly, the group would need to apportion its total revenues between in-scope taxable digital services and out-of-scope activities. Any apportionment made would need to be done on a fair and reasonable basis.

A deduction for expenses, losses or other items is not permitted in the calculation of taxable revenue. Revenue is intended to mean the gross amount received before deductions, as recognised in the digital services group’s consolidated financial accounts prepared in accordance with acceptable accounting standards or principles (this is further explained in the Digital Services Group section of this commentary). This reflects that the DST proposed in this Bill is charged on the supply of the relevant services not on the profit made by the supplier of those services, and that using gross revenue figures recognised in the groups consolidated financial accounts will reduce compliance costs. Connection with a taxable digital service For revenue to be taxable digital service revenue it must arise in connection with a taxable digital service. Where this required connection occurs, it is taxable digital services revenue no matter how it is described by a business. This is intended to protect against arrangements that may attempt to artificially split out the revenue stream from the underlying taxable digital service. Ultimately, whether a revenue stream is connected to a taxable digital service would depend on the particular facts and circumstances of the business. However, some key factors to consider are:  whether the revenues would have been earned without the business supplying the taxable digital service, and  the degree to which the revenues are connected to the user base, service or data the platform or engine provides or collects from users. For most businesses, it should be clear whether a revenue stream is connected to a taxable digital service. Digital services revenue from in-scope activities The detail below provides guidance and specific examples about the types of revenues that are connected to taxable digital services. The situations where revenue is connected with taxable digital services is intended to be broad and capture the range of approaches that are used to monetise value from user activity. It therefore includes advertising revenue and amounts from the sale or licensing of user data collected in connection with a taxable digital service (clause 11(1)(d) and (e) of the Bill).

Intermediation platform Revenues that arise in connection with intermediation platforms typically include:  commission fees received for facilitating transactions between users  delivery fees  fees to access or otherwise buy and sell goods and services listed on the platform  fees from advertising products to users of the platform, either by preferential search listings or display advertising  general advertising on the platform, and  subscription fees to access the platform’s services. Importantly, it is not the purchase price of the good or service transacted between users that is digital services revenue. Instead, it is the revenue that the intermediation platform itself earns for facilitating the transaction. Social media and content sharing platforms Revenues that arise in connection with social media and content sharing platforms typically include:  fees for displaying advertising to users of the platform  subscription or other access fees from users of the platform  fees charged to users to access specific content on the platform  other direct fees from users of the platform, and  income from the sale/licensing of user data. Internet search engines Revenues that arise in connection with internet search engines typically include:  fees charged for advertising on the group’s search engine results  fees charged for advertising that is shown by the search engine on third-party websites  other search advertising revenues, and Date: August 2023 29 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\]  income from the sale/licensing of user data. Carrying on multiple taxable digital services Where a business carries on more than one taxable digital service, the revenues in connection with those activities should all be included in the group’s total taxable digital services revenue. Apportionment between taxable digital services and out-of-scope activities If the group carries on both taxable digital services and out-of-scope business activities, then only the revenue that is connected to taxable digital services needs be included in the group’s total taxable digital services revenue. Accordingly, a group may need to apportion its total revenues between in-scope taxable digital services (including incidental activities) and out-of-scope activities. Any apportionment should be done on a fair and reasonable basis. Whether an apportionment is fair and reasonable will depend on the particular facts and circumstances of the business activities and the revenues concerned. A fair and reasonable apportionment should be based on the information available to the business and reflect what an objective and informed person would consider to be fair and reasonable in light of that information. Any method chosen should reflect the relative contribution of the activity, or activities, to the wider business. Example 9 Now Switch runs an intermediation platform (an in-scope activity for a DST) and a separate digital magazine service (an out-of-scope activity for a DST). Users are charged a single subscription fee to access the intermediation platform and digital magazine service. Most of Now Switch’s other revenue is generated from advertising on both the platform and digital magazine. In total 70% of the advertising revenue comes from the intermediation platform and 30% from the digital magazine. Accordingly, 70% of the advertising revenue relates to an in-scope activity and will be included in the group’s taxable digital services revenue.

These criteria are applied to a “digital services group” and are calculated based on the revenue recognised in the multinational’s consolidated financial statements. Background A DST needs to have meaningful thresholds below which it does not apply. This is intended to reduce compliance and administrative costs and reduce its impact on start-ups and small businesses (which, for example, may be loss-making). The OECD guidelines on a DST recommended two separate thresholds: 3  A threshold based on the size of the group. For this purpose, the OECD suggested the current threshold for country-by-c ountry reporting, which is €750 million of consolidated annual turnover.  A threshold based on the amount of the digital group’s global revenue that is attributable to the jurisdiction’s users. The design of the New Zealand DST proposed in this Bill has taken these guidelines into account when setting the global threshold and country-specific exception. The global threshold has been set in line with the OECD’s guideline of €750 million of annual consolidated revenue. However, the New Zealand DST’s global threshold requires the €750 million of annual revenue to be generated from in-scope taxable digital services (in common with the DSTs adopted by France and the United Kingdom). This is to ensure that the DST is targeted at mature digital services businesses that are more likely to benefit from the deficiencies in the international tax framework. A multinational business would be liable for the proposed DST if it meets the global threshold. However, the group’s DST liability in a revenue year would be nil if it qualifies for the country-specific exception. The country-specific exception of $3.5 million per annum is roughly proportionate to other jurisdictions that have adopted a DST given the different 3 OECD (2018), Tax Challenges Arising from Digitalisation – Interim Report 2018: Inclusive Framework on BEPS, OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project, OECD Publishing, Paris.

This exception is discussed in more detail in the Calculation and payment of the DST liability section of this Bill commentary. Detailed analysis Clause 5 of the Bill introduces the term “digital services group”. The term is defined as meaning a group of persons consisting of all persons that are included in the consolidated financial statements of an ultimate parent entity if those financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting practice (GAAP). If the ultimate parent entity does not file consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, the digital services group would comprise all persons that would be included if the ultimate parent entity had to prepare GAAP-compliant consolidated financial statements. This deeming provision is proposed as an integrity measure to ensure otherwise comparable groups are viewed similarly to ensure that the global revenue threshold has its intended effect. Ultimate parent entity The term “ultimate parent entity” is defined in clause 5 as a person that owns, directly or indirectly, a controlling interest in any other person and is not owned, directly or indirectly, by another person with a controlling interest. Generally accepted accounting practice “Generally accepted accounting practice” is defined in clause 5 as:  International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), or  other country-specific generally accepted accounting principles relevant to publicly traded entities outside New Zealand that require two or more entities to prepare consolidated financial statements in a similar manner to IFRS. The tax will primarily affect digital services groups with limited to no presence in New Zealand, so a broad definition of generally accepted accounting practice has been adopted to minimise compliance costs. DST revenue year The term “DST revenue year” is a relevant accounting period under GAAP for a group or entity and is defined in clause 5 of the Bill.

Background One of the guidelines the OECD recommended for jurisdictions adopting a DST to consider was balancing the underlying policy objective of trying to address the rapidly emerging challenges raised by the digitalisation of the economy while also mitigating over-taxation as much as possible. 4 It noted that implementing a low rate of tax that was proportionate to the profit margins was an important factor in achieving this balance. The design of the New Zealand DST proposed in the Bill has taken this guideline into account with the tax being charged at a low rate of 3%. This rate is also in line with other jurisdictions that have adopted a DST. France, Italy and Spain have a 3% rate while the United Kingdom and India have a 2% rate, and Turkey has a higher 7.5% rate. In line with the OECD’s guideline to include a country-specific threshold to determine whether a group is liable for DST, a group’s DST liability for a revenue year is nil if their total digital services revenue attributable to New Zealand is below $3.5 million in that year. Detailed analysis If a group is a digital services group after satisfying the global revenue threshold, it would then calculate its DST liability. Clause 7 of the Bill provides that DST liability is calculated by charging the DST at a rate of 3% on the group’s digital services revenue for a DST revenue year. This would require the group to ascertain the revenues attributable to:  New Zealand users, if the revenues arise from the use of a taxable digital service by a user normally located in New Zealand. 4 OECD (2018), Tax Challenges Arising from Digitalisation – Interim Report 2018: Inclusive Framework on BEPS, OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project, OECD Publishing, Paris.

Clause 9 of the Bill proposes an exception whereby a group’s DST liability is nil if its taxable digital services revenue for New Zealand tax purposes totals less than $3.5 million for that DST revenue year. Example 10 ExchangeMe Group has €1 billion of global taxable digital services revenue from an intermediation platform. Of the global taxable digital services revenue, $100 million of revenue is connected to New Zealand users. ExchangeMe Group’s total New Zealand DST would be $3 million, calculated by charging the 3% DST on the $100 million of taxable digital services revenue connected to New Zealand users. Currency Clause 6 of the Bill outlines that for the purposes of the Bill, other than clause 8, all non-New Zealand dollar amounts would have to be converted to New Zealand dollars. An amount would have to be converted by applying the close of trading spot exchange rate on the date the amount is required to be measured or calculated. However, if the amount relates to a period, the amount would be able to be converted by applying the average of the close of trading spot exchange rate for the 15 th day of each complete month that falls in the relevant period. Connected to New Zealand users Digital services revenue (defined in clause 10 of this Bill) means all the revenues that arise in connection with a taxable digital service (defined in clause 11(1) of this Bill). This concept is explained in detail above in the Digital Services Revenue section of this Bill commentary. This revenue arises from New Zealand users if the taxable digital service that generates that revenue is used by a “user” that is normally located in New Zealand. Meaning of user While there is no definition of “New Zealand user” in the Bill, it is intended to mean anyone (including both individuals and legal persons) who used the platform or service. Whether someone has used the platform or service would depend upon the underlying taxable digital service.

This will be the case for taxable digital services revenues that are derived from advertising where the user will be the person that views the advertisement. In other cases, there could be multiple users in a transaction. This will be the case for revenues attributable to specific transactions facilitated between parties on an intermediation platform (eg, commission fees, delivery fees) where the different parties to the transaction are all users. For the purposes of determining a user in the context of an intermediation platform, there is no distinction between a “buyer” or “seller”. This is because both sides of the transaction are users of the intermediation platform, which derives value from having high volumes of users willing to exchange goods or services. It also avoids potential difficulties identifying which user is formally charged a fee or other amount as part of a transaction. New Zealand user An important feature of the DST is the connection between revenues and the value provided by users in New Zealand. Concepts such as tax residency can be difficult for a digital services group to determine for users of its taxable digital services. Accordingly, clause 12 of the Bill identifies a New Zealand user as a person that is normally located in New Zealand, as evidenced by various indicators that the digital services group may collate in the course of user registration or user interaction with the platform or search engine. The indicators listed in clause 12 of the Bill are as follows:  the person’s billing address  the person’s delivery or shipping address  the internet protocol address of the device used by the person  the person’s bank details, including the account the person uses for payment or the billing address held by the bank  the person’s phone number area code, or country calling code  global satellite positioning data on the person or another geolocation method  other information considered relevant by the Commissioner  an indicator agreed to with a member of the digital services group in writing by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. These indicators are provided to help businesses identify whether a user of their taxable digital services is normally located in New Zealand, rather than whether a user is in New Zealand at the time the taxable digital service is used.

Vice versa this approach may result in foreign users that use a platform, service or engine while they visit New Zealand not being considered New Zealand users because they are not normally located in New Zealand. The indicators are intended to clarify who could be a New Zealand user and therefore lower the cost of ascertaining where the user is based. Requiring greater accuracy would increase compliance costs. Importantly the Bill allows businesses to use other relevant information held as an indicator of whether a user is normally located in New Zealand. Any indicator used must be reasonable and will depend upon a business’s unique circumstances. The Bill also allows businesses to use an indicator agreed to with the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to determine whether a user is normally located in New Zealand. This is intended to provide a business using an unspecified indicator with certainty. Whether a business decides to exercise this option will depend on its own circumstances, resources available and comfort with relying on an unspecified indicator. These rules are intended to provide flexibility for groups because the information available to different businesses varies and may change due to changes in technology and new business models. Compliance costs are reduced when a business can use information that it routinely collects through its normal process rather having to request additional information from its users for tax purposes. Example 11 Kātata provides an online dating platform that satisfies the social media and content sharing platform definition. Users are charged a subscription fee to use the service. Edward Williams is a user of Kātata. When he signed up to the service, he provided his New Zealand credit card details and billing address, which Kātata uses to charge the subscription fees. Kātata can determine that Edward Williams is a New Zealand user, because his credit card details and billing address indicate that he is normally located in New Zealand. Attribution to New Zealand users Ideally a digital services group will be able to determine the total amount of global digital services revenue connected to New Zealand users based on the actual contribution of New Zealand users (ie, the revenues received from in-scope revenues involving New Zealand users on a transaction-by-transaction basis).

Buyers and sellers of instruments are charged a commission fee for each successful transaction facilitated by Resonance. Resonance tracks the location of buyers and sellers for each transaction and has data available for the total amount of commission fees received on a country-by-country basis. For the 202X revenue year it received commission fees from transactions involving sellers and/or buyers in New Zealand of $4 million out of a global total of €800 million. Therefore, $4 million of Resonance’s global digital services revenue is connected to New Zealand users. However, because this approach may not be feasible for all businesses, or it may impose undue compliance costs, businesses can also attribute global revenue from taxable digital services to New Zealand users based on a fair and reasonable method. This could involve apportioning the global revenue from taxable digital services based on the proportion of New Zealand users to global users. Alternatively, businesses can use a different proxy to attribute to global revenue from taxable digital services to New Zealand users if this method is fair and reasonable. A benefit from this approach is that it may enable digital services groups to apply a consistent method to that used for attributing revenue to local users under foreign DSTs, thereby resulting in reduced compliance costs. Example 13 Bargain Grab is an online intermediation platform which charges users with commission fees on transactions. For the 202X revenue year it received $1 billion of global commission fees. Bargain Grab commission fees vary depending on the type and value of goods sold and it does not normally track these on a transaction-by-transaction basis. Therefore, determining the amount of global commission fee revenue paid by New Zealand users would involve applying significant resources. However, Bargain Grab identifies that of its total global users, 10% are normally located in New Zealand. Therefore, Bargain Grab can apportion $100 million of taxable digital services revenue to New Zealand users (being 10% x $1 billion of total global taxable digital services revenue).

Advertising revenue The digital services revenues that are generated from online advertising will be connected to New Zealand users when the advertising is viewed or otherwise consumed by users normally located in New Zealand. An advert will be considered to be viewed by a New Zealand user when it is presented to a New Zealand user or otherwise engaged with (eg, clicked) by a New Zealand user in a way that gives rise to revenue for the digital services group. Where there is no direct evidence of a New Zealand user viewing or consuming an advert (potentially because this is not tracked), the business should assess whether, for example, contractual evidence indicates that the advertising was in whole or part intended to be viewed by New Zealand users. Example 14 Revel provides an online search engine that generates revenue from displaying advertising banners on its engine. For the 202X revenue year, it has satisfied the threshold and is a digital services group under the Bill. For the revenue year ended 202X, it receives $5 million of revenue from displaying advertisements for businesses that operate solely in New Zealand. Revel can determine that these advertisements are intended for users normally located in New Zealand because the products advertised are not available to global users. Connected revenue from intermediation platforms Where a transaction facilitated by an intermediation platform involves a New Zealand user, all the revenues the intermediation platform receives from that transaction are deemed to be connected to New Zealand users. This reflects the fact that without a purchaser (or seller) there will be no transactions facilitated by an intermediation platform. This applies regardless of whether the New Zealand user:  purchases the good or service  sells the good or service, or  lists or advertises the good or service.

This is discussed in more detail below. Connected to New Zealand land Where taxable digital services are related to New Zealand land, the revenues from that taxable digital service will be connected to New Zealand even if the owner of the land or the user of the land is not a New Zealand user. Taxable digital services that are related to land include the lease or rental of accommodation or other buildings, for any time period, as well as services relating to the sale of land. However, they do not include services whose relation to land is indirect or remote – for example, advertising the sale of photographs of New Zealand land on an intermediation platform would not be a service in relation to New Zealand land. This means that revenues from allowing a user to rent out a property in New Zealand are attributable to New Zealand irrespective or where the owner of the property is located or who stays in the property. Example 15 CountyInn provides an online intermediation platform that facilitates users renting accommodation from other users and charges service fees to each user. Bill Smithers is normally located in Australia but owns a property in Martinborough, which he lists for rent on CountyInn’s platform. Kevin Raymond is normally located in the United States but while on holiday in New Zealand he rents Bill Smithers’ Martinborough property via the online platform provided by CountyInn. All revenue CountyInn receives from this service is connected to New Zealand land because the property rented is located in New Zealand. DST reduction for certain cross-border transactions In general, where one of the users involved in a transaction on an intermediation platform is a New Zealand user, all the taxable digital services revenue an intermediation platform receives from facilitating that transaction is deemed to be connected to New Zealand users. This applies regardless of whether the other user is normally located in New Zealand or a foreign jurisdiction.

The rule is designed to reduce the tax charged on a transaction where the other user is based in a jurisdiction that operates a similar tax to the New Zealand DST and thereby reduces the risk of double digital services taxation from the imposition of the New Zealand DST. Reasonable to assume In determining the jurisdiction where it is reasonable to assume that a foreign user is normally located, a group needs to consider all the information about that user’s location available to them and any other relevant facts or circumstances. Businesses may wish to use the same indicators for determining whether a user is normally located in New Zealand under clause 12 of the Bill A substantially similar tax It should be easily identifiable whether a foreign jurisdiction is applying a tax that is substantially similar to the New Zealand DST. The factors below are intended to help businesses determine whether a tax is substantially similar to the New Zealand DST or not:  Is the tax levied on gross revenue or net income/profit?  Is the tax levied at a low rate?  Is the tax levied on revenue generated by active user participation?  Is the tax limited to highly digitalised business activities?  Is the tax based on users located in a jurisdiction rather than payment flows? Example 16 Switcheroo is an online intermediation platform that facilitates the sales of goods between users around the globe and meets the thresholds to be a digital services group liable to pay New Zealand DST. $100 of Switcheroo’s taxable New Zealand digital services revenue results from a transaction between a New Zealand user and a foreign user.

Therefore, it is reasonable for Switcheroo to assume that the foreign user is normally located in France. It is reasonable for Switcheroo to assume the foreign user is normally located in France and the French DST (which is substantially similar to the New Zealand DST) will also apply to the transaction, this reduces the amount of New Zealand digital services revenue by $50 (being $100 x 50%). Digital services tax is a debt due to the Crown Clause 14 proposes to establish that the amount of digital services tax payable is a debt to the Crown owed by the digital services group and recoverable by the Commissioner in a court of competent jurisdiction. Joint and several liability Clause 15(2) of the Bill imposes joint and several liability on all members of a digital services group for payment of the New Zealand DST. This is to ensure that the New Zealand Government has recourse to payment of the tax if the group’s representative member does not make payment for any reason. Refunds and overpayments Clause 16 proposes that the Commissioner refund overpaid DST within a four-year time bar. Similarly, clause 17 proposes that the Commissioner refund overpaid DST within a four-year period where a person makes an overpayment as the result of an amended assessment. Tax avoidance Clause 18 proposes that a tax avoidance arrangement with the purpose or effect of defeating the intent and application of the DST is void against the Commissioner.

These include proposed amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). Specific administration rules are also required, which nevertheless generally follow existing administrative provisions. The specific features of the regime include:  All in-scope digital services groups must register with the Commissioner within 90 days of the end of the first revenue year in which the digital services group meets the global revenue threshold.  All in-scope digital services groups must file an annual DST return whether the digital services group owe a DST liability or if it has a nil return. That return will be due six months after the end of the revenue year of the group. However, a group that has not had to pay an amount of DST before would not be required to file a nil return even if they meet the global revenue threshold and thus have to register for DST.  In-scope digital services groups must pay any DST liability for the current revenue year to the Commissioner within six months of the end of the group’s DST revenue year.  Increased penalties apply for a DST representative member failing to register and to provide information to the Commissioner. Detailed analysis Registration Proposed new section 226G of the TAA provides that the ultimate parent entity of a digital services group must nominate a company that is a member of the group to be recognised as the DST representative member. The DST representative member will perform the obligations required on behalf of the digital services group. If no nomination is made, the ultimate parent entity of the group will be the DST representative member. The nominated company ceases to be the DST representative member if the company leaves the digital services group or the ultimate parent entity nominates a different company to be the DST representative member.

As part of the digital services group registration process, the DST representative member would inform Inland Revenue of the name of the DST representative member, what digital services group it represents, the registered office of the DST representative member, the start and end dates of the group’s DST revenue year, and the name and address of the ultimate parent entity of the digital services group, if the ultimate parent entity is not the DST representative member. Digital services tax return Proposed new section 33G of the TAA will require the DST representative member to file a DST return if the digital services group is liable to pay an amount of DST in the current DST revenue year. The DST representative member will also have to file a DST return for a zero or nil return of DST if the digital services group has been liable to pay an amount of DST in a previous revenue year. The return for the current DST revenue year must be provided to the Commissioner in the form and with the particulars prescribed by the Commissioner within six months of the end of the DST revenue year. Assessment of digital services tax Proposed new section 92C of the TAA will require the DST representative member who provides the return for DST for a DST revenue year to assess the amount of DST that is payable for the digital services group. This assessment is to be made on the date on which the DST return is received by Inland Revenue. We expect the DST return will be filed through digital channels. The Commissioner has an existing power in section 106 of the TAA to make default assessments in circumstances where the Commissioner is not satisfied with the contents of a return, or if a taxpayer fails to provide a return by the due date. This would also apply to the DST. If the Commissioner assesses DST payable in terms of section 106 of the TAA, the DST representative member can only dispute the assessment by providing a DST return for the DST revenue year. Time bar for amending DST returns Proposed section 108AD of the TAA prevents the Commissioner from amending the assessment for a DST revenue year if more than four years have passed following the end of Date: August 2023 48 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] the DST revenue year in which the DST return is provided. This four-year time bar does not apply in circumstances where the Commissioner considers the digital services group has knowingly or fraudulently failed to disclose to the Commissioner all material facts that are necessary for determining the amount of DST payable for the DST revenue year. Record keeping Proposed new section 22BB of the TAA will require the DST representative member of a digital services group to keep sufficient records that are readily available to be collected by the Commissioner. These records must outline the digital services group’s liability to pay DST and include records where the liability is a zero amount. The records must be in English or te reo Māori and may be kept outside New Zealand. Consistent with the general record keeping requirements in the TAA, records will need to be kept for seven years following the end of the relevant DST revenue year. Penalties Failing to apply for registration Proposed new sections 94E and 139ABB of the TAA will enable the Commissioner to impose a penalty of up to $100,000 on a DST representative member that fails to apply for the registration of a digital services group when it is liable for the DST. The DST representative member is not liable to pay the penalty if they establish in proceedings challenging the assessment that the assessment is excessive or that the digital services group is not chargeable with the penalty. The Bill proposes that the penalty is discretionary. This means the Commissioner is not required to impose the penalty in all circumstances where a person does not comply with their obligation to register. This penalty is consistent with existing penalties in the TAA that the Commissioner can impose on a discretionary basis for other taxpayers of a similar size. Failing to make a digital services tax return Proposed new section 139ABB of the TAA additionally provides that a DST representative member that fails to comply with the requirements of providing a return for the digital services group to the Commissioner will face a penalty of $500.

Shortfall penalties The DST will also be subject to shortfall penalties, including the penalty for an unacceptable tax position, contained within the TAA. Other provisions of the TAA Proposed section 91C(1)(ed) of the TAA enables the Commissioner to issue binding rulings in relation to the DST. Other provisions of the TAA will generally apply to the DST without modification, such as late payment penalties and use of money interest.
